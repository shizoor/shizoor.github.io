1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,640
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:16,120
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,220
The Self Genius Hour of Life!

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,560
Okay, okay, here it is.

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,580
Dad just said I was a mutant, but I said I was a butant.

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,340
Because I am internally...

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:39,880
Whoa.

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:50,780
I am internally mutated, but outside I am beautiful, so I am a butant.

9
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,100
A butant.

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,200
Butant.

11
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,320
A butant.

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:55,900
I'm a...

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,380
Titi!

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,540
You've convinced me.

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:57,540


16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,720
I've contributed a new vocabulary word to the Self Genius Charts.

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,160
Tell Dad.

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,920
In your book, can you do that?

19
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,480
Oh, yes.

20
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,280
I'll put it...

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,780
I'll put it...

22
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,760
I'll work it in as soon as I can.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,720
As soon as I can.

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,200
You've invented a new...

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,300
It's a new concept.

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,920
It's a beautiful new concept.

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,160
It's a butant...

28
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,820
Butantful new concept.

29
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,300
My Titi, I'm so proud of you.

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,260
Put her there, pal.

31
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,200
What a...

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,440
What a wonderful...

33
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,940
You're part of the young generation, that sick generation who must ravage and plunder for their kicks.

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,060
Scenes of such brutal honesty will be shown on this screen that we strongly recommend that impressionable young people,

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:51,540
or those people of any age who are upset or affected by scalpel-slashing, arm-twisting, axe-hacking motorcycle maniacs,

36
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,740
now close their eyes for the remainder of this coming attraction.

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,900
Thank you.

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,540
And check!

39
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,360
Keep your brain clean so hard.

40
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,720
I'm the Reverend Mary Squared.

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,200
Oh, downtown.

42
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,260
Kiss me, tie me, tie me up and spur me.

43
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,340
I want to holler, but the town's too small.

44
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,860
Oh, my God!

45
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,320
And I am, of course, a good friend, Reverend Ivan Skag.

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,120
Ivan Skag me!

47
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,940
And we have many special guest preachers here tonight.

48
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
Preachers Square.

49
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,020
Indeed.

50
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,160
Sister Susie the Floozy from Atlanta is here.

51
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,940
Boys!

52
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,220
Oh, my God!

53
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,520
Oh, my God!

54
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:47,860
Boom!

55
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,860
You know, this is a different quality of preacher than you're used to seeing on St. Bob's Hill.

56
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,340
Oh, yes, it is.

57
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,880
Slaggers.

58
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,560
Hopefully by the end of this evening, we will have worked up.

59
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,200
Even you people will be feeling mega slaggers of guilt.

60
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,920
Bob Dobbs is coming New Year's Eve, and he's bringing the wire.

61
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,680
It is useless to resist.

62
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,860
The Church of the Subgenius and Club No present the first Dallas.

63
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,700
Subgenius the Bible, December 31st, Thursday night.

64
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,520
Thought you tried everything?

65
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,780
Well, we have!

66
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,120
And now we're going to make you do it too!

67
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,280
This may be the most important decision of your life.

68
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,620
Man, this must be a great, you know, this must be the one true religion.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,340
It is the one true religion.

70
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,240
You know, just look.

71
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,900
I mean, here we are, frappy whiskey babes.

72
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,720
What more could we want?

73
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,460
What more could we want?

74
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,180
Our religion.

75
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:56,940
Money.

76
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,620
Money.

77
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,180
Yeah, money.

78
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,480
Money.

79
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,420
What about the money?

80
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,520
Well, yeah, I got a question.

81
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,800
And yeah, I wanna know.

82
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,720
Yeah, I got a question.

83
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,260
Because I just saw this show.

84
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,200
And which came first?

85
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,060
Religion or money?

86
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,360
I said, which came first?

87
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,220
Religion or money?

88
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,340
Yeah, religion or you?

89
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,660
Who?

90
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,840
I wanna know

91
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,580
Yeah, I got a question

92
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,220
You think I lied just on this show

93
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,040
Which came first, religion or money?

94
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,380
I said, which came first, religion or money?

95
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,600
Money

96
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,740
This is what I said

97
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,080
In your stable

98
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,160
This is all I got

99
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,320
From all the people

100
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,160
You paid the cash

101
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,240
It's a gamble

102
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,280
On your eBay

103
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,580
We're gonna pay for the loan

104
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,640
Yeah, I got a question

105
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:54,640


106
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,560
Yeah, I wanna know

107
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,200
Yeah, I got a question

108
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,860
You think I lied just on this show

109
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,720
Which came first, religion or money?

110
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,900
I said, which came first, religion or money?

111
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,580
We're in the action

112
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,040
For our money

113
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,620
We're in the action

114
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,960
For our money

115
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,640
Which came first

116
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,400
I did come first

117
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,740
What's in the money?

118
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:27,740
Money

119
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,540
Well, hello, and welcome to church

120
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,660
and with the Church of the Subgenius

121
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,180
you can have religion and you can have money too.

122
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,200
Because time plus money equals slack.

123
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,620
And that's what we're here for.

124
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,580
We're here to give you a little radio scent heaven.

125
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,540
And most religions promise to deliver you from evil.

126
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,880
But only, only the Church of the Subgenius can promise

127
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,620
not only to deliver that evil directly to your door,

128
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,240
but if it isn't there in 30 minutes, the evil is free.

129
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,320
Now that's a church.

130
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,160
You know, I've been trying to tell you that only people will give money

131
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,120
only if they hate.

132
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,800
And we just don't have enough hate in our religion.

133
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,140
It's like those Christians, man, they hate everybody

134
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,980
and they send them millions of dollars.

135
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,860
Those Ayatollahs, they get bankrolled by, you know.

136
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,400
It's like you've got to hate.

137
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,300
You've got to find an enemy.

138
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,480
Certainly we have all normal people.

139
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,980
But that's what we're trying to get the damn money out of, Doug.

140
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,340
Well, no, we don't really.

141
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,720
Because the Subgeniuses never have decent jobs.

142
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,880
Subgeniuses never have any large amounts of money.

143
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,440
And if they do, they don't know they're Subgeniuses.

144
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,120
They're guys like Howard Hughes, you know, or Jimmy Hoffa.

145
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,020
Yeah, they haven't been turned on to it.

146
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,180
That's the problem, you see.

147
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,300
Maybe we should make this church, you know,

148
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,160
like the anti-Satanic and demonic force church

149
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,400
and we could get all that money that police officers are getting

150
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,180
to go around and elect your school boards

151
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,060
about how to recognize Satanic cults in their neighborhoods.

152
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,400
Mysterio can pay off for you.

153
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,320
Yeah.

154
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,360
Witch baiting.

155
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:24,720
Yeah.

156
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,460
Yeah.

157
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,340
That's a great idea.

158
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,700
Let's get into witch baiting now.

159
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,140
Have you liked my new baiting suit, boy?

160
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,860
A lady just got out of the room, damn it!

161
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,460
I heard Susie the Flazy from here in Atlanta.

162
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,180
Band of men, can you do a stripper beat?

163
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,120
Can you do a striketta ball?

164
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,860
Who?

165
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,760
Shut up!

166
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,360
You!

167
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,020
Jesus!

168
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,900
Woo!

169
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,320


170
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,760
Boy, I'm sweating like a whore at church, baby.

171
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,520
And this is the church to be in.

172
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:11,840
Woo!

173
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,140
I'd like to thank the sweet, sweet guy we were not going to stay.

174
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,100
Miners, please.

175
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,200
Our heroes split four ways

176
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,180
But there's one thing this church is guilty of

177
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,500
And that's cats and fags and chicks

178
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,320
Like Connie

179
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,840
Connie Donald

180
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,540
Connie Donald

181
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,420
And in tunnels, ex-ceramic gardens

182
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:01,700
A wet spill on Isle 5

183
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,300
It took Connie to tell me I didn't have a scratch

184
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,740
I thought I did

185
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,140
I did it good

186
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,120
I was such a good girl

187
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,660
I hated the police

188
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,680
And I spent all my money on buying products

189
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,400
But despite my most efforts

190
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,960
Couldn't get a scratch

191
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,120
And I kept the track

192
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,160
I kept the track

193
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,000
Until Connie

194
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Came in and won my life

195
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,320
She said, Salute

196
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,980
The only sin in this church

197
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,400
Is the sin of slacklessness

198
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,460
And I said, buddy, insurance, Sam.

199
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,680
And Connie took me to Apple.

200
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,320
And she said, boo.

201
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,760
Boo.

202
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,380
That's so perfect.

203
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,920
Do it again.

204
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,680
Keep rolling.

205
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,440
And now, somewhere in Washington, D.C.

206
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,780
Oh, man.

207
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,940
Time's running out.

208
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,760
Won't be long now.

209
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,000
What a world.

210
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,840
What a world order.

211
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,120
Four years, she's the president of the number one superpower in the world.

212
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,900
And you can sure collect a lot of money.

213
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,860
A lot of homage.

214
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,300
A lot of booty.

215
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,860
Look at all this garbage.

216
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,140
Crates and crates of Desert Shield and Desert Storm paraphernalia.

217
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,260
Just look at it all.

218
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,440
Desert Storm dishes.

219
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,840
Cigarette lighters over there.

220
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,860
Desert Storm blankets and action figures and pillowcases over there.

221
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,320
All over there.

222
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,840
Matchbooks.

223
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,020
Desert Shield T-shirts.

224
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,100
Sanitary napkins.

225
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,740
Comic books.

226
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,660
Pilots.

227
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,180
Treatments.

228
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,680
Desert Shield the movie.

229
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,940
The whole damn nine enchiladas.

230
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,700
I was sure popular.

231
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,640
That thing sure was popular.

232
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,460
The number one president in the last 50 years.

233
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,360
But mustn't dwell.

234
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,420
Mustn't dwell.

235
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,940
Jumping baby Muhammad.

236
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,940
Look at this, will ya?

237
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Giant iron curtain that Mikhail left here.

238
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,000
Boy, I sure had big plans to put it up here in America.

239
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,740
Big plans.

240
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,360
Ungrateful electoral wouldn't let me do it.

241
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,740
Not gonna go there.

242
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,940
Let's not dwell.

243
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,280
Let's not be grim, brothers.

244
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,880
Let's not dwell.

245
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,580
Let's not point bangers.

246
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,800
And what do we have here?

247
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,020
My, my.

248
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,040
Look at those frequent flyer miles for all those trips to Tehran in 1980.

249
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,280
Those were the days before, you know, the 400-day hostage crisis deal.

250
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,320
Excitement.

251
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,500
Meeting all the M.A.M.s and mullahs.

252
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,240
TV sure helped us with that one, boy oh boy.

253
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,040
Better send Dan Rather a belated Christmas card.

254
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,040
Me and Barbie could use the mile.

255
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,080
Got a funny feeling I might be going incognito again.

256
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,020
Heh heh.

257
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,260
Betcha I get a pretty penny for this.

258
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,960
Autographed picture of Jesus in a three-piece suit.

259
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,220
Shaking hands with Pat Robertson.

260
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,020
Heh, my sentiments exactly.

261
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,820
I always knew he was a Republican at heart.

262
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Old J.C. for a genuine conservative.

263
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,380
A real conservative.

264
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,160
And what am I gonna do with all this stuff?

265
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,340
I know.

266
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,880
I'll have a White House rummage sale.

267
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,520
Rummage sale.

268
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,480
Featuring a...

269
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
Whoa! Hold everything.

270
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,160
What do we here?

271
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,000
My name.

272
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,340
My notes.

273
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,020
My notes.

274
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,380
From the Iran-Contra fiasco.

275
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,240
But no, Walsh loved to get his mitts on these.

276
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,780
He got a better chance of seeing Ronnie Reagan.

277
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,220
Heh.

278
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,200
Good thing I got my J. Edgar Hoover vacuum cleaner.

279
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,140
The best covert vacuum cleaner in the world.

280
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,840
Suck up all this incriminating and covert itineraries and a Jaffee.

281
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:34,040
J. Edgar Hoover sure built an impressive governmental machine to suck the truth out of anything and go unreputated.

282
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,340
Leaves everything righteously clean.

283
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,220
Squeaky clean.

284
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,520
A kinder, gentler clean.

285
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,120
Well, now I've taken care of some loose ends.

286
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,000
Might as well open up shop here.

287
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,120
Over there.

288
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,600
You, sir.

289
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,300
Hello, sir.

290
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,180
Right over there.

291
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,360
Step right up.

292
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Can I interest you in this purple crucifix from the Mexican Free Trade Delegation?

293
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,140
Quarter.

294
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:55,840
Quarter.

295
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,300
Don't be shy, man.

296
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,120
Come on, look around.

297
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,460
There's plenty of stuff here.

298
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,380
I've got this.

299
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,980
I've got a Melville Marcus's shoes.

300
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,020
I've got a Ronnie Reagan.

301
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,020


302
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,020


303
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,920
I've got a Reagan's toupee.

304
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,280
And of course, we're going to bring in the new year.

305
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,400
1993.

306
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:20,880
The 90s are going to make the 60s look like the 50s.

307
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:20,980
Ho!

308
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,920
Praise Pope Fife, Wilson.

309
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And of course, you know, they call it, the conspiracy calls it 1993.

310
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:40,000
We in the Church of the Subgenius, we're about to inaugurate the new year of 5BX.

311
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:48,260
5 years before I say you better start counting down now and send me your money.

312
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,660
It's the most important five years.

313
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,640
It's the last five years of human reality as you know it.

314
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:54,780
That's right.

315
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,040
It's the 90s.

316
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,120
You take or get out.

317
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,980
And we're not going to be on the same page.

318
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:02,980


319
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:02,980


320
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:02,980


321
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:02,980


322
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,360
We're not going to miss the human reality being totally destroyed.

323
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:06,860
No, we won't.

324
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,240
Not much.

325
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,080
Not one single bit.

326
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,980
We might have little nostalgic twinges.

327
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,600
I like those for the day.

328
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,940
Oh gosh, I really miss counting that.

329
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,700
Jehovah One Productions takes you on the strangest journey you'll ever encounter.

330
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,340
A place that's beyond what any other studio has ever dared show you.

331
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,840
More frightening than The Exorcist.

332
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,180
More fantastic than Star Wars.

333
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,540
More absurd than Monty Python.

334
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,560
The real world is here.

335
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,980
See incomprehensible beings with unquenchable appetites for the inhuman.

336
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,560
I'm going to get me one of them Z cars.

337
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,760
And what is the hideous secret of the thing in the mirror?

338
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,880
More dead than the Frankenstein monster.

339
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,660
More evil than Dracula.

340
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,900
More destructive than Godzilla.

341
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,220
In the real world, the monster is you.

342
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,700
The real world is a comedy.

343
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,700
It was reported that the US bombed Libya today.

344
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:11,840
A nightmare.

345
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,400
I can't find my keys!

346
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,500
A mystery.

347
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,300
I'm trying to find myself.

348
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,400
See undead beings involved in nightmarish occult rituals.

349
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,400
What you sign, honey?

350
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,840
Can I buy you a drink?

351
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,540
Gasp at the bizarre fascination that is found in spectacles of violence.

352
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,160
I just know the Packers are going all the way this year.

353
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,420
Tremble at the strange worship of a human sacrifice cult.

354
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,940
Mr. Homosexual Communist School Teacher, sir.

355
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,220
Mr. Do you hear me, Mr. Phil Donahue?

356
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,440
The answers are all found in this book.

357
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,360
The monster is you.

358
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,440
And who can imagine what kind of loathsome entity dwells beneath the mask of...

359
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,860
The Thing in the Mirror.

360
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,480
The monster is you.

361
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,760
Now we're only doing this for your own good.

362
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,840
You know, Reagan makes you proud to be an American.

363
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,940
Hey, you can bet your ass there's no blacks in this town.

364
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,760
More casualties were reported in Nicaragua today.

365
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,200
Escape from your escapism.

366
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,180
See the real world for the first time.

367
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,260
If you dare.

368
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,220
Can't we wait till it comes on cable?

369
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,180
The real world is available in reel-around with omniphonic sound.

370
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,320
Coming soon to a theater near...

371
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,260
Oh my God, no! It's already here!

372
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,140
Radar. Required viewing for everyone, all ages.

373
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,600
Some portions might be offensive to anyone.

374
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,860
Parental discretion is advised.

375
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,940
This is very true.

376
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,160
We have the Pink Lincolns queued up.

377
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,880
Ready to go?

378
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,280
Yes.

379
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,820
I got my tie on.

380
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,260
Ready?

381
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,080
Yeah, which is kind of a corporate anthem.

382
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,000
What it is to be pink.

383
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,820
So we can experience the pinkness and not have to taint ourselves with actually working.

384
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,700
I'm a cog in a wheel in a lubricated world and I wanna marry an office girl.

385
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,940
I've got my tie on.

386
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,400
I set my watch, I set my goals when I get old.

387
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,320
I wanna be fat.

388
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,680
I've got my tie on.

389
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,460
It's a string around my finger, it's a noose around my neck.

390
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,780
I'll go to grass, pick laces, prove I'm not a derelict.

391
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,760
I've got my tie on so I'll be sure to hold my head up high.

392
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,740
I can't forget why I got out of bed even when the morning paper's red.

393
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,860
I've got my tie on.

394
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
I'm riding across the tile floor.

395
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,040
I've got my name on the office door.

396
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,520
I've got my tie on.

397
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,000
It's a string around my finger, it's a noose around my neck.

398
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,200
I'll go to grass, pick laces, prove I'm not an idiot.

399
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,040
I've got my tie on so I'll be sure to hold my head up high.

400
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,580
I've got my tie on.

401
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,640
It's a string around my finger, it's a noose around my neck.

402
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


403
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,640


404
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,760
I've found a penthouse with a view I know I've got a job to do.

405
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,980
I've got my tie on.

406
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,400
I've picked my side.

407
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,140
I've made my choice, I've gotta have a damn good choice.

408
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,480
I've got my tie on.

409
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,020
It's a string around my finger, it's a noose around my neck.

410
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,980
I'll go to grass, pick laces, prove I'm not a derelict.

411
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,400
I'll prove I'm not a derelict.

412
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,060
I've got my time, so I'll be sure to

413
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,300
drink my summer pie!

414
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,820
That was the Pink Lincolns, a band

415
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,260
from Tampa, Florida, which, coincidentally,

416
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,420
that was my brother singing.

417
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,600
So, uh, subgenius

418
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,360
blood runs in my family.

419
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,680
Actually, although

420
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,840
it's the Pink Lincolns, there's nothing

421
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,300
pink about these boys.

422
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,240
Bob Bob. Bob Bob.

423
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,280
Bob Bob. Bob Bob.

424
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,520
Bob Bob.

425
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,460
More? More

426
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:33,960
sex!

427
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,640
It's always

428
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,920
better than not enough!

429
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,940
And we're not talking about

430
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,100
your plain old human

431
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,620
penis. Oh, oh!

432
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,920
Au contraire! We're talking

433
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,840
about your get-shy-ly

434
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,560
miss-miley-squeeze-me

435
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,700
telly hurts

436
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,400
kind of fun!

437
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,520
Sex hurts!

438
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,540
Sex hurts!

439
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,120
Sex hurts!

440
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,980
Sex hurts!

441
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,500
Sex hurts!

442
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,040
Sex hurts!

443
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,100
I'm telling you, it feels so good!

444
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,580
It hurts!

445
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,900
And in order to do that,

446
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,960
of course, um,

447
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,920
well, I think we should probably do it before the New Year

448
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,020
because we should make sure everybody in this

449
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,300
room has undergone it.

450
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,960
You can't get away from it. Has undergone it.

451
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,000
You're in now. We're locking the doors.

452
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,880
The short duration

453
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,080
marriage.

454
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,740
So, Jesus Christ,

455
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,480
the most touching

456
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,660
and beautiful ceremony in the church,

457
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,620
that's through the launching of the day we have our own

458
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,400
and the short duration divorce.

459
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,840
Yes, that's important.

460
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,840
That's important. This is something new.

461
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,020
Just last week on the,

462
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,920
at the radio station, we got

463
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,760
a call from a couple,

464
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,740
a subgenius couple from Fort Worth,

465
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,860
I believe. That's right. If you're married,

466
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,780
now in the audience, don't

467
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,780
despair because on the

468
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,860
contrary, you can get a

469
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,800
short duration divorce and marry

470
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,860
anybody else in this room that

471
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,460
you want to. That's right.

472
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,060
This couple called up and said, look,

473
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,720
we have, we're looking

474
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,940
forward to that short duration marriage ceremony

475
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,720
where we're going to be married

476
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,580
to anybody we want to and

477
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,940
do whatever we want for 24 hours.

478
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,760
But, I said, we're already married

479
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,680
and we don't think it would be right, you know, to

480
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,940
go fornicating with somebody else until

481
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,880
we've had a 24 hour

482
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,800
divorce, too. So that's a

483
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,400
new thing. We'll have to wing it.

484
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,620
None of us are lawyers yet, so.

485
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,040
Help us, Steve!

486
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,340
Praise Bob!

487
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Praise Bob!

488
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,960
He may be dumb, but God, he's cute.

489
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,180
Praise Bob!

490
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,200
Praise Bob!

491
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,000
Bob. Bob. Bob.

492
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,500
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

493
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,820
I want to witness for Bob.

494
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,960
Bob. Bob. Bob.

495
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,000
Clean me out. Thanks to Bob.

496
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,800
I've reached a

497
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,400
zen state. I have nothing.

498
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,960
Thanks to Bob.

499
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,360
Thanks to Bob.

500
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,880
Anyone else?

501
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,740
I'm sure you all know

502
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,300
our next speaker for Bob.

503
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,000
He's been with

504
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,580
us for a real long

505
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,560
time.

506
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,580
It's the Reverend

507
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,660
Dr. Saint

508
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,460
God Living

509
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,600
Deity, Reverend Sterling

510
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,920
Dunst, who little rocks in his

511
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,800
dicks.

512
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,200
Praise Bob!

513
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,100
Woo!

514
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,840
Yeah!

515
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,320
Yeah!

516
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:41,900
Yeah!

517
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,580
We've got about five minutes

518
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,000
until 1993

519
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,700
when Reverend Stang

520
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,380
and Sister Mary

521
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,260
Damn Squirrel caught

522
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,060
a gun.

523
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,940
We'll be back up here for a demonstration

524
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,040
of time control. But first I've got to

525
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,480
I'd like to take a little survey tonight.

526
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,940
Here in the belly of the beast

527
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,900
in Babylon, I'd like to find out

528
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,100
how many real drug addicts

529
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,400
we have in the audience tonight.

530
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,800
Just as I suspected!

531
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,620
Well Bob can help you

532
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,320
kick those cheap conspiracy

533
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,280
street drugs and get you

534
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,180
higher quicker!

535
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,180
How'd you like to smoke a little of what's in

536
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,500
Bob's pipe, huh?

537
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,200
Well being an ordained minister

538
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,800
in the Church of the Subgenius enables

539
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,840
you to be on the waiting list

540
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,100
to receive vast shipments

541
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,160
of the legal immortality

542
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,580
herb, Habifroxipulops

543
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,780
or FROP

544
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,120
for short, which grows only

545
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,300
by moonlight on the graves

546
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,740
and droppings of

547
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,640
dead Tibetan holy men

548
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,740
and full-blooded yetis.

549
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,120
Now we're gonna bring

550
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,980
in the new year tonight, and we're gonna

551
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,860
tell you what you're gonna be next year.

552
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,380
We're gonna tell you how to act, we're gonna tell you how to FROP

553
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,000
we're gonna tell you how to get SLACK

554
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,680
because the first rule

555
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,740
of the Church of the Subgenius is

556
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,160
the Subgenius must have

557
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,300
SLACK! What must he have?

558
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,960
What must he have?

559
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,420
What must he have?

560
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,000
He must have SLACK!

561
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,500
The night get killed or praise Bob!

562
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,960
Come on, help me somebody!

563
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,280
Alright, another rule of the Church of the Subgenius

564
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,040
I want you to drill into every one of your

565
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,220
heads is

566
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,080
anybody you see driving a

567
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,240
Porsche doesn't deserve it!

568
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,500
You deserve it, and you deserve it

569
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,780
and you deserve it, and I deserve it

570
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,980
They don't deserve it!

571
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,340
Do they deserve it? Say no!

572
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,860
Do they deserve it? Say no!

573
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,240
Do you deserve it?

574
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,940
Say yes! Yes!

575
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,600
Get killed or praise Bob!

576
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,040
Help me somebody!

577
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,760
Help me somebody!

578
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,720
Help me somebody!

579
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,780
Now children,

580
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,260
many people have asked me

581
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,400
Reverend Sterno

582
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,980
how did you become a

583
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,860
subgenius?

584
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,260
How did you find Bob?

585
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,220
Well I'd like to tell you

586
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,200
about that tonight children

587
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,880
and a happy tale it is in the telling too

588
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,820
for it was in the winter of

589
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,640
1965

590
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,080
Ironically I was walking down

591
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,440
the streets of Dallas, Texas

592
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,680
Children I was depressed

593
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,680
Say oh no!

594
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,120
Children I was dejected!

595
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,040
Say my God!

596
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,180
Children I had not

597
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,320
The accent wound of a

598
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,980
recently assassinated U.S.

599
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,040
President in weeks!

600
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,140
I was down to my last two cc's

601
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,220
of bat sperm antidote

602
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,940
pudding! Say oh no

603
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,660
Sterno!

604
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,160
Children I had

605
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,820
not launched the bleeding head of

606
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,500
Arnold Palmer in six months!

607
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,220
Oh God Sterno!

608
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,220
Sterno!

609
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,940
Children

610
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,400
I was at the end of my rope

611
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,140
It came to me that the only

612
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,340
solution to my problems

613
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,500
was suicide

614
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,480
and I didn't even have the money

615
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,280
for a Saturday night special!

616
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,340
I was walking to the pawn shop

617
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,140
praying to Bob

618
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,420
that I had enough money

619
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,760
to buy a Wednesday

620
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,620
or a Thursday night special

621
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,520
to blow my brains out!

622
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,080
When I happened to glance down

623
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,540
into a mud puddle children

624
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,700
and there in that mud puddle

625
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,420
covered with mud

626
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,980
was a pamphlet

627
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,220
and their children

628
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,220
emblazoned on the cover of that pamphlet

629
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,280
was Bob's mighty face

630
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,520
beaming up at me!

631
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,980
His enigmatic smile seeming to say

632
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,600
Here model is this cheesy ad

633
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,400
in 1953

634
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,820
I know exactly how that smile will look

635
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,880
when Reverend Sterno needs it in 1965

636
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,100
Well I picked up that pamphlet

637
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,500
children and I read it

638
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,320
and what it said in essence was

639
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,120
Get in on the ground floor

640
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,600
of a lucrative new cult now

641
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,640
while raped for love

642
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,100
Well I was one of the few people

643
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,860
to do that children

644
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,360
and now there are thousands

645
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,900
nay millions of zombie eyed

646
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,400
panhandling teenage followers

647
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,080
standing on street corners

648
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,380
and cities the world over

649
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,320
selling that self saying pamphlet

650
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,460
and sending me the money

651
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,840
which affords me considerable slack

652
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,880
as you might have guessed

653
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,860
So if you are what they call

654
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,560
different

655
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,040
if you think we're entering

656
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,780
a new dark ages

657
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,440
entering ages

658
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,680
if you view the entire universe

659
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,400
as one vast

660
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,180
morbid cosmic joke

661
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,880
J-Live

662
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,340
if you are searching for an inherently

663
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,520
bogus religion that will condone

664
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,860
superior degeneracy

665
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,080
and tell you that you are above

666
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,040
everyone else

667
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,060
and most important of all children

668
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,580
if you can help us

669
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,240
with a donation

670
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,540
we would be grateful

671
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,580

00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,020
and Peter's face of pain

00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,100
Bleach the piece of the fine ass

687
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,940
Have a fuzzy big bollock

688
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,320

689
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,440

the rocket racket

692
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,780
This face outer belongs to your worship

00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,260
in the crotch of your choice toys

694
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,800

695
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,000

696
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,700
like it appears

697
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,840

698
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,000

buzz of the good

702
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,480

703
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:58,960

Thank me

706
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,580
What you've been listening to

707
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,840
recordings from the New Year's

708
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,160
Devival here in Dallas at Club No

709
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,300
with Sister Mary Squared

710
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,880
Pope Sternodocs

711
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,320
St. Janer Hyperclites

712
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,680
a lot of what I've been playing is actually

713
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,060
from Janer's new album

714
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,580
or tape actually

715
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,980
and also some stuff from

716
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,120
Reverend Susie the Floozy

717
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,600
on her local Atlanta

718
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,860
Hour of Slack show

719
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,000
on WREK in Atlanta

720
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,720
Praise WREK

721
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,760
Oh you know some

722
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,800
a couple of subgeniuses said

723
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,300
Reverend Stang

724
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,280
I don't think I'm going to make it

725
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,360
to that Club No thing

726
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,560
because you know

727
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,220
because well I just know

728
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,160
there's going to be a bunch of

729
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,160


730
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,960
those PIBs there

731
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,840
people in black

732
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,640
and I'm too cool to

733
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,820
be seen in a place where there's people

734
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,000
trying to be too cool

735
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,640
and let me tell you something

736
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,160
I'm a little bit tired sometimes

737
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,540
of subgeniuses saying

738
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,800
oh that person's not weird enough

739
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,160
because they don't look weird like me

740
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,060
they probably have a

741
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,400
job or something

742
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,540
I'm just thinking

743
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,580
because those are the people

744
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,900
those backsliders

745
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,020
are the ones that don't spend any money on us

746
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,480
the damn fashionable looking

747
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,380
bobbies are the ones that spend money

748
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,900
we've just about had it with the

749
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,420
true subgeniuses

750
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,700
we like the bobbies better

751
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,640
let's spend more money

752
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,640
I don't know who you are

753
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,060
or where you come from

754
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,540
I only know one damn thing

755
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,660
and that's that it's street law

756
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,020
now I don't

757
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,160
I don't know how you do it

758
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,140
I only know how you do things out there

759
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,580
in California

760
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,920
or LA

761
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,780
or whatever

762
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,600
continent you come from

763
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,160
but I want you to see

764
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,240
this damn line I'm drawing on the ground

765
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,120
call it McCannie line

766
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,540
step over a McCannie line

767
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,480
you're in McCannie

768
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,260
I ain't talking no P. Lasky county

769
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,740
you're in Muck county

770
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,260
step over this line

771
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,820
now you

772
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,980
you step over this line

773
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,160
I'm gonna shoot your ass

774
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,300
I'm gonna shoot your dead

775
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,540
you fall on that sidewalk

776
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,120
I'm gonna give you a ticket for obstructing traffic

777
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,380
you can't pay that ticket within 30 days

778
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,200
you're gonna go to jail

779
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,480
jail ain't no place you can be

780
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,020
especially if you're a dead boy

781
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,320
now I don't know how you do things out there

782
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:45,840
in California

783
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,180
or LA

784
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,960
or San Francisco

785
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,180
or whatever country

786
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,160
you come from

787
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:53,640
but

788
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,640
but down here in America

789
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,340
what we like to call Arkansas

790
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,520
we figure Arkansas ends in

791
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,700
Kinsaw

792
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,680
and we can't

793
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,320
we can saw

794
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,720
we will saw

795
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,800
and we do saw

796
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,520
and I just want you to understand that boy

797
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,760
in McCannie we've got three different kinds of

798
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,060
offenses

799
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,200
we've got

800
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,160
we've got

801
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:23,160


802
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:23,780
misdemeanor

803
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,560
we've got felony

804
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,840
and we've got a sodomy

805
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,180
you're busted for felony you can serve time in the federal penitentiary

806
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,420
you're busted for

807
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,560
sodomy

808
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,360
you can get your ass sawed

809
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,300
now you get busted for sodomy in someone else's precinct

810
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,200
they might just saw you a little bit

811
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:42,800
you get

812
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,780
you get busted for sodomy over here in my precinct

813
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,000
I'm gonna cut your damn ass in half

814
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,260
I'm gonna saw you boy

815
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,980
I don't want you to know that

816
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,160
I don't want you to know that

817
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,880
I just want you to understand that

818
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,460
now I don't know

819
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,940
I don't know that much about

820
00:34:59,220 --> 00:34:59,860
about

821
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,800
synthesizing usable

822
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,420
sugars from

823
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,400
the food I consume

824
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,300
I only know one thing that's Dallas street law

825
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,740
I don't know that much about

826
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,880
converting

827
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,820
oxygen to

828
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,060
workable food substance

829
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,300
I only know one damn thing

830
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,700
that's Dallas street law

831
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,160
I don't know much about hemoglobin

832
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:23,600
counts

833
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,580
I don't know that much about

834
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,800
maintaining a physical

835
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,940
existence

836
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,180
in a three dimensional reality

837
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:33,660
I

838
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,000
I

839
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,080
I'm gonna get you for that boy

840
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,320
that's all Bob cares about

841
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:41,600
but I

842
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,040
this week

843
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,100
the Dallas observer

844
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,600
see here's the thing

845
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,300
this is the damn problem with this church

846
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:53,100
I have to spend so much time doing the PR for a show like this

847
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,220
that I never get to come up with an original sermon

848
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,060
but

849
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,200
fortunately

850
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,700
there's always a huge supply of hate

851
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,280
and hate of course

852
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,120
is what keeps this church going

853
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,340
it's actually hate

854
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:07,580
hate

855
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,180
I don't feel that hate

856
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,380
hate is actually

857
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,880
hate is actually what keeps all religions going

858
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,900
and we're

859
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,660
we're a secret

860
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,040
how come

861
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,320
how come the Christians and the Muslims

862
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,700
hate at least as much as we do

863
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,520
look how much more money they're making

864
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,940
so we gotta crank up

865
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,520
some world class hate

866
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,700
so

867
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,140
I

868
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,880
I don't think that

869
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,660
now here's something hate worthy

870
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,040
this is slightly hate worthy

871
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,720
can I have a little more light

872
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,720
damn you're good okay

873
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,140
now

874
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,260
the Dallas Observer had this

875
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,300
they gave us a blurb you know

876
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,780
like a little bit of PR but it had a

877
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,180
smarmy snide

878
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,780
sort of blurb

879
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,240
this blurb will be nailed to their

880
00:36:59,240 --> 00:36:59,760
back

881
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,040
in fact

882
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,260
this blurb will be nailed to their

883
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,020
back in hell and every time they try to

884
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,140
pull it out it'll just be put back in with

885
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,100
a bigger nail

886
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,480
but they said here

887
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,360
now this is the way

888
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:16,740
our

889
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,900
local entertainment paper

890
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,760
describes what's happening here tonight

891
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,380
folks

892
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,940
folks who dig

893
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,640
satirical overkill

894
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,840
they got the overkill part right

895
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,900
satirical overkill

896
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,800
satirical overkill

897
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:36,800


898
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,800
satirical overkill

899
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,660
will get their

900
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,740
will get their

901
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,460
that's kind of snide

902
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,620
they will get their fill for the whole year

903
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,060
as if too much is not better than not enough

904
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,920
with

905
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,780
yet another

906
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,520
church of the subgenius event

907
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,040
I know there's just been

908
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,640
way too many subgenius events

909
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,980
in Dallas I'm sorry

910
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,540
we won't do it again

911
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,820
this first

912
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,980
the first annual random rave

913
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,880
subgenius devial actually we've done

914
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,320
three of these in Cleveland

915
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,040
is yet another

916
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,340
membership drive event

917
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,240
for and get this

918
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,120
the clique that wants

919
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,660
to be a cult

920
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,300
to be a cult

921
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,740
to be a cult

922
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,720
the clique

923
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,440
that wants to be a cult

924
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,600
I have news for you friends

925
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,580
I have news for you friends

926
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,240
this is the only cult

927
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,980
that is trying not

928
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,860
to be a cult

929
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,400
and that's not easy

930
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,040
because I guess the

931
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,360
Dallas Observer didn't

932
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,460
I guess they uh

933
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,980
the Dallas Observer didn't read this month's

934
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,480
playboy

935
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,020
and

936
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,620
and

937
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,220
we're going to

938
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,200
go back on page

939
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,340
which were on page

940
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,020
thirteen of course it says

941
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,060
YOU waren cities

942
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,780
giving some slack

943
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,180
those of us who don't get

944
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,100
poems of us who don't get

945
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,460
family values

946
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,100
the church of the subgenius is thankfully

947
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,520
preaching the virtues of slack

948
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,600
same way

949
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,680
uh

950
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,100
they said

951
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:33,180
But after listening to various attempts at expressing the inexpressible, because slack, by definition, cannot be defined, we felt a giddiness that, when we look back on it now, prepared us for a mini-revelation.

952
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,580
The voluptuous Sister Mary Squared of the Church said,

953
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,240
The curve is mightier than the sword.

954
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,240
And suddenly, everything started making sense.

955
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,800
It's entirely different. It's entirely different.

956
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,640
But everybody, yes.

957
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,780
Now you have yourself, now you have, now you have two kinds of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

958
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,000
Let me get that scratched off of there and quit looking at it.

959
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,340
Quiet, please!

960
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,240
That real crusty, real what kind of damn?

961
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:10,820
Crispy.

962
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,540
Crispy.

963
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,240
It's really different.

964
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,060
Now you can have two kinds of Kentucky Fried Chicken to choose from.

965
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,480
My regular recipe.

966
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,300
And my new, extra crisp.

967
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,160
Crispy.

968
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,560
Crispy.

969
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,020
New, extra crispy. I thought I said that.

970
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:24,540
One second.

971
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,240
Now you have two kinds of Kentucky Fried Chicken to choose from.

972
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,120
Cut it.

973
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,040
It's entirely different.

974
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,540
It every bit as finger-lickin' good, you see.

975
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,160
No, every bit as finger-lickin' good.

976
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,480
You see, I found a way to cook chicken deep down to get that real crispy crust some folks like.

977
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,920
I better do that again, haven't I?

978
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,200
Yes.

979
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,520
Alright.

980
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,180
Cut.

981
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,740
You don't want me to sing, do you, for Christ's sake?

982
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,700
We're rolling.

983
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,620
This is the good one. Take five.

984
00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:03,800
Most folks, most folks, most folks, most folks, most folks have heard about it.

985
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,920
Alright, that's good. Good, very nice.

986
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,800
That's why folks call it finger-lickin'.

987
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,640
That's why folks call it finger-lickin'.

988
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,860
Sounds good.

989
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,120
That's why folks call it finger-lickin' good.

990
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,000
That's why folks call it.

991
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,000
That's why folks call it finger-lickin' good.

992
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,400
That's why folks call it finger-lickin' good.

993
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,460
I'm not getting anywhere with this damn thing.

994
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,180
Okay, fine.

995
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,440
Oh, now, isn't that sad?

996
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,140
I mean, he had money, but he didn't have slack, and you can tell it in his voice.

997
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,080
It's sort of pitiful.

998
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:45,920
I have a theory about what happened to Harlan Sanders' brain, and it's a good one.

999
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,700
You see, inside the brain, you've got your subgenius Yeti cortex.

1000
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,080
You've got your subgenius Yeti cortex.

1001
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:56,180
And it's hidden deep within the innermost recesses of the brain, beneath that part that

1002
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,660
scientists have mislabeled the reptile cortex.

1003
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,740
Now, I know reptiles.

1004
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,580
I've served with reptiles.

1005
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,920
And the pinks don't have what it takes to evolve up to reptiles.

1006
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,600
They're better instead to call it the pink cortex, or right now, I guess we could refer

1007
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,800
to it as the pea brain.

1008
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,640
Originally, we're born with our Yeti cortex open and free.

1009
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,340
Ready to receive Bob as our personal vibrator.

1010
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:27,960
But then, then the insidious programming of the conspiracy begins and the pea brain takes

1011
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,440
root.

1012
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:35,040
This pink cerebral crap collects around the pure, shining Yeti cortex, coating the pure,

1013
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:41,860
shining Yeti self with stinking, odious, gelatinous glop, which eventually smothers it and strangles

1014
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,860
it into abject dozing submission.

1015
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,840
But it can't entirely kill it.

1016
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,400
Oh, oh, no, no.

1017
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:48,620
No, no, no.

1018
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:13,160
I 장겁 게 무� 않아 없 esimerk이 기뭐기테엔

1019
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:18,220
16 CONTENT Mỹworth eight minutes

1020
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:18,620
sono

1021
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,200
She taught me how to get you and Jim on that island.

1022
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,660
She taught me honesty is the best policy.

1023
00:43:51,860 --> 00:44:00,020
She said guns don't kill people, girls kill people.

1024
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,800
And Connie said I was just her cat.

1025
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,980
So thanks to Connie I'm on a rampage now.

1026
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,400
I gotta go charge the conspiracy with a grand theft.

1027
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,220
We got our slack, we got our slack, we got our slack.

1028
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,480
We could use it much better than we did.

1029
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,460
Sister Susie the floozy plays the policy.

1030
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:40,580
How many times have you known some hopelessly lost conspiracy dupe?

1031
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:45,020
Someone who hasn't yet figured out how to use these newfangled opposable thumbs.

1032
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,620
They just suddenly come up with an almost enlightening,

1033
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,900
blatant idea from out of nowhere.

1034
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,440
It's that poor little yeti brain trying to break through.

1035
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,720
That usually doesn't have a chance against a pernicious pea brain crap on its own.

1036
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,380
But this creepin' crud can be defeated, yay!

1037
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,620
It can be overcome, it can be cleansed away.

1038
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:12,220
With a scrubbing action of the toilet bowl brush of Bob and Connie's sweet love.

1039
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,020
So turn your before life over to Bob.

1040
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,300
Just get down on all fours and tell him,

1041
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,140
Bob?

1042
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:18,620
Yes?

1043
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,560
My head feels like a lava lamp that's been loaded down the truckload of Portland cement.

1044
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,300
What can I do about it?

1045
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,240
And what does Bob say, dear friends?

1046
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,960
Bob says,

1047
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,940
Take that miserable life-sapping crap and blow it out your butt!

1048
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:36,760
Yeah!

1049
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,600
Excremeditate it out of your system before it kills you.

1050
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:47,480
Before you're nothing but a host body for a shambling, pathetic, nine-to-five Joe Schmo pink boy who doesn't have a damn clue.

1051
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,980
And when you've blown out your butt,

1052
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,480
when you're clean of all that pink conspiracy crud,

1053
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:59,220
the void around the Yeti cortex fills up with pure distilled essence of slack,

1054
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:04,920
and your precious brain pod simply floats along in that sublime bliss.

1055
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,760
It's like a beautiful dream, Bob.

1056
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,220
I was gonna tell you about the doctors for bobbing out in space.

1057
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,400
Seem to be a major motion picture from some genius film studios.

1058
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:25,660
Well, the doctors for bob have attained the brain of Charles Manson,

1059
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,120
which they must take to Mars.

1060
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:33,300
So they pick up their rocket and they head off in the direction of the stars.

1061
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,060
And they've got the brain, and it ain't no strain.

1062
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,480
The brain ain't old, the brain's quite young.

1063
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,320
It's the brain that belongs to Charles Manson.

1064
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:43,980
It's a...

1065
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,200
doctor's brain.

1066
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,020
Remember that cuenta?

1067
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:53,920
You don't even realize what that means.

1068
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,640
You better read it.

1069
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:54,640


1070
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,240
That brain, Seagull.

1071
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,580
I think I know what it does.

1072
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,360
Children die.

1073
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,840
It has not been hitting its Jakara and units.

1074
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:05,820
It has had a history of death and consciousness state forever.

1075
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,380
It's a triconomically VR pretendent.

1076
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,180
If this folks brain

1077
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:13,180


1078
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,240
who's gonna know.

1079
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:14,580
Here we go.

1080
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:15,200


1081
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:19,620
in the Oscar Studios, in conjunction with the Paloma Frans Studios, in conjunction with

1082
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:24,060
Hitman's Yardman Studios, in conjunction with Two-Headed Yardman Studios, in conjunction

1083
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:30,800
with Three Hooded Yardman, while Techno-Kill's Studio Show, in conjunction with Five Hooded

1084
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,520
Yardman, and the Fifth Yard Dash with Jesus Society Show.

1085
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:43,540
That demonstration was an example of the only two things that concern us tonight, children.

1086
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:49,560
The two things that we're here to do are fight the conspiracy and praise Bob!

1087
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,260
I was born on the East Coast in France.

1088
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,660
I was a member of the difficult.

1089
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:11,200
It wasn't that I couldn't put the answers of life together, it was that I wouldn't!

1090
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,520
I would beat myself in!

1091
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:17,580
I would bend the third eye, stick me with a fork, I am dumb!

1092
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,600
Twist me and turn me and tie me up and spur me, my mouth bent and twisted in ways that

1093
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,180
I couldn't possibly imagine!

1094
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:31,300
Until I met the church, and then I realized what was going on.

1095
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:41,560
I was suffering, my friends, I was suffering from astral slug possession, a hard one!

1096
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,520
Get your blades out!

1097
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:43,520


1098
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:43,520


1099
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,840
I'm waiting back over here, I want to see you work your stuff!

1100
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,020
There's no mischief in my mojo!

1101
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,860
As long as you know what to do, we can just go, go, go all night long!

1102
00:48:55,100 --> 00:49:02,340
And I discovered, gosh, Reverend Mary, Sister Mary, that's an awfully hard way to run your

1103
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:02,720
life!

1104
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:08,620
And I discovered, I discovered all kinds of things that I was doing to make my life

1105
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,440
as hard as possible.

1106
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:10,840
You know what I mean?

1107
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:11,840
You know what I mean?

1108
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:12,700
You know what I mean?

1109
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,260
You know what I mean?

1110
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:18,360
Miscommunication, another lesser known delusion, all the time!

1111
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:25,180
Beware miscommunication, because she'll make you think that you want one thing when you

1112
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,640
really want the other.

1113
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,220
She'll make you think that you want cheap conspiracy slack.

1114
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:41,260
She'll make you think that you want all that fame and all that glory and all that money.

1115
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,260
Well, honey, au contraire!

1116
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,760
It was slack that I was looking for!

1117
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,080
Slack, true slack!

1118
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:56,560
Slack that you can't find in the store, slack that you can't find in politics, slack that

1119
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:02,260
you can't find anywhere on this earth except within yourself, and you are truly grounded

1120
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,000
and self-centered.

1121
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,260
And I realized what kind of bull was going on!

1122
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,240
What kind of bull was going on!

1123
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:11,240


1124
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:11,240


1125
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:11,240


1126
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:16,360
What was going on during the end times, because believe me, my friends, it is the end times.

1127
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,620
New York was flooded.

1128
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:25,680
The Catholic Church is talking about having women priests in their organization.

1129
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,100
It's the end times, people!

1130
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:33,340
It's time to start asking some questions and getting some anger!

1131
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,780
And feed me, milk me, pet me, eat me!

1132
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,220
Eat me!

1133
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:41,220


1134
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,880
It's time to stop prohibition and start to bitch it!

1135
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:57,660
Start asking yourselves where all the bull in your life is coming from!

1136
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:01,180
Every day we're bombarded by advertisements.

1137
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,440
Every day we're bombarded by the pinks and the normals and, well, what are those people

1138
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,080
doing and I won't do that unless my neighbors do that.

1139
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,200
And gosh, what if my church isn't there?

1140
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,860
And my church doesn't expect me to donate quite as much as I did last year?

1141
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,000
I just don't know what to do with the extra money!

1142
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:20,580
And oh, my gosh, I didn't make Mrs. Jones' tea party!

1143
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,760
That's such bull!

1144
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,940
Life is such bull that way!

1145
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,980
And it's time to get rid of our bull.

1146
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,020
It's time to join the cult of the living bull!

1147
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:40,920
Where men are men and women graze in their pastures and wait until somebody milks them.

1148
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,980
Move, baby, move!

1149
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,120
Have a very dairy Christmas and a happy new year!

1150
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:51,020
We are back live with Suzy the floozy.

1151
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,800
Mmm, yeah, the reverence of Suzy the floozy.

1152
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,380
Boy, I'm on my knees for the church.

1153
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:04,480
Which is a good place to be because, uh, you know, life in the gutter, I've often said,

1154
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:08,660
it's easier living in the gutter because that way you don't get hurt rolling off the curb.

1155
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,540
And that's a nice thing.

1156
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,700
I think that's the great thing about the church is that all over, in every sort of thing you encounter during the day,

1157
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,180
can become something incredibly spiritual and devotional.

1158
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:27,800
It's not restricted to just supposedly cleared stuff by some sort of nameless, faceless hierarchy.

1159
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:34,580
And I want you to think of everything that has ever gone into you.

1160
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:38,360
Anything that ever will go into you.

1161
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,140
Anything that you've ever wanted.

1162
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,060
Anything that you've ever wanted to go into you.

1163
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,860
And I want you to take a deep breath.

1164
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,720
Are you ready? On the count of three.

1165
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,960
One, two, three.

1166
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,300
And hold it.

1167
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,420
And let it out.

1168
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,860
And I want you to take a second inhalation on the count of three.

1169
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,440
And this time, I want you to think of anything that's ever gone out of you.

1170
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,060
Anything that's ever shot out of you.

1171
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,620
Anything that's ever spewed out of you.

1172
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,700
Anything that's ever been caught in between.

1173
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,340
It's just been ripping to get out of you.

1174
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,660
And you plan to get on it sometime.

1175
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,500
But you just don't know when.

1176
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,320
Take a deep breath.

1177
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,120
And hold it.

1178
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,080
Hold it.

1179
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,060
Let it all out.

1180
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,040
Let it all out.

1181
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,280
Let it all out.

1182
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,260
Let it all out.

1183
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,100
Let it all out.

1184
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,700
Let it all out.

1185
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,180
Let it all out.

1186
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,600
Now, on the third inhalation,

1187
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,700
and this is the real important part of our meditation,

1188
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,240
our excremeditation,

1189
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:58,780
I want you all to think of anything that has ever gotten caught in between.

1190
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,880
Pieces of chicken in your teeth,

1191
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,880
your brain in your head,

1192
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,980
anything that has ever been caught in between

1193
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,180
and has been preventing you from making a difference.

1194
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:11,180


1195
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:23,880
And I want you to take a deep breath.

1196
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,440
On the count of three and hold it.

1197
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:27,760
Ready?

1198
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,600
One, two, three.

1199
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,880
Now, when I rub my hand at the top of my lungs,

1200
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,120
we're going to scream all as loud as long as we can.

1201
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,520
If you've already lost your breath,

1202
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,180
just take another deep breath.

1203
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:41,180


1204
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:41,180


1205
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:41,180


1206
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:41,180


1207
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:41,180


1208
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:41,180


1209
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:41,180


1210
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,060
Are you ready?

1211
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,760
We're going to scream until the windows break.

1212
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:46,720
One.

1213
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,560
Two.

1214
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,760
Three.

1215
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:54,520
Four.

1216
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:55,940


1217
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,200
Six.

1218
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,020
Seven.

1219
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,360
Eight.

1220
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,640
Nine.

1221
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,860
10.

1222
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,160
11.

1223
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:11,180
12.

1224
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,320
Praise Bob and Al Coddy!

1225
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:27,340
Now, there are some questions that we've got going on here tonight.

1226
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:33,860
There are some questions and there's some anger and some sacred hate boiling in the audience tonight.

1227
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:52,380
1992, they said, was the year of the woe man, but oh, all contraire, 1993 is what's going to get a lady like me off, if you know what I mean.

1228
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:02,640
Current 93, and if you all listen to the beat dicking and the witchy deities and their wisdom,

1229
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:03,840
you'll find out that 1993 is the year of the woe man.

1230
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:03,840


1231
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,740
1993 is a very important year.

1232
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:11,620
Alistair Crowley, a very weird, weird alien.

1233
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,200
Praise Alistair Crowley.

1234
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:24,180
The Book of the Law, 31, 31, 31, which if you add it all up,

1235
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:30,480
if you take 31 and 31 and 31, which is the number of those three books, you get 93,

1236
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,420
which, which,

1237
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:38,660
which sums up the Book of the Law, which is do what thou wilt,

1238
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,060
shall be the whole of the law.

1239
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,980
Do what thou wilt.

1240
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:57,320
And the whore of Babylon, and I could babble on and on about this,

1241
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,040
embodies the current 93.

1242
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,220
And Connie is Babylon.

1243
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:15,880
So 1993 is going to be the year of the woe man, or woe tan, or however you have it,

1244
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,320
but goodness gracious me, oh my woe man.

1245
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,940
We've got a job to do, sure.

1246
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:25,200
Okay, so we think we've got it going.

1247
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,160
We think we've got it going.

1248
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,620
We got a Democrat in the Oval Office.

1249
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,020
Yeah, he got in.

1250
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:33,840
We got in.

1251
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,900
We knew he would beat Bush.

1252
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,520
Sure.

1253
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,720
We collectively licked Bush in 92.

1254
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:50,740
But will he stay hard enough to do the job that's needed?

1255
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:56,460
Only Hillary knows, and Jennifer Flowers,

1256
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,580
and Jennifer Flowers,

1257
00:57:58,860 --> 00:57:59,700
and Jennifer Flowers,

1258
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,840
and Jennifer Flowers,

1259
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,740
and Jennifer Flowers,

1260
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,260
but Connie knows,

1261
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,320
but Connie knows,

1262
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:06,860
but Connie knows,

1263
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:06,860


1264
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:06,860


1265
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:06,860


1266
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,080
that Bob is capable of doing the job.

1267
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,920
And anyway you push and shove it,

1268
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,560
if you let them fud it and blow real hard,

1269
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,920
and again and again and again,

1270
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,680
she'll just keep on sucking.

1271
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,360
She'll start doing it in all ways, shapes and kinds,

1272
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,000
because now that we've got a Democrat in the office,

1273
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,840
it's starting to think on her own terms,

1274
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,720
because now she's a little bit more liberal,

1275
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:32,560
and she's a little bit more pink on our terms.

1276
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:32,920
Yeah.

1277
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:33,660
Yeah.

1278
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,600
She may be pink, but well, he's not normal.

1279
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,380
But we gotta start pushing it more.

1280
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,620
We gotta start getting more army,

1281
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:42,680
because Bob is coming in 96.

1282
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:47,960
Bob is coming in 96, and we gotta get ready for him.

1283
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,400
Only a pink boy.

1284
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,040
Connie is coming with a nine iron,

1285
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,460
and the ball she aiming with ain't for playing golf,

1286
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,880
if you know what I mean.

1287
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,540
It's time to end the bar, America.

1288
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:03,640


1289
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,320
Because happy up and have a good time.

1290
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,420
Let's face it, we're an ugly nation.

1291
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,280
We're an ugly society.

1292
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,640
We pick our notes.

1293
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,820
We power flatulate to the gods.

1294
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,200
We step on old women and old men, and we praise you.

1295
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,220
We're ugly.

1296
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:25,200
We sweat like pigs, and hey, sex is messy.

1297
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,940
Pays the Mexi sex.

1298
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,220
It's time to start asking some questions,

1299
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,640
and getting some anger.

1300
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,720
We were ripped off by the 60s.

1301
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:44,180
All the old hippies sold out, and got all the goodies.

1302
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:50,200
We were stuck with VCRs, and transistor radios,

1303
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:54,540
and Walkmans, and Topmans, and get yourself Offmans.

1304
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:01,060
So, there are no goodies to get, even if we could sell out.

1305
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,140
It's time to start asking some questions,

1306
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,100
and getting some anger.

1307
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,360
And here to tell you all about that sacred hate on,

1308
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,380
I hope you boys have by now,

1309
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,680
is the one and the only, Reverend Ivan Stein.

1310
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,940
Ivan Stein.

1311
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,840
Thank you.

1312
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,740
Sister Mary squared.

1313
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:26,900
Oh, yes.

1314
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:31,360
And, well, we'll be moving out now.

1315
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,200
You have been listening to the Sub-Genius.

1316
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:36,100
Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

You can have it.
