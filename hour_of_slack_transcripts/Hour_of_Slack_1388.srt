1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:10,380
Lieutenant? Lieutenant? Yeah, yeah, I'm listening. Lieutenant? Yeah, yeah, I'm listening. There's someone opening the door. Lieutenant? Yeah, yeah, I'm listening.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,540
You didn't need a thumb through my note card.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,900
This time he danced as if the puppet strings from his brain had been cut away and the madness was complete.

4
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,940
The genius.

5
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,360
Wake up, old Bob.

6
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,060
I believe in Mr. Bob.

7
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,240
Hey, Bob, it's great to have you on this show again. How you doing?

8
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,600
How is old Bob?

9
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,020
Oh, he's doing good. He sends his regards.

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,820
You know one of the best things about Bob?

11
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,800
Bob? What's that?

12
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,600
He's a smoker.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,480
Yeah, yeah, a frop all the way.

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,700
Bob! B-O-B!

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,360
But if you're on the market for just a basic, decent guy, you can't go wrong with Bob.

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,700
He's a reliable, no-frills model. Just one previous owner.

17
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,900
She only traded him in because she wanted something a little zippier.

18
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,740
His name's Bob.

19
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,260
Bob.

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,240
Bob's great.

21
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,260
He comes in every day.

22
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,540
He's tall, dark, and handsome.

23
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,440
His eyes are brown.

24
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:22,980
Brown shirt.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,720
Brown pants.

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,180
Brown belt.

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,780
How do I know?

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,380
Brown truck.

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,020
He's pretty cool.

30
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,160
Bob's a man of vision.

31
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,480
Dynamic.

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,760
Bob is a people person.

33
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,820
He's a unique individual.

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,520
He's one of a kind.

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,260
He's a people person.

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,380
Bob is prime cut.

37
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:32,700
He's a genius.

38
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,280
First rate.

39
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,800
He's an inspiration.

40
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,460
Great ass.

41
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,240
He's a man of the people.

42
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,020
I love Bob.

43
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,380
He's a people person.

44
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,280
He's a mover and a shaker.

45
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,680
Bob is the leader of the generation.

46
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,460
Bob has a great vision for the future of our country.

47
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,940
And a great vision for the future of the children of our country.

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,220
He's amazing.

49
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,180
He's a poet.

50
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,600
And a genius.

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,980
Absolutely, Bob.

52
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,380
Doc.

53
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,060
Straight up, Bob.

54
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,520
I love it, Bob.

55
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,100
Paragirl.

56
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,900
Great, Bob.

57
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,320
Doc.

58
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,660
Chilling most, Bob.

59
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,280
You know, a lot of people come to me and they say,

60
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,240
Dr. Gordon, how do I get slack?

61
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,100
And, you know, that's like asking a Zen master,

62
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,900
how do I achieve enlightenment?

63
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,360
It comes from within.

64
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,200
Slack is within you.

65
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,820
You must learn how to release it.

66
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,080
And the true way to release slack so it flows through your body

67
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,760
and possesses every particle of your soul

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,920
is to follow the path of Bob.

69
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,980
That's all you need.

70
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,880
But how come Izzy isn't always says that there's only one guy that runs the show?

71
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,780
One guy that runs the show?

72
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,820
One guy.

73
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,660
One guy.

74
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,620
Who runs the show.

75
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,500
There's one guy and his voice.

76
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,620
One guy to rule.

77
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,120
And his name is Puzzling Evidence.

78
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,800
Oh, I think it's Phil Henry.

79
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,140
Yeah.

80
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,960
An O. Henry bar would be.

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,680
Puzzling Evidence.

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,660
As well as a three-basket gym.

83
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,560
Where your dreams come true.

84
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,780
The new Caramel Milky Way bar.

85
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,760
Surrounded by creamy milk chocolate so rich in milk it almost moves.

86
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,520
And inside, a river of molten caramel.

87
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,280
And all your cares will go away.

88
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,320
Yes, your teeth will rebound from listening to the puzzling.

89
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,140
This show makes you feel happy inside.

90
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,260
You will wrench at this chocolate convention.

91
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,660
You'll go up and down on top of each other.

92
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,520
Many, many times.

93
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,180
Until you beg for more.

94
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,620
I beg your pardon?

95
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,400
I'm going to push you up.

96
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,560
Well, I'm afraid then you'll get a ten.

97
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,520
Oh, my lord.

98
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,620
We just shifted everything.

99
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,120
Yes, I think Hilda wants to vacuum over in this corner.

100
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,800
Pick up your feet, Dr. Howe.

101
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,140
This way to the street.

102
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,140
Dr. Howe, I notice that you're sitting mighty low tonight.

103
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,440
Mighty, mighty low.

104
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,600
I am sitting mighty low.

105
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,580
I'm sitting mighty low.

106
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:52,680
What's this?

107
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:52,980
It's a new style.

108
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,640
It's a new style.

109
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:53,640


110
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:53,640


111
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:53,640


112
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:53,640


113
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:53,640


114
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:53,640


115
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:53,640


116
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:53,640


117
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:53,640


118
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,480
It's a new style.

119
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:54,740
It's a new style.

120
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:54,740


121
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:54,740


122
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:54,740


123
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:54,740


124
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:54,740


125
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,880
Did you notice that about him?

126
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,480
Yeah.

127
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,840
I'm sitting mighty low.

128
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,840
I thought part of something.

129
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,940
You're only like three feet tall tonight, Dr. Howe.

130
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,940
I'm getting kind of small.

131
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,300
Did you go through that shrink ray on the way in?

132
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,040
I'm shrinking kind of small.

133
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,440
You can remind me of the incredible shrinking man.

134
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:12,940
All right.

135
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,580
All right.

136
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,420
It's humiliating enough to this diminution in size without having to listen to you go on about it.

137
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,560
I don't know why I had to lose mass and height.

138
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,100
It's so noticeable.

139
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,260
I know.

140
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,380
Well, I'm getting smaller as I go on.

141
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:29,740
Whoa.

142
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,300
There he goes.

143
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,300
He's teeny.

144
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:37,440
I understand that soon you will be small enough to fit between the molecules of an atom.

145
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,280
That will take some time.

146
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,680
Not soon at all.

147
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,880
Besides, you've got that the other way around.

148
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,800
The atoms of a molecule.

149
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,640
Yes, those molecules.

150
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,180
Dr. Drummond, you crack me up.

151
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,500
Yeah.

152
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:53,620
Yeah.

153
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,880
Yeah.

154
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:01,520
I'm falling and I'm gonna die.

155
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:13,720
Slowly, it's going to get

156
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:13,720


157
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,580
Trust your I used to be servants.

158
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,520
Can I just be your friend?

159
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,780
From PR News in Washington, I'm calling on citizens to take foolish chances.

160
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,860
The story is a sensation.

161
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,040
Police hit newsstands today.

162
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,520
Authorities should focus on bringing PR News to justice instead.

163
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,240
This is PR News.

164
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,700
Eight states plus the District of Columbia have declared a state of New York.

165
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,500
The NHL says it remains committed to a fair outcome for both PR News.

166
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,840
What bands played at X-State?

167
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,960
Besides the Meany Assets.

168
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,040
There was, of course, the Meany Assets.

169
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,780
The Tommy Amoeba.

170
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,280
God!

171
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,600
Fat Man D.

172
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,020
We're there.

173
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:23,900
Tommy Amoeba.

174
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,580
What was his band?

175
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,900
I can't remember the name of the band.

176
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,300
There's a name for it.

177
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,940
Tommy Amoeba.

178
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,720
He calls himself the lowest form of life.

179
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,700
But, of course, the Amoeba is by no means the lowest form of life.

180
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,560
No, but he is.

181
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,000
Here it goes.

182
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,680
A song called National Support.

183
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,120
Hope for the best.

184
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,200
Here it goes.

185
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,240


186
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,960
Here it goes.

187
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,220
Here it goes.

188
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,500
Here it goes.

189
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:51,500


190
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:51,500


191
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:51,500


192
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:51,500


193
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:51,500


194
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:51,500


195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,920
Insatiable music Thomas Cook!

196
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,660
Captlaimed by words.

197
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,560
I walked on the streetroke into a hole.

198
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,840
I looked at my feet and fell in a hole.

199
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,980
I think of a friend I knew long ago.

200
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,160
Alarm connects then I'm waving hello.

201
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,480
I hope my friend's back and says hello.

202
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:21,480


203
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,800
I hope for the best expecting the worst to know if I'm blessed or if I've been cursed

204
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,220
to know for the worst expecting the best to know if I'm cursed or if I've been blessed

205
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:39,720
I walk in and out of life's every door I'm thinking about where I've been before

206
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:46,400
so don't take it bad I'll take all the blame if I don't respond when you call my name

207
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,860
I hope for the best expecting the worst to know if I'm blessed or if I've been cursed

208
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:59,320
I hope for the worst expecting the best to know if I'm cursed or if I've been blessed

209
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,180
Hoping for the best is the national sport

210
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,900
Say what you mean but hope for the best

211
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,780
I walk to the bar and order a drink

212
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,380
I drink

213
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,220
That's cheaper by far than any damn shrink

214
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,360
I stare at the glass divided by two

215
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,600
I don't know which half reminds me of you

216
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:32,200
I hope for the best expecting the worst to know if I'm blessed or if I've been cursed

217
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,580
I hope for the worst expecting the best to know if I'm cursed or if I've been blessed

218
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:44,580
Hoping for the best is the national sport

219
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:51,320
Say what you mean but hope for the best

220
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,520
A little bit louder now

221
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,860
Hoping for the best

222
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,380
is the national sport

223
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,100
Say what you mean but

224
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,360
hope for the best

225
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,400
A little bit louder now

226
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,520
Hoping for the best is the national sport

227
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,560
Say what you mean but Maine

228
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:14,560


229
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
Hope for the best

230
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,560
Hope for the best

231
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,980
Is the national farce

232
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,560
What's up here?

233
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,520
What?

234
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,100
What?

235
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,560
What the fuck?

236
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,060
Hope for the best

237
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,340
Expecting the worst

238
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't know if I'm blessed

239
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,360
Or if I've been cursed

240
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,140
Hope for the worst

241
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,480
Expecting the best

242
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,300
Don't know if I'm first

243
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,640
Or if I've been blessed

244
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,680
A smoke, a drink

245
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,000
A time to settle down

246
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,460
The bad thoughts I think

247
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,700
I find I've had another

248
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,260
I broke the sink

249
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,580
And threw up in the shower

250
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,800
Get out all the tensions

251
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,180
I'm in a new direction

252
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,760
I have to crash

253
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,340
Here where they won't surprise me

254
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,620
I need some cash

255
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,100
Get some things to disguise me

256
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,140
A wig, mustache

257
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,860
And they won't recognize me

258
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,100
I'll blend in, you'll see

259
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,080
Back into society

260
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,300
I'm not going back

261
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,920
I'm not going back

262
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,360
I'm not going back

263
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,880
I have to laugh

264
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,320
Each time I think about it

265
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,620
I fool the staff

266
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,120
I bet they wonder how did

267
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,480
I slip the back

268
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,340
And leave completely

269
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,240
Shrouded, dunked

270
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,020
Into the laundry

271
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,260
Always gets picked up

272
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:47,580
At three

273
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,000
I've run for days

274
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Can't let those thugs

275
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,500
Enslave me

276
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,960
I'm in a haze

277
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,840
From all the drugs

278
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,360
They gave me

279
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,720
My eyes are glazed

280
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,960
And this beer sucks for shaving

281
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,260
Just give me five minutes more

282
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,820
Then I run back out the door

283
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,580
But I'm not going back

284
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,360
I'm not going back

285
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,240
I'm not going back

286
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,600
I'm not going back

287
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,060
I'm not going back

288
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,900
I'm not going back

289
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,760
I'm not going back

290
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,500
I'm not going back

291
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:51,760
I'm not going back I'm not going back

292
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,680
I'm not going back I'm not going back

293
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,780
I'm not going back, not going back, not going back

294
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,460
I smoke, I drink, I try to settle down

295
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,460
But I thought, I think, I'll find out better now that

296
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,040
I broke the sink and threw up in the shower

297
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,660
Get out all the 10 chips, I'm in a new direction

298
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,780
I have to crash, yeah well that won't surprise me

299
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,600
I need some cash, get something to disguise me

300
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,320
A wig, a mustache, something will recognize me

301
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,600
I'll blend in, you'll see, back into society

302
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,800
I'm not going back

303
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,060
This is my fiddly bear, refuse the return to the workforce

304
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,680
It'll never happen

305
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,380
Always

306
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,700
Oh wait, it already did

307
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:45,160
But it has more slack than you can imagine in 50 lifetimes

308
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,440
I'm not going back

309
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,380

from San Francisco

339
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,320
We arrived there just a week or less

340
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,360

hello

371
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,920
hi

372
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,380
Where do you want these?

373
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,520
On and on.

374
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,980
We'll pack it all around the central staircase here.

375
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,660
So you had little air-conditioned domiciles you could retreat to?

376
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,260
Yeah.

377
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,160
Well, we brought ours with us.

378
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,460
We were plugged in the camper.

379
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:44,920
Right.

380
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,840
Hal had a special hierarchy trailer there.

381
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,600
Right.

382
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,140
And how did the baptisms go?

383
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,540
Were people eager to get in the water during the horrible heat?

384
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,860
You know...

385
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,620
You'd think.

386
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,420
I don't...

387
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,760
I didn't attend the baptism.

388
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,160
They're just too afraid of old sea quolls.

389
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,960
Because...

390
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,700
They don't want to get down there and party with old sea quolls.

391
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,300
It's like a lot of people who will swim in a pool won't swim in a pond.

392
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,000
A pond is too full of salamanders and giant tadpoles and things that go splash.

393
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,960
Almost everybody that will swim in a pond will swim in a pool if it's available.

394
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,200
But it's nice and cool.

395
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:30,360
The pond is cool and, you know, over at old sea quolls, Dan, it's ice cold.

396
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:30,700
Yeah.

397
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,120
And you can get the heat off you.

398
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,360
He gets the heat from pulling unwitting victims down, right?

399
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,280
Oh, he does, yes.

400
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:45,800
But that's not likely to happen during the daylight unless you make wriggling motions that he simply can't resist.

401
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,700
The bottom can't be sounded.

402
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,680
We've got a place in Barberton, Ohio.

403
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,160
It's bottom.

404
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,860
You slap it.

405
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,620
It's on the side of the grave we saw last night.

406
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,080
Here we go.

407
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,120
Old sea quoll, you stay away from my junk.

408
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,760
Here come the frog ones.

409
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,640
Disappearances you didn't afford.

410
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,680
They're welcome to.

411
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,880
There's a giant spider right there.

412
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,480
Oh, fantastic.

413
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,220
He goes.

414
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,500
It's a wonderful live spider.

415
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,420
Oh, my God.

416
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,260
I can see it from here.

417
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,600
You deny the conspiracy.

418
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,020
It's a bob in your life.

419
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,180
Oh, my God.

420
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,200
Okay, that's it.

421
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,420
That's our first bob.

422
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,660
There's an arachnid.

423
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,980
He's swimming underwater.

424
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,040
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,020
We got the hunter and now all we need is him.

426
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,320
Nice.

427
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,660
Who wants to get holy first?

428
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,400
Who will be the first?

429
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Who wants to be cleansed first?

430
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,320
Who among ye besides that brave spider?

431
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,040
I, of course, as the catcher.

432
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,160
No.

433
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,520
That means I get to be the pitcher.

434
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,240
That's right.

435
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,320
Only I can.

436
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,480
Well, bend over, Dr. Howe.

437
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:59,380
Because of Susie's attractive front end and I will make this the longest, most drawn out of the ceremony.

438
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,640
It's always good when the.

439
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,340
I wish I had a cigarette.

440
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,140
Let's see.

441
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,260
Susie, do you reject the conspiracy from your life?

442
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,420
What conspiracy?

443
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,180
Do you reject jabbering minis from your life?

444
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,100
That's a good one.

445
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
I think I'm just going to reject it all.

446
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,400
Do the job, stay.

447
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,200
She's not co-author.

448
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,880
Do you accept Bob into your life?

449
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,320
Yes.

450
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,400
Do you accept Connie into your life?

451
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,760
I got my doubts about her.

452
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,780
I mean, astronauts, astronauts.

453
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,300
Do you accept the Yakutism, the evil, monstrous robots into your life?

454
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,820
I've accepted them into my ass.

455
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,160
Not like you had a choice.

456
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,880
I was just trying to.

457
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,600
Okay.

458
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,340
Bob.

459
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,440
There you are.

460
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,820
Reborn in Bob.

461
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,680
I feel slack.

462
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,380
You suck.

463
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,740
You should be a lot slacker than you look.

464
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,140
All right, who's next?

465
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,600
You see how it's done.

466
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,100
Come forth, or second in this case.

467
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,840
Teeters and all of your Peters.

468
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:26,360
Do you, once again, accept Bob into your life and reject the conspiracy and all it stands for and all the horrible, mundane, boring stuff, including this sermon?

469
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,100
Fucking A.

470
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,000
Fucking A.

471
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,480
Woo.

472
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,380
Down he goes.

473
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,880
There you go.

474
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Praise Teeter.

475
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,940
Praise Teeter.

476
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,320
Seriously, praise Teeter.

477
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,320
All right.

478
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,780
We have a woman in need of your menstruations, Reverend Stane.

479
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,740
Sister Magoon.

480
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,100
Yes, Reverend Stane.

481
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,400
Do you accept the conspiracy?

482
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,100
No, wait.

483
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:52,700
Jim.

484
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,040
No.

485
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,460
That was close.

486
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:58,860
Bob.

487
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,120
What?

488
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,780
I don't believe it.

489
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,240
No, I don't believe it.

490
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,800
Oh, God.

491
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:17,000
I love the woman.

492
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,000


493
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,180
No, no.

494
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,140
Don't.

495
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,980
Oh, God.

496
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:22,700


497
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:22,700


498
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:22,700


499
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,060
No.

500
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,320
God.

501
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,360
I don't believe it.

502
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,280
You're a liar.

503
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:27,660
You're a liar.

504
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:27,660


505
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:27,660


506
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:27,920
Why?

507
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,500
You're a liar.

508
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:28,500


509
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:28,520


510
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:28,520


511
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:28,520


512
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,420
Because you're a liar.

513
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:29,460
Why?

514
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,460


515
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,740
Praise God, then you are a true sub-genius.

516
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,780
We know you are not a genius.

517
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,020
So, do you accept Bob into your life and reject the conspiracy?

518
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:42,980
Why not?

519
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,020
Of course, why not?

520
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,740
That's all you need to know.

521
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,340
Hallelujah!

522
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,460
Come on, what's better, the baptism pool or Facebook?

523
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,880
Facebook, it shows everybody's real names.

524
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,040
Facebook's the anthem.

525
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,360
Gross!

526
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,520
I hate seeing that.

527
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,400
That means I can reveal them under torture.

528
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,960
Does Facebook reveal your real titties?

529
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,260
No!

530
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,200
So, which is where would you rather be, this pond or on goddamn Facebook?

531
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:12,800
That's right.

532
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,620
Get in the pond!

533
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,620
Amen.

534
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,920
You're already in the...

535
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,480
Lucy...

536
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,220
You're either on the pond or off the pond.

537
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:27,780
Reverend Lucy Van Pelt, for your expertise at torturing round-headed little boys, proving

538
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,020
you are a true sub-genius.

539
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,540
You mean Scott?

540
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,260
You can be a true sub-genius in this.

541
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,920
I'm proud to baptize you.

542
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,180
In the name of Bob, you reject the conspiracy.

543
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:43,060
People who don't shop at your store and accept Bob and whatever into your life.

544
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,520
I'm here this year.

545
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,740
She accepted the one.

546
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,380
That's a yes!

547
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,080
Praise Bob!

548
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

549
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,440
I got this too, the math.

550
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,060
Whatever.

551
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,020
Reverend Anitrocity, we know that you need to be a sub-genius.

552
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,020


553
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,020


554
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,020


555
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,020


556
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,020


557
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,020


558
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,740
You have a big slack payoff that's owed you.

559
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:01,940
Oh yeah.

560
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,240
So we don't question your hatred of the conspiracy.

561
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,840
That could not be more clear.

562
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,540
And your faith in Bob has always shown like a beacon for everyone who knows you.

563
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,200
Most of them, unfortunately, are pinks who can't see.

564
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,060
Yes, yeah.

565
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,960
We all have that problem.

566
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,740
And so, I baptize thee in the name of J.R.

567
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,000
Bob Dobbs, Connie Jehovah One, all those other monsters.

568
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,000


569
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,640
We haven't done books and comic books.

570
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,800
And praise Bob!

571
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:32,760
Woo!

572
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

573
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,220
I wish I'd been down here every day most of the day.

574
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,960
I've tried to be here every day.

575
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,880
Next year, our slack on stage happens right here.

576
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,580
Hand me that mic!

577
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,000
Do you reject with all of your heart the conspiracy?

578
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,000


579
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,000


580
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,000


581
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,000


582
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:06,480
The stupidity and the intelligence of the conspiracy welcoming in its stead the pure slack which

583
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,740
has nothing to do with brains, thank God.

584
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,560
Say I do!

585
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,080
I do!

586
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:12,920
Hallelujah!

587
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:14,920
Hallelujah!

588
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,500
A shunlalak labasaya.

589
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,820
You go go!

590
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,800
One of us.

591
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,340
One of us.

592
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,200
One of us.

593
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,220
One of us.

594
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,000
Psycho-X ain't one of us.

595
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,000


596
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,000


597
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,000


598
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,000


599
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,000


600
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,000


601
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,000


602
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:36,940
Do I repent of the sorrow of joining the Church of the Subgenius

603
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,800
and instead accept the glory of joining Bob

604
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,940
and all his slackful subgeniuses and all their stupidity

605
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,500
and yet wonderful ignorance?

606
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,360
Yes, I do!

607
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,540
He baptized himself!

608
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,480
Oh, he's having a real fit.

609
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,520
Oh man, look at this. This is getting bad.

610
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:06,120
Guy, I'd like to ask you if in Brazil there is a tradition of water-throwing day.

611
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,340
Actually, it's three days.

612
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,080
You start off with water the first day

613
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,080
and then the second day it's colored water

614
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,600
and slightly obnoxious stuff.

615
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,940
And if you're in a real hardcore area, by the third day,

616
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,880
which I believe is the one we call the Fat Tuesday,

617
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,980
they throw things like motor oil, shoe polish, excrement, stuff like that.

618
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:36,920
That's terrible. That must be a modern variation on the older holiday of water-throwing day.

619
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,380
Oh, they still throw water.

620
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,460
You say they throw water on the first day,

621
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,800
but by the third they've graduated to shoe polish, motor oil.

622
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,480
Yeah, exactly. It's like an arms race.

623
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,780
Yeah, that I don't believe was a part of the original intention of water-throwing.

624
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,520
Well, I don't know. They do that in Bolivia and Brazil.

625
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:54,900
Gatorade.

626
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,460
Gatorade.

627
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:55,460


628
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:55,460


629
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:55,460


630
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:55,460


631
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,320
Gatorade's good to throw.

632
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,320
I knew it took place in several South American countries.

633
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,540
Brondo. We get some Brondo in here.

634
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,460
And it seems like a good thing to me,

635
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,280
except, of course, now that you're throwing shoe polish.

636
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,140
It's got electrolyte.

637
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:14,100
Well, yeah, but what happens is they don't go out on those days.

638
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,760
Well, it goes out on the first day because it's water day.

639
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,720
But after the water day, like in Santa Cruz, Bolivia,

640
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,920
you don't go out after water day.

641
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,400
You just let the kids go out and throw that at one another.

642
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,120
And get their clothes all nasty.

643
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,340
Because if they're over the age of 12, they're drunk anyway.

644
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,500
I thought everybody tried really to splash each other.

645
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,780
In the accounts I read, which, of course, are from the 1920s.

646
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,160
Well, you know, Dr. Howell, there's a similar ceremony in India

647
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,280
where they do it with perfumed and colored water.

648
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,940
And they throw it, and everybody's clothes are just incredibly tie-dyed.

649
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,840
Sopping and tie-dyed.

650
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,160
And colored, yeah.

651
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,460
But then again, India's a place where you'd like to be sopping.

652
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,660
Because it's so hot.

653
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,300
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

654
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,520
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

655
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:48,720
Thank you.

656
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,960
Thank you.

657
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,800
Thank you.

658
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,080
Thank you.

659
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,160
Thank you.

660
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,580
Thank you.

661
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,260
Thank you.

662
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,580
Thank you.

663
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,020
Thank you.

664
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,920
Thank you.

665
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,860
Thank you.

666
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,120
Thank you.

667
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,280
Thank you.

668
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,640
Thank you.

669
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,940
Thank you.

670
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,000
Thank you.

671
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,160
The burning of the Bob.

672
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,060
At this time, we should make our way down the street.

673
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,520
So we can set Bob on fire.

674
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,980
Because he screwed us over again.

675
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,980
He did, even though they came.

676
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,340
You know, I tried this year. I really did.

677
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,540
You know, normally we burn him on the 4th.

678
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,460
And I thought to myself, well...

679
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,860
If I got set afire every year right before I was supposed to show up,

680
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,260
I probably wouldn't show up.

681
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,380
So I thought we'd do it different this year.

682
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,180
I thought we'd give Bob a chance.

683
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,420
And what did he do? Now he screwed us over again.

684
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,720
If you will walk your way down the street

685
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,380
to where we burned Bob last year,

686
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,760
you can follow the path down and right before it splits,

687
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,900
there's a little fire waiting for us.

688
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,920
And we'll set that son of a bitch ablaze.

689
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,740
You see the flashing light over there, folks?

690
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,080
It's hypnotizing. Follow the flashing light.

691
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,440
Follow the flashing light.

692
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,700
Follow the flashing light.

693
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:27,560
Follow the flashing light.

694
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,320
Follow it. Follow it.

695
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:51,280
The light is kritic.

696
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,020
It's kind of painless by its likeness.

697
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,780
But we're going to continue.

698
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,340
The last time weoding.

699
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:56,680
I thought this was an argument, but it wasn't.

700
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,040
That is, we just finished the slides.

701
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,240
But he can't see it.

702
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,500
Over time, as the light moves,

703
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,160
we can't see it anymore.

704
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,020
Oh?

705
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,440
The priest shall burn the head on the altar for a burnt lord.

706
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,040
It is a burnt head and it's made by sweet fire.

707
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,280
This is new. All new.

708
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,500
And medical science offers you proof positive.

709
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,500
You'll see the number 903 on the government stamp.

710
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,340
There is a Dobbs down here somewhere.

711
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:34,140
Somewhere is either Bob himself or one of those clever robotic dummies.

712
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,060
This seems a little disorganized for a religious ritual.

713
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,860
Who's Dr. Hall?

714
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
That's what I'm saying.

715
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,060
I'm not going to ask him if he's Bob Hill.

716
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,680
This seems rather disorganized.

717
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,500
There's supposed to be somebody holding a bullhorn up to my mouth all the time

718
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,040
so that I can be obnoxious real loud.

719
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,620
And that ain't happening.

720
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,840
Back in the old days.

721
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,260
Back in the old days.

722
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,960
We didn't have a fire starter to start our subdued fire.

723
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,220
We had to rub two sticks together.

724
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,640
We didn't even know what fire was back in the old days.

725
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,320
We just rubbed two dicks together.

726
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,740
Are we ready?

727
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,800
We've been asking you that for a while, Lord Death.

728
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,640
Into the flames.

729
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,320
I leave planet Earth the way that all the rest of us have.

730
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,700
The rest of you will probably have to go.

731
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,860
Look, walk closer to the fire so that you can be illuminated, Lord Death.

732
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,520
Fuck you, Bob!

733
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,460
No, Bob, no!

734
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,180
We need a countdown.

735
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,380
Don't fall on your head.

736
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:45,800
Yes, even without the bullhorn, I dare rant.

737
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:52,200
This simulacrum of J.R. Bob Dobbs, clever though he may be,

738
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,540
we know it's not the real Bob.

739
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,520
He couldn't burn.

740
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,500
We wouldn't be able to hurt him unless he wanted us to.

741
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:04,820
This effigy, however, symbolizes our freedom from our own God.

742
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,060
He's not really the best God in the world.

743
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:15,980
So we recognize that we have total faith despite his rather obvious flaws.

744
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,100
That's the important thing about this or any other religion.

745
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,020
So he's rather...

746
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,520
What?

747
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,900
Badly stitched together and barely looks human.

748
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,720
Yet, yet, we still have faith in Bob.

749
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,140
We maintain the F.I.B.

750
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:35,740
Faith in Bob!

751
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:43,920
Also, it is photogenic and funny to watch a dummy of a man burn.

752
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:45,960
Really.

753
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,500
Just so you know, I know there's some people here that don't have their subgenius wristbands,

754
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,300
don't know anything about subgenius.

755
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,060
There's probably some infiltrators here.

756
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,240
No problem.

757
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,580
We're happy to have you.

758
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:08,060
Just understand this is not really a dead, innocent, pink boy sacrificed to our God disguised

759
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,540
as a crappy dummy.

760
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:16,240
It really is just a crappy dummy and there's not really a live person inside here.

761
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:23,280
So as Papa Joe Mama suggested, we should have a countdown to the countdown.

762
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,280


763
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,280


764
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:33,900
When he looks like this, I believe it's up to him.

765
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,120
AUDIENCE MEMBERS binder

766
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,120


767
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,560
A couple days later, here comes aaraoh!

768
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:47,480
Wait, wait, wait!

769
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:48,840
But once again...

770
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,140
Everyone does this...

771
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,500
alegal...

772
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,300
Fire in his hole!

773
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,740
Oh, the fire!

774
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,620
You'll be in the fire!

775
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,040
Up the TV!

776
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:07,980
Bird!

777
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,080
Insult to injury.

778
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,360
Jason applies the flamethrower to an already tortured victim

779
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,900
to make sure that his butt burns as fast as his face.

780
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,200
He's getting a burning sensation out there, XJ.

781
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,660
Right in his tar that's...

782
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,380
That is butt hurt.

783
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,320
You think you have butt hurt, my friend.

784
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,080
Bob's butt hurt was so fast and frantic.

785
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,040
Was your butt blowtorched?

786
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,960
How many times?

787
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:47,560
Not many.

788
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,340
Not that long.

789
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,360
Oh, my God!

790
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:56,980
Oh, my God!

791
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:57,840
Oh, my God!

792
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,880
Oh, my God!

793
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,280
This is how it happened.

794
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,520
I was waiting for Bob, and all of a sudden, gunshots.

795
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,360
Seven or eight of them.

796
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,300
I quickly jumped on top of them to protect him.

797
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,480
That's when I saw them, the Arabs.

798
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,340
Seven or eight of them.

799
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,720
I found the main guy, disarmed him, knocked him unconscious.

800
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,840
Please, Jesus, please, Jesus, please, Jesus, please, Jesus,

801
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,260
save Bob, save Bob.

802
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,260
Please, Jesus, please, Jesus, please, Jesus, please, Jesus, please, Jesus.

803
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,280
He's in serious condition, Jack, and they don't know if he'll live or not.

804
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:31,060
Now, just minutes ago, we learned the name of the suspect from Frank Ryan of the NYPD.

805
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,640
His name is...

806
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,060
Once dead, he lives.

807
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,100
Never dead.

808
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,260
He's evil.

809
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,540
I killed him.

810
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,460
It was my fault.

811
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,320
I'm bad luck.

812
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,660
He said I could.

813
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,780
He said I could kiss him.

814
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,540
Who said?

815
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,660
Who said you could who?

816
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,640
I said, come on now.

817
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,940
I was standing right behind him.

818
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,700
I saw him shoot Bob.

819
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,840
You pump people full of drugs and pipe dreams of what happens.

820
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,420
They come gunning for people like Bob.

821
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,160
But those folks don't realize something.

822
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,800
You can't kill the truth.

823
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,540
This is refreshing.

824
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,980
There's no forced dancing or drumming.

825
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,900
The subgeniuses don't do that naturally.

826
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:16,300
Naturally, they sit and stare going, wow, there hasn't been a commercial for ten minutes.

827
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:16,520
I'm not going to do that.

828
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:16,520


829
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:16,520


830
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:16,520


831
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:16,520


832
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:16,520


833
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:16,520


834
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:16,520


835
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:16,520


836
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:16,520


837
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:28,940
The drama's over.

838
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:28,960


839
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,720
because we had some good beans today.

840
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,420
I've got a...

841
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,120
Bob had a bad fart.

842
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,680
Bob had an extremely bad rectal fart.

843
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,240
It looks like one of those

844
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,260
inactive colonic incidents.

845
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,660
Pyroflatulation of the involuntary kind.

846
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,460
Unvented.

847
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,620
Goodbye, Bob.

848
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,300
We knew you.

849
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,740
I built this fire to burn our bar.

850
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,200
Because it's kind of expensive

851
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,760
and we're not that stupid.

852
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,380
No.

853
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,640
Come on.

854
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,620
Bob is the king of it, so...

855
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,960
Well, then Bob can show up and stuff.

856
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,720
Bob can show up and stuff himself.

857
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,580
Yeah, he can stuff himself.

858
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,920
But Bob did not show up to stuff himself.

859
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,680
So it's full of dryer, lint, and newspaper.

860
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,900
I thought about putting old

861
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,020
printouts of membership packs in there,

862
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,560
but I realized it was bad security.

863
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,380
They'd be wafting through the woods

864
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,480
and, you know,

865
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,780
meth heads would pick them up.

866
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,300
Yeah, Amish meth heads would pick them up.

867
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,180
The Amish meth heads.

868
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,760
No, the meth lights.

869
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,980
Yeah, Bob.

870
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,780
Yeah, PM Bob.

871
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,060
PM Bob.

872
00:42:59,240 --> 00:42:59,760
Hmm.

873
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,940
The next thing you know,

874
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,460
they'll be honoring their treaties

875
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,040
with the dirt worshiper.

876
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,320
Athens has fallen.

877
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,460
Oh, no.

878
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,500
That was a nice town.

879
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,840
Yeah, it was.

880
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,120
That's the end of knowledge

881
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,980
for a thousand years.

882
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,720
The dark ages began

883
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,660
with the call of Athens.

884
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,460
The Athenites become slaves

885
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,760
to the citizens of Rome, Ohio,

886
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,380
population 2,000.

887
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,560
There's probably not even a library there.

888
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,380
Huh.

889
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,580
That's what he thinks, Brian.

890
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,020
That's the library?

891
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,360
The Rome, Ohio library?

892
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,280
Yeah, I see.

893
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,600
Actually, that was the Alexandria

894
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,040
library.

895
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,100
Oh, yeah.

896
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,460
Oh, yeah.

897
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


898
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


899
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


900
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


901
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


902
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


903
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


904
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


905
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


906
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


907
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


908
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


909
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


910
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


911
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


912
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


913
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,780
The entire collection

914
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,880
lines at the bottom

915
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,720
of the fire pit.

916
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,100
Yeah.

917
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,920
The whole idea was just magic.

918
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,940
Build your own ship.

919
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,540
No, we were going to get

920
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,760
everything for 35 bucks.

921
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,540
That was the whole idea.

922
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,300
It was the whole idea.

923
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,500
The whole idea was...

924
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,380
I can't believe that...

925
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,900
Okay, would a preacher like Bob

926
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,300
lie or be wrong?

927
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,880
Not lie so much as

928
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,460
bend the truth,

929
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:15,820
Yeah, exactly.

930
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,320
dramatically.

931
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,440
Well, it seems like we would

932
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,380
pick up on something like that

933
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,040
after 17 years.

934
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:24,520
You would think.

935
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,620
You would think.

936
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,940
I mean, thinking, right?

937
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:27,940
Did you hear?

938
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,060
It's not the thinking part.

939
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:29,740
It just still seems so right.

940
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,280
It's the cap.

941
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,360
Yeah.

942
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,680
No, and you're right.

943
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,220
It's the cap.

944
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,120
$35 isn't enough to buy...

945
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,120


946
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,880
next year's Bob.

947
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,460
Hi, we never did that.

948
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,520
But Princess, what do you

949
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:40,640
see?

950
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,480
That was Starwood.

951
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,600
We'd scrape up each...

952
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,780
The ashes, remember?

953
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,460
Every magic Starwood.

954
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:45,460


955
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,840
...and put it into the next one

956
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,340
so it would be even more magical.

957
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,900
We should scrape these up

958
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,020
so they'll be more skeptical each year.

959
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,800
More realistic.

960
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,000
Less magical every year.

961
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,460
We could even slip some into the

962
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:03,240
Starwood fire and fuck them up.

963
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,660
See the colors come out.

964
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:05,980
I know.

965
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,700
They didn't catch on.

966
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,560
We could totally demagicize

967
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,860
the Starwood fire.

968
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,640
I don't think it works.

969
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,940
Just by adding one teaspoon

970
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,440
for every one of them.

971
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:15,440


972
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:15,980
I don't think it works.

973
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,200
I don't think it works.

974
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,980
It's like pure ash of faithlessness.

975
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,360
Purified Bob.

976
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,880
Yeah, purified disbelief in anything.

977
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,400
Except fun, slime, and Bob, of course.

978
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:33,700
Seeds for next year.

979
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,040
Drawing out of the ashes of this.

980
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,640
Kool-Aid, Flavor-Aid.

981
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,300
For those in the...

982
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,280
I think Bob's in there.

983
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,300
Yeah, no kidding, man.

984
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,200
It's Flavor-Aid for the real serious...

985
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:45,420
Oh, yeah.

986
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:45,420


987
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:45,420


988
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:45,420


989
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:45,420


990
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,900
...suicidal cultists.

991
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,700
Did you hear Pastor Prime's theory

992
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,060
about if there's one speck left of this

993
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:00,300
that it will morph into another entire

994
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,320
Dobbs head?

995
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,760
She had a whole theory there that she

996
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,860
was expounding.

997
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,240
Oh, from that dummy?

998
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,300
From that dummy, yeah.

999
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,420
That if every...

1000
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,320
Like it's holographic, one tiny cell

1001
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,060
from it can be replicated into a...

1002
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:15,400
Yes, if one cell of it is linked to a

1003
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:15,400


1004
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,260
speck left, if it doesn't completely burn.

1005
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,080
If you can't turn it into a false Bob

1006
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,320
that overpopulates the whole Earth.

1007
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,320
Yes, that's her theory.

1008
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,500
Well, that's why it's burning out.

1009
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,740
Maybe it would be worth if you put in molten metal.

1010
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,340
After the attack on Bob's life,

1011
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,260
the media outcry is unprecedented.

1012
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,460
His face echoes across the American landscape

1013
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,160
on the covers of magazines, in newspapers,

1014
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,960
and on television news broadcasts.

1015
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:38,640
Robert.

1016
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,220
One week after the shooting, word comes that Bob

1017
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,240
will be released and transported to Pennsylvania

1018
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,400
by Medivac.

1019
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,100
Coming in the Medivac helicopter,

1020
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,140
in a Hansen style hansock and pop,

1021
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,040
a

1022
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:53,520
Howling Sea 있어

1023
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,440
and a

1024
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,080
Baroku

1025
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:55,260
uh

1026
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:55,900
She wooden

1027
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:56,840
back

1028
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:56,840


1029
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,280
signature

1030
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:57,280


1031
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:57,540
Okay.

1032
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,320
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

1033
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,200
Hey everybody, I'm taking off my pants!

1034
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,180
Take off your pants!

1035
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,140
Take off your pants and dance!

1036
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,160
Take off your pants!

1037
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,000
Take off your pants and dance!

1038
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:47,940
Take off your pants!

1039
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,780
Try to do some good shit!

1040
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,220
Take them off, it won't hurt!

1041
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,260
Take off your pants and dance!

1042
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,760
Take off your pants!

1043
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,900
Take off your pants and dance!

1044
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,380
Take off your pants!

1045
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,220
Take off your pants!

1046
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,980
Take off your pants and dance!

1047
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:34,140
Take off my pants!

1048
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:34,140


1049
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,720
I'm leaving my pants on!

1050
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:40,080
When the rabbit of chaos is pursued by a fetish of consoling through the feelings of anarchy...

1051
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,360
Oh!

1052
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,140
Oh, they've come to steal my pants!

1053
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:43,140


1054
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:43,940
You're playing with me!

1055
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,500
Are you sure you didn't just forget to put them on again?

1056
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,740
I must need to take my leave of my pants!

1057
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,400
Call Walter Cronkite, your girlfriend is a bad sign!

1058
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,180
Uh-huh.

1059
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:04,140
Back in 1965, there was this guy named Johnny Delmar.

1060
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,560
He used to race on the circuit...

1061
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,280
...out in California.

1062
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,240
And this guy was like the...

1063
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,980
...the top of the line!

1064
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,960
Slot car racer!

1065
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,440
Well, this guy ended up missing one time and, uh...

1066
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,140
He, uh...

1067
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,000
Well...

1068
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,900
They found him a year later and he wasn't quite the same.

1069
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,380
He was still winning races, but, uh...

1070
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,180
He was the living dead, so...

1071
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,500
This is, uh...

1072
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,500
Johnny Zombie.

1073
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,240
💪

1074
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:48,240


1075
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:48,920
💪

1076
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,020
💪

1077
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:21,540
Thank you.

1078
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:02,920
Thank you.

1079
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:15,800
Thank you.

1080
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,920
Thank you.

1081
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,260
Thank you.

1082
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,020
Thank you.

1083
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,100
Thank you.

1084
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,100
Thank you.

1085
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,540
Thank you.

1086
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:23,300
Thank you.

1087
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,520
From PR News in Washington,

1088
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:42,960
I'm Tom Selleck.

1089
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,840
Not clear, but witnesses and police

1090
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,880
say several activists are shelling

1091
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,760
suburbs off the coast of western Canada.

1092
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,920
On the east coast, there are

1093
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,440
no reports of majored Canada.

1094
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,180
It is not what's important.

1095
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,940
Officials say a church attacked a

1096
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,540
car while mass was being held.

1097
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,880
They say state-controlled media gave

1098
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,980
more positive PR news to the ruling

1099
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,000
party. This is PR News.

1100
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:25,980
We'll be right back.

1101
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,460
We'll be right back.

1102
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,860
We'll be right back.

1103
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,420
We'll be right back.

1104
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,520
We'll be right back.

1105
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,280
We'll be right back.

1106
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:13,380
We'll be right back.

1107
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,200
Why do you associate

1108
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,800
with those strange people?

1109
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:18,860
And my answer

1110
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:19,960
is always the same.

1111
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,380
Why not?

1112
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,980
From PR News in Washington,

1113
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:31,600
I'm from the

1114
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,620
fallen 20% on September

1115
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,860
721st, later this

1116
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,280
month. Now,

1117
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,780
according to NATO data,

1118
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,600
the first months of this fighting,

1119
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,900
the fighting season saw some of the

1120
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,900
highest violence levels in recent PR

1121
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,220
News. And that's PR's

1122
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:50,140
armed clashes. But female

1123
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,320
activists in the group are upset

1124
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,600
that this is PR News.

1125
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,580
It just isn't helping at all.

1126
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,160
Cobble, cobble. But an official

1127
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,140
in the capital of Myanmar says

1128
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:02,180
President Obama will visit the southern

1129
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,040
U.S., which is emerging from

1130
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,880
more than two decades of military

1131
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,480
PR News in Washington.

1132
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,600
Sire, there is no more

1133
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,620
money. We've got to get

1134
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:17,460
some money.

1135
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,320
Come on!

1136
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,040
Get up off that chair!

1137
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,200
Follow me!

1138
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:26,600
Arda!

1139
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,480
Friends, we're glad

1140
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,000
you listened to this show, and

1141
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,360
we're even more glad that some listeners have

1142
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,500
donated enough to help us keep on going

1143
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,000
for another couple of months.

1144
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,840
And not just this show,

1145
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:42,020
but subgenius.com and all the

1146
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,060
other archive sites.

1147
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,700
But if you truly

1148
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,740
love Bob, and want some of that

1149
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,820
slack back to rebound to

1150
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,500
you, you should go to

1151
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,060
subgenius.com front page

1152
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,640
or especially the radio page,

1153
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,660
or the catalog store pages,

1154
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,840
and help out financially

1155
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,960
as best you can.

1156
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,860
Now, we know what it's like to be on

1157
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:05,980
the brink of total poverty, and we don't

1158
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,820
want any subgeniuses to make their own

1159
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:08,960
situations worse.

1160
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,940
But some of you still have jobs.

1161
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,900
Even five bucks

1162
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,880
makes a big difference, even

1163
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,900
if it's only once a month, from

1164
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,880
enough of you. Fifty bucks

1165
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,200
makes an even bigger difference.

1166
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:23,940
All we're saying

1167
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:26,160
is that blowjobs

1168
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,100
could go the way of Stevejobs

1169
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,680
if you don't pay dogs.

1170
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,960
We also take

1171
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,600
checks and money orders to

1172
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,440
Subgenius Foundation.

1173
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:37,580
P.O. Box

1174
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,240
181

1175
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:40,840
417

1176
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,200
Cleveland Heights, Ohio

1177
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:47,940
44118

1178
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,960
Thanks for anything

1179
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,140
you can do to help let there

1180
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,160
be slack.
