I feel him in my hands.

I feel him all over me.
No, no, no, no.

Friends, this was going to be a love show, but we're all paranoid still, so I changed my mind, and it's a war show with Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave at ESO Swamp Radio WCSB Cleveland.
The war drums are so nice.
President Bush certainly is looking presidential and busy lately, huh?
Now what happened?
They opened the satchel and we're still busy with the sexes?
Is that what happened?
I don't know. I haven't turned on the news in six months since they knocked those buildings down.
It's pretty much George Bush and Dick Cheney against everybody in the world.
Dave, we all turned down, tuned in, and we dropped out, man.
Oh, man, you guys have gone the hippie way.
Yeah, we quit voting.
That's our protest against voting.
I'm going to become a nihilistic type dude.
You know what I'm saying?
Forget this dog stuff.
How about a neopaleon?
I've got a silly tumor and I'm yucking it up, you know, and the world's burning down around our knees.
Right. Right.
No, your world is burning down around your knees.
The world will simply do what it does.
Burn around its own knees?
Long after your world has burned to its knees.
Stand up and run.

Friends, there have been some really strange subgeniuses
And also some mal-aligned normals pestering me lately
And man, you know what, I've about had enough
I've had enough of that
I think people are going nuts
Is there still, is, is, have there been sunspots?
Did the Russian CIA guys turn on some ray? Oh yes, there is a tremendous amount of...
Oh yeah, they did, that's happening too
The kook meter at Subgenius Central is spiking
I have never seen anything like it
Well, war fever, there is war madness going on
And sometimes when they use the big subliminal generators
Lots of people, you know, start spazzing out in their everyday lives
Yeah, I have, I think that it's, it's like, you know, teachers, loony bin custodians
And cops and so forth all know this around full moons
That there's a real palpable increase in just general craziness
And it seems like, I mean, we're between full moons right now, man
What is going on?
What do you think is happening? What do you think is happening, Dr. Frederick?
There's people in those cars next to you
Why are they looking at you like that?
Are they following you?
Do they know your name? Why is he riding, what is he riding now? Your license number?
Have you ever, have you been checking out the white SUVs?
Do you know about Alex Jones? Have you heard of Alex Jones?
The internet so-called kook from Texas?
Yeah, yeah
Who believes that George Bush is the Antichrist?
Or at least one of his friends?
Yes, I guess
Well, who is the real guy?
Isn't every president the Antichrist?
Yes
I think so, I mean, you know, after all these years, I think they, that's what they're essentially running for is Antichrist
Reagan was best, because he had the six letters in each of his things

Yeah, I heard that, I wish I'd seen that

And it's not working, man, I still got it
I know what you mean, man
It's a hard fever to break
It's, uh, I've been trying to avoid all of that, didn't turn on the TV during the day
Me neither, actually
Or anything, but, but I could still kind of sense the psychic echoes reverberating in my head
You could hear all the madmen in Washington, ah, you know, huzzahing at one time
Also, they all showed up on alt.slack and on the internet, uh, very interactively

I think, well, I don't know if Tony Blair gets his
little BP card, his special
embossed BP card.
All I know is I
unearthed my draft card with
the 4F stamped on it
not long ago. I bet that 4F
is still good. I doubt if my
feet have gotten...
4F is your top foot?
4F? Flat feet? Anything else you could have?
Well, that's psychosis,
homosexuality,
well, they didn't have AIDS back then.
Sarcomas from Greece. Believe it or not.
Bulimia,
expandable buttocks. I was number 30
in the lottery. They were going to ship
my ass off to Hamburger Hill
and turn me into hamburger.
But instead they shipped off the rest of your body
and left your ass back in dear old Tejas.
And was it a wonderful thing for the
population of... I don't know.
I have friends who had the
best time of their lives
serving in the armed forces
during the Vietnam War. Then I have other
friends who have to take Valium three
times a day because they had the
worst time of their lives.
Most people don't like it. But the ones who
do, it's not the war. It's just the idea that
maybe they might die, but maybe they
won't. You know, they just get goosed up on it.
Then the rest go, oh shit, what did
I get into here? This really sucks.
You know? Well,
the marijuana on Guam
had a lot to do with...
the good times that I've
heard about. Well, on Iwo Jima
in World War II, the pot was so good
that they had to keep raising the flag
and lowering it and razor it and get the right
and they could never get the right angles or anything.
That's why that was a four-day shoot.
But most of the opportunities took place
on the U.S.
Those guys had to pose there holding that flag
in place while they got sculpted and
carved that big rock
to match their... Instead of glorifying
it, though. Yeah, I mean, that was...
Many people would die.
Think about that. How many people will be dead?
Oh, hell, we don't care about that.
We'll be mutilated by the smart bomb.
Death is something that happens to other people in America
unless it happens to you. You know what I mean?
Especially violent death
when the sky's red and the water
tastes like poison and is poison
and you can't... Well, let's not
get into it because... Why can't we just
all get a bong?
I've believed that for so long.
That's my credo.
In Vietnam,
the media
didn't know anybody.
They went ahead and showed the dead stuff,
the dead things and people
on the television, but you see,
nowadays, during that Gulf War miniseries,
you didn't see anything too unpleasant.
It was kind of like Star Wars.
Flying over the Death Star,
shooting with their ray guns,
and you'd see these pretty explosions
down there.
It was all just...
Yeah, it was psychedelic.
the media
people have
learned that you keep your blood
in your guts with the scary monster
movies and the babysitter murder
movies. Rollercoaster style.
And you keep your
romance with those
and with the news, you just keep it
hard. Yeah.
Just slightful.
It's the end of the world.
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It's the end of the world.
I've gotten so tired of carrying around
that placard that says the world.
The end is nigh.
At this point,
it's like,
how many times have I drilled for the
end of the world now?
Ever since I was a teenager, really.
Since I was a little kid.
Might as well just hold up in the puffer dome.
Might as well hide under your school desk with the newspaper
over your head.
Duck and cover.
That's all you guys are doing.
It's still just a bunch of duck and cover.
Duck and cover.
Duck and cover.
That's all you guys are doing.
You are dumb and dumb.
Duck and cover.
And you'll feel just freaking fine.
Yay.
Hey, man.
I think you've got the wrong attitude
about this war thing.
I mean, like, blood must be shed.
Thank you.
Down through our histories
We have been told
That women hold mysteries men cannot know
But boys learn through secrecy
How to hide lies
And cracks in their souls
And behind shaded eyes
They'd filter all light
Through the sins of their fathers
Shining on down
On good sons and daughters
We were true believers
And at this song of gold
I was a high holy fever
That purified the soul
But days turned to piss off
All equality allowed
As girls danced the go-go
To our golden calf
We borrowed the tune
From the hymns of our fathers
We are not rebels
Just good sons and daughters
Good sons, good sons
And daughters
Good sons, good sons
Yeah, the revolution came
Oh, the revolution went
And I'd never all
Just that 50%
Oh, the truth that comes from tennis
From porno to rape
And bought into Hollywood
And kept the slight
Millions of Marylanders
Who died for their lovers
Seducing the culture
Of good sons and daughters
Good sons, good sons
And daughters
Good sons, good sons
And daughters
Good parents
Sur Books
And Sei Unions
Good Harlequin

And we're a family






Do not look down
On the ground
There's dwell


She's reading through the paper
In her little keep
And I happened to see
A police officer
That looked a whole lot like me
And so I started dodging questions
A-line on top of lies
And I thought what I thought
Was a good alibi
I never knew your mother
Your sister or daughter
I ain't no killer
I'm a good son
Yeah, I'm a good son
Yeah, I'm a good son
Yeah, I'm a good son

We're talking about space aliens
If you'd like to join our conversation
Numbers are on the screen
2-0-0 for Republicans
And 2-0-1 for Democrats
And 2-0-2
2-2 for space aliens
I noticed in your article
There are a lot of companies
That are working on aliens
If you want to fall in love
With an alien
That's basically impractical
What about worldwide space aliens?
They're based on reality
But they're imaginary
What other countries
Besides the U.S. and Russia
Are in the space aliens?
Brazil is certainly one
That might surprise an alien
India is another
But they're imaginary
Are there regulations
That are in place
Regarding private aliens?
Can anyone shoot up space aliens?
We'll be covering that
In some future issues
But there are some folks
Who are deep in the moon
Do the space aliens
Have to pay their full way themselves?
Yes, they do
Are these just imaginary
Or are these actual aliens?
It was a propaganda effort, certainly
But that's not
And
But
The Russians
That
So there'll be some corporate sponsors
And where are they finding the aliens?
That's hard
They're not finding it
Is NASA funding any of this?
Well, that's the conclusion they came to
Based on a market study
One of them asked me where my flag was
And I said it was home in a box
Where it should be
Well, but of course it was at home
Where else would it be?
It's the same place we go every day
Of course, of course
To our own little rooms in Winkyland
Yes
Where no one ever goes home
And there's never any war
Never
Ever
It's all soft and fuzzy
War is good
And pink
War is good
War is good
War is good
War is good
War is good
Makes Jesus laugh
Makes the Virgin cry
Makes the children sing
Blue the skies
War is good
War is good
War is good
War is good
And St. Attila raised the hand grenade up on high saying
O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade
That with it thou mayst blow thy enemies to tiny bits
In thy mercy
And the Lord did grin
And the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths
And carp and elderbees and orangutans
And breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large-
Give a bitch, brother
I communicate without wires or strings
I have the evil eye
I carried the module bag
I swam the Bermuda Triangle and didn't get wet
I circumcised dinosaurs with my teeth and make em leave a tip
I changed tires with my tongue and my tool
Every night I hock up a lunger and extinguish the sun
I'm the big fitted devil of level fourteen and I'm the king of the world
Who'll try to blow me down?
I've packed the brownies of the gods
I am a mole radio
I am a Kamado dragon
I am the killer whale bereft of its pup
I have a triple backbone
I was sired by the wolf man
Give me all your slack
I told Jesus I wouldn't go to church and he shook my hand
I have my own personal saviors
I change em every hour
I don't give a have sex with
If there's life after death
I want to know
If there's even any frigging slack after death
Bah!
Well there are those who fear the end
Fear the fatalistic trend
But I'm the one who won't follow the crowd
I'll say death be not proud
Well
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death
Death, death, death, death, death to the angel of
Opposers say death cannot be killed
Like the proper defensive skill
Yelling out with an angry sound
Saying death, you're going down
Death, death, death, death
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death
Death, death, death, death to the angel of
Death is coming, the end is near
Grab a gun, put away the fear
Pull the trigger and blow him away
Death, this is your dying day
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death
Death
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death
I have arrived from the other side to take you away
But can't you see I'm doing my hair?
Well, you're dead now, so shut up
Says you

Death, death, death, death to the angel of death
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death
It's not just a couple of кусンドos
You couldn't keep chapters like I can

But it doesn't matter

Death, death, death and you're in your squat
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death

Instead认
Bye-bye, Fernanda Nende.
What if the guys who brought over the slaves
would have just let the slaves have their drums
and turned it into a big party?
Well, they didn't let them do that.
If you had a drum, they kind of killed you, I think.
And instead of opening up a big cotton factory,
opened up the biggest tourist attraction on planet Earth.
Well, that's kind of what the U.S. is eventually going to turn into.
A tourist attraction that no one attends
because of threats of terrorism by the government itself
and because of rampant schizophrenia in the streets.
Well, now that's your problem, Dave.
No, I think 60% of the children in a certain level of school
are on some sort of like behavior-oriented...
Turn in, drop out, baby.
That's what I'd do if I had...
I don't know if I had a chance.
And I'm not talking about out in Ashtabula.
Just drop it there?
God, it might not come back.
I mean, we just like sink into the snow.
Living in Ashtabula is not dropping out.
Wow, man.
Well, you can drop out while still living in Ashtabula, can't you?
Of course you can even drop out from dropping out
because you didn't end the cycle.
Yeah, yeah.
When you repent and quit your job and slack off,
well, sooner or later,
that becomes a job.
Take it from me, kids.
Right.
I mean, if you were to walk down the street naked every day,
wouldn't that soon become a job
and have no slack whatsoever?
The first day, think of how much slack there'd be
just to be walking down the street bare naked
to have people go and get the hell out of here, you know?
Well, the point is, when you're in a bag,
you've got to get out.
A bag?
Yeah, if you find yourself caught up in a bag,
then move.
Cut your way out of the bag.
We're out of a box,
but we're being...
I'm born again into different shapes in a bag.
No, you might just end up in another bag,
but at least it's a change.
Huh?
It's a change.
You might still end up in yet a bigger bag.
You get out of one trap and you're in a bigger trap.
You pull the wool there, wool off of your eyes,
but your own wool over your eyes.
What's the difference, you know?
Finally, when you begin pulling the pubic hair
over your own eyes,
is the truth finally revealed?
A falsified fact.
Fried in deep fat and kissed gingerly
with three or four maraschino churros.
You're grossing me out, Danny.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

No more free will.
No more free will.
No more free will.
No more free will.
That's the way to polka.
That's the way to polka.

No more free will.
That's the way to polka.
The Brand Flakes.
And now, more questions.
So are we officially at war now, or what?
All three of us?
Yeah, we're having a...
Are we there yet?
I don't think we were officially at war during Vietnam, Chaz.
Right.
No, I don't think we declare wars officially anymore.
Right.
We just send a whole lot of guys and they die and then...
Go on a police action.
Some politicians wave the flag and get some money suppository enemies.
I brought some speeches for you to read.
The first one is by Julius Caesar, and the second one is from Hermann Goering.
Because the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor,
for patriotism is indeed a double-edged sword.
It both emboldens the blood and boils the blood just as it narrows the mind.
And when the churns of war...
Drums, I'm sorry.
When the dorms of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind is closed,
the leader will have to need...
Wait.
Will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry.
Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and blinded by patriotism,
will offer up all of their rights unto the leader and gladly so.
How do I know?
Well, this is what I have done.
And I am Caesar.
And that was Julius Caesar.
Well, supposedly.
Oh, Julius Maximus, too, I think was involved in that one.
Yes, the Lemur posted found that wonderful quote.
See, it goes back a long ways, doesn't it, Stang?
The idea of the consummate Maximus, the dictator, as you were, as it was, as it is.
Well, here's a good one from Hermann Goering at the Nuremberg trials.
For of course the people don't want war.
But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy.
And it is always a simple matter to drag the people along.
Whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship.
Voice or no voice, the people can always be bought to the bidding of their leaders.
That is easy.
All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked
and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and expose the country to danger.
I care.
I care for a lozenge here, Goering.
Or as John Ashcroft said, to those who scare peace-loving people with phantoms of lost liberty,
my message is this, your tactics only aid terrorists,
for they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve.
That's right, Stang.
Any form of discarnate speech or any kind of enveloping or anything like that
causes a friction or a fractality in the nation's body politic.
We lose our unity as a mass.
What's the way our bowels lose their expression of will when the leader speaks?
His voice to us is like the voice of a huge proboscis,
ding-downing his quacking sound and his crying in the rain.
And you know what the horrible, horrible, horrible thing about all this
is at the same time that I get so, you know, like ticked off of the blatant power,
the blatant abuse.
The abuse of our powerlessness that we all kind of have to sit and watch.
At the same time, I find myself going,
gosh, I hope that our young soldiers can kill those soldiers before they kill our young soldiers.
I hope the sleepy orgasm guns put them all to sleep in a wanky humor.
The weird, you know, thoughts that you find yourself having.
Because I know a bunch of soldiers that, you know, they're not being sent out now,
but they're being trained to be sent out.
Young subgenius.
I know a bunch of rebels.
Soldiers.
I know rebel soldiers hiding in the mountains,
waiting for the day when they can pour out like ants onto your forehead.
And that's worrisome to me.
I know, it is worrisome.
That's the kind of thing that makes me think,
gosh, I hope we really do have super Death Star bombs
that our wise leaders haven't revealed yet
that we can suddenly just unsheathe and clobber everybody with.
I would like our...
Strike terror into the hearts of everybody
until terrorists, even in our own country,
destroy everything completely.
And then it's like Planet of the Apes, Road Warrior,
and it'd be cool, man.
It'd be totally cool.
You wouldn't have to know the word.
You'd just get up and either rape or pillage
or be raped or pillaged.
You know, it'd be simple.
You wouldn't have these...
Have you ever been raped and pillaged?
...worksheets you'd have to fill out.
No, they have workshops you have to attend,
and then you fill the worksheets out either.
It's got a data blank on it.
It's got a keep up...
It would be like in the movies, man.
...on the bottom of the margin.
They're trying to prepare us for it.
We are.
We are in the movie, Stag.
We are in the worst damn movie ever made.
A movie made by big oil petroleum consortiums
and strange people with lizard eyes.
Yes? Oh, yes.
You look so...
as if it's far-fetched.
No.
How far?
No, I was just thinking how...
Dick Gregory used to say that
Hollywood was always preparing you
for what's next.
Now, I don't think that Hollywood
necessarily does this in cahoots
with Hollywood.
Oh, they do.
Other than...
Yes, they do.
I don't know if they need to
because, you know,
they all have the same pollsters
and marketing experts.
They all share the same databases.
Since I was an old guy...
Well, it's not an old guy.
I remember reading it, actually.
I remember seeing it.
Years ago.
Remember Jack Valenti,
the motion picture industry guy?
I've met Jack Valenti, actually,
and shook his hand
when I was only 15 years old.
Did you shake his...
I was part of a CIA-sponsored
propaganda thing.
As a young filmmaker,
that's no baloney,
but as you're saying...
You just proved me your point right now.
Yes, Jack Valenti,
who is, in fact, yes,
one of what we would term them.
The mole.
Yeah.
The mole in the...
Well, I don't know.
Who's the mole with the CIA?
Hollywood is the mole.
The American motion picture
information agents.
Oh, wow.
What a wonderful title.
Information.
Would take my old stupid claymation film
I did when I was real young
and submitted it to the CIA.
to film festivals around the world.
I guess as...
It's about communism
and the evil it represents to mankind.
It was, you know,
only much later that I realized...
These are collective claymations.
There was something
completely else going on
that didn't have anything to do
with some stupid kid's claymation movies.
True.
True.
Yeah, yeah.
It was really funny.
You know, and of course,
that was far, far years,
thousands of years later.
Did you hear the new...
Layers of geological time.
Unimaginable.
Did you hear the new
in this geological era,
this Pleistocene magma,
magma minimum,
the new paranoia
about, like, say, Burning Man,
where you saw the, quote-unquote,
film crew come in there?
Remember the...
Yeah, let's play.
...very upscale film crew?
Yeah, yeah.
Now, I have heard...
The scary, the one that scared me.
The scary one.
I saw the devil.
Yes, I saw the devil.
Okay, I have heard other people
who have been to festivals
and have seen the same...
Well, they describe them
as much the same
and said they scared
the bejesus out home.
And they said they had
the strong feeling
that they were some kind
of government goons.
Really?
Well, that's what I heard.
I just got the impression
that these were some kind
of rich, decadent aristos
from some London, you know,
disco video world
that's beyond my realm
of showbiz, you know.
Yeah, that's what
they wanted you to think.
The idea was when they point
that camera at you,
you're being irrationally
irradiated at about
100 millisquads per squack.
I thought it was just the acid.
Well, the acid was squacking
at you too,
but that's from a different gene.
That's why I don't...
You know, when some rich guy
looks like the devil to me,
I don't take it real seriously.
I don't do anything about it,
you know.
It might creep me out
for a minute.
What have you done to his eyes?
There's people that think
I'm the rich devil guy.
When the bullet has
pierced your helmet.
What the...
You know, it's like...
Whoa!
This is the song you hear.
Here.
La, la, la, la, la.
Now, that depends
on what movie you're in.
Can you see Laura Bush
with the devil copulating
and George sitting by
waiting for the new spawn
to come out?
And Laura Bush walks up to you
in an angelic little outfit.
Two little slutty daughters
dressed.
Each one of them
is sucking on one of those
heart popsicles, you know.
And they have those
weird devil eyes.
Oh!
Texas is the spawning ground
of spate and...
Come sleep safe and warm with us.
Yes, Texas is heaven.
Crawl into the baby crib
with Grandma Bush
for a real treat.
Or a tweet.
Hi, hi, hi.
Your heart may belong to Jesus,
but your ass belongs to the core.
Your ass belongs to W.
I just heard somebody
on a Nostradamus program
say that either
Shaddam Hussein,
Osama bin Laden,
or somebody named W. Buss
was the antichrist.
They couldn't figure out
the last one.
You know, the other ones
it was so easy to get to
Osama bin Laden
and Shaddam Hussein,
but the one that said W. Buss,
they were like going,
who could that be?
What happened to that guy?
Yeah, what happened to
that bin Laden guy
and what was his name?
Goldstein, that other dude
we were supposed to hate.
It seems like they changed
the hate hour
every month or something.
So now.
Well, Goldstein started
another department store
and I guess Osama bin Laden
has a huge number of car lots
throughout the Midwest now.
Oh, really?
Oh, yeah.
Starting in Detroit,
he started with his empire
and worked his way
through central Michigan
and now he's everywhere.
Is he in competition
with the Noriega car lots?
The Noriega car lots
have not been panning out
too well over the last
three or four years.
Oh, those come out of Bogota.
Yeah, they're going under.
Now, a lot of the worried
subgeniuses have been saying,
what country should I move to?
Right.
That's a good question.
Coast Belize and Costa Rica
come up a lot.
I've been suggesting Russia.
I've heard since...
It's silly over there now.
It's nuts over there.
It's a complete free-for-all.
If you've got any money...
You can get anything you want.
You can get anything.
You can live like
Roman Polanski and Jack Nicholson.
That's really decadent
and weird now there.
Yes, that's...
There's a great book
called Exile
about American expatriates
in Russia.
Making their own
little communities
along the river Don,
the river Dnipro,
and the river Volga.
Resting quietly
in the fading sunshine
before the winter comes
and they freeze
their American...
That's what you get
to think about
for another...
Happy Americans in Russia?
Weak.
Depatriated?
I thought...
See, I first thought
depatriation was something
you had to do
at a doctor's office.
Like, they remove
the folds from your butt.
Right, and then you
would never get
the folds again.
Right.
So, like, if your ass
was too big,
you just go get depatriated
and you're like
a GQ guy.
You know, next thing you know
the women in a
Beechwood mall
are, like, sneering at you
and stuff.
The ones that have lips.
That's for the others, Dave.
That's not for those like us
who wear the bracelet.
The secret...
The secret bracelet.
Oh, I saw those
advertised on TV
late at night.
The secret bracelet?
Yeah.
I noticed Bush was wearing
one the other night
along with a decoder ring
and we don't even get
one of those special
decoder rings.
He could just, like,
whip it up there and go,
General Franks.
No, they're like
some kind of healing thing
or something, I guess.
They say Kennedy
was so horny
he would
run off and leave
the football.
You know, the briefcase
with the go-codes
and the box.
Yeah.
And be, you know,
Mr. President,
we've got to get you
to the ball.
Uh-huh.
Mr. President.
I'll be with you
in just a moment, boys.
Till next week.
Yeah.
I just, yeah,
wanted to come out
and give her a hat
to ask what you do.
Keep your sack
in the saddle
if you want to.
Keep your hat
untied if you want to.
Throw it away.
I don't give a damn.
Keep your hat
untied.
Your back,
your back to the wind.
Oh, yeah, that was
one of them.
Yeah, it's important.
What do I care?
Was, was
watch your ass
one of those?
Invert.
Watch your ass.
Watch your ass.
Invert.
Invert.
Watch your ass.
Wash your,
and oil your saddle.
And make sure
those feet are oiled
too, the way Jesus
liked to oil his ass.
Keep your back
to the wind.
Spit.
And so the Christ
was woven
from memory
of own
testicles
and the world

in the sad
formal book
that he could
heal
in a minute.
Oh, God.
What do we learn
to get back
as a guy?
Take me home
you silly boy
cause I'm still
in love
with you.
peace
