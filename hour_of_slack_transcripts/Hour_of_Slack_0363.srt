1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
I'm afraid here it is.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,280
We're being aware of it.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:11,180
And now, the Self Genius Hour of Slack!

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,500
I think that we're both confused now.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,720
And we're saying we need to know what's going on.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,860
We're both crazy and it's great.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,440
It's great.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,740
Yeah, baby, give me a call.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,140
I'll take care of that problem.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,620
God bless you.

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,620
While this song is blasting, let me take the echo down.

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,040
You can come over here and share this mic.

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,120
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,840
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Psychopath Finder,

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,160
I'd like you to meet the Reverend Ivan Stang.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,980
Oh, my God.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,420
My Lord.

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,720
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, I've been listening to your show for minutes.

19
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,340
Minutes and minutes.

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,700
I've been...

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,900
That's one of our tens of fans.

22
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,460
You were talking about my dad, Arnold Stang.

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,380
Yes, he was the original Chunky Man.

24
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,260
No, wasn't he?

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,860
No, no, why did you...

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,220
We're so slow to acknowledge the fact that you're...

27
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,120
He was the original.

28
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,940
Some of his work.

29
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,180
Well, some of his work, I think, was monumental

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,640
as far as the delivery was concerned.

31
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,220
We like to remember him best with...

32
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,780
Hercules in New York.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,540
With Arnold Schwarzenegger.

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,900
The two Arnolds, the great...

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,060
The great...

36
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,700
Oh, it feels so good to be back on the air.

37
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,160
I just don't feel real unless...

38
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,760
But where are the headphones?

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,860
I feel like I'm naked.

40
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,600
Oh, there's some.

41
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,500
I'll grab these.

42
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,560
Then I'll know...

43
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,280
Can you say Chunky Choo-a-click?

44
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,540
Oh, that's so much better.

45
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,020
Oh, I feel the power now.

46
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,200
It's a form of...

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,800
It's a kind of power that leaves you very quickly, though.

48
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,280
I'm afraid a lot of people have to resort...

49
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,400
To unusual, like, baths and ointments.

50
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,060
You must do one thing.

51
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,660
Oh, keep rubbing those ointments on.

52
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,260
Oh, that feels so good.

53
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,140
Okay, you can't do...

54
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,360
Well, you guys, this isn't great.

55
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,580
This station is so much...

56
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:08,860
You can't do it too much.

57
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,340
I'll let you...

58
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:09,600
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,320
They don't...

60
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,680
They don't...

61
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,960
They don't take such good care of us...

62
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,740
Do we know...

63
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,760
...at the Dallas station.

64
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,820
Well, I...

65
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,640
They attribute at least...

66
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,820
We don't get the ointments.

67
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,680
For one moment, to the mighty breaths of the Salvador Dali partner...

68
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,860
I thought it was spa time again.

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,500
Jays, it's time for your final slogan...

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,340
The weather man...

71
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,800
Something...

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,240
Something...

73
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,220
Something...

74
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,280
Something...

75
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,420
material?

76
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,040
Alas.

77
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,600
What in the world?

78
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,900
D governo مس� makes him an oasis of death?

79
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:51,900


80
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,060
Goodbye.

81
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,060


82
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,420
I was on my cult team...

83
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:52,940
I was on my cultиля goline...

84
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,060
M stream.

85
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,060


86
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,060


87
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,680
I see.

88
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:54,680


89
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:54,980
You're gonna stay?

90
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,740
I'll be...

91
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,140
Okay.

92
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,360
All right.

93
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,780
You wouldn't play dumb there if it's the smart bar, right?

94
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,060
Well, it won't be called the smart bar when we're through with it.

95
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,800
What's it going to be called?

96
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,460
I don't know, but we'll take any brain cells that were available,

97
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,460
any extra brain cells, the ones you don't need.

98
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,800
Friends, if you come to the smart bar, you'll leave so stupid and so, so happy.

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,040
You will have slack.

100
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,140
You'll have slack just running down your pants leg.

101
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,460
It's such a lovely, lovely thing.

102
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,460
To have that love snot.

103
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,660
Hi.

104
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,700
You can't say love snot.

105
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,560
It's not midnight yet, is it?

106
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,220
What?

107
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:31,820
Hello?

108
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,220
What kind of a station is this?

109
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,120
I'm going to call the SEC right now.

110
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,240
What type of station is this?

111
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,060
I'll take a look.

112
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,760
You talk, you're on the air with Reverend Ivan Stang, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

113
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,200
and a room full of people.

114
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,140
We have a cast of zillions.

115
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,560
Did you check out the retinue that accompanied me into this station?

116
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,900
I got a question, Reverend.

117
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,100
The wives of Bob who are here?

118
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,060
The wives of Bob?

119
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,380
Yes, including Sister Mary Squarely.

120
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,080
I could tell by the way they were emanating, you know, that halo thing?

121
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,180
Because I never saw that before.

122
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,720
And the little black patch that appears over their eyes as if by magic.

123
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,000
My retinues were damaged through dark abuse.

124
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,480
What is the meaning of slack as to by when whom by them?

125
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,960
Because many don't know, because there are a lot of 12 year olds who, uh,

126
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,680
we have many 12 year olds.

127
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,480
Yeah, they're...

128
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,500
And they need to be told.

129
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,500
And demographically and vision power.

130
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,700
People have lied to them about slack.

131
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,780
They've said slack is working for a living.

132
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,960
Uh, they've said slack is being responsible citizen.

133
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,180
Obviously, you know, I mean, in our school system today,

134
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,020
that they would teach the children things like that.

135
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,900
Slack, those who know don't say, and those who say don't know.

136
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,460
You know that.

137
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,200
We shouldn't even be talking about it.

138
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,340
Well, we have to preach the message of slack now.

139
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,580
Even though the nuns know.

140
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,280
The nuns know slack.

141
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,520
Know slack.

142
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,600
None for me.

143
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,360
No slack.

144
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,000
None for me.

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,480
Yes, just say no to slack.

146
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,300
Go ahead, do what the conspiracy of the normal people says.

147
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,520
Just say no to slack.

148
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,840
That's what they want you to...

149
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,320
That's not...

150
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,340
I mean, they are not just telling you to say no to drugs.

151
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,560
They're telling you to say no to things that I'm not allowed to say on the radio.

152
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,000
Frextits.

153
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,960
Yeah, for instance...

154
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,580
Thought control.

155
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,020
Frextits.

156
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,140
Forensics.

157
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,500
Forensics.

158
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:37,800
Forensics slack investigations reveal that when J.R. Bob Dobbs was shot and, well, they

159
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,300
like to say killed, that what ran out of those head wounds was pure slack, not blood.

160
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,060
And it was bottled by the greedy vampires there on the stage.

161
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,180
And we have bought those little vials of Bob's blood for sale.

162
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:00,340
Ah, yes, if you'll just send us your love offering, we'll send you back a tiny vial of

163
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:11,080
the blood of J.R. Bob Dobbs, a proven aphrodisiac, and Hurricane Bob water, and JFK brain parts.

164
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,020
There's a Hurricane Bob water?

165
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,580
Talk about your head launchings, man.

166
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,520
That was quite a splattage, but what is Hurricane water, the holy water of Bob?

167
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,420
Hurricane Bob?

168
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:22,760
Yes.

169
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,040
Hurricane Bob water.

170
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,320
You know, there were two Hurricane Bobs this decade.

171
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:34,100
Hurricane Bob, when Bob voids his water, it can become a vast maelstrom, a vortex of...

172
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,460
That was the voice of the Magma Lin.

173
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,800
What those hurricanes was Bob was, uh, disflatting himself.

174
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,380
He was flatulat- pyroflatulating, we call it, like Mount St. Helens.

175
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,080
There's pyroflatulat-

176
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,160
The pyroflatulation of Bob.

177
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,420
Uh, and or, and or, you never know about Connie, though.

178
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,640
She's more ladylike.

179
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,060
I mean...

180
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,580
Hers are more like the mud springs that, in the Hawaiian Islands, you know, just kind of blurping.

181
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:00,920
Oh.

182
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,880
Oh, ain't that so true.

183
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,400
Who is that singing?

184
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:15,940
I think it's Doris Day with a herniated thing, or, no, it's, um, Plasmy, uh, Claudine Lange, doing her True Colors.

185
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,740
Colors.

186
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,560
Her...

187
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,360
Spelled with a U.

188
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,580
Oh, that's her Colostomy Bag album, right?

189
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,120
That's the one.

190
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,680
That's the one that got her banned in Brazil and four or five other countries with, uh, hard to pronounce names.

191
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,280
You know, have you heard the rumors about Frank Sinatra and the Colostomy Bag?

192
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,800
Well, I, I, one was alluded to, uh, but I didn't, what did you hear?

193
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,080
That's what I heard, and you don't, I mean...

194
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,260
Right. When you're talking about the man, you know...

195
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,160
Yeah, let's not, uh, well, you don't want to do an Albert Goldman on him, and, you know...

196
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,100
Yeah, you could find a horse in your shopping cart or something. Or, no.

197
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
That's right. That's exactly right.

198
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,080
I would not spread any rumors about Frank Sinatra unless I was completely, completely...

199
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,760
I have something in my throat.

200
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,380
Oh, here, let me get it.

201
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,660
Oh!

202
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,900
Oh, went.

203
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,480
Boy, there's a bunch of them. Look at that. They're like little pearls on a string.

204
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,800
Keep, keep moving it.

205
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,640
Hey, I bet that feels good, doesn't it?

206
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,140
Uh, it felt better, I think.

207
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,460
Oh, there's the last one. Oh, it had a little fish hook on it.

208
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,560
What is that squirming thing at the end of it?

209
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,020
I was floundering on Long Island in the spring, uh, this, uh, yesterday.

210
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,440
Let's cook it up, man.

211
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,460
Okay, uh, if you're ready.

212
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,820
Oh, okay.

213
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,300
Let's cook it up.

214
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,620
Now, that's real home, home style down, home style. That's a meal in one, I think, isn't it? Or three?

215
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,720
Now I feel like I need to clear my throat.

216
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,360
Oh, uh, what?

217
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,320
No, I've got one, too.

218
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,760
Oh, Christ almighty, that thing is pink. What the...

219
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,620
It's glowing.

220
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,100
Kill it! Kill it!

221
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,080
How did, how did you drive here? What way did you take to get here?

222
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,840
Oh, we went through the flats.

223
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,840
Yeah, well, that explains that thing. It's burning a hole in the floor. Somebody put some water on this thing.

224
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,500
Oh, that won't, that won't stop. It'll burn its way through a spaceship hole.

225
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:15,640
There it goes.

226
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,640
Yeah.

227
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,100
Yeah.

228
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,280
And if you go to the Smart Bar, you can have these things burst out of your chest, too.

229
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,260
And some of them may land there and never come out.

230
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,020
That's the best kind, the ones that you can keep as little pets deep inside you.

231
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,920
They speak to you late at night when no one else can hear them.

232
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,320
Little tiny cerebral sea monkeys that lodge in your notochord, I think.

233
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,020
Like a little family living in your stomach.

234
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,040
Well...

235
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,900
Did you ever buy sea monkeys? Did you ever order sea monkeys?

236
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:58,460
No, I captured some and enslaved them once at a house somewhere south of here, but there was an ongoing investigation.

237
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,720
I remember them well, though. They smiled at me. They were happy. They were...

238
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
I loved them. I did love them. That's why I had to do what I had to do.

239
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:12,500
I, I can't... I don't know how to love. I, I, I don't know how.

240
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,340
If you are a victim of...

241
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,780
Codependency on sea monkey...

242
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:19,840
Sex...

243
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:27,020
Please call 823-749-0567-1974...

244
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,420
...

245
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:40,640
Now, that's the apocalypse number. Now, if you want the regular 800 number, just hang around by the dumpster for a few more hours.

246
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,700
Some of you have been there for a while.

247
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,540
Okay, nothing's changed yet.

248
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,940
I can't wait for a signal.

249
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,680
Okay.

250
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,380
I remember this song. God, that was a great band.

251
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,000
Was that brain cancer?

252
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:01,620
I think it was brain cancer. That was when they, uh, the, the, the lizard women were slashing their wrists.

253
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:08,120
It was like a group of four or five people, and they dedicated themselves to jump off that precipice and do that for, for...

254
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,840
There was no reason. There was no reason. It was senseless.

255
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,300
Is that what they used to call cock rock, or was that glitter rock?

256
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,620
That was glitter clock...

257
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:15,980
...clock rock.

258
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,420
Glitter clock rock. It was elliptical. You know, I mean, I don't...

259
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,940
It was, man. That was, uh, I was elliptical. I was at one of their concerts.

260
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,800
I kept coming back.

261
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,520
Yeah.

262
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,320
Or going around and around, or something. Yeah, I got, but after a while, the one guy...

263
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,860
...

264
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,880
The, the one feller, I think he died of a heroin overdose, or heroin, heroin, uh, something.

265
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,180
Yeah, it's a shame, people, in our...

266
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,280
...in our...

267
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:50,060
...in our great land feel the need for those sorts of false slack.

268
00:11:50,920 --> 00:12:09,720
Those taking them laughers and screamers, popping them vomit ultrasauruses and little P-dog pills and anti-P-dog pills, which are called, uh, uh, bladder control pad tat tablets.

269
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,400
It's a sad thing.

270
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,100
And, you know...

271
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,700
...they need slack. They need slack. And they can get slack.

272
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,580
Well, here's some slack that they can get.

273
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,780
Hey! Where'd that voice come from?

274
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,600
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

275
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,800
Magical world of radio.

276
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,380
Oh! We've got someone in the studio over there.

277
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,100
Okay. Uh, no, the slack that the public can get tonight, immediately...

278
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,740
...is probably not.

279
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,880
...will be giving away a pair of tickets to the rant and rave at the Smart Bar...

280
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,060
...this coming Saturday...

281
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,200
No, that wasn't...

282
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,400
...the third.

283
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,620
It was...

284
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,180
One pair.

285
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,520
It was actually many, many Saturdays ago.

286
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,720
The Smart Bar is in another city where you can't go.

287
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:00,340
What do these girls have to do to qualify for these special rave tickets for the Smart Bar show Saturday night?

288
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,340
The subgenius revival of the Smart Bar...

289
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,040
...in Cleveland several months ago.

290
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,420
Find a payphone.

291
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,260
Find a payphone.

292
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,440
Find a payphone.

293
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,900
Find a payphone.

294
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,000
Find a payphone.

295
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,200
It's about a coinciding...

296
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,080
Inciding .

297
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,120
Inciding .

298
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,000
Inciding .

299
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,680
Inciding .

300
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,860
These guys in the studio. I tell you. They are clever.

301
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,040
How do they do that?

302
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,800
That's amazing!

303
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,380
Amazing!

304
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,340
It's amazing the way they move the echo tunnel in and out of this little room and...

305
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,020
...put it around our heads and then they...

306
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,820
Move the space.

307
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,360
Move the space.

308
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,820
Oh, come on!

309
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,300
That one got my eardrum.

310
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,160
They pulled it right through the headphones.

311
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,800
And that's what we try to do to you, dear reflection.

312
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:38,980
And that's what we try to do to you, dear reflection.

313
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,460
Uh-oh, I think we did it.

314
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,660
We were just kidding, man.

315
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,820
Don't call the cops.

316
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,260
We didn't really do that to you, dear.

317
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,440
We wouldn't, you know, we wouldn't want to tear your brain in half.

318
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,340
Not a lot.

319
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,320
Unless you wanted us to.

320
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,880
We'd tear it a little bit.

321
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,300
And I think...

322
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,680
We can blend it up.

323
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,420
We can...

324
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,480
And Connie is so good with a blender.

325
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,540
We can put it on liquefy.

326
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:16,000
And we could just liquefy those little tiny pieces of blended flesh.

327
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,960
Right on up.

328
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,000
Oh, I'm just wicked with a blender.

329
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,180
I bet some of you, boy, and some of you gals,

330
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,320
all some of you furry squids would love to come and take a ride

331
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,740
in Connie's special electronic blender.

332
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,140
At that amazing...

333
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,160
Nice show.

334
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,020
Connie, show them how your blender works.

335
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,620
Do we want to see?

336
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,800
Yeah, we want to see.

337
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,960
The special effects are cheap on that.

338
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,600
Let's see the blender.

339
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,300
Come on.

340
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:57,580
Well, you see, Reverend, you kind of push the liquefy button and...

341
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,720
Ooh, I say do that again.

342
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,260
That looks like some sort of percussion instrument.

343
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,440
And it gets...

344
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,560
Sure is.

345
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,640
Ooh, it's doing it now.

346
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,700
Oh, man.

347
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,720
Can I watch this on the radio?

348
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,180
I don't know.

349
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,200
You have to.

350
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,280
I have to.

351
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,280
Recommended for mature audiences only.

00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,900
And you, you two can actually come and see in real live person.

355
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,520
What?

356
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,420
The Vistas of Loveliness right in front of me now.

357
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,960
Princess We Are Doe, queen of all the UFOs.

358
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,140
Sister Mary Squared, au contraire.

359
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:55,640
These wives of Bob will have you men clutching your scrotum in terror.

360
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,680
Why?

361
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,180
Well, I'll be...

362
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,340
There they go again.

363
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,880
Where am I? Thank you, Reverend Stagg.

364
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,340
Why?

365
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:07,520
Why?

366
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,460
I'll wind them up and they think for themselves.

367
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,940
And watch out, boys.

368
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,620
Here they come.

369
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,120
Tell me I'm pretty.

370
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,940
Oh, I want to holler that the town's too small.

371
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,400
Yeah.

372
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,480
Thank you, sister.

373
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,280
Thank you.

374
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,800
Thank you, sister.

375
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,440
Dancing men.

376
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,280
Live dancing men.

377
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,680
Dancing men.

378
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,760
Big dancing men.

379
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,720
And great big drinks.

380
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,420
You know what?

381
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,780
It's great being a subgenius preacher.

382
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,060
You get to preach to a big room full of sinners that are all drunk.

383
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,840
Now, you know, some of these more regular preachers, that's too much of a challenge for them.

384
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,160
They'd rather go to a...

385
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,360
Sure.

386
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,340
It's...

387
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,020
They'd rather have a smelly tent.

388
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,940
They can't...

389
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,040
They can't language.

390
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,240
They can't talk the language of a...

391
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,540
of a drunken, obliterated...

392
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:00,880
Sinner.

393
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,320
Sinner.

394
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:01,680
Oh.

395
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,000
They...

396
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,260
They can't reach them.

397
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:03,680
They...

398
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,160
They try.

399
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:04,840
They...

400
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,920
They go into the void, but they...

401
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,120
They can't come back out.

402
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,620
They can't get a response.

403
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,260
That's...

404
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,720
That's right.

405
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,640
They don't talk the sinner's language, because they ain't sinning enough.

406
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,620
No, they ain't.

407
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,700
And I don't care what...

408
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,560
how much of a sinner you think you are.

409
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,980
You could sin more.

410
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,580
You could sin more if you only knew how, right?

411
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,320
You've got...

412
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,200
Sinning and grinning and sinning and grinning away.

413
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,720
That's what we mean here.

414
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,040
You've got the excuse.

415
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,040
Bob is the excuse.

416
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,340
Now all you need is a few new ideas for sins you haven't tried yet.

417
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:36,900
Yeah.

418
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,680
Let's think of a few sins that we haven't done recently.

419
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,940
How about appendix puffling?

420
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,160
When was the last time you puffled your appendix?

421
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,380
Well, come to the Smart Bar and you'll not only find out how, you'll probably see hands-on demonstration.

422
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:53,860


423
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,580
You can marry...

424
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:54,960
That's right.

425
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,140
You can marry your appendix.

426
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,200
And then puffle it.

427
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,200
And if you have qualms religiously...

428
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,200


429
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,460
Tipple your cross...

430
00:17:59,460 --> 00:17:59,960
Cross...

431
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,820
Are you hung up with religious qualms about puffling your appendix before marriage?

432
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,920
You can get married Saturday night for a 24-hour period.

433
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,120
Yes, a mass...

434
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,140
But Reverend Stagg.

435
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,640
Short-duration marriage.

436
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,800
But Reverend Stagg.

437
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,620
Yes.

438
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,520
Yes, my child.

439
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,240
Why would we need a short-duration marriage when we have the almighty excuse in Bob?

440
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,780
Why would we need a short-duration marriage?

441
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,260
We can just go on sinning and sinning and sinning and sinning.

442
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,740
We don't need no marriage.

443
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:36,800
Because you want the certificate to show at the office the next day and go, you would not believe it.

444
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,080
You wouldn't believe what I did this weekend.

445
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,360
He's my friend.

446
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,800
If I told you what I saw Saturday night at the Smart Bar, you wouldn't even believe me.

447
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,040
You wouldn't even believe me.

448
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,400
That's what you'll be able to tell your friends Monday morning.

449
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:53,640
And besides, Reverend Stagg, it'll be their only chance to marry me and Bob.

450
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,800
At the same time.

451
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,900
And I want you all the way to number 666.

452
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,020
Oh!

453
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,760
Oh!

454
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,780
I'm all alone.

455
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:06,780


456
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:06,780


457
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,560
I'm all tired.

458
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,240
Let he who has wisdom know.

459
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,460
I'd like to remind you beings that you're listening to WC in Cleveland.

460
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,120
That's 89.7 FM.

461
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,360
And it's a radio station.

462
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,220
And it hurts your ears as much as it can.

463
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,960
And, you know, depending.

464
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:45,560
We don't want to get into any sort of insurance problems with FCC and the Federal Bureau of Demonology.

465
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,120
Seen here in slide number 7.

466
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,500
It's puzzling evidence.

467
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,720
Oh!

468
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,400
Oh!

469
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,800
I almost forgot.

470
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,740
We can't show that one on the airwaves like this.

471
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,220
Oh!

472
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:08,870
That one.

473
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,870


474
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,870


475
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,870


476
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,870


477
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,870


478
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,870


479
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,830
You don't have anything like this all night long.

480
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,710
You know that show goes from 6 o'clock in the evening to 6 o'clock in the morning.

481
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,890
12 hours of sinning, sinning, sinning.

482
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,150
Freed.

483
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,310
Freed.

484
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,090
Freed.

485
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:26,310
Freed.

486
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,510
Hell.

487
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,150
Hell.

488
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:27,550
Hell.

489
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,670
And the Gym.

490
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:29,570
Hell.

491
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:30,130


492
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:30,510
Hell.

493
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:30,510


494
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:31,430
Hell.

495
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,910
Steven Stan.

496
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,730
I'm an angel.

497
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,190
Hair, breathe.

498
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,210
Hair, breathe.

499
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:34,710
Whoa.

500
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,010
Yeah, I just wanted to say hello to Dan and the self-conscious rules.

501
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,790
The self-conscious rules?

502
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,930
Self-conscious does rule.

503
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,570
Rule number one, do not endlessly intone the rules.

504
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,110
Rule number two, do not endlessly intone the rules.

505
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,330
Rule number three, this is production control.

506
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,350
Could you lower the music a little bit, please?

507
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,910
Thank you.

508
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,430
Oh, thank you, production control.

509
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,870
You're tuned to WCSU.

510
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:02,990
No, you're not.

511
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,470
You're tuned to KFM 3 FM in Dallas, Texas.

512
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:13,750
Dear friends, and I suppose I probably should cut in and tell you what's going on here.

513
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:24,590
Several months ago, just before we did the first Rant and Rave show in Cleveland,

514
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,690
I was lucky enough to be a guest on Lonesome Cow.

515
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:37,130
The Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Scabby and Psychopath Finder show on WCSB in Cleveland.

516
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,270
It's a wonderful show, obviously.

517
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:52,130
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and I really hit it off in that spouting manner.

518
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,210
And I just got back from doing the second Rant and Rave show in Cleveland.

519
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,590
It was a beautiful thing.

520
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,470
And those wives of Bob were indeed a-preaching.

521
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:11,750
Sister Mary Squared, Princess Wee, and Sister Melodious Chops, not to mention Miss Communication.

522
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,330
Man, it's a different world up there in the Cleveland land.

523
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,330
And Pope Sterno Docks was part of that show.

524
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:26,210
And we hope to be bringing you some edited tapes from the special parts of those shows.

525
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,570
Those live subtenues, devivals.

526
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:40,330
In forthcoming Hour of Slack shows, you are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack,

527
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,470
voice of the Church of the Subgenius.

528
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,750
I'm your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

529
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:53,370
And if you've never tuned in to an Hour of Slack show before,

530
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,070
I should point out that they're all different.

531
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,670
Well, every now and then, they're the same.

532
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,290
But for the most part, they're all different.

533
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,310
And this one's all different.

534
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:07,510
This is one of my favorite tape moments.

535
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:13,610
And it's 90 minutes long, so we won't even begin to get to the end of it, dear friends.

536
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:19,790
But if you do have a further interest in the Church,

537
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:26,850
and want to know just the, well, the highly organized and linear background

538
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,770
to the rather unlinear...

539
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,850
spouting that you're hearing,

540
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:35,490
you can always write for free information on the other activities of our mighty Church.

541
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,270
I'm going to give that post office box number.

542
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,670
I just got a call from somebody who sounded like they listened to the show all the time

543
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,730
and still didn't have that post office box number.

544
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,690
So obviously, we cannot say it enough.

545
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,230
And too much is always better than not enough.

546
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:58,530
And that number to write is post office box 140306.

547
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,990
In Dallas, Texas, 75214.

548
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:08,370
Once again, that's box 140306.

549
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:14,370
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

550
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:19,330
And we would be glad to let you know what's going on.

551
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:25,790
I will admit that the show, the amazing show that we constantly refer to on this tape,

552
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,050
actually happened in...

553
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,950
Cleveland many months ago.

554
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,730
And it's way too late for you, but...

555
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,530
Well, we did videotape it.

556
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,810
And there's always the...

557
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,190
Well, you could go buy...

558
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,590
Well, I can't...

559
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,830
I can't tell you what all you could go do,

560
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,650
because this is a public-supported radio station.

561
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:51,990
I cannot advertise our other materials and products,

562
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,850
and just how easy they might be to find,

563
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,690
where you too actually poke around.

564
00:24:59,470 --> 00:24:59,950
So...

565
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,490
So what the heck, man?

566
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,230
So what the heck, man?

567
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,930
Production control at the smart bar.

568
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,290
Brian, you didn't have to turn it off just the moment.

569
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,130
So you, production control, you think you have control?

570
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,650
So you, just who has control?

571
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:28,510
So you, just who has control?

572
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:28,870
This is amazing.

573
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,930
We have a production control tonight.

574
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,770
It is not unprecedented, but...

575
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,270
I've never experienced production control.

576
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,450
That's where they clean up the sound.

577
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,010
You can actually understand what the personality is saying.

578
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,030
No, it's the other way around.

579
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,870
Oh, oh, oh, well, that's the kind of...

580
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:48,750
That's the kind we take.

581
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,130
You know, as Reverend Ron,

582
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,510
who's the sound maniac whiz on Saturday Night Show...

583
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,570
Oh, Reverend Ron.

584
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,330
He said,

585
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:58,970
He said,

586
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,630
Three can kill an elephant.

587
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,750
I can take five.

588
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,670
I don't know what he was talking about,

589
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,630
but you too can find out May 23rd.

590
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,570
That's 523 for you distorting.

591
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,650
At the smart bar.

592
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,870
And oh, it's so cheap, too.

593
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:18,810
It is.

594
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,650
It's cheap.

595
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,790
It's cheap.

596
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,430
It's down.

597
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,910
We can't tell you how much,

598
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,710
but it's eternal salvation or triple your money back.

599
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,330
Well, yes, we can't do it.

600
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,830
It's on your absolute...

601
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,930
Well, there's a fine line between...

602
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,270
That's one of the collars.

603
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,390
Now, see, they won't allow me to take collars

604
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,170
on the Hour of Slack show in Dallas

605
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:52,230
because we get these kids, you know, calling up.

606
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,510
We don't have any delay.

607
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,090
There's no seven-second delay.

608
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,470
I'm sure there isn't here either.

609
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,350
The kids who move, they move from Dallas.

610
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,870
They move from Dallas up here to harass us.

611
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,130
Oh, okay.

612
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,130
Oh, that's where those collars are.

613
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,610
They're not even in your town anymore.

614
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,070
They're just up and gone.

615
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,450
Well, did they come with a little collar flushing device?

616
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,550
You can't, you know...

617
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,030
I don't know.

618
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,530
Well, let's see.

619
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,530
Start pushing buttons,

620
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:19,230
and when you hear the screams of them disappearing into the vortex,

621
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,610
then you know you've treated the collars

622
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,170
just the way they really deserve

623
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,790
and in a way they want to be treated that way.

624
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,150
They look to us for leadership,

625
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:28,110
oral,

626
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,010
leadership.

627
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,930
That's A-U-R-A-L.

628
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:35,950
They like to be kicked and kicked and kicked and hit all over again.

629
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,550
I say, do that again.

630
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,650
Oh, honest.

631
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,110
Oh, Lord, thank you.

632
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,410
How could I become a reference?

633
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:44,850
Let's see, kid.

634
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,990
Are we able to give the price amount of a love offering?

635
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:48,710
No.

636
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,790
Why, my friend?

637
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,950
20,000 leagues under the sea.

638
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,250
You can give the address for information.

639
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,870
I can give the address for free information

640
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,530
on the Church of the Subgenius

641
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,510
and how to become a minister.

642
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,050
I can even give you a card.

643
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,450
With your little membership card

644
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,650
and your four giant issues of the Stark Fist of Removal

645
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,070
X-triple-double-X-rated magazine.

646
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,350
And that post office box number is,

647
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,430
got your pencil ready?

648
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,450
I bet you do.

649
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,470
Just, just write to Bob.

650
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,230
That's B-O-B.

651
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,370
You got it? B-O-B, Bob, B-B-Bob

652
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,970
at post office box

653
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:25,350
1-4-0-3-0-6

654
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,390
in lovely Dallas, Texas.

655
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:28,510
1-4-0-3-0-6 in lovely Dallas, Texas.

656
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:32,370
7-5-2-1-4.

657
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,170
Ah, yes.

658
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,670
Once again, now that's box 1-4-0-3-0-6.

659
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:37,650
Dallas, Texas.

660
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,790
7-5-2-1-4.

661
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,430
And I'd like to remind you all

662
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:48,770
that you are listening to E-M-O-B-S-O-R-E-A-R-N-W-C-O-S-E-R-E-A-R-N-O-C-R-E-A.

663
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,530
The most immediate way to see Bob

664
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,950
is to take a hammer,

665
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,250
a common, everyday hammer,

666
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,250
wrap, don't be silly about this,

667
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,310
wrap it up, wrap a cloth around it

668
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,590
so it's sort of blunt,

669
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,330
so it can't actually crack your skull

670
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,470
and tap yourself with some force

671
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,150
squarely in the center of the forehead.

672
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,830
You will see Bob,

673
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,510
although you may not be able to understand

674
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,870
what he's trying to tell you,

675
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,950
much less reach into your wallet

676
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,850
for the payment for the non-slap to go away.

677
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,170
Now, Rev Boy, I've heard that

678
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,010
many of your Zen boobages

679
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,870
had worn accoutrements like that

680
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,250
around their neck and had slapped themselves

681
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,490
to attain satori.

682
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,990
Now, what particular state

683
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,710
would a person attain to,

684
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,370
you know, climbing the pyramid, so to speak,

685
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,590
upon seeing Bob?

686
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,410
Would it be like a nirvanic state of bliss?

687
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,530
It would be what we call

688
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,290
control.

689
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,250
Contracted consciousnessnessnessnessness.

690
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:44,930
Miss? Miss?

691
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,250
Contracted consciousnessness,

692
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,710
which we're practicing right now.

693
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,750
We squeeze the brain

694
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,690
and get rid of the excess brain cells,

695
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,250
which caused people originally

696
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,450
to be able to do math

697
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,010
and other boring, tedious things,

698
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,210
jobs and so forth.

699
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,870
And we give the brain cells back.

700
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,530
Now, don't get me wrong,

701
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,830
we give them back after we clean them.

702
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,570
We wash them.

703
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:10,270
It's called brain watching, actually.

704
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:17,790
We watch the cells grow, and we put them back in, and they work very differently after that point.

705
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:25,710
You can, why, I've gone back to the clinic again and again and again, and you will too.

706
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:33,190
Could I say, for instance, jog or maybe do my laundry while I was in this contracted state of unconsciousness?

707
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,750
That's the best way to do your laundry.

708
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:35,650
Yeah.

709
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,190
Jogging, you know, it depends.

710
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:38,890
Hire clean air.

711
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,230
Jogging, it depends.

712
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:48,530
Yeah, it depends, or any of the other good control pads, or you can work with those.

713
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:55,190
That is to say, if you were, like, running on a pair of control pods or some sort of other device like that, if you,

714
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,790
oh, I'm sorry, I lost my train of contracted consciousness.

715
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,290
That's the idea.

716
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:04,190
Well, I'm starting to begin to understand, I think, a little bit morally more about this.

717
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:04,970
Oh, that's a bad sign.

718
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,230
That's a bad sign.

719
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:06,870
No, you.

720
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,910
Okay, it's a bad sign.

721
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:07,990
Okay.

722
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,910
Put the pads on your feet.

723
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:10,330
All right.

724
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,210
Okay, now you're ready to slide.

725
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:13,990
That's the way we do it.

726
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,450
You slide.

727
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,750
I'm afraid, though.

728
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,090
With the pads on your feet.

729
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,850
No, no, well, we'll go out to a country road or someplace to start with.

730
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,110
You don't want to do it next to traffic.

731
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,270
That's what I'm saying.

732
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:27,110
If you do it next to traffic, it will hurt you.

733
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:36,950
But if you make fun of, though, also, I mean, you know, what sort of protection as, you know, a spiritual amulet or some sort of totem could provide.

734
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,030
It will.

735
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:41,510
And I appreciate that fact that God gave me.

736
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,130
God would that for me.

737
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:42,130


738
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:42,130


739
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:42,130


740
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:42,130


741
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,290
Now I'll be not what it comes to.

742
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:43,690
Sir, tell me, what's wrong with your eyes?

743
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:43,690


744
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,930
Well, it was a wok if you liked the video, excellent for that.

745
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,530
For example, if I really like my life, I'll disspeare the alone thing until that very end.

746
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:54,730
If I'm too out, I'm hot, wasn't that good.

747
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,110
Really?

748
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,710
Yeah.

749
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:55,710


750
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:55,710


751
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:03,910
Now, let's see, let's see.

752
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,290
to demonstrate on the radio. That's okay.

753
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,790
Okay. And now you

754
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,250
put the pads on your feet.

755
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,350
Okay. Now, concentrate.

756
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,030
Really, really concentrate.

757
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:14,690
On what?

758
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,870
Come on. Just anything. Okay. Just concentrate

759
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,430
on the pads. Concentrate on the pads.

760
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,650
Oh, no. Look, he's leaking on the pads.

761
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,650
No, no, no. Don't concentrate that hard. You're leaking

762
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,750
the pads. Look, if they get all

763
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:27,930
encrusted like that,

764
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,850
they won't slide.

765
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,990
They won't slide. Okay. Now, get in

766
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,610
the boxcar. Okay. Okay.

767
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,210
Roll the tilt control.

768
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,910
That boxcar's tilting. Now, do you feel it?

769
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,410
Are you sliding?

770
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,990
We'll leave him in that boxcar

771
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,770
now. He's sliding.

772
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,830
I can feel sliding.

773
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,130
I can feel it.

774
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,950
I can feel it. Okay.

775
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,150
Now,

776
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,850
what you are experiencing is a state

777
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,910
of slack.

778
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,510
That's it?

779
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,550
Well, that's not all

780
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,650
there is to it. Now, don't be disappointed.

781
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,290
There's more. There's a little bit more.

782
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,030
It's beginning slack, okay?

783
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,590
But we'll need another

784
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,010
check before you can...

785
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,590
Do you have a MasterCard

786
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,150
or anything like that?

787
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,530
Because you've achieved stage

788
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,350
one of slack, but in order to become

789
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,450
completely clear, you're going to have to go

790
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,310
through a couple more little initiation

791
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,790
rituals.

792
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,790
...with spontaneous breast enlargement

793
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,990
or any other diseases.

794
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,290
I have a few

795
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,530
syndromatic diseases which I wonder

796
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,310
if life may be studying any kind of

797
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,630
you know, an exacerbated

798
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,370
form of religious thing would get me

799
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,450
into trouble, you know.

800
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,490
That was the spontaneous breast enlargement.

801
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,310
I thought you were just puffing up like the

802
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,350
common garden toad to frighten off

803
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,970
enemies as sort of a bluffing

804
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,290
defense. No, he

805
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,910
shaves his kneecaps for that.

806
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,410
Oh, well, that's the part

807
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,330
of something else, yes. And it frightens away

808
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,890
the predators

809
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,530
and other... You know how we males are, don't you?

810
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,890
I mean, you know, it's a thing.

811
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,130
You have to frighten everyone.

812
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,110
Oh, yeah, I know how us males...

813
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,030
I'm not one of those guys that

814
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,270
doesn't know how we are.

815
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,230
How does Bob, you know,

816
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,610
how does Bob take care of

817
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:14,830
aggression?

818
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,870
How does Bob take care of your

819
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,210
aggression?

820
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:22,610
He lets you

821
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,950
just have it out.

822
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,950
You didn't like that third grade school teacher?

823
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,070
No. He will

824
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,910
look her, he will find her, he will bring her to

825
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,910
Dobstown, he will put her in the gladiator pit,

826
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,530
the poor...

827
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,490
pathetic old hag, and he will

828
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,590
hand you the baseball bat with nails in it

829
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,490
and let you go at it to your heart's content

830
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,590
and you will... That's stage 17

831
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,570
of slide. That's real justice.

832
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,310
It's true justice.

833
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:47,970
This is an objectivist,

834
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,610
rationalist church, and we believe

835
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,090
in justice above mercy.

836
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,570
Justice first and mercy later.

837
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,250
Get the

838
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,450
evil, old, nasty third grade

839
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,510
teachers out of the way, and then we can

840
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,510
talk about mercy.

841
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,330
Well, I'm a convertible already. I can feel this.

842
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,430
This kind of abstract power you've been

843
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,630
blowering all over the place since you've walked in here.

844
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,810
You're starting to seep in through my body right now.

845
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:10,750
Um...

846
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,590
And the operations

847
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,850
are cheap. That can all

848
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,050
be corrected, but...

849
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,410
And we have easy credit plans

850
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,330
for your

851
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,770
personality reintegration, as we

852
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:26,670
call it in the...

853
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,450
What sort of people...

854
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,950
What sort of person needs to find...

855
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,010
...

856
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:32,310
...

857
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:33,630
...

858
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:33,630


859
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:33,630


860
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:33,630


861
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:33,630


862
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:33,630


863
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:33,630


864
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:33,630


865
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:33,630


866
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:33,630


867
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:33,630


868
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:33,630


869
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:33,630


870
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:33,630


871
00:35:33,650 --> 00:36:03,650


872
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:07,870

...

875
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,310
...

876
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:11,390
...

877
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:11,430
...

878
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:11,670
...

879
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:11,730
...

880
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:11,890
...

881
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,250
...

882
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:13,350
...

883
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:13,370
...

884
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:40,510
revolutionary uh the political uh hatred of the right wing and the left wing and the middle of

00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,890
is this coming on you don't have to yell into it man

898
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:07,210
i was wondering coming down i think what form like i've been in harry krishna festivals and i've

899
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:14,250
noticed the dancing there yeah hi krishna harirama here's a flower with my dollar that's what i that's

900
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:19,670
the way i heard it now when the people in churches of genius hands it what kind of figurative

901
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:25,610
outline do they do is this like a little jolly golly goose stepping or more of a mumble step

902
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:32,850
dancing or is it like square dancing or it's however the hell they want to do it it is absolutely

903
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:40,350
however you want to do you dear friend you you can dance however nobody nobody made games say

904
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:45,470
you know if you were ever a terrible and stupid look the kind of dancer that people that you just

905
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:51,670
knew people were laughing at you after 15 minutes in the smart bar saturday night you will not care

906
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,610
you frankly won't care what they think and that's where we're trying to get to our aim and Korra

907
00:38:55,630 --> 00:39:00,290
get you. We're trying to put you in that place where you can truly say, as Bob has said so

908
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:07,950
many times, if they can't take a joke, then beep them. Beep them, my friend. Beep them

909
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:11,750
if they can't take a joke. That's what the Church of the Subgenius is based on. That

910
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:16,790
is the rock upon which this church was built. The ship that sank the beach of hypocrisy

911
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:22,650
unto which Bob built his mighty church. His edifice of glory and slack and pornography.

912
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:32,250
Now, Bob's gory edifice takes a lot out of you. It does. Oh, my hand. Ouch. It hurts

913
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:37,510
my hand so much to rant like that. When you're testifying, as you are waving your fronds

914
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:42,910
around and making those big grandiose gestures while you're pontificating. Yeah, I studied

915
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:48,570
films of Hitler to do that. And Lenny Reifestahl's School of Drama. That's right. Those little

916
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:54,330
jerky movements. It's very attention-getting. But we can't talk about the other practices.

917
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,430
How about Edward?

918
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,630
Edward Reifestahl's School of Drama. This was a famous sub-Tutonic night or something,

919
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:03,530
or afternoon or something. It was some sort of esoteric behemoth or something.

920
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:03,930
Who?

921
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:13,730
Adolf Hitler. That he had been schooled in the marginal arts of psychomimetry. Or magic,

922
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,450
magic it was.

923
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,510
But it wasn't powerful enough to defeat that of Bob, who throttled him with his bare hands

924
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,290
in that bunker.

925
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,510
Everybody wondered who did it.

926
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:22,790
And ran off with evil brawn.

927
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,250
He's dead, right? Bob's living, so what the hell, right?

928
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,330
All I found were the panties. And Kennedy's brain laying there in a jar.

929
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:35,350
All subcutaneously and simulaculously. It makes you wonder what the hell the world's

930
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,010
coming to all at once backwards and forwards.

931
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:44,850
We want those files released. Why is the CIA still holding on to Kennedy's brain and Eva

932
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:45,710
Braun's panties?

933
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,430
I think it's...

934
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,730
The proof of Bob is right in there. It's there.

935
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:53,150
It's necromantic though, I would say. I think these people are probably involved in some

936
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,630
sort of necromantic skirrage.

937
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:55,610
And they...

938
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,170
I think that...

939
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,750
I don't think anything after that.

940
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,430
It's best...

941
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:01,630
That's best not to.

942
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,710
It is best.

943
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,510
Let's, uh...

944
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,910
There's some things man was not meant to know.

945
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,850
I know, and that's why the veil can never be lifted unless, of course...

946
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,150
Praise Bob.

947
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:15,230
Unless, of course, yes, praise Bob. Unless, of course, we are a witness and we, you know...

948
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,410
Can I get a witless? Can I get a witless, my friend?

949
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,710
You got like five in this room.

950
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:22,450
Ah...

951
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,290
I'm witless!

952
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:25,610
Now are you beginning to catch on why it's called the...

953
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:29,570
It's called subgenius rather than Church of the Ultragenius or the...

954
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,330
That's right. We all fit that category.

955
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,590
So many do.

956
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,370
Micro or macro.

957
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:34,370
So many do. And if you...

958
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:40,990
And if you're a genius who doesn't qualify, we know just how to handle that. You'll be

959
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,030
plenty ready for Bob's church after the...

960
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:50,090
The little ice pick through the nostrils we do. We don't leave scars anymore. We go through

961
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:54,810
the corners of the eyes and the nostrils. And it's done with lasers. It's no stitches...

962
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:55,590
It's a no-muscle...

963
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:55,590


964
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,630
No fuzz operation anymore.

965
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,310
No more of those Frankenstein-looking...

966
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:03,310
I heard of... Some guy said he was a developer in Idaho. He said you had some kind of clinic

967
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:07,610
going on out there. And a lot of these peoples was having big hemorrhages, brain hemorrhages,

968
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:12,410
contusions and whatnot. And they were calling up a lawsuit against the Church of the Subgenius.

969
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:17,650
That's all part of the satire. That is the mental illnesses, the diseases, the injuries.

970
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:22,690
That is part of the satire on... It's a relevant, socially relevant, artistic thing. I mean,

971
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:25,590
this isn't like porno or some... It's just...

972
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,690
It's just a simple satire.

973
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:27,650
What, sculpting?

974
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,870
See, that's all it is.

975
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:29,410
Just a joke.

976
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,030
A little sculpt, little mastic bones here and there, twisty little...

977
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:32,350
Exactly.

978
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:32,750
Yes.

979
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:37,930
Well, we use the human body as a canvas. It's performance art, you see, officer.

980
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:38,750
I...

981
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,550
That's all. We're not... I mean...

982
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,010
Well, I...

983
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:46,430
You don't think anybody takes this seriously, do you? Oh, gosh, that would be... So I would

984
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:46,670
think...

985
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,230
When were you in Gainesville five years ago? I'm sorry.

986
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:50,370
Hmm?

987
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:54,810
Never mind. You said no one took that seriously, and I asked you if you were in Gainesville

988
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:55,910
five years ago or something.

989
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:00,770
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

990
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:03,850
That's kind of a slow and disgustingly mellow groove.

991
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,950
But they're singing Bob. Did you hear that?

992
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,830
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob. I heard it. I heard it.

993
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:13,810
What a coincidence. Golly! Did you hear that? They said Bob! You said that guy's name was

994
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:19,410
Bob. Let's prove they're Bob Dolph. You will. God. People take such obvious...

995
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,470
That's Princess We Are Doe. Queen. Queen of all.

996
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:24,790
Of all.

997
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:35,810

1011
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:52,430
Secular

1012
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:52,450
Lydia

1013
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:52,530
Nam

1014
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:52,550
Lab

1015
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:52,950
heh

1016
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:56,310
hoop

1017
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,470
scheme

1018
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,090
bag

1019
00:44:59,090 --> 00:44:59,090


1020
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:14,570
Here it Is

1021
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:20,630
Hahaha

1022
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:18,050
For instance, if someone were to answer a very particular question...

1023
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,550
I have a pair of tickets to give away.

1024
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,970
I'm allowed to give away a pair of tickets.

1025
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:25,630
What is J.R. Bob Dobbs' middle name?

1026
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:26,330
We'll do that later.

1027
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:29,270
If you can answer that question, you get one of the free tickets.

1028
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,250
We only got two, though.

1029
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:32,910
There you go. You're on the air.

1030
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,530
It isn't Rincon.

1031
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:36,390
Yes?

1032
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:37,370
His middle name.

1033
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,550
All right, say his full name again.

1034
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:40,950
I have ESP.

1035
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:44,810
Yes, I'm afraid of the retinue now.

1036
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:47,150
These are the denizens of erst.

1037
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,150
You're lucky that they don't let you go to the farm.

1038
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,230
They're twisted the wrong way.

1039
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,190
The DNA is spinning opposito.

1040
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:58,390
Oh, look at that poor little collar going down that drain.

1041
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:00,930
Round and round and round, and he just disappears.

1042
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,710
What a loss.

1043
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:05,750
I feel so...

1044
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:06,130
Hello?

1045
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,270
Bob's middle name.

1046
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:08,530
What is it?

1047
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:09,470
Bob.

1048
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:10,470
Bob.

1049
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:11,310
Bob.

1050
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:13,770
Well, there's the winner.

1051
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:14,850
Yes.

1052
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:15,170
That's it.

1053
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:16,370
That is absolutely correct.

1054
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:21,050
On Bob's birth certificate, it says J.R.

1055
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:24,830
Quote Bob, unquote, Dobbs.

1056
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,010
Okay, what's your name?

1057
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,270
John Costolo.

1058
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:28,250
Okay.

1059
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:31,910
I just called and asked about the free tickets, as a matter of fact.

1060
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:32,650
Okay, wait a minute.

1061
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:33,830
And never got an answer.

1062
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:34,790
Figures.

1063
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,470
Sub-genius.

1064
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,350
Hey, why do you think they call it sub?

1065
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:40,310
You may already be a wiener.

1066
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:42,370
In fact.

1067
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:42,810
True.

1068
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:44,190
Okay.

1069
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:45,710
You know all about it?

1070
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:46,090
Bob.

1071
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,570
Do you know all about it?

1072
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:48,070
Baby!

1073
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:49,570
You were just gonna...

1074
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:50,270
Woo!

1075
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:50,670
Okay.

1076
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:52,130
Well, listen to the radio.

1077
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:52,450
Bye.

1078
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:55,170
Just show up at the door and you'll have two tickets.

1079
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:55,650
Two tickets.

1080
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,710
I believe there's been a manifestation.

1081
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,070
Oh my God.

1082
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:00,010
What?

1083
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:00,570
Turn around.

1084
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:01,630
Has there been a miracle?

1085
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,230
Oh my Lord.

1086
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:04,950
Oh my God.

1087
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:05,470


1088
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:07,110
I think I have to leave.

1089
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:07,890
Copyright infringement.

1090
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:08,330
Number...

1091
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:09,410
Oh my Lord.

1092
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:10,930
My friend, I'm sorry.

1093
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:10,930


1094
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:10,930


1095
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:14,390
I think I'm gonna go get some Elvis Presley records out.

1096
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:15,310
I'll be back in a minute.

1097
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:19,970
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1098
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:26,110
A crimson manifestation glinted in through the room and I turned a few heads.

1099
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:26,950
What a manifestation.

1100
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:28,090
Into cabbage.

1101
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:28,630
Into cabbage.

1102
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,630
Oh, turn camera number three.

1103
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:32,650
Yeah, there we go.

1104
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,050
Go up on the monitor.

1105
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:34,950
There is...

1106
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:39,570
Is that Connie Dobbs herself, itself, I should say?

1107
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:40,930
Well, her name is...

1108
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:40,930


1109
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:40,930


1110
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:40,930


1111
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:40,930


1112
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:40,930


1113
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:40,930


1114
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:40,930


1115
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:41,010
How are you doing these days anyway?

1116
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:42,190
I'm a elf, now, Reverend Stagg.

1117
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:42,750
How are you?

1118
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:47,390
It's been a long time since I've seen you on some cowboy day.

1119
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:50,430
How are you doing these days anyway?

1120
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,590
I'm very sling along as usual.

1121
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:53,990
Look at him react.

1122
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,690
I'm all set to come with me down to the Smart Bar.

1123
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,250
I'm as ready as I can...

1124
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,450
How ready is all everybody...

1125
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:00,810
Another one of these things.

1126
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:03,090
We just can't show these things on the radio.

1127
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:05,810
You can't show them.

1128
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:06,130
You can...

1129
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,470
You can indicate, though.

1130
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,050
With the minds left...

1131
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:10,910
With the mind's ear eye.

1132
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,790
The eye of the ear, isn't it?

1133
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:15,070
No.

1134
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:15,750
That's right.

1135
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,810
It's television for the blind, as he said.

1136
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,430
But it's not, as you said, it was, I forgot what I was saying.

1137
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,630
And really, it's not very dignified to just spell these things out.

1138
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:29,730
I mean, it's sexier if you don't show everything.

1139
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:30,510
You know what I mean?

1140
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:33,510
I mean, it's just, the old movies were so much more romantic.

1141
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,490
Connie was one of the top stars.

1142
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,070
If you're more elliptical.

1143
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:41,470
That's a description of a circular thing, though.

1144
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:43,330
Hyperbolic, I think, would be more.

1145
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,750
Hyperbole, elliptical is more graphically descriptive.

1146
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:51,970
Life is a metaphor, and we, life is like a metaphor, actually.

1147
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,330
Life is a simile of a metaphor.

1148
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:58,690
And like a metaphor, it's like a bad, it's like bad whiskey is.

1149
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:02,370
It burns like the truth is like bad whiskey is, like a bad metaphor.

1150
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:05,190
Like a joke that's been told too many times.

1151
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:06,470
Three, four times too many.

1152
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:08,830
Well, I suppose I told it.

1153
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:11,090
That was a different one, though.

1154
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,910
Well, I have to pretend like, well.

1155
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:22,990
Oh, I wasn't reacting to anything.

1156
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:24,370
I have to hear something.

1157
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:28,210
Say goodbye to all our company.

1158
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:37,030
M-I-C-K-E-Y.

1159
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:39,250
Why?

1160
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:41,410
Because we hate you now.

1161
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:46,990
Oh, hell cares.

1162
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:50,770
Oh, oh, oh.

1163
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:53,350
Hey, I like that.

1164
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,470
That is cheese curdling.

1165
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,790
I never heard that song sung that way.

1166
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:59,210
Oh, speaking of cheese.

1167
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:05,890
Connie, would you, when I was growing up, I saw you in so many movies.

1168
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:08,810
Would you tell us about the sex life?

1169
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:11,190
And the sex life of some of the stars that you worked with?

1170
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:12,990
Or Bob.

1171
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,290
What do you and Bob do?

1172
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:15,450
Any of that gossip?

1173
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:23,610
Well, Reverend Stan, what Bob and I do is very hard to describe over the airs of the radio.

1174
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,710
But it involves a bit of prairie squid.

1175
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:31,430
And it involves a bit of this and that.

1176
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:35,050
And of dilling and gelling and milling and milling.

1177
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:38,690
It's just two mucking.

1178
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:39,650
fudge.

1179
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,130
Hubba hubba.

1180
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:44,650
Hubba hubba, why?

1181
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:46,750
I can just,

1182
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,710
my mouth water's just thinking about it.

1183
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:50,830
It's better than french fries

1184
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:51,650
most of the time.

1185
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:54,230
Did you ever use the tantric deviation

1186
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:56,930
sexual practices as preached by

1187
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,270
B.P. Wow

1188
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:01,050
of the Wow Foundation?

1189
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:02,950
Well, I'm always

1190
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:04,470
in for a good wow

1191
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,590
now and then, but I've developed

1192
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:08,610
my own sort of

1193
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:09,510
tantric deviation.

1194
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,630
I am capable,

1195
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:14,550
Mr. Shang, of the tsunami

1196
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,250
orgasm. Now,

1197
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:18,270
tsunami is the Japanese

1198
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:20,570
word for hurricane, so as you can

1199
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:22,650
imagine, my tantric

1200
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:23,890
positions just

1201
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:26,310
overflow with

1202
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,410
ecstasy. Tidal waves

1203
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:29,790
of pure

1204
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:31,250
pleasure.

1205
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:34,250
Ah, yes.

1206
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:36,210
Bubba

1207
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:38,150
doves, he's no sub, bub doves, he's

1208
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,390
no fool. He's the head of the subgenius

1209
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:41,910
church. He is super cool.

1210
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,190
That's Glass Madness,

1211
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:46,070
a folk.

1212
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:48,150
No, he lives in Hawaii.

1213
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,110
Hawaii now, actually. He lives on

1214
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,390
the island of

1215
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:53,910
and he

1216
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,190
sings those cute, he does the nice

1217
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:57,350
subgenius songs.

1218
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:59,890
Actually, there's a nice

1219
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:02,170
subgenius song maker here in

1220
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:02,710
Cleveland.

1221
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,890
Reverend Melodious Chops.

1222
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,890
Sister Melodious Chops will be

1223
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:09,630
performing three new

1224
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:12,350
all-unclosed

1225
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,850
Bob songs

1226
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:15,890
Saturday night

1227
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:17,950
May 23rd

1228
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:19,130
at the

1229
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,370
Marshall Bar.

1230
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:23,690
Yeah, right.

1231
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:25,390
Ryan Stang.

1232
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:27,090
Yeah, you tell him, pal.

1233
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:29,390
Oh, dear friends,

1234
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:31,810
I'm gonna flip that tape.

1235
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:34,070
Do continue on a little bit,

1236
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:35,730
but perhaps I should give the

1237
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:38,290
additional subgenius post office

1238
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:39,730
box number you can write to

1239
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,390
here at the

1240
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,050
near the end of the broadcast

1241
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,470
with my good friend

1242
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:49,650
Jimi Hendrix in the background.

1243
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:52,450
Yeah, this is

1244
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:53,770
the broadcast of a

1245
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,390
well, yeah, they like call it a

1246
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:58,050
damn church or

1247
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,210
something like that.

1248
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:01,630
And that's just

1249
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:03,630
exactly what it is.

1250
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:05,890
And

1251
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:06,150
and

1252
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:06,510
, you know,

1253
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:07,310
you can find out the

1254
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,790
more explanatory

1255
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:11,610
information or at least all the

1256
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:12,710
little ads and things.

1257
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:14,410
If you write to

1258
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:17,190
Bob at post office box

1259
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:20,550
one four zero three zero six.

1260
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:25,610
That's box one four oh three oh six

1261
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:29,090
Dallas, Texas, seven five two one four.

1262
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:32,510
And rather than doing our usual

1263
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:36,190
unusual tonight, playing bits and pieces,

1264
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:38,190
from all over the country and here,

1265
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:40,990
we're playing bits and pieces only from

1266
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:47,190
this Cleveland radio show that I was lucky enough

1267
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,490
to be a guest on.

1268
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:49,350
And, you know,

1269
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:51,130
Will Adob's wasn't here tonight.

1270
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:54,070
I've been answering the phone and now I see what he goes

1271
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:57,170
through with all kinds of poor little kid.

1272
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:59,430
Lee, I don't know what, you know,

1273
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:06,090
fanatics trying to call us up and do and not say

1274
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:06,170
that.

1275
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:08,430
You know, prank calls real.

1276
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:11,670
If if they, you know, if they've at least,

1277
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:16,510
you know, say something stupid or smart.

1278
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:19,330
That's the kind of prank calls we can get into.

1279
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,290
Heck, we record them and play them next show.

1280
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:24,890
But they just have to do it.

1281
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:28,990
They just have to do it rival cult style.

1282
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:29,550
I guess.

1283
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:33,970
But anyway, back to the fun and horror here.

1284
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:42,850
Have you got the new one with the infinite control

1285
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:45,310
with knob, the one that goes all the way up to 11.

1286
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:48,230
Connie, if you've got that.

1287
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:48,410
Yeah.

1288
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:49,430
Fourteen eighty nine.

1289
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,750
Yes, I've got that down.

1290
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,670
Graved in my head, memorized word for word and verb.

1291
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:58,590
Item and I just might give you a gander if you can get

1292
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:02,270
your little goodies down to the smart bar on five twenty three.

1293
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:03,990
Get on and get one.

1294
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:04,410
Mate.

1295
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:05,990
It's alive.

1296
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:06,150
Get one.

1297
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:06,150


1298
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:06,150


1299
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:06,150


1300
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:06,870
Like a rave.

1301
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:09,890
I mean, come out and have a bloody rave.

1302
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,530
Rave out with Bob.

1303
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,230
You know, Bob.

1304
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,650
Don't know if it's Church of Subcom or whatever.

1305
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,170
Like a rave.

1306
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:19,490
It's trendy.

1307
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,550
It's like what they do in London.

1308
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:21,930


1309
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,310
Who the hell is Bob?

1310
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:24,370
Lost and drunk.

1311
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,210
What about Tom?

1312
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:27,330
Bobby's show up and try to.

1313
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:27,650
What about Harry?

1314
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:29,150
What about Connie?

1315
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,230
Bob.

1316
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:31,890
Hell, Bob.

1317
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:33,550
Yes, it was praised, Bob.

1318
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:34,850
But it's hail Connie.

1319
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:35,710
Hail Connie.

1320
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:36,490
Hail Connie.

1321
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:37,770
Where did you get that dress?

1322
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:39,230
Hail Connie.

1323
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:39,570
Hail Connie.

1324
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:42,030
Where did you get that dress?

1325
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:47,650
Somewhere deep and hot and oozing with snot.

1326
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:50,690
And she cooks up a hell of a hamburger, dear friend.

1327
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:51,310
I sure do.

1328
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:52,270
I sizzle it.

1329
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:55,550
I fat fry them little bovine creatures.

1330
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:57,970
Moo, moo, baby.

1331
00:55:58,350 --> 00:55:59,950
Try that burger, Connie.

1332
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,590
My eyes are running already.

1333
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:05,550
That's the onion.

1334
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,050
That's your space onions.

1335
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:11,170
You were talking about tantalizing deviants.

1336
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:14,390
Tantric deviations.

1337
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:18,110
Oh, my God.

1338
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,630
That already sounds exciting.

1339
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,750
That's why those monks never leave that chamber.

1340
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:23,530
Which monks are you talking about?

1341
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:27,670
Are you talking like Nepalese temple bald heads or something?

1342
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:31,650
The Nepalese temple bald head monks.

1343
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:32,870
Tantrism?

1344
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:33,550
Ancient lamas.

1345
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:35,530
The temple bald head monks.

1346
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:37,190
They use them too?

1347
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:37,930
Uh-huh.

1348
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:39,250
They ride on the lamas.

1349
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:39,990
Jesus almighty.

1350
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:42,650
We got camels so far.

1351
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:45,410
Now we got lamas and monkeys too involved in this also.

1352
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:48,390
I don't know if Cleveland is ready for this.

1353
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:49,770
This is a bird, man.

1354
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:53,970
I mean, I know you guys got a kulak and the whole thing going together all over the country

1355
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:58,110
and everything, but I don't think you could have animals like that performing.

1356
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,210
Well, maybe you could.

1357
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:01,410
Could you?

1358
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:03,990
Well, I mean, legally I know.

1359
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:05,490
They did it on Noah's Ark.

1360
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:05,490


1361
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:05,490


1362
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:05,490


1363
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:05,490


1364
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:05,490


1365
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:05,490


1366
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:05,510
They did it on Noah's Ark.

1367
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:06,150
Noah's Ark, my friend.

1368
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:06,650
They must have.

1369
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:07,370
Just read your Bible.

1370
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:07,970
They did it on...

1371
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:08,750
They didn't do it.

1372
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:13,250
They didn't have room for the dinosaurs, but they had room for AIDS mosquito, I noticed.

1373
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:15,490
Well, we're leaving it to the conspiracy.

1374
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:16,230
Uh-huh.

1375
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:17,550
They figured something out.

1376
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:17,710
Yep.

1377
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:22,750
I think the Communist Party and Frank, the guy that made Gallo wine, had conspired...

1378
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:23,190
Frank Gallo.

1379
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:27,150
Frank Gallo and, well, it was Gorbachev.

1380
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:31,710
Bishop Hensley there who started the Thunderbird wine in Modesto, California.

1381
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:33,070
And all of those people...

1382
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:34,410
America's fine aperitif wine.

1383
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,410
Methylated spirits.

1384
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:36,630
They served very cold.

1385
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:36,830


1386
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:39,710
And that's what causes the AIDS virus to proliferate.

1387
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:42,790
The green bottles.

1388
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:44,230
The green bottles, I think.

1389
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:45,550
Was it the green bottles?

1390
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:46,990
Yeah, that's where it started.

1391
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:58,390
After they invented it in Fort Detrick and stuck it into the polio inoculations that were going to Africa and...

1392
00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:59,770
Well, that was a brilliant...

1393
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:00,810
Red Cross.

1394
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,290
Brilliant stroke of genius on everyone's part.

1395
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:03,670
And that's how the little...

1396
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:05,490
Yeah, that sounds...

1397
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:06,450
Yeah, wonderful.

1398
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:13,390
And that's why you see so many Dobbshead scarification tattoos as ritual amulets sort of...

1399
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:25,210
To ward off the diseases, you see the Dobbshead scars on people's backs and foreheads and things because, you know, you can't buy a sandwich in some parts of the Third World without the mark.

1400
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:28,190
Yeah, the mark of the barking...

1401
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:28,510
The best.

1402
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,430
The mark of the best.

1403
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:29,970
The best.

1404
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:30,370
Yeah.

1405
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:32,090
That's what we're trying to do, you know.

1406
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:34,490
I would never use it with anything but Hellman's mayonnaise.

1407
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:36,130
Bring life to thee.

1408
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,630
Image of the best.

1409
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:38,610
Bring it.

1410
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:39,510
The best that you can be.

1411
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,590
Because you only go around once at a time.

1412
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:42,350
Life to thee.

1413
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:43,190
Image of the best.

1414
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:46,870
That Dharma guy I was talking to said you only go around 6,000...

1415
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:46,890
Life to thee.

1416
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:46,890


1417
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:52,650
See, you only go around once at a time.

1418
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,570
Life, life, life, life, life, life, life...

1419
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:55,190
So many lives.

1420
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,630
Image of the best.

1421
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:58,390
Image of the bet.

1422
00:58:59,270 --> 00:58:59,670
Yeah.

1423
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:02,590
And you'll win that bet if you bet what Bob bets.

1424
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,930
You are listening to ESO Radio.

1425
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:07,970
And what did Bob bet?

1426
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:08,990
He made a wager.

1427
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:11,890
And it wasn't the wages of sin he was talking about.

1428
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:20,490
He was talking about something a little more deeper, a little more macrocosmic, something that encompassed almost each and every one of...

1429
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:21,610
And touched our lives so...

1430
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:24,710
Not too deeply, actually, but sometimes it did.

1431
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:27,090
What was I talking about?

1432
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:28,090
Forgiveness.

1433
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:29,070
Forgiveness.

1434
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:29,630
And peace.

1435
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:29,950
And peace.

1436
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:30,630
And prosperity.

1437
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:32,770
This is a church prosperity.

1438
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:33,290
Forgiveness.

1439
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:34,230
Forgiveness.

1440
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:34,910
But peace.

1441
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:35,870
And pee.

1442
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:36,850
And pros...

1443
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:37,170
Forgiveness.

1444
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:37,930
Forgiveness.

1445
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:38,930
Forgiveness.

1446
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:39,390
And prosperity.

1447
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:40,370
And...

1448
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:40,650
Forgiveness.

1449
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:41,330
And...

1450
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:41,550
Forgiveness.

1451
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:42,250
And peace.

1452
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:49,970
Yes, Bob does not bring forgiveness because he doesn't think you need to be forgiven for anything you did.

1453
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,230
He's not that well connected anyway.

1454
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:53,230
But...

1455
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:54,530
But...

1456
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:55,430
And it's a...

1457
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:58,150
As they say on the radio, it's a big...

1458
00:59:58,150 --> 00:59:58,350
It's a big...

1459
00:59:58,350 --> 00:59:59,670
But you got there.

1460
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:00,130
Yeah.

1461
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:02,290
That's so clever, man.

1462
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:02,990
I love that phrase.

1463
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:04,670
I like you get to use that about once a year.

1464
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:05,310
No, no.

1465
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,570
We use it every time.

1466
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:07,430
But you got there.

1467
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:08,230
We use it every show.

1468
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:09,630
But you got there.

1469
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:10,070
Big...

1470
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:11,350
But you got there.

1471
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:12,810
Who is chasing us around this room?

1472
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:13,610
That's reincarnation.

1473
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:14,350
Proof of reincarnation.

1474
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:15,450
Big...

1475
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:17,830
But you got there.

1476
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:18,710
Big...

1477
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:20,910
I...

1478
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:21,650
I...

1479
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:21,890
I...

1480
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:21,950
I...

1481
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:22,050
I...

1482
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:22,190
I...

1483
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:22,270
I...

1484
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:22,310
I...

1485
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:22,490
I...

1486
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:22,730
I...

1487
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:22,890
Avạn

1488
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:22,890


1489
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:22,890
