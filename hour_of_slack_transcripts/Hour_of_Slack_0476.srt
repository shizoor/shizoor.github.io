1
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,380
What I'm asking people to do is accept that everything they've based their lives on is a lie.

2
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,340
I'm seeking salvation.

3
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,980
There are enemies of children's souls.

4
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,660
All alone in this world of wickedness.

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,520
Search inside yourself for your soul.

6
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,240
In the name of the Jesus.

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,440
No, no, no.

8
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,560
No, no, no.

9
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,440
Don't be proud of me here.

10
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,600
Don't be proud of me here.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,540
Fight the real enemy.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,440
Don't you want to be saved?

13
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,120
Don't you want to be saved?

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,100
Fight the real enemy.

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,440
We're all looking in the same direction.

16
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,880
We're not seeing quite the same thing.

17
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,300
There is absolutely no other possibility.

18
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,600
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:29,980
to the moon.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,020
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

21
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,420
which reaches from the inner mind to

22
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,720
the subgenius hour of

23
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,820
SWAT.

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,140
And now for this week's verse of meditation.

25
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,940
The dog returns back to its own vomit

26
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,420
and the sow is washed only to wallow in the mire.

27
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,980
We're glad to have each and every one of you at our service today,

28
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,360
especially the young folks.

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,200
There's going to be a youth meeting tonight

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,980
after the Ascension.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,800
There's going to be a family and all you youths need to be there.

32
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,680
We're going to serve macaroni and cheese,

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,520
fish sticks and banana pudding.

34
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,620
Brother Blowforth will speak on dating and mating.

35
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,200
Is it fun or frustrating?

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,620
Should be real good.

37
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,940
New Realization,

38
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,940
bringing you best new information for your life.

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,880
Not entertainment.

40
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,980
New Realization,

41
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,940
embodiment of concept taught by

42
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,540
Nen Master Nenslow is here to help you.

43
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,700
CIA, NSA, CFR,

44
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,280
Trilaterals, Federal Reserve,

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:29,980
Builder,

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,600
Burger, P2, Club of Rome,

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,520
International Race Hate Conspiracy,

48
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,860
all means nothing.

49
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,320
Facts are worse than you imagine.

50
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,380
Yeti UFO contactees by thousands.

51
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,480
Cruel, hairy alien dwarfs

52
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,340
slash pickup truck fuel tanks with long sharp claws.

53
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,920
Cute ET, Aryan Space Brothers,

54
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,880
Confederation of Biped Humanoid Worlds.

55
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,860
We'll wish for that when Global Satellite TV reveals to all

56
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,200
that dinosaurs never extinct went underground,

57
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,920
not through polar holes.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,200
To imaginary interior world,

59
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,600
but to abandoned ancient death ray cavern cities

60
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,000
whose unwanted pets dinosaurs once were.

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,460
They have advance of us by millions of years

62
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,740
and long ago paid off world governments

63
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,480
creating red herring MJ12,

64
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,440
Area 51 dreamland scams,

65
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,880
releasing vital fragments of actual fact

66
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,160
in foolish fairy tales to discredit serious researchers,

67
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,640
conceal worldwide network of human clone meat farms.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,240
Invisible non-corporeal idiiforms wage war

69
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,840
for possession of human mind.

70
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,660
Showing all traits of life form,

71
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,840
lacking only bodies,

72
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,160
they possess, breed, fight, survive

73
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,220
in non-dimensional idiocosm created by humans,

74
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,820
parasitic fungus brain.

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,540
Lowly lichen tells the tale of fungus failure

76
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,640
to infect plant life form.

77
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,640
Alone or with plant form,

78
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,540
fungus is stationary, subject to nature's whim.

79
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,440
Discovery of one cell animal life changes all that.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,480
Mobile host lives, grows, develops, at last the human form,

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,360
creates stone heap culture.

82
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,120
Tools creating smaller tools, but then...

83
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,420
Idiiforms develop, controlling animal fungus symbiotes,

84
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,680
creates armies, religions, atom bomb.

85
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,500
Idiiform lives an expensive victim,

86
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,080
breathes, lives though all else die.

87
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,660
Solution, none.

88
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,440
Answers, none.

89
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,400
Nenslow said, beware of those with all the answers.

90
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,500
I have only more questions.

91
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,180
Nenslow said, I never tell you don't listen to him.

92
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,640
I tell you listen, and listen carefully.

93
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,300
Compare, use reason, never decide once and for all

94
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,820
this person is right, this is wrong.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,620
Always leave yourself an out.

96
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,300
A person said to Nenslow,

97
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,380
when commies come marching down Main Street,

98
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,180
I'd rather have a gun in my hand than a philosophy book.

99
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,140
Nenslow said, if commies have philosophy book,

100
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,260
they will never march down Main Street.

101
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,260
Read, learn, work.

102
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,720
Do, dare, and be silent.

103
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:10,240
New realization, box 86582, Portland, Oregon 97286.

104
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,440
yuanacial briefing made possible by

105
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:40,440


106
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:40,440


107
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:40,440


108
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:40,820
qi

109
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:40,820


110
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,800
qi

111
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,660
Should have been left alone to hang and dry

112
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,340
You're in all things too late to scream and cry

113
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,860
Daddy says what can't you sell?

114
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,100
Watch the club

115
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,960
Everything will flow through you

116
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,620
And you're all around

117
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,040
For the good, for the good

118
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,960
Should have been left alone

119
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,900
Now can't decide

120
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,380
Which hypno-tragic role to suicide

121
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,260
Daddy says what can't you sell?

122
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:39,840
Watch the club

123
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,360
Watch the club

124
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,400
Everything will flow through you

125
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,000
And you're all around

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,740
For the good, for the good

127
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,620
New New York

128
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,740
Like hell

129
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,960
Decentralized

130
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,340
New York

131
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,600
Like hell

132
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,340
Decentralized

133
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,080
New New York

134
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,160
Like hell

135
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,200
Decentralized

136
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,280
New York

137
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,660
Let's do it

138
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,180
Watch a generate

139
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,020
We'll be right back.

140
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,260
We'll be right back.

141
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,260
We'll be right back.

142
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,200
We'll be right back.

143
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,340
And, uh, yes, this is why he provided this music also in the background.

144
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,440
This is Nenslow himself leading the Nensletic Orchestra.

145
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:29,020
Before that, you heard Out of Band Experience,

146
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,420
also known as Kings of Feedback,

147
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,040
a great subgenius band doing Fight the Real Enemy.

148
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,360
And who might that be?

149
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,820
And you can reach Out of Band Experience

150
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,340
by calling, got that pencil ready,

151
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,140
1-617-LICK-O-B-E.

152
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,380
Yes, 1-617-LICK-O-B-E.

153
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,900
Yes, we're taking it easy now at this point.

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,540
We've had to do three shows in seven hours,

155
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,520
and we've got two more to go.

156
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,280
But we've got so much great tape,

157
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,540
and we're going to continue now.

158
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,880
With the tapes of the Senate hearings,

159
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:21,540
originally broadcast on WCSB Cleveland ESO radio show.

160
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,360
When last we left off with Cantor Chaz

161
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,880
and lonesome cowboy Senator Dave, the accused.

162
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,100
We were autopsying President Dobbs,

163
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,500
who actually had just discovered

164
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,980
some key facts about the brain of President Dobbs,

165
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:53,360
and were, I believe, flipping the tape on the last shows.

166
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,360
This is where the tape picks up in Dave's brain.

167
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,580
Thank y'all.

168
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,480
... had been replaced by spongy mass of pipe tendrils,

169
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,920
which seemed to arrive with an unholy intelligence of their own.

170
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,800
Now, this may explain some of the President's foreign policy miscues,

171
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,340
and the president's own.

172
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,460
Well, we certainly have been exposed to something

173
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,300
nearing an incredible story here today.

174
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,440
I don't know really what to believe,

175
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,820
that the president's wife's brain actually became an out...

176
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,780
... tendrils, tendrils in her brain.

177
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,360
... tendrils, tendrils.

178
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,440
Someone, someone, look, help the senator!

179
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,440
Help the senator!

180
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,500
... get the pipe out!

181
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:40,860
Ah!

182
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,800
Oh, no!

183
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,000
Too late!

184
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,180
It's broken in too deep!

185
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,180
He'll lose the whole front part of his brain!

186
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,300
Whoa!

187
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,960
Now, how do you feel, Senator Dave?

188
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,840
I feel just fine.

189
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,560
I feel all smooth and creamy like Serena,

190
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,560
or a plate of well-done grits.

191
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,080
I don't feel like napping, though.

192
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,320
He has become...

193
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,800
... Dave has become...

194
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,200
... a great man.

195
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,200


196
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,580
He has joined us.

197
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:22,780
All one, unite all faith, all moral ABCs, rabbi dogs.

198
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,740
All dogs.

199
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,700
Dilute, dilute.

200
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,880
Okay, okay.

201
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,500
All wagged out.

202
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,980
Hey, is there supposed to be different new flesh growing on my skins?

203
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,600
Oh, that's just one of the side effects of the operation.

204
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,740
Oh, tell us about your dream.

205
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,800
You were mumbling answers as if you were being held up.

206
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:42,800


207
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:42,800


208
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:42,800


209
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:42,800


210
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:42,800


211
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:42,800


212
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:42,800


213
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:42,800


214
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:42,800


215
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:42,800


216
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:42,800


217
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:42,800


218
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:42,800


219
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,740
I was on trial in some Senate hearings.

220
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,460
I dreamed that Reverend Stang was an evil senator.

221
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,860
And he had claimed that somehow I was investigating church,

222
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,820
and then I had bankrolled, pocketed my bankroll,

223
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,680
that had been given to me by the Senate at committees.

224
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,140
And then he had been doing it instead,

225
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,160
but he had me crucified up there just like Sivana Rowland examining his snakes.

226
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,800
I was going to the cross or the witching post.

227
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,860
And then all of a sudden,

228
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,780
Jackie Onassis' head exploded into a pile of...

229
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,440
Polyphone, kind of like Bob's did when he was exploding.

230
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,360
Did we get all that on tape?

231
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,080
Okay, take it down to the novel department.

232
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,940
Send it off to Simon & Schuster.

233
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,820
That'll be the next subgenius book.

234
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,540
It's worth it.

235
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,280
Those experiments and, I mean, well, the surgery is expensive,

236
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,420
but well worth the results in prophetic utterances by the patient.

237
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,720
As we can see, doctors here,

238
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,760
Dave laying on the altar,

239
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,400
on the operating table,

240
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,080
seems to believe that he is standing upright and doing a radio program.

241
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,420
...shall come a time when three wolves shall walk through the Underwoods...

242
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,640
He's hooked up to the bearing.

243
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,700
...pitches of cheese and monumental artifacts from...

244
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,540
Wait a minute. The lights are blinking.

245
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,820
Okay, yeah.

246
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,900
We can type in behavioral changes,

247
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,160
and we can use the file transfer protocol

248
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,400
to send his behavior changes out over the neural net

249
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,200
so that all the other recipients,

250
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,400
if they can download Lonesome Cowboy Dave's brain,

251
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:29,040
they are able to take on the courage and wisdom of Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

252
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,260
It's a high-tech version of the primitive belief

253
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,440
that if you ate the enemy's heart, you would gain his courage.

254
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,400
In this case, we download Lonesome Cowboy Dave's brain

255
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,240
and gain his intelligence,

256
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,040
which for most of us, of course, is a soporific drug.

257
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,460
It's the only way we can relax.

258
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,060
We run up a little bit of Dave's brain,

259
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,440
and it just mellows us out, you know.

260
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,660
It lowers our consciousness so many degrees.

261
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,740
It feels great! You ought to try it!

262
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,300
Come on, man!

263
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,800
Don't you want to be like everybody else?

264
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,640
Try it!

265
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,720
What are you, chicken?

266
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,400
Try some Dave's brain, man!

267
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,840
This...

268
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
I'll try some.

269
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,780
This is pure...

270
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,920
Oh, yeah, come on, little girl.

271
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,840
The first lobe is free.

272
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,160
Okay!

273
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,440
Here, just hold on just a second.

274
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,620
Now, breathe into this sack.

275
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,640
This sack contains some of the essence of Dave's brain.

276
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,820
Go ahead, just huff it.

277
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,580
There you go.

278
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,220
Okay!

279
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,360
She's drooling.

280
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,800
Is it the brain of...

281
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,000
She's growing small.

282
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,520
She looks like a little girl.

283
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,240
Now she's four years old.

284
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,420
Three, two...

285
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,600
Now, hopefully it'll stop here.

286
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,320
We don't know what happens if they keep going.

287
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,920
Oh, don't cry, little girl.

288
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,700
Now, it's okay.

289
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,160
We're your friends.

290
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,100
You're going to grow big.

291
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,540
You'll be a big girl soon.

292
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,980
All right, now she's growing.

293
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,700
Here we go.

294
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,900
It only lasts about 20 seconds, gentlemen.

295
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,200
And isn't that miraculous?

296
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,600
Now, a fully grown test subject.

297
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,000
Just re-grow immediately.

298
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:22,420
What we are trying to do is to make possible for the person to sniff or to waft someone's brain,

299
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,160
to eat the brain, part of the brain, and immediately accrue all of the attributes of the person.

300
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,480
Imagine the same way he had described the cannibal getting the heart of the victim.

301
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,220
That's right.

302
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:40,060
And CEO Dobbs has decided that if we can work this formula into the hamburgers in his new franchise,

303
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,500
perhaps we'll just pat it in like we could use some spices.

304
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:50,460
That's the first burger god, hunger raper, they're called, will be given away free to each customer.

305
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,420
And once they have that first one, we know that they'll come back for more Dave brain-tainted meat.

306
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,980
Ravaged by hunger?

307
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,340
That's a really good brain.

308
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:07,720
The problem with this brain is the convolutions are completely useless.

309
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,040
There's no information.

310
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,860
There's no information carried in this brain.

311
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,480
It seems to be some sort of sieve or some sort of...

312
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,720
That's not what's at issue here.

313
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,760
It fits on a bun.

314
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,300
That's all that counts.

315
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,800
It weighs half an ounce.

316
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,900
Marty, think of it this way.

317
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:23,260
And it sits on a bun.

318
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,620
That's right.

319
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,380
It sits on a bun.

320
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,320
And it's 350 for the quarter pounder.

321
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:27,540
350.

322
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,380
I mean, we don't care if it doesn't really, if it's not really a brain.

323
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,360
We don't care if it's not.

324
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:33,940
It works.

325
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,460
Look at how well it sits up on the steam table here.

326
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,140
They eat it.

327
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,820
The next part of your purpose is to have an audience who doesn't have the botulinum

328
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,100
on their stomach when you have diabetes.

329
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,660
Yeah.

330
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,960
I mean, my intuition could be that.

331
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,280
That's right.

332
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,280


333
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
te obey

334
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,200
Just do it by your instinct.

335
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,280


336
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,000
You have to find sport.

337
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,820
Just be able to 160 Kilos of sugar and you're And this is from the government.

338
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,040
You don't leave anything out of it.

339
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,940
If you leave a lot of food alone, other things will be found.

340
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,120
That's this

341
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,500
You must have been real cool in the 90s.

342
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,640
Yeah, that's no good when you get busted with a trepanation scar.

343
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,940
Yeah, they can tell.

344
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,400
Yeah, they just take a look at you, and that's no job.

345
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,020
You know, you can't even really apply for ADC or anything.

346
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,820
They see that, they assume you're on medication, too, you know,

347
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,660
and it's like, I'm trying to explain to them.

348
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,940
Well, but not because of the church and subgenius or anything like that.

349
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,620
Because, you know, so that's, you know.

350
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,780
Yeah, I mean, half the teenagers in town, I mean,

351
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,160
all the Nine Inch Nails fans have to go out and do the drill thing on their head.

352
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,420
Well, I mean, you know, like there's a lot of people walking around with scars on their skulls,

353
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,720
you know, big, big holes in their skulls, and what kind of, you know,

354
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,960
what are they getting out of this society?

355
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,220
I mean, people think like they don't exist.

356
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,620
What kind of children are we raising?

357
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,380
Children, I mean.

358
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,480
When our high schools have to have metal detectors at the door

359
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,700
to keep the kids from bringing their Black & Decker drills in.

360
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,440
I know it's getting so far out of hand, you know,

361
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,960
like some principals on the Near East side have actually,

362
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,600
and after installing, you know, they find a trepanation scar on a person's head

363
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,340
or a piece of a drill blade on their skull.

364
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,040
They're out.

365
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,560
What's out of there?

366
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:16,400
In Dallas, Dallas school, I walked in to talk to the kids about drugs and drills and E-means.

367
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,740
That's where I go looking for drugs, too.

368
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,700
Exactly.

369
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,300
And there was a child, there was a fifth grader sitting there

370
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:26,020
with a fresh hole in his head and a trickle of blood running down the side of his nose

371
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,060
with a blank stare in his eye, quoting Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

372
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,380
sitting there right in the middle of English.

373
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,380
So she'd obviously gone to the boys' restroom and,

374
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,460
like in my day, we might go in there and smoke a cigarette or something.

375
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,600
Now they go and plug, take their power drill with that,

376
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,020
they run on batteries and their beepers and their internet

377
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,160
and they drill that hole and if they're not high enough from the first one,

378
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,460
that means, well, drill a new one.

379
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,500
Make it a little deeper.

380
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,640
Use a gauge four drill instead of a gauge three.

381
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,180
I say one shunt and they should be suspended for six weeks straight.

382
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,220
I knew this dude.

383
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
One shunt and no more hunt.

384
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,560
One shunt and no more hunt.

385
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,700
You have found everything you need.

386
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,360
Some people merely blow off the top of their skull entirely.

387
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,960
Those are hipper than now.

388
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,580
Yeah, the ones who take the whole front half of their skull off.

389
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,780
Oh, yeah.

390
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,240
They're so cool.

391
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,120
Yeah, they're like that.

392
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,380
You know, wearing black.

393
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,400
That's the only way they can be cool.

394
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,100
Wearing black and all black and everything and their brains exposed.

395
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,300
Yeah, they always have the little stud on their neck.

396
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,600
Like Frankenstein's monster.

397
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Yeah, like it's supposed to really do something for you, you know?

398
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,180
Like, I really carry that.

399
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,600
Yeah, if you see the ones with the, like, they get their left hand and right hand switched.

400
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,840
Or some have the hand of the gorilla.

401
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,360
You know what works very good?

402
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,740
You know, they're real weak and kind of numb after that.

403
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,420
I only see gorilla hands.

404
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,620
And they're into it.

405
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,380
They like to walk up to normals and shake hands, you know?

406
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,680
With their big, clammy gorilla hands and a normal sleeve.

407
00:20:59,740 --> 00:20:59,780
Oh, yeah.

408
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,240
Let's get down.

409
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,420
Let's cut the hole out of the front of our skull.

410
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,360
Let's go.

411
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,360


412
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,360


413
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,360


414
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,360


415
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,360


416
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,360


417
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,360


418
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,800
Achieve enlightenment.

419
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,600
It's the new cool thing.

420
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,780
It's the way to get high, baby.

421
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,000
Are you?

422
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,140
What's the matter, you fray?

423
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,800
Come on.

424
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,480
The drill doesn't hurt.

425
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,340
Put some Dr. Bronner's on it first.

426
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,260
Aren't you a friend?

427
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,360
Make love to the drill.

428
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,280
Bob's into it, man.

429
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,100
Become one with the drill.

430
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,120
It's God's approved.

431
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,100
Yeah, you'll love the way it sounds.

432
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,060
It, like, echoes across your skull when it's going in.

433
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,240
It's I One Drill.

434
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,540
It's like stereo.

435
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,220
I found the drill last week, and in two months,

436
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,000
I made $7 million.

437
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,540
The drill is your friend.

438
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,380
Open yourself to the drill.

439
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,460
Let the drill open you to everything else.

440
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:55,520
Have you ever sat on a beach and imagined you were actually doing a radio show while you were in a striped jacket?

441
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,500
You will.

442
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,720
Have you ever imagined yourself locked in a bathroom, crying?

443
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,340
No.

444
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,480
Eating urine-stained cake?

445
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,720
Crying on your birthday?

446
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,500
Did you ever have a dog?

447
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,900
I had a great job down there at the Kaiser Blaze factory, but then the Silanees came in and they laid us all off.

448
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,980
Dogs, when are you going to do something about this invasion of our shores?

449
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,860
Sign a Patreon.

450
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,320
Bob, I'd like to say something about all them damn farmers.

451
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,400
I'm not going to say anything, but I'm going to say that I'm going to say something about the farmers who are coming around here and taking up all the jobs.

452
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,740
You're so boring when I think of you.

453
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,220
You do nothing to my interview.

454
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,280
My doctor's no fun.

455
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,040
Who cares of the pills in a box?

456
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,580
Just can't care for hills.

457
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,700
Can't care for hills.

458
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,560
Can't care for hills.

459
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:34,780
Can't really care for hills.

460
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:34,840
I have to say that they are mental positions that lie behind every dimension of longer jobs.

461
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:34,840


462
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,300
We won't swear.

You're not anywhere

473
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,060
You're not anywhere

474
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,560

475
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,280

480
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,280
Like that

481
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,220
ero

482
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:09,440
He drove a Cadillac Sedan D.D.Ville

483
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,720
With a power door locks and an 81 grill

484
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:28,200
It had the cruise control with adjustable seats

485
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,140
And he wore winged toed golf shoes

486
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,680
With retractable cleats

487
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,500
And as he drives the course

488
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,300
He's got a long ball

489
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,540
With his bag of clubs and an 8 o'clock call

490
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,800
Martini's ecstasy with a wooden wedge glue

491
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,420
And he drove a Cadillac Sedan D.D.Ville

492
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:16,220
With a twist of laminate and an olive tube

493
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,060
He drove a Cadillac Sedan D.D.Ville

494
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:36,100
With a fuel injection and an iron pad well

495
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,880
He could drink it all down

496
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,340
With a vodka like swill

497
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,060
And he could smile so wide

498
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,840
Like a Cadillac rule

499
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:03,240
With his little cap and the reason he choose

500
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,120
And he could give a slap

501
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,640
He fulfilled his clues

502
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:22,140
It took him 40 yards just to fit in his shoes

503
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,240
With that Martini ecstasy

504
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,380
You could pay his dues

505
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,380
And he could drive a Cadillac

506
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:56,380


507
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:01,300
With his bag of clubs and an 8 o'clock call

508
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,840
And he drove a Cadillac

509
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,860
With a twist of laminate and an olive tube

510
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:05,860

00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,080
With a twist of laminate and an olive tube

512
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,220
From his own point of view

513
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,440
Ah!

I don't know

553
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,560
you

00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,040

00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,000

635
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,000
Oh, yes, I can feel the spirit.

636
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,740
It's piling up.

637
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,660
It's about washing up the back of Dave's teeth now.

638
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,500
It's going to spill over any minute.

639
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,700
That's a nice one, woman.

640
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,100
He's so full of the slack, it's lapping at his lower lip.

641
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,540
The woman is backing up from the gorge.

642
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,140
Spirits, effluvia, esoteric effluvia.

643
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,860
If he leans forward, the slack will come oozing,

644
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,260
floating out of his mouth like ectoplasm out of a trance medium.

645
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,440
But it ain't no spirit of the dead, friends.

646
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,140
It's the pure essence of slack.

647
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,460
Loves him, Cowboy Dave's slack.

648
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:17,960
Forming in its ectoplasmotic manifestory existence,

649
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,560
hovering in front of his face here in the studio like a green cloud.

650
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:28,140
And it's forming into the shape of whatever he's thinking about, which is...

651
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,480
I believe, oh, it's Chelsea from that new rave magazine.

652
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,340
I recognize that pose.

653
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,180
He's thinking of the cover.

654
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,640
We are happy to serve you.

655
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,360
Now it's dissipating.

656
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:47,060
A cloud of slack in the shape of a naked girl.

657
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,300
And it's pretty...

658
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,100
Dave, that's not exactly like sophisticated or PC.

659
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,600
But it's honest, friends.

660
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,840
And that's what happens.

661
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,260
He hit up on that chicken.

662
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,780
I mean, he had a hit of the chicken.

663
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:08,340
And the slack splashed out in the form of whatever he was thinking about.

664
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:16,680
Dave was in Dobbstown for six months learning just that one trick.

665
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,500
Now, anything I think of for long enough time,

666
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,820
using the alien machinery,

667
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,680
which doesn't really exist as machinery,

668
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,740
I can will into existence

669
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:32,180
any kind of dog-faced boy or miscreant vehicle

670
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,780
or three-wheel bike to wheel around the block

671
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,720
and sleep in a dumpster.

672
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:43,180
Friends, we just saw a series of images form outside of Dave's head.

673
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,000
It ended with a tricycle.

674
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,700
I noticed he went through a whole bunch of things.

675
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,020
There was a picture of JoJo, the dog-faced boy.

676
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,880
Old, you know, turn-of-the-century photograph.

677
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,120
There was...

678
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:58,660
There was that picture of Kool-Aid with the face drawn on it.

679
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,460
I don't think he even mentioned that one.

680
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,940
It's a stream of consciousness visualizing.

681
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,860
It externally...

682
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,460
Well, it causes the hallucinations to be externalized,

683
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,600
is what the catalog says.

684
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,740
And you're saying that as the illusions are formed in the mind of the individual,

685
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,780
then they're made concrete?

686
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,240
And then they're...

687
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,200
Well, they're not concrete.

688
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,120
They're just an image.

689
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,200
They're just an image, like a hologram,

690
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,300
that forms outside the head.

691
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,440
But you can't photograph it.

692
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,560
Other people can see it.

693
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,380
But only...

694
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,480
Like, we've done experiments.

695
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,700
Dogs can't see it.

696
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,740
You can't photograph it.

697
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,420
But other people will see it.

698
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,400
Because it's that...

699
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,760
It's on that etheric level.

700
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,580
The slack itself is invisible to the normals.

701
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:46,140
To the subgeniuses, we're floating in a sea of slack.

702
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,020
We're floating in a sea of pills, for that matter.

703
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,920
But you're just too blind, deaf, and dumb to stick your tongue out.

704
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,700
Just...

705
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,400
Just chaw down on them.

706
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,220
You're floating in a sea of slack, my friends.

707
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,080
But I'll tell you something about slack.

708
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,460
If slack was water, Bob Dobbs would be surfing.

709
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,220
But you'd be drowning.

710
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:06,620
Mmm...

711
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,480
Mmm...

712
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,380
There it goes, leaking out of Dave's mouth and nose again.

713
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,420
He's all filled up with that slack.

714
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,020
He's got that...

715
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:19,360
He's got that special trepanated brow.

716
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:20,840
Mmm...

717
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,080
Mmm...

718
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,620
He took out a hole about the size of a quarter.

719
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,540
Out of the front of his skull.

720
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,200
Didn't even bother to transplant some skin over it or sew it back.

721
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:30,780
It's just...

722
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,220
The corpus corallosum is exposed.

723
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,680
Supreme serenity.

724
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,760
Supreme serenity.

725
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,400
He sees Bob even when Bob ain't there.

726
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,300
Supreme serenity.

727
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,840
And you know, friends, God is everything.

728
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,840
But Bob has already been everything else.

729
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,060
All the kids in my neighborhood...

730
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,480
Look like Bob Dobbs.

731
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,080
What?

732
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,040
All the kids in my neighborhood smoke pipes.

733
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,880
All the kids in my neighborhood are proud to be Bob Dobbs.

734
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,360
And if they ain't Bob Dobbs...

735
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:03,860
They die.

736
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:04,960
We kill them.

737
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:05,840
We kill them.

738
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,060
I'm gonna kill them.

739
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:07,880
Kill them dead.

740
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,580
And if they are Bob Dobbs...

741
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,440
We kill them.

742
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,640
We kill them dead.

743
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,340
You're Bob Dobbs.

744
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,500
You're Bob Dobbs, too, aren't you?

745
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,000
I'm gonna kill you.

746
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,000
I'm gonna kill you first.

747
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,720
You ain't gonna kill me until I get up to you.

748
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,940
Well, I like this church.

749
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,700
Everybody turns into Bob Dobbs,

750
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,300
and they can all sit in the pews and be exactly alike,

751
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,700
and if anybody's different, then they can hate him.

752
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,160
Hate him, hate him, hate, hate.

753
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,800
Oh, I love to hate.

754
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,840
I hate Bobbies.

755
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,320
Everybody comes by me hating fair and square.

756
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,320
Eek, eek, eek, eek, eek.

757
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,920
Er, er, er, er, er.

758
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,120
I'm the good ship Dobbs,

759
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,480
sailing the seas of slack.

760
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,520
The mistletoe.

761
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,180
Pirating and looting of the pig carpet.

762
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,900
Raiders out there.

763
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,440
Looting them on the information highway as well.

764
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:54,960
Arr.

765
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,300
The Spanish.

766
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:56,900
We pull our...

767
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,480
Just looting, looting.

768
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:03,860
We pull our Corsairs up to their modems

769
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,240
and climb right aboard.

770
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,380
Climb right aboard.

771
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,520
We created an interactive CD-ROM game

772
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,520
that hooks your checkbook account up to the Internet

773
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,600
every minute you spend shooting those funny Dobbs figures

774
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,300
rushing at you down that corridor.

775
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,400
Every...

776
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:19,840
Every penny.

777
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:20,740
Every...

778
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:23,360
A penny a second goes straight to the home

779
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,100
for slackless children.

780
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,500
Dear friends, look at this little child here.

781
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,460
He's not allowed to play with...

782
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,060
At home, with his human parents,

783
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,400
this child wasn't allowed to play with

784
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,260
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

785
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,820
He-Man, Transformers, or Playboy magazines.

786
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,460
No, that's right, Ivan.

787
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,600
This child wasn't even allowed to play with himself.

788
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,560
This child was severely deprived.

789
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,380
Doesn't that just make your heart...

790
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:49,620
Doesn't that just make your heart bleed?

791
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,540
Doesn't that just make tears well up in your eyes to think,

792
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,980
these poor little...

793
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:56,420
These children may have the subgenius gene.

794
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,700
It could be triggered by exposure to enough...

795
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,800
Well, let's just call it information.

796
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,360
Pornological Irritainment, we call it.

797
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,340
And, uh, it's...

798
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,020
You know, it's...

799
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:09,800
It's the...

800
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,080
It's something you can do with that excess money.

801
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,600
The government's just gonna take it.

802
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,660
The government should...

803
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,920
Do you want to give it to the government

804
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,360
so they can spend more on socialized highway buses?

805
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:19,360


806
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,140
Bridge building. Bridge...

807
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,260
Bridge building.

808
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,320
You want to just let the government take it?

809
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:24,760
Or you...

810
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,060
Or...

811
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,960
You know, if it has to be gone anyway,

812
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,760
give it at the Home for Slackless Children,

813
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,020
Dobstown, Malaysia.

814
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,500
Tax-exempt.

815
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,340
These children aren't going to cry very much longer,

816
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,060
are they, Ivan?

817
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,760
These children are going straight away to that home

818
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,520
and perhaps find themselves in some sort of

819
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,680
non-mystical, non-experiential way.

820
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,800
Perhaps they don't even really exist, do they?

821
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,520
We don't make those kids...

822
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,580
memorize boring religious passages.

823
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,400
We give them video games.

824
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:58,460
We give them Wolfenstein 3.0 in 3D.

825
00:46:58,740 --> 00:46:59,060
We...

826
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,260
We give them Army...

827
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,700
We give them the complete G.I. Joe set.

828
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,320
We give them Barbie...

829
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,580
Barbie's Dream House, Barbie's Dream Kitchen.

830
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,540
But, of course, you know,

831
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,760
we don't want to train those little girls to be...

832
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,780
to grow up to be pink girls.

833
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,740
We want them to be subgenius girls.

834
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,500
You know?

835
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,460
And it's all in virtual reality, isn't it, Reverend?

836
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:20,840
That's right.

837
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,120
So that's why we change those Barbie dolls

838
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,840
before we give them to the girls.

839
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,160
We...

840
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,120
We make them...

841
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,420
We kind of morph them between a Barbie

842
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,320
and the Star Wars characters.

843
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,500
Now, when the ectoplasm comes out of...

844
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,240
Gives them more character.

845
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:33,820
Yes.

846
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,420
But when the ectoplasm comes out of their mouths,

847
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:37,380
doesn't that...

848
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,980
Wouldn't it ruin a Barbie set?

849
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,360
Oh, but when you see a room full of kindergarten-age children

850
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,380
with green...

851
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,500
Slactoplasm oozing out of their nostrils, ears, and...

852
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:48,500


853
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,160
Mouths.

854
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,720
Their eyes rolled back in ecstasy.

855
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,520
Girating them.

856
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,900
Forgetting their evil conspiracy toilet training forever.

857
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,100
Doing their bank statements.

858
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,640
Chewing on their pencils.

859
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,580
We encourage them to chew on their pencils.

860
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,040
We encourage them to break their crayons into millions of bits.

861
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,020
We encourage them to pick on each other,

862
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,140
gang up and bully each other,

863
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,540
and ostracize members.

864
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:15,040
We want them to learn the way things are in the real world,

865
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,500
where they can do anything but...

866
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,400
But they're gonna have to pay the price.

867
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,700
You know?

868
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,400
It's the school of hard knocks.

869
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,820
If more kids were raised in the school of hard knocks,

870
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,200
I don't think America would be where it is today.

871
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,480
That's right, Reverend.

872
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,440
I think the school of hard knocks would knock some sense into these kids' heads.

873
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,120
Beat them all.

874
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:39,280
They'd quit huffing paint and Dave Brain,

875
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,960
drilling holes in their heads,

876
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:46,060
and hooking internet superhighways in one ear and out the other.

877
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:50,160
Why, friends, I think if you just give your money to Home for Slackless Children,

878
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,900
we could turn America around.

879
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,200
We could sure do that.

880
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:58,200
We could string up normals from trees like they've been doing to weirdos

881
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,620
for years and years...

882
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,220
for centuries.

883
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,280
For a thousand...

884
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:01,680
Comes and goes around.

885
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,060
You know who built the pyramids?

886
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:04,060
We did.

887
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,360
Well, no, well, no.

888
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,920
Actually, a bunch of stupid, normal religious fanatics.

889
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,200
They did it.

890
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,200
But you know who designed the pyramids?

891
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:10,580
We did.

892
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,360
We did.

893
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,380
We stood there and said,

894
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,760
you know, we'd love to be hauling those...

895
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,620
4,000-ton rocks up that slope with you men,

896
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,300
but they need us here,

897
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,620
telling the king that the gods want this pyramid built.

898
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:27,380
Yeah, now look here.

899
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,940
See, Pharaoh, what we got here,

900
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,220
we got a conjunction of Mars and Venus in the constellation Cygnus.

901
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,400
And Phos and Ra are in conjunction.

902
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,360
Yeah, yeah, Ra and Phos, yeah.

903
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,300
Isis and Osiris are about to collide.

904
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:39,620
Right, right.

905
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,140
And, you know, when the river starts flooding,

906
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,040
you know what's gonna happen with Asakoth,

907
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,140
or, I mean, Osiris.

908
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,080
That's not really how we should be.

909
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:46,600
That's right.

910
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,120
So the gods will kill us

911
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,140
if we don't make all the dupes build the pyramid.

912
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,940
Make the dupes build the pyramids in the name of the gods.

913
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,440
But who will design this pyramid?

914
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,220
Will you, the subgenius high priest, design the pyramid?

915
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:58,400
That's slack.

916
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,280
Uh, nay.

917
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,720
We will get this talented normal to do the actual math.

918
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,580
We will pay him four tamarins, three dates, and a donut.

919
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,720
But we know it wants to be gold.

920
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,980
The gods want it to be covered with gold,

921
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,760
and it has to look like that thing

922
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,500
that the humans will use on their dollar bills,

923
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,820
but without the eye.

924
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,900
The mighty pyramid.

925
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,900
The symbol of the equilibrium between the controller

926
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,720
and the control.

927
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,200
It's a bloodshot eye.

928
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:32,640
As long as somebody's wielding the whip,

929
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,620
somebody else is gonna walk out and say,

930
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,260
Whip me.

931
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,880
Come on, whip me.

932
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:41,160
I mean, which one would you rather be, my friend?

933
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,500
Oh, you wanna be that whooped,

934
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:44,480
huge,

935
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:49,920
human, feeling the sting of that master's whip, or do you want to be one of the masters?

936
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:55,400
Those who, or do you want to be the parasite that lives off those evil masters and those

937
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,240
stupid dudes?

938
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,560
I want to be a parasitist.

939
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,500
There you go, kids.

940
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:06,120
Now you're thinking, like the mighty tick, which kills, does not, the predator kills

941
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,320
the prey, but the parasite kills neither.

942
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,840
It torments.

943
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,600
It torments all equally.

944
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:19,400
And we, the subgeniuses, are the parasites, the ticks upon the body politic.

945
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,180
A politic.

946
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,900
We made a joke on it.

947
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:28,760
Anyway, seriously, though, to continue in a more serious vein.

948
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,480
In that the body politic is made of a vermin, shouldn't it be?

949
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:39,500
We may be called, sure, they call us vermin, and they consider that an insult.

950
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,820
Spermin vermin?

951
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,660
To us, that's a compliment.

952
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,360
Yes.

953
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,180
Yes.

954
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,480
Well, not the highest.

955
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,240
One of the third, well, maybe the fifth highest compliment.

956
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:53,300
And in faith, we march these children down the hill out of the home for slackless children

957
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:59,280
and out to the fields where they learn slack work with little tape decks around their necks

958
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,640
listening to this show and picking, uh, soya beans, cotton, and so forth.

959
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:05,600
Oh, it's beautiful.

960
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,100
We have little crops up there.

961
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:06,860
It's lovely.

962
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:07,180
It's beautiful.

963
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:12,160
They are taught, they are taught, uh, the slack yoga of service.

964
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,520
But they learn words.

965
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:13,780
They learn to work.

966
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:14,040
You see?

967
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:14,760
As slack.

968
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,420
Great idea, huh?

969
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,540
That was one of Bob's most brilliant.

970
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,020
It was sort of like passive resistance, you know?

971
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,800
It was, right.

972
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,000
So, uh.

973
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,880
A brilliant thinker.

974
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,540
Better than L. Ron Hubbard, I must say.

975
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,460
Much, much more, well, it's, well, he has a squarer face I think.

976
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,900
L. Ron was a sex god, man.

977
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,160
Well, nobody competes with Bob, I know.

978
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:35,740
Oh, no.

979
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:41,280
Well, needless to say, you know, you know there's a story, possibly apocryphal, that

980
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,500
when the last time Bob was sent to the hospital.

981
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:43,800
To hell.

982
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:44,320
To hell.

983
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,400
That he cuckolded the devil.

984
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,460
I've heard that story.

985
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:50,760
Yes, that he was even a better tempter than the devil.

986
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,700
And he cheated too at times, didn't he?

987
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,400
And that he, he put, he put two more horns on the devil, you might say.

988
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:55,860
Oh my God.

989
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:56,680
Yes.

990
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:59,620
And Satan cast Bob from hell.

991
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:02,440
And since he was never baptized, he can't go to heaven.

992
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,220
So, he's back on earth.

993
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,400
He can try to kill him.

994
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:05,880
Hell, we did.

995
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,280
We were the first ones to try.

996
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,220
You may hate this Bob stuff, right?

997
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,980
You don't think that occurred to us too?

998
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:12,620
Oh.

999
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:13,680
We tried to get out.

1000
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,160
We tried to get out back in 84.

1001
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,780
But, go ahead, blow him away.

1002
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,620
Put ten bullets through Bob's head.

1003
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,380
He's gonna come like a cartoon character there.

1004
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,780
He'll be again grinning at you.

1005
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,520
It never stops.

1006
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,960
It never stops.

1007
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:28,840
He just can't die.

1008
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,620
My mind always hurts.

1009
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,440
It is painful.

1010
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,080
It is very painful.

1011
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,460
And he just won't ever die, will he?

1012
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,640
He just keeps coming back and coming back.

1013
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,240
It's phenomenal.

1014
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,400
It's kind of like this song.

1015
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,480
Well, we have a song about Bob called The Song That Will Never Die.

1016
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,780
It's about a man who has a heart that refused to die.

1017
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,880
Should we sing it or not?

1018
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,300
We've been singing it for the last hour and a half, Dave.

1019
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,640
It won't go away either, will it?

1020
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,600
No, you can't.

1021
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:56,360
You know, the ironic thing is the song, in a way it wants to die.

1022
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,700
But it cannot die.

1023
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,900
It just crawls on fitfully.

1024
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,560
Sometimes it picks up and really cooks.

1025
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:08,420
And people go, okay, it's gonna build to a halt and it's gonna be over, you know.

1026
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:12,260
And it might be over for a little while, but oh no.

1027
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,540
It picks up again.

1028
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,420
Just like a mighty stick.

1029
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,960
Like a patient on an operating table.

1030
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,100
That's right.

1031
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,380
And you die and you zap it.

1032
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:25,740
Because the guitar player might die, but some other guitar player will come along.

1033
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:26,200
That's right.

1034
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,400
The drummer might die.

1035
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,940
Some other drummer.

1036
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:35,180
Or else a car that just blew a tire, the wheel flapping will be the percussion for the song.

1037
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:35,660
That's right.

1038
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,580
That's the way we play it.

1039
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:36,980
That refused to die.

1040
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:41,580
And, you know, the audience has changed a million times.

1041
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,100
You know, they went away.

1042
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:43,960
I remember when you were a pig.

1043
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,100
There's always more.

1044
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:45,980
That pig, very, very tall.

1045
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:46,480
I remember.

1046
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:46,940
I loved that.

1047
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,040
There's always some sort of odd.

1048
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,400
And they may flee the song.

1049
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,340
They may try to kill.

1050
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,940
They tried nuclear.

1051
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:59,020
Years ago, back in the 50s, they tried nuclear weapons on the bomb.

1052
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,780
Bullets could not stop it.

1053
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,200
Flamethrowers, paper cuts, nothing.

1054
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:04,220
Nothing.

1055
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,000
No cosmetic has ever been erased.

1056
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,620
It would get real ugly.

1057
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,500
It would get real damn ugly.

1058
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,160
And it would grow 50 feet tall.

1059
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:15,700
You know, it was like the more you tried to kill the song that refused to die, the louder

1060
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:18,720
and meaner and more horrible it would get.

1061
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,940
The survival mechanism, mechanism, mechanism.

1062
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:26,600
It was an artificial intelligence of its own.

1063
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,700
Of its own kind.

1064
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,000
Yeah.

1065
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,720
You'd think it was all petered out.

1066
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,060
Oh, yeah.

1067
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,500
But it would...

1068
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,660
Peter on.

1069
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,300
Yes.

1070
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,280
Peter's out or Peter's in.

1071
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,920
It would rise from its deathbed.

1072
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,140
It would rise from its deathbed.

1073
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:41,140


1074
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:41,140


1075
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:41,140


1076
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:41,860
It would be like a vampire.

1077
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,860
And spring into erect awareness.

1078
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,820
More musicians would be drawn in.

1079
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,020
It would sap the life force out of them.

1080
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,320
Like a glowing bolt of bolt weight.

1081
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:53,820
People...

1082
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,420
The song itself tried to warn people about the song.

1083
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:02,060
I mean, part of the lyrics of the song were about how dangerous the song was.

1084
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:02,560
We warned them.

1085
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:02,880
We did.

1086
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:03,880
We actually warned them.

1087
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,840
It begged its listeners to kill it.

1088
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,760
It begged for them to kill it.

1089
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,080
But when they killed it, it refused to die.

1090
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,720
They tried to kill it.

1091
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:19,120
You could not kill the song.

1092
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,900
The song couldn't commit suicide.

1093
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,340
Refused to die.

1094
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:23,820
To die.

1095
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:30,220
The song was just an overlapping rhythmic notation in the back of his head.

1096
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,180
Oh, sometimes it wasn't music at all.

1097
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,480
Sometimes it was an earthquake.

1098
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:38,760
In San Francisco, sometimes it was a toxic insecticide.

1099
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:39,740
Yeah.

1100
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,100
It was a toxic insecticide spill in India.

1101
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:41,960
He remembered.

1102
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:42,540
Yeah.

1103
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,260
It might be a secret government cover-up one other month.

1104
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,240
But it was still basically the song that refused to die.

1105
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,540
Sometimes it would be a radio show.

1106
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:55,280
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1107
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:59,380
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1108
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,000
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1109
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,960
Got your pencil ready?

1110
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:08,760
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1111
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,660
That's Bob, P.O.

1112
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:16,420
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1113
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,300
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1114
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:23,000
Give me back the burning wall.

1115
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,120
Give me a start in St. Paul.

1116
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,580
I've seen the future, brother.

1117
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,820
It is my dawn.

1118
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,560
It is your dawn.

1119
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:35,480
Things are gonna slide.

1120
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,540
Slide in all directions.

1121
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,360
Move and nothing.

1122
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,900
Won't be nothing.

1123
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,800
You can't measure anymore.

1124
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,000
The blizzard.

1125
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,940
The blizzard of the world has crossed the threshold

1126
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:56,600
and it's overturned the order of the soul.

1127
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:03,700
When they say, they say, repent, repent, repent, repent,

1128
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:07,020
I wonder what they mean.

1129
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:13,840
When they say, they say, repent, repent, repent, repent,

1130
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,880
Amen.

1131
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,880
I wonder what they mean.

1132
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:23,580
When they say, they say, repent, repent, repent, repent.

1133
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:26,760
I wonder what they means.
