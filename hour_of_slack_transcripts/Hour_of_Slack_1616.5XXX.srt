Godzilla alert level three. All personnel to action stations.

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,900
Hey, what's this?

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,340
What's that?

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,320
It's a...

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,080
Subgenius Power of Swag.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,360
Get from me.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,360
Son of a bitch.

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,360
Hello. Hello, sir. It's lovely to see you again. Are you well?

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,660
It's a Godzilla-saur.

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,560
What's a Godzilla-saur?

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,140
Uh, hey, wait. You can't come in here. It's off limits. You can't stay here.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,960
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,300
From PR News in Washington, I'm still emerging.

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,200
U.S. officials say the U.S. had numerous aircraft, aircraft, aircraft, that it's uncertain.

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,640
The White House says it authorized PR's reports.

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,980
The White House says it authorized PR's reports.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,340
The White House says it was a complex operation.

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,580
The Vatican says Pakistani forces say this is PR.

20
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,940
Mourners are preparing to wake up a PR News that's on its way to Washington.

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,580
Father has taught John to spit into the toilet.

00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,900
It's a

It's a

00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,260
It's a

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

43
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,120
Little

44
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,160
Donnie was

45
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,000
in Moscow

46
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,020
one day

47
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,560
lonely little

48
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,300
trumpet boy

49
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:45,960
you know

50
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,500
what they

51
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,000
say

52
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,460
it's a

53
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,080
very long

54
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,580
since he

55
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:49,880
had a

56
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,320
special

57
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,040
surprise

58
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,800
he had

59
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,000
some

60
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,480
spittle

61
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:52,920
on his

62
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,300
chin

63
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,000
a little

64
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,720
twinkle

65
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,160
in his

66
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,660
eyes

67
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,260
took out

68
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,840
his phone

69
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,800
and punched

70
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,380
a few

71
00:07:59,380 --> 00:07:59,940
numbers

72
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,140
woke up

73
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,640
Vlad his

74
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,060
girlfriend

75
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,240
she

76
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,180
from a very deep slumber

77
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,220
Said he had some rubles and a lot of spare time

78
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,720
If these ladies had a diaper and some nursery rhymes

79
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,360
Nice action out the back side, baby

80
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,380
Get out the rubber sheets and get a good view

81
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,840
Nice action out the back side, baby

82
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,820
Lean back and open your mouth before they spew

83
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,160
Now everybody knows that he's a pussy-grabbin' fascist boy

84
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,340
Deutschland, Deutschland, Uber, Ryan

85
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,200
But they ain't seen his genocide when he's playing coy

86
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,420
He lets out a little squeal when he's gettin' his way

87
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,740
His nipples perk up and his belly starts to sway

88
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,240
Headed to the toilet when he's done

89
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,180
With his hookers by his side

90
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,460
They're gonna bring some discipline

91
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,220
But Trumpy will abide

92
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,900
A gentle yellow spray and a cascade of dung

93
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,460
Donny Boy's so happy when it's rollin' off his tongue

94
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,440
Nice action out the back side, baby

95
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,520
They got a presidential treat for you

96
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,140
Nice action out the back side, baby

97
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,060
Beg and crawl like the little worm you are

98
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,980
Here comes your poo

99
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,760
Trumpet board giggles when they fetch out the whips

100
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,900
Trumpet board giggles when they fetch out the whips

101
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,200
He got stubby little fingers wipin' urine from his lips

102
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,380
Starts to get excited when they're reachin' for his balls

103
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,660
But the glove slides off because they're just too small

104
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,260
Nice action out the back side, baby

105
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,400
What's all that stuff that be squirtin' on you?

106
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,840
Nice action out the back side, baby

107
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Tilt your head and open your mouth

108
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,760
Here comes your poo

109
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,200
Here comes your poo

110
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,400
Here comes your poo

111
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,180
Nice action out the back side

112
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,300
Trumpet board music

113
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,380
Thank you

114
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,260
The Rudy Schwartz Project

115
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,620
Nice action from the back side

116
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,280
on the new CD, Tango Lessons in a Fascist Whorehouse

117
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,780
which is on DC Jam Records

118
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,320
More from that album soon

119
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,020
But here, recorded live at 19X Day Drill

120
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,460
Saint Andrew the Impaled

121
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,420
Now here is the natural response

122
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,660
to whenever you're faced with this prospect

123
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,960
They say reconcile with the wife

124
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,040
I say fuck it

125
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,480
They say fix the holes in your life

126
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,560
I say fuck it

127
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,280
Might seem I'm leaving in a rush

128
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,180
But a man can only take so much

129
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,720
So I grabbed just some of my stuff

130
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,900
And I said fuck it

131
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,420
I said fuck it

132
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,000
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it

133
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,740
I said fuck it

134
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,200
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it

135
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,060
And if you don't agree, my friend

136
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,840
Don't make no difference in the end

137
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,540
Cause in the end, all I have to say is

138
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,060
Fuck it

139
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,920
They say get to work on time

140
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,900
I say fuck it

141
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,000
They say write a clever rhyme

142
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,120
I say fuck it

143
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,840
Cause here's one thing that I've observed

144
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,680
To rhyme some words don't take much nerve

145
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,900
And it might seem quite absurd

146
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,060
But I say fuck it

147
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,540
I said fuck it

148
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,020
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it

149
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,760
I said fuck it

150
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,200
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it

151
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,200
And I don't care if I lose my job

152
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,800
I don't care if I become a slob

153
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,160
My conscience has been robbed

154
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
And I say fuck it

155
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,500
Oh, now we're gonna fuck it in this key

156
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,280
They say you gotta pay your bills

157
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,180
I say fuck it

158
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,400
They say you can't be drinking swill

159
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,340
I say fuck it

160
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,120
Cause if I could afford better than swill

161
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,860
I'd probably be able to pay my bills

162
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,080
But then again, I might just say fuck it

163
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,600
I said fuck it

164
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,000
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it

165
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,700
I said fuck it

166
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,080
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it

167
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,920
And if you got a better way

168
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,600
Go tell me on some other day

169
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,960
Cause on this day all I have to say is fuck it

170
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,820
They say you love your enemies

171
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,860
I say

172
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,620
Fuck that

173
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,040
They say try to keep the peace

174
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,860
I say

175
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,760
Fuck that too hard

176
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,440
Cause I gotta tell you girls and boys

177
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,920
This angry man's gonna make some noise

178
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,500
And it truly is a joy to say fuck it

179
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,180
They say watch what you eat

180
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,060
I say fuck it

181
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,160
Put the lid down on the seat

182
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,060
I say fuck it

183
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,580
Cause I'm gonna live just how I do

184
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,240
I don't need no advice from you

185
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,440
Cause when I hear advice I say fuck it

186
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,880
I say fuck it

187
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,420
I say fuck it

188
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:56,880
Fuck it

189
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,820
I said fuck it

190
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,000
And if you think my song is crude

191
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,380
Or you're put off by my attitude

192
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,880
There's one thing you can do

193
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,900
And that is suck it

194
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,320
They say

195
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,520

196
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,460

197
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,080

198
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,200
Live at X Day

199
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,260
And now a little mashup we've been saving for a year

200
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,120
By Reverend Joe Jeziorski

201
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,640
Me?

202
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,620
I'm a preacher

203
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,800
I'm the Lord's servant

204
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,400
I want to inform you that

205
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,120
Moses said that sodomites should be stoned

206
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,360
Stoned

207
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,480
It's right there in the book of Leviticus

208
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,020
Every sodomite needs to be stoned

209
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,200
Stoned

210
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,540
A century ago

211
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,420
Cocaine was the only thing that was stoned

212
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:56,420


213
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:56,420


214
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,900
Cocaine was put in Coca-Cola

215
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,800
Cocaine flavored up Coca-Cola

216
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,660
They were actually using cocaine

217
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,820
The sodomites

218
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,920
Has done the exact same thing

219
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,340
That Coca-Cola has done

220
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,420
Except they've done it with semen

221
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,480
Male semen

222
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,420
And the truth is now coming out

223
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,220
A sodomite named Bahamas Mama

224
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,080
Discovered that semen

225
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,880
Flavors up coffee

226
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
And it makes you think

227
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,360
You're having a good time

228
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,520
Drinking that cup of latte

229
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,640
With the semen in it

230
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,460
I'm not making this up

231
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,100
And it flavors up

232
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,360
The coffee

233
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,760
Soda by latte

234
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,780
Soda by latte

235
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,520
A number of people think

236
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,500
That drinking semen is a good idea

237
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,860
You know a number of people

238
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,500
Think that semen tastes good

239
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,340
You've got a little idea

240
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,380
There's millions of people

241
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,360
Around the world

242
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,200
Who really think that

243
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,040
The taste of semen is good

244
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,840
They've discovered

245
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,580
That since people like semen

246
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,120
And there's so many people

247
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,560
Drinking it from one another

248
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,640
Why not put it in our coffees?

249
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,640
Soda by latte

250
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,420
My question is

251
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,640
Where are they getting all this semen?

252
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,920
They're getting this semen

253
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,060

263
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,440

00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,660
I had no ball.

315
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:06,220
She told me a hamburger has a special protocol.

And soon your thoughts will be...

467
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,320
Your thoughts shall all be mine.

468
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,440
Watch the pretty coin of gold.

00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,220
And you will do as you are told.

00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,720

I see the way you spread your lies

494
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,380
Who knows what's in your head

495
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:56,780
And frankly, who gives a shot?

496
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,860

This next song is a song called Have Life.

510
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,020
It goes a little something like this.

511
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,360
All right. It goes exactly like this.

512
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,600
Not exactly.

513
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,300
That was Pilgrim Speakeasy.

514
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,000
I've been waiting a year to play that one, too.

515
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,440
But this next one is brand spanking new from the Rudy Schwartz Project.

516
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,140

00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,300
Sweet that pack of noodles

518
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,400
In the nobleness

519
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,860
Or at the snow bar

520
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,380
When you want to find me

521
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,960
You have to dress up

522
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,320
In all the little bars

523
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,320
You read my name on all the ice

524
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,640
And on the windows of the bistro

525
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,560
A tapas de coin, that's my palace

526
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,240
Where I find my friends in the evening

527
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,820
My friend, it's me

528
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,240
I'm happier than a king

529
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,600
I'm happier than a king

530
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:33,600


531
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,280
I'm happier than a king

532
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,180
I never get soft

533
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,160
In all this

534
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,800
I push myself

535
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,320
In the shoulders

536
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,740
I cross my sweet thoughts

537
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:45,440
Why?

538
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,700
Why be a jerk?

539
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,240
My dick, my dick

540
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,120
It's enough to be a dick

541
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,660
As painful as I am

542
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,260
I'm really a little...

543
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:10,820
I want to make money

544
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,040
I'm going to kill myself

545
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,700
I'm 9 hours

546
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:18,700

I take them all, I push myself

The shadows, I have them all

553
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,260
They all have a reason

554
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,440
Why? Because to be a recumbent

555
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,820
My pommel, my pommel

556
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,820
It's enough to be in his hands

577
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,880
Stay like a beast, stay like a dog

578
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,740
No matter how, no matter what

579
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,740
I've never been a genius or a poor old prestige

580
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,400
I've never been a genius or a poor old prestige

581
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,000
You ain't seen nothing yet, you ain't seen nothing yet

582
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,700
It'll burn it, burn it back, burn it, burn it...

583
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:36,820
Butthole

584
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:38,880
Butthole

585
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:40,820
Butthole

586
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:42,900
Butthole

587
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:44,780
Butthole

588
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,180
Butthole

589
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:46,740
Butthole

00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:46,740

Every sodomite, every sodomite has um a penis ejected into my butthole.

Amen!

620
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,040
And you needed as best as diaper to be able to keep that flame from burning a hole in your pants!

621
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,500
You ain't seen nothing yet!

622
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,160
I got a penis injected in the butthole!

623
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,740
I got a penis injected in the butthole of every sodomite!

624
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,100
Every sodomite!

625
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,020
Every sodomite has a penis injected in my butthole!

626
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,500
I gotta burn it in my butthole!

627
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,220
I got a fire!

628
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,820
I got a flame coming out of my butthole!

629
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:22,580
God!

630
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,380
I'm gonna be the best sodomite!

631
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,080
I gotta give it a try!

632
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,340
The flame coming out of the butthole!

633
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:26,900
Jesus!

634
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,460
Come in T-My-Butt!

635
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,800
T-D-J's strep no doubt!

636

Rock the sand on bottom!

637
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,960
Come in T-My-Butt!

638
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,480
You gotta go and pray to God and ask God to come in T-My-Butt!

639
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,180
When that penis comes out, the flame will start burning!

640
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,740
Yeah, I got the word in my butthole!

641
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,240
I got the healing word in my butthole!

642
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,040
I got the word in my butthole right now!

643
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:43,600
Amen!

644
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,280
Yeah, I got the word in my butthole!

645
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,000
God!

646
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,560
God!

647
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,720
God!

648
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,560
God!

649
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:00,560


650
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:00,820
Butterfly!

651
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:01,760
Butterfly!

652
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,440
God!

653
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,840
Butterfly!

654
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:05,800
God!

655
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,820
Butterfly!

656
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,760
God!

657
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,780
Butterfly!

658
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,540
God!

659
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:10,700
Butterfly!

660
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,620
Go!

661
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:11,960


662
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:11,960


663
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,040
Butterfly!

664
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:13,020


665
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,000
Hohoh!

666
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:18,200
Umm...

667
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:18,200


668
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,180
Butthole.

669
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:19,520
Burn.

670
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,160
Burn.

671
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:20,600
Butthole.

672
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:20,900
Burn.

673
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,540
Butthole.

674
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:22,440
God!

675
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:25,820
Burn it.

676
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,220
Burn it.

677
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:26,700
Butthole.

678
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,240
Butthole.

679
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:27,780
Butthole.

680
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,800
He can't sit down.

681
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,140
He's got a burning in his butthole.

682
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:31,760
He's got a fire.

683
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,140
He's got a flame coming outta his butthole.

684
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,300
God's gonna have a flame coming outta your butthole.

685
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,900
You're going to have a flame coming outta your butthole

686
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,480
And all that is within you.

687
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,440
Hallelujah.

688
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:41,780
And amen.

689
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,080
And amen.

690
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,440
Amen.

691
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,180
Butthole.

692
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:46,480
Butthole.

693
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:46,980
Butthole.

694
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:50,760
God!

695
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,880
Shane Stedham and Dr. Clovis Puth did that.

696
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,660
A little ditty called Burnin' Butthole.

697
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,100
And before that, Burn Bridges.

698
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,120
What a coincidence.

699
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:13,780
Now back to 19X Day Drill with St. Andrew the Impaled ending

700
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,480
after numerous starts and parts.

701
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,380
His great subgenius song Saucer Built for One.

702
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,620
As seen on YouTube channel Revstang.

703
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,560
Where was I? Eight?

704
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,100
Now Saucer Built for Eight.

705
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,660
I know that sounds just great.

706
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,260
But I'm starting now to recognize a trend.

707
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,020
I'd bettered out for nine and then I changed my mind

708
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,120
so fucking kids I'm skipping ahead to ten.

709
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,340
And my saucer built for ten.

710
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,000
A mobile pleasure den.

711
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,320
A hedonistic hoedown on its way.

712
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,960
To that sexy slack filled place.

713
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,360
A way up there in space.

714
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,980
We were promised we'd be ready come X Day.

715
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,740
Now a saucer built for ten.

716
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,000
You might think that's the end.

717
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,780
But I hate to let down my subgenius brethren.

718
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,440
So I put an extra door as I put some bean bags on the floor.

719
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,640
Now I'm proud to say my saucer seats eleven.

720
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,940
Oh and my saucer for eleven.

721
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,460
We got, uh, my saucer seats eleven.

722
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:16,460


723
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:16,460


724
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:16,460


725
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,680
My libido won't be ebbin'.

726
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,780
In fact I might become a better lay.

727
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,400
Cause I'll learn from the best.

728
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,980
And I'll practice on the rest.

729
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,800
As we all make each other.

730
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,040
Come X Day.

731
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,640
Now a saucer for eleven.

732
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,700
Oh my this place is gettin'

733
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,280
to be one where it's hard to hear yourself.

734
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,080
Over all the grunts and moans.

735
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,400
So I put in some headphones.

736
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,000
That'll be perfect for my saucer built for twelve.

737
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,360
Yeah my saucer built for twelve.

738
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:44,940
Uh.

739
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:45,660
Uh.

740
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,120
Oh dear Bob the smell.

741
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,860
And the furniture all has a sticky sheen.

742
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,360
But if that ain't quite enough.

743
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,860
Well I hate to say it tough.

744
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,700
I ain't workin' on a saucer for thirteen.

745
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,680
No my saucer built for twelve.

746
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,180
Will suit us all real well.

747
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,580
As we go tearin' across the Milky Way.

748
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,300
As we go tearin' across the Milky Way.

749
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,740
And no one's gettin' off.

750
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,500
And no one's gettin' off.

751
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,620
Well everyone's getting off.

752
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,920
And no we'll never stop.

753
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:14,920


754
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:19,280
Unless we go by that moon of Saturn.

755
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,160
And it's all methane.

756
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,420
Like it has methane weather.

757
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,440
Like liquid methane.

758
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,780
And methane like you know ice.

759
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,800
And there's like water ice in the mountains.

760
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,680
Cause I wanna drop a match on that.

761
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,780
I mean like I know nothing will happen.

762
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,480
Cause there's no auction.

763
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,940
But I don't know no.

764
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:32,960
Nothing will happen.

765
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,320
So I think it'll be kind of exciting to do.

766
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,120
Until we reach our new home.

767
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,880
Come extend.

768
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,320
Stay.

769
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:43,840


770
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:45,620
Stay.

771
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:46,260

00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:53,900


774
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:54,740
23666808.

775
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,920
I'm it. I'm Drew.

776
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,340
That's D-R-U to you.

777
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,260
Thank you so much.

778
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,360
I got a record.

779
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,100
You can buy it.

780
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,100
Come talk to me.

781
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,040
Enter the empire!

782
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,540
I am an ordained minister

783
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,920
in the church of the subgenius.

784
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,820
Praise Bob.

785
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,940
I'm also a writer and speaker

786
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,760
warning the public about Bob Dobbs

787
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,880
and his cult of the subgenius

788
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,680
when I'm paid to do so.

789
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,520
And that is subgenius approved activity.

790
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:41,860
And I am not a subgenius.

791
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,500
I assure you.

792
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:45,280
You see, subgenius is the first 100%

793

Parody orthodoxy also ortho-paradoxy copyright

799
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,780
what the fuck in subgenius ministries.

800
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,460
Results may vary according to condition, position,

801
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,660
or head up the end user. Ortho-paradoxy does not include

802

weed foot and mouth controller corrective.

803
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,200
Can I get a praise Bob? Yes. Praise Bob

804
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,400
from the hearts of your crotches and from the

805
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,660
billfolds bending nearby to touch them

806
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,940
with gold. Praise him

807
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,700
from the cutting edge of your prehensile

808
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,740
apocalyptic hackle spots.

809
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,960
I've prepared for tonight's sermon

810
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,860
by pouring over a few verses from the

811
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,840
blasphemora, partaking of the

812
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,880
holy sacrament of habifrop zipilops

813
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,820
not a drug,

814
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,620
ardently reconfirming my queer bisexual

815
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,420
orientation, and now I'm ready

816
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,760
to preach against preaching.

817
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,700
And if any of you start

818
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,820
hoping that means I blow my brains out

819
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,740
for the big finale, I apologize

820
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,620
in advance for disappointing you.

821
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:43,940
Thank you.

822
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,740
I am Watt the fuck and I preach the holy

823
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,460

824
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,440
his loving son tolerance,

825
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,620
and the blessed holy spirit

826
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,660
of how you worship is none of my goddamn

827
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,860
business. That is a trinity that

828
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,520
can save the fucking world.

829
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,540
Slack out.

830
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,780
Take this.

831
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,840
I've got words of service.

832
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,640
Word of prophecy.

833
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:23,980

PR has more PR reporting.

934
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,780

938
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,720
it can be longer than an hour.

939
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:46,600

00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,840

941
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:54,520
