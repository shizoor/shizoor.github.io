1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
I'll pull me through!

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,540
Just speaking to you over the body of a wall.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,600
Here it is! Here comes the show! Quiet!

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,140
Ah!

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,520
I think I got it.

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,160
Right between the walls.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,780
Okay, drag the show over here. Come on, guys.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,980
Come on, guys. We gotta get the show up the stairs.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,860
Check it. See if it's got its wallet.

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,280
Let's take it down to the old abandoned warehouse.

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,740
Hey, this show's got $500 in its wallet.

12
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,500
This show's got a motor truck. Tie it up.

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,980
We'll get its car keys.

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,600
I always wanted to get into the show.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,260
Now it's our chance.

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,040
You'll never forget, Abel, what I said in this damn show.

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,560
And he was hopeless.

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,340
His legs drew up tight and tense

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,600
and withered away to just skin and bones.

20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,300
Probably would have had to limp.

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,020
For a few days because of sore shin.

22
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,040
Don't you see my point?

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,520
No, no, no.

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,300
Oh, yes, we all love each other.

25
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,160
Well, Bob, I don't know how you feel about matters like this,

26
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,660
but personally, I just don't approve of

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,220
the self-genius

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,800
power of

29
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,100
watching.

30
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,200
I hardly agree with you.

31
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:19,600
Oh.

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,060
In the next 13 or 14 minutes,

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,960
something good,

34
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,300
good, good is coming.

35
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:28,840
Coming your way.

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,240
So don't leave this radio station.

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,760
Let's have a good time together.

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,840
He's all I need.

39
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,280
He's all I need.

40
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,600
Ah, yeah.

41
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,220
Ah, friends, we had so much new stuff to play

42
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,900
that it put us behind.

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,520
And the only way to catch up was to blow off the new

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,920
and just, well, basically,

45
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,120
friends, what I did was grab one each

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,820
of all of our subgenius CDs,

47
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,820
the masters of which were

48
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
right at hand. And so,

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,860
what we have are one or two tracks

50
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,200
from each of these various CDs.

51
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,360
We have

52
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,800
Bob's songs, one through six,

53
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,940
Media Barrage's ten through twelve

54
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,340
from plus zero and five,

55
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,480
and the best of Hour of Slack.

56
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,440
And so, friends, back to

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,300
the good old days.

58
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,040
As soon

59
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,480
as you turn your back,

60
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,580
everything in the universe snaps itself inside out

61
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,300
with a hideous sucking motion.

62
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,840
The only reason you cannot call the world impossible

63
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,580
is because it is only through the world

64
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,340
that you know the concept of impossibility.

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,140
You have been led to believe that everyone feels

66
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,160
he or she may be the only living consciousness.

67
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,000
But you are, in fact, the only one for whom this is true.

68
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,900
The fundamentals of the universe are the same.

69
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:57,900


70
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:57,900


71
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,500
The structure of reality is totally transformed every instant.

72
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,580
But it provides you with a phony memory

73
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,360
that it has always been the way it is.

74
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,360
Since you are always at the exact center of an infinity,

75
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,500
there is no such thing as movement, location, space, or time.

76
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,360
You are a row of electrochemical events

77
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,920
taking place in your cerebrum.

78
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,120
Ah!

79
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,800
Nothing has meaning in itself,

80
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,400
but everything can support any meaning.

81
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,980
If you could glimpse for even a moment

82
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,660
the real meaning of existence,

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,140
your brain would be neuroanatomically destroyed.

84
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,260
You cannot conceive a thing for which you do not have a word.

85
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,480
Everyone's perception is radically unique,

86
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,940
but leads them to believe it is more or less similar for everyone else.

87
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,920
You are a row of electrochemical events

88
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:55,920


89
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:55,920


90
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:55,920


91
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:55,920


92
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:55,920


93
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,100
You are a row of electrochemical events

94
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,800
You are a row of electrochemical events

95
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,520
You have always been listening to this tape.

96
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,720
You are a row of electrochemical events

97
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,220
You have always been listening to this tape

98
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,320
You cannot remember a time before you were born

99
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,860
because there was no such time, nor any other.

100
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,100
It has always been this moment.

101
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,960
Death could occur inexplicably any second.

102
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,980
125,000 deaths every second

103
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,640
The oddness of the world exceeds the imagination by an infinity.

104
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,680
It has produced this talking about it,

105
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:34,840
This talker, this labeling of it, this labeler, the concept of labeling, the concept of oddness,

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,700
the word oddness, the concept of a word, the word word, the word concept, and the concept of a concept.

107
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,640
Consciousness is not a continuous state, but a momentary surfacing for variable periods at random points.

108
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,600
Your next awakening could be 20 years from now.

109
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,940
Nothing can be proven to be true.

110
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:10,700
Because reality is composed of infinitesimally small moments, there is no such thing as an event.

111
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:19,060
The reason people are untrustworthy is because their cerebral processes are fundamentally random ones.

112
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,620
During the night, every ego in the world...

113
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,900
The world changes bodies, inheriting also the memory.

114
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:35,040
Old age is not a gradual, but a catastrophic process, and could strike at any moment.

115
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,800
Dreams are the reality for which the real world is a dream.

116
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:51,240
There has never been a time in history when men have voluntarily used less than the greatest possible military technology against their enemy,

117
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,620
and allowed a great technology...

118
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,720
...to fall into disuse and ignorance.

119
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,120
Therefore, there will be a full-scale nuclear holocaust.

120
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,800
You are dreaming this moment.

121
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:18,820
The universe will continue to expand until there is not enough matter per unit space to provide the gravity necessary for regeneration, and it will slowly die out.

122
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,620
When you finish listening to this, everything will change.

123
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:23,620


124
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,760
You will be different from the way it was when you began.

125
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,240
But, again, your new memory will conceal this from you.

126
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,500
All events occur at random.

127
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:44,480
The universe is one of an infinite number of universes, the closest of which is undetectable, being a billion universe lengths away.

128
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,440
Only what you are experiencing right now exists.

129
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,620
Love is an immediate process.

130
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:53,620


131
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:53,620


132
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:53,620


133
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:53,620


134
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:53,620


135
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:53,620


136
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,380
is the feeling that another person is really yourself.

137
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,700
You are about to make the first conscious decision of your life.

138
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,360
Uh-oh.

139
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,200
Hundreds of New Yorkers at a religious revival

140
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,040
chanting the name of a modern-day prophet

141
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,520
Bob.

142
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,620
Bob's teachings are the foundation of a church

143
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,580
that does little more than parody cults and American consumerism.

144
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,060
It's called the Church of the Subgenius.

145
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,020
Tom Vitale has this report.

146
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,220
You will pay to know what you really think.

147
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,840
But if you give us money, we will tell you what to think.

148
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,440
And not only have you paid to know what you really think,

149
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,400
but once you will get value for your dollars.

150
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,020
American culture.

151
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,080
Americans will buy anything, and they're getting sold short.

152
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,080
That's the message of the Church of the Subgenius,

153
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,040
as delivered by the Pope of all New York, David Meyer, at a recent revival.

154
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,600
Meyer also instructed the enthusiastic crowd in how to get slack,

155
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,260
how to get right with Bob, and how to pull the wool over your own eyes.

156
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,920
For they shall see God.

157
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
It's still true.

158
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,480
God still speaks in special ways to each of us today.

159
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,020
But my feelings toward him are still so broad.

160
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,760
Riddle and sour.

161
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,960
I don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care, don't care.

162
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,660
More.

163
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,140
Tired.

164
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,740
Tired, I'm tired, I'm tired.

165
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,060
I can't tolerate it.

166
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,140
I can't live with it.

167
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,640
I can't.

168
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,620
And that's how I became a subgenius.

169
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,580
Children of the great St. Lenny Bruce said,

170
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,860
American society cripples you and arrests you for limping.

171
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,600
Here in the Church of the Subgenius, we say,

172
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,860
cast off those crutches,

173
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,840
and cry,

174
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,960
and go with pride.

175
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,180
You can crawl again.

176
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,540
You can crawl again, children.

177
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,020
I may sound like a Bible-beater yelling up a revival at a river crossing camp meeting,

178
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,240
but that don't change the truth now.

179
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

180
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,240
I want to see if one person,

181
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,500
one single person,

182
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,540
will have the courage of their conviction

183
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,020
and come down here and open up to Bob and give them, give me their wallet.

184
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,700
I don't just want your money.

185
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,020
I don't just want your money.

186
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,880
We want your credit cards.

187
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,620
We want your library cards, your voter registration.

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,320
Give it all up now.

189
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,860
Give it all up now.

190
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,620
Give it all up now.

191
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,640
Give it all up now.

192
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,500
Now, now, now.

193
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,340
I'm talking to you tonight about the Holy God,

194
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,760
the One and Only Bob,

195
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,020
the One and Only Bob,

196
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,040
the Church of the Subgenius.

197
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,020
Praise Bob. Praise Bob.

198
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,360
Can I get a witness?

199
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,500
Can I get a witness?

200
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,660
Can I get a praise Bob?

201
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,900
Can I get a praise Bob?

202
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,020
Can I get an answer?

203
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,460
Can I get an Amen?

204
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,360
Can I get an Amen?

205
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,220
Thank you, children. Thank you.

206
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:56,740
Thank you, children.

207
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,060
Thank you.

208
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,260
Now, some of you may not be familiar with the Church of the Subgenius.

209
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,660
Some of you may not know the Holy Ghost.

210
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,180
The Purpose, the Divine,

211
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,720
The Purpose of the Church is to have what?

212
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,420
The Purpose of the Church is to have what?

213
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:17,640


214
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,240
Can I hear that again?

215
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,820
I need more slack.

216
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Can I get some slack?

217
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,000
Has this ever happened to you?

218
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,520
Why, I should have been there, Ted.

219
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,360
It was great.

220
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,520
There was free booze, great music,

221
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,500
one of the best parties I ever went to.

222
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,000
Where were you that night?

223
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,140
Oh, I just kind of stayed home and watched TV.

224
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,000
I guess I should have gone, huh?

225
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,560
Didn't you feel stupid?

226
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,360
Didn't you wish you could go back to that night, that party?

227
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,640
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn how to do that very thing.

228
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,800
Introducing Bob's School of Time Control.

229
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,680
At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time,

230
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,640
slow time,

231
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,140
and make time run backwards.

232
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
But most importantly,

233
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,080
you'll be learning how to make time work for you.

234
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,320
How, you may ask?

235
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,820
Well, just ask this man here,

236
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,580
an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.

237
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,020
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck.

238
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,760
Blango.

239
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,960
My dog was dead.

240
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,840
Was I sad till I met Bob?

241
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,760
Bob showed me how I could go back,

242
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,460
get the registration number for the car,

243
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,900
do a slip job on the brakes,

244
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,900
and wouldn't you know it,

245
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,220
that truck went off into a ditch and burst into flames

246
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,240
just exactly a block before he could hit old Booger.

247
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,980
Ain't that right, fella?

248
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,080
Yes, just imagine the horrible things

249
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,440
that could be undone tomorrow

250
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,340
if you had only gone to Bob's School of Time Control today.

251
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,400
Courses start yesterday, but you can catch up.

252
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,640
Just right.

253
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,620
Bob's School of Time Control, the universe.

254
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,620
Bob's School of Time Control,

255
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,980
a division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited.

256
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,080
Everybody says I'm paranoid.

257
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
They all think I'm crazy.

258
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,420
They all smile to my face.

259
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,340
But they'd like to see me die.

260
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,960
And to attain the slack of Bob,

261
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,480
a subgenius must fight a vast and powerful conspiracy,

262
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,680
what Pope Meyer calls the pinks.

263
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,600
Think of sort of that ruddy glow in the cheeks you see on people

264
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,500
who want to sell you something you don't really need,

265
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,720
who want to take away that which means the most to you

266
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,540
and give it back to you for a profit.

267
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,560
Now, who has come along to save us from this conspiracy?

268
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,220
This conspiracy that would feed you this trash?

269
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,120
Bob!

270
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,620
Bob!

271
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:18,960
Bob!

272
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:19,540
Bob!

273
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,140
Bob!

274
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,940
It's Bob.

275
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,200
Bob!

276
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,320
Bob!

277
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,860
Bob!

278
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,100
Bob!

279
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,100


280
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,100


281
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,100


282
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,740
J.R. Bob Dobbs was the world's greatest salesman.

283
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,780
He could sell anything to anybody.

284
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,200
He was a foregoing, full-fledged, blue-ribbon member of the conspiracy.

285
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,560
Selling and selling and selling and selling.

286
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,240
And one day he discovered a fantastic secret.

287
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,060
What is he selling?

288
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,020
A secret that had been hidden.

289
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,640
The secret of slack.

290
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,100
What is he selling?

291
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,220
Bob!

292
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,720
Bob!

293
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,660
The Church of the Subgenius,

294
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,400
a parody of weird cults,

295
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,820
has some 3,000 devoted members

296
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,760
who have bought thousands of pamphlets,

297
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,240
stickers, cassettes, and t-shirts,

298
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,420
all bearing the trademark of Bob's smiling face

299
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,920
with a pipe stuck in his mouth.

300
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,960
Peek-a-boo!

301
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,420
I can see you!

302
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,460
And I know what you do!

303
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,320
Bob is that big, all pervasive figure

304
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,200
that encompasses spuddom on planet Earth.

305
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,640
And what is spuddom?

306
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,920
It's the human condition.

307
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,220
It's things falling apart.

308
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,400
It's fat ladies in double-knit jumpsuits beating their kids in Kroger's.

309
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,820
We hope to welcome you all tonight

310
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,280
to the fervid celestial spoutings

311
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,660
of the inner epops and clockwork workings of the Church.

312
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,660
But this task will not be easy.

313
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,720
The fruits of the subgenius plant

314
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,800
are not as cordial to the taste

315
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,380
as the fruits of the subgenius plant.

316
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,320
As others may be,

317
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,160
kind of mucilaginous paste.

318
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,380
But it's easy to become tangentially twisted

319
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,900
along precarious paths that have nothing to do

320
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,540
with the straight and true direction of our search.

321
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,580
We are born with the Dobbs nature.

322
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,740
However, only exist technology

323
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,220
can complete a subgenius's transfiguration

324
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,200
into over-manhood or over-womanliness,

325
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,660
and so far Bob has allowed this to happen

326
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,460
to one solitary guinea pig.

327
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:19,540
This is Bob's friend,

328
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,140
Dr. Philo Drummond.

329
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,640
What? God damn it!

330
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,080
Man was born with original selectivity,

331
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,040
but most civilized people don't believe in it,

332
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,640
and their most learned scholar

333
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,460
has apparently been completely turned deaf.

334
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,800
Well, I've studied the Saurian stage in human evolution.

335
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,960
As it turns out, many of our ancestors

336
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,800
are not the primates as commonly thought,

337
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,000
but the theropod line of the great archosaurs of Mesozoic...

338
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,220
Oh, no, look out!

339
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,360
Get him out of here!

340
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,280
Bob is a rock.

341
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,060
Bob is a tree.

342
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,740
Bob is you and Bob is me.

343
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,440
Bob is a football.

344
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,620
Bob is a basketball.

345
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,660
Bob is a rugby ball.

346
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,880
And Bob is a golf ball.

347
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,580
In an order like this, we may have guidelines,

348
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,280
but you must remember not to be literal-minded.

349
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,220
No subgenius follows any two rules exactly.

350
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,900
You must also remember that anything any subgenius says

351
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,520
at any time is sacred dogma automatically.

352
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,320
And now the rules of the church of the subgenius.

353
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,000
The first rule of the church of the subgenius is

354
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,280
the subgenius must have...

355
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,840
What must he have?

356
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,420
What must he have?

357
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,880
What must a subgenius have?

358
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,800
Doug, what must he have?

359
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,000
He must have...

360
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,380
He must have slack!

361
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,500
Help me out here, Doug.

362
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,800
The second rule of the church of the subgenius is

363
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,300
too much is always better than not enough.

364
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,320
Can I get a too much?

365
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,140
Too much!

366
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,580
Can I get another too much?

367
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,520
Too much!

368
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,840
Can I get another too much?

369
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,520
Too much!

370
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,100
Oh, but too many of those, children,

371
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,000
it's always better than not enough.

372
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,420
The third rule of the church of the subgenius

373
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,880
is a rule violated every day, every way you go.

374
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,560
People say to me,

375
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,780
who is a conspiracy?

376
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,320
Look and see who violates this rule

377
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,520
and you will know them by their actions.

378
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,540
The third rule of the church of the subgenius is

379
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,120
if you don't have a sense of humor,

380
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,120
don't try to be funny.

381
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,440
Don't try to be funny!

382
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,380
The fourth rule of the church of the subgenius,

383
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,240
thank you, Buck,

384
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,280
and one of the most important rules

385
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,760
that supersedes all other rules is

386
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,900
fuck them if they can't take a joke!

387
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,700
Fuck them!

388
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,700
Huh! Huh!

389
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,280
You must draw your own conclusions.

390
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,120
But that's the way religion is.

391
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,740
It's been a constant battle since the very beginning.

392
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,620
The first man to try to guess why he climbed out of the slime

393
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,760
was the first man to pick up a stick and hit his brother.

394
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,840
Offered void.

395
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We've been programmed.

396
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,560
Offered void. We're prohibited.

397
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,240
Offered.

398
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,400
Our slack was taken away the moment we entered this world

399
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,680
where he's treadmill

400
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,120
and we've been running like little rats through a maze.

401
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,840
And the only way you can get away from that is to deprogram.

402
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,640
Edit your own memory.

403
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,960
Take those bad memories.

404
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,520
Take those horrible training regimens

405
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,140
that you were subjected to as a youth.

406
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,800
Flush them down the toilet as you excremeditate.

407
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,420
Let me ask you. Let me ask you.

408
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,860
Yes, sister.

409
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,260
Did you ever own a guinea pig?

410
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,740
I ate my guinea pigs.

411
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,500
I grew them and I ate them.

412
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,640
That's dick, Craig. Bob.

413
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,560
They were food. I'm a carnivore.

414
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,600
I can't help myself.

415
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,120
Right out of the

416
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,360
cage.

417
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:42,900
Thank you.

418
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,840
I'll drive a mile for us not to walk on foot.

419
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,000
I am a human being of the first goddamn order.

420
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,860
I am too intense to die

421
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,280
for I speak only the fucking truth.

422
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,240
We're never gonna live.

423
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,100
We're never gonna live.

424
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,960
We're never gonna live.

425
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,760
We're never gonna live.

426
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,060
We're never gonna live.

427
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:10,540
We're never gonna live. We're never gonna live.

428
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,940
I ransomed it from the past.

429
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,540
I made time wait on for me.

430
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,420
I'll live forever and remember afterwards, yes,

431
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,560
I am the purple flower of Pell County.

432
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,000
Give me wild birds.

433
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,600
Who's that in the gravestone?

434
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,280
Crude, no.

435
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,160
Cadet state camberlain

436
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,720
on stage.

437
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,420
A rebel CIA man,

438
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:40,520
quelqu'un commiss Antrag

439
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:40,520


440
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:40,520


441
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,100
is the highest number there is.

442
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,680
Well, by God, I count to a godzillion and one.

443
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,380
I weigh 666 pounds and zero gravity.

444
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,100
Come and get me.

445
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:23,080
I weigh 666 pounds and zero gravity.

446
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:53,060
I weigh 666 pounds and zero gravity.

447
00:20:53,100 --> 00:21:22,620
I weigh 666 pounds and zero gravity.

448
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:53,080
I weigh 666 pounds and zero gravity.

449
00:21:53,100 --> 00:22:23,060
I weigh 666 pounds and zero gravity.

450
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:53,060
I weigh 666 pounds and zero gravity.

451
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,060
Give me the signal.

452
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,280
Yeah, yeah.

453
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,260
Oh, hideous alien monster creatures from the beyond world.

454
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,820
This is for Bob Walton.

455
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,180
Where are we, Bob?

456
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,580
The code is broken.

457
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,460
Trouble?

458
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,100
Big.

459
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,040
Security?

460
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,280
I have the lid on tight.

461
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,940
Well, take it off for me.

462
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,160
The message is?

463
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,200
Mars needs women.

464
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,620
Mars needs?

465
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,840
It's a gag.

466
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,900
It's a prank.

467
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,560
It's a fake.

468
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,280
I don't think so, sir.

469
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,280
What's going to happen to your children?

470
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,860
What's going to happen to your children?

471
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,140
What's going to happen to you when this society we've created,

472
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,820
when this society we've created,

473
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,720
air conditions,

474
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,320
air conditions,

475
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,140
are station wagons with wooden sides,

476
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,780
station wagons with wooden sides,

477
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,540
are cautious indeed,

478
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,100
are retired actors,

479
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,020
are in jail,

480
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,880
are in politics,

481
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,460
are in charge.

482
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,120
What happens when that collapses?

483
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,320
What happens when your daughter ain't worth a damn?

484
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,960
What happens when your daughter ain't worth a damn?

485
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,300
That's when the man from Planet X9,

486
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,100
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius church.

487
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,860
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius church.

488
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,480
But until that day,

489
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,600
the power and wisdom of Bob can help us break their mind control

490
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,620
by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

491
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,320
There's a fella down in Texas,

492
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
they say,

493
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,920
his name is Bob.

494
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,060
He tells me I should slack off.

495
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,100
I should quit my job.

496
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,820
Well, I'm a subgenius,

497
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,500
and I must have my slack.

498
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,620
If I don't live forever,

499
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,780
I get my money back.

500
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:59,300
They said that on July 5th of 1998,

501
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,220
the earth would meet destruction,

502
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,440
suffer a deadly fate.

503
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,740
That day was long away,

504
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,860
now it has come and gone.

505
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,180
There was no fire from heaven.

506
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,420
Oh, no!

507
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,800
And this old world rolls on.

508
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,100
Well, I'm a subgenius,

509
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,140
and I must have my slack.

510
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,760
If I don't live forever,

511
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,000
I get my money back.

512
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,520
Poor Stang was made to suffer

513
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
a terrible disgrace.

514
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,680
He was such humiliation.

515
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,660
He feared to show his face.

516
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,660
Now Bob may be laughing

517
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,420
because we are such chumps.

518
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,080
But there is no reason

519
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,100
to be down in the dumps.

520
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,600
It'll all still happen.

521
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,520
No need to curse or frown.

522
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,940
They got all the right numbers.

523
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,900
Just got them upside down.

524
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,540
Well, I'm a subgenius,

525
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,120
and I must have my slack.

526
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,900
If I don't live forever,

527
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,300
I get my money back.

528
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,020
So I'll just live forever.

529
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,020


530
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,020


531
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,020


532
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,020


533
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,020


534
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,660
And I will go back to the office

535
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,940
to the meeting

536
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,780
the meeting of the other

537
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,740
new and potentially

538
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,220
significant contributors

539
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,600
to the corporal world of communications

540
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,100
and the psychological world

541
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,620
of how to get ahead by kissing butt

542
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,060
butt

543
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,260
by not actually letting the lips

544
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,860
of the kisser

545
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,720
kisser

546
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,500
touch the butt of the kissy

547
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,420
yes

548
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,880
by providing the illusion

549
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,660
that the actual kisser's lips are indeed

550
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,580
kissing and touching

551
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,120
I mean the molecules themselves are one

552
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,780
on the point of contact with the kissy's butt

553
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,900
butt

554
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,720
in this case

555
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,560
we have found how to get ahead

556
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,380
ahead ahead

557
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,180
in the corporate world

558
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,860
by only using

559
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,460
the established norms

560
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,620
of success climbing up the ladder

561
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,520
and how to use those norms

562
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:29,060
s to be able to go in that state

563
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,880
in anybody's window

564
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,480
out of that state

565
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,400
but also try to get to more

566
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,400


567
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,400


568
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,120
andTERRA

569
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,120


570
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,120


571
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,120


572
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,120


573
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,820
doing the bombing

574
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,440
and and rather saying public

575
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:37,480
equality and economic hero coke

576
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,960
in the addiction yet but all the more beyond in most ways

577
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,080
Tube shops today is the vientana

578
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,580
to fish pantsary

579
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,560
and the lips are actually touching the butt.

580
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:57,200
But we both know now that that does not necessarily ring true

581
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,580
for, oh, say, a subgenius in that position.

582
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:09,300
And for those people, we have found that the best way is to give the illusion,

583
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:16,000
the zen, so to speak, or per se, of butt kissing.

584
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:26,160
And by doing so, one can derive said benefits from such action

585
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:35,280
that one who, in all sincerity, was following that path with the utmost sincerity,

586
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:41,800
to use that word again, and by doing so, fall into the trap.

587
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,820
Yes, by following the illusion.

588
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:50,720
Conversely, one can avoid the trap, but reap the benefits.

589
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:59,520
And so my, this concludes our topic of the zen of butt kissing.

590
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,480
Corporate style.

591
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,800
We're all brothers in a perfect world.

592
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,220
There's no need for spontaneity.

593
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,240
Perfect system, we're all brothers to the end.

594
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,680
I think this is about the thickest.

595
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,780
Thickest, thickest thing I've ever heard on KFJZ,

596
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,480
and since I've been listening to it.

597
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,840
It's not just the wars and the awards that win them.

598
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,060
It's not just the dull and empty distaste for a smothered culture

599
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,260
that expires all around you in pools of its own wastes.

600
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,820
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu.

601
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,860
It's not just the child zombies that murder their mediocrity parents

602
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,860
and then cruise the streets with bloody feet.

603
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,920
It's not just those starry old vets on the park benches

604
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,600
with looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars

605
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,060
of Belsen and Auschwitz.

606
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,840
It's not just the anesthesiologist for needy.

607
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,300
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you.

608
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,760
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan.

609
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,660
It's not just the broken headlights, snapped antenna,

610
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,840
and human excrement on your car hood.

611
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,680
It's not just that the old ways were best.

612
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:28,100
It's not just the bastardization and perversion of every honest means of self-expression.

613
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,900
It's not just the killer shit ganja from the dark side of the bush.

614
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:39,160
It's not just the penoid snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop.

615
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,280
It's not just the widescreen technicolor corporate daisy chain

616
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,980
that has defiled the entire population.

617
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,980
It's not just the

618
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,880
It's not just the

619
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,900
It's not just the

620
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,160
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland,

621
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,360
non-entity son-of-a-bitch who thinks workers are property.

622
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,080
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil.

623
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,040
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature

624
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,980
without realizing that they're not alone.

625
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:15,980


626
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:15,980


627
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:15,980


628
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:15,980


629
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,600
without realizing that nature is an open-ditch latrine in midsummer.

630
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,940
It's not just some asshole with a pipe

631
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,820
and a shit-eating I-know-more-than-you-do-dog grin

632
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,340
all over his homogenized face.

633
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,320
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped

634
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,880
inside a regimented, devolving world

635
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,540
that you certainly never made.

636
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,020
It's not just the doorway to doom.

637
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,760
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

638
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,420
It's not just the missing H's

639
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,980
or the stolen Alpha Beta Max?

640
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,040
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.

641
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,860
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum show.

642
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,240
I put it to you, he's on the square

643
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,040
and a corking fine business proposition.

644
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,600
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.

645
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,820
Shot salvation and fighting Jesus,

646
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,140
you'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there,

647
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,720
if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.

648
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,660
No, he's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

649
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,220
In his back pocket, just you try it.

650
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,920
I understand them, they don't understand me.

651
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,580
They are the normals, they're all that I'm not.

652
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,260
But I'm a subgenius, a whole different species.

653
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,360
If I had my way, they all would be shot.

654
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,280
For when I was young, the pigs ruled the world.

655
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,340
Now all that has changed,

656
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,360
cause Bob's flag's unfurled.

657
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,700
I spit on normals, cause I hate their guts.

658
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,220
I am a subgenius.

659
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,620
I am a subgenius.

660
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,440
They like their jobs for all the wrong reasons.

661
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,840
They wear me down with their false holler smiles.

662
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,760
But my kind triumphed,

663
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,400
and now I'm a subgenius.

664
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,840
Now we will kill them,

665
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,960
dead normal bodies,

666
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,500
for mile after mile.

667
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,020
For when I was young, the normals held sway.

668
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,760
Now all that has changed, cause Bob has his day.

669
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,900
My shoe will soon kick a hole in their butts.

670
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,280
I am a subgenius.

671
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,400
I am a subgenius.

672
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:45,400


673
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,100
I am not bitter for all they did to me.

674
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,440
They're only humans, they're deaf, mute, and blind.

675
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,660
But I am a subgenius, and I have a duty.

676
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,940
The utter destruction of all humankind.

677
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,800
For when I was young, the pigs ruled the world.

678
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,320
Now all that has changed, cause Bob's flag's unfurled.

679
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,900
Soon I will grind their face in the dust.

680
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,200
I am a subgenius.

681
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:30,140
I am a subgenius.

682
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,760
Thank you.

683
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:39,500
Oh, friends, I just, I can, the miracle of the Bob world is unfolding in front of me now.

684
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,320
I can see in the spirit, through my windshield, I see a superimposed,

685
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,080
superimposed over this mixmaster across which I drive.

686
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:55,760
I can see a, a, an ocean of self-realized subgeniuses all in one place.

687
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:04,920
They're waiting up to their knees in blood, but it's the blood of the baptism of the mighty, uh, fist face of Bob!

688
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:13,060
The face that can pile through eight foot thick titanium steel conspiracy Fort Knox doors.

689
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:17,540
The face that can burn through metal with that mighty pipe!

690
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:24,160
From across the nation they came and they saw

691
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,020
A new will begin in northern Arkansas

692
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,380
They drove the storms and hurled the night

693
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,200
To the new awakening and dark, dark inside

694
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,540
The cares deep in love hanged in their ties

695
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,480
The journey was dead and they were feeling fine

696
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,460
Bobby was there but they were few

697
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,640
There was mostly cool guys like me and you

698
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,280
And we got high, so high, on Dr. Cousin

699
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:06,340
Yeah, we got high, so high, on Dr. Cousin

700
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,800
Hey!

701
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,720
Hey!

702
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,060
We ate lots of mushrooms to commune with nature

703
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,240
How are we to know we'd have to move our ship later?

704
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,120
Five hundred colors flashed into my brain

705
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,160
My self-advision occurred in three or four planes

706
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,200
My brain was blasted, my head feeling fixed

707
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,180
My eyeballs protruded but I didn't get sick

708
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,380
We packed up my tits but we kept seeing dots

709
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,440
Then we found that the peak had gotten all the best spots

710
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,100
So we got high, so high, on dark, dark mountains

711
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:55,380
Yeah, we got high, so high, on dark, dark mountains

712
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,760
The people were happy, they were all having fun

713
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,820
While Dr. Bob was farming skulls in the sun

714
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,860
The corpses were swinging, their love did abound

715
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:14,000
The average corpse floated a foot off the ground

716
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,060
The bandit there not one speaking his name

717
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:22,240
While his pockets on the clamshell were swaying their fame

718
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,820
Sparked on explosion and combo gang fights

719
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,120
Finished this then, just in time for us

720
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:35,320
And we got high, so high, on Dr. Cousin

721
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:44,120
Yeah, we got high, so high, on dark, dark mountains

722
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,500
The people were happy, they were all having fun

723
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,240
They remember who we were

724
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,840
They remember who we are

725
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,360
They remember who we were

726
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:22,820
We were all happy, they were all having fun

727
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:22,820


728
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:30,560
Yeah, we got high, so high, on dark, dark mountains

729
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,600
Ah, yes, dear friends, the swinging love corpses.

730
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,120
I'm gonna go back there, I'll even meet the Pope.

731
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,040
Better make it to Doc Doc, or just give up hope.

732
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,960
The dead will be walking, maybe Bob will appear.

733
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,120
The sound of chainsaws will be all that you hear.

734
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,160
Now I'm gonna go back, and I won't be stopped.

735
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,360
I'm gonna go back to smoke the ultimate frown.

736
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,540
You just can't imagine what it's like to go when reality's on hold.

737
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,260
And Doc Doc says, no, we gotta hide.

738
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,660
Hide.

739
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,860
In Doc Doc Mountain.

740
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,620
Hide.

741
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:19,360
Hide.

742
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,300
In Doc Doc Mountain.

743
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,080
Hide.

744
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,140


745
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,580
Hide.

746
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,220
Hide.

747
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:45,820
Hide.

748
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:45,820


749
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:46,260
Hide.

750
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:46,320
Hide.

751
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:46,320


752
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:46,360
Hide.

753
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,360


754
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,360


755
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,360


756
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,360


757
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,360


758
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,360


759
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,640
Hide.

760
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:46,640


761
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:46,640


762
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:46,640


763
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:46,640


764
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:46,640


765
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:46,640


766
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:46,640


767
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:46,640


768
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:46,640


769
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:46,900
Hide.

770
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,700
Hide.

771
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:01,040
Um, markets with repositories in my rectal cavity.

772
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,000
Dobbs.

773
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,980
It's all Dobbs stuff out here.

774
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,220
And if you want to talk to Dobbs, that's all you're going to get to.

775
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,460
Because, you know, if you really have a problem, forget it.

776
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,300
And then you will get a ticket to Dobbs Town.

777
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,200
And one of our special meditation chambers, the little dog cages.

778
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,420
And you can get in and mail yourself to Dobbs Town.

779
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,720
The church will pay for it all.

780
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,260
And we will support you once you get there.

781
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,060
You'll be so happy.

782
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:32,160
There are no dogs and no dogs to be on the street in Dobbs Town.

783
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,960
There are no sheep and no hideous wolf weather.

784
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,860
And there's no collar any longer.

785
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,420
What is Dobbs Town?

786
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,580
What is, then, Dobbs Town?

787
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,300
It is the stuff that dreams are made of.

788
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,820
It's what makes Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys fly.

789
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,220
It powers the Starship Enterprise.

790
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,220
It's the hidden code in Windows and Mac OS, though not yet available in Linux.

791
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:18,440
It's the general oblivion created when the moon dance strikes the cornea of your head.

792
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,520
Dobbs Town.

793
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:24,680
It's the cancer-causing, teeth-staining, smelly, pukey hat.

794
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,320
It's the drug that helps you find God.

795
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,860
It's the lonely night before that never, never ends.

796
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,600
Dobbs Town.

797
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:36,000
It is your brain on drugs.

798
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,320
It's learning to work as a team and as a slave.

799
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:46,760
It's where there is a lake in which resides the sword Excalibur kept by the lady of the lake, Connie Dobbs.

800
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:54,080
And if you think it's hard to pull that stone from out of that sword out of that lake, it's easier to pull a fig from a donkey's anus.

801
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,000
Dobbs Town.

802
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,200
It is where all the flowers have gone.

803
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,560
It is the home of John Dillinger's real penis.

804
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,100
Dobbs Town.

805
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,000
It is a mystery, wrapped in an enigma, smothered with sautéed mushrooms and onions in a savory gravy.

806
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:12,800
Dobbs Town.

807
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,200
It is John Dillinger's penis.

808
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:20,160
The savage, it did muscular gravy and surrounded by mushroom people.

809
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,500
Dobbs Town.

810
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,060
The home of both of these things.

811
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,060


812
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,100
The Lemurians and Cenobites.

813
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,280
My proper home.

814
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,380
I'm going back someday.

815
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,260
I've got to get back to my home.

816
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,580
Dobbs Town.

817
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:40,140
It's near the coast of Honalee and the land of Fredonia.

818
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,100
Dobbs Town.

819
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:53,960
It's the world's largest producer of manna, ambrosia, froth, and the green stuff that Dave injects into the brain to reanimate dead tissue.

820
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:59,160
Spiritual bliss with open-loam boiling every night from midnight to dawn.

821
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
Dobbs Town.

822
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,680
It's the residence of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

823
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,660
Part of the year.

824
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,020
It's creamy and crunchy.

825
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,900
It tastes great and it's less filling.

826
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,880
It is margarine and it is butter.

827
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:18,900
But if it were to fall into enemy hands, it would mean the destruction of us all.

828
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,400
Ah yes, dang it.

829
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,000
It is the downfall of us all.

830
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,120
And it tastes bad on bread.

831
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,520
Because man, those that go don't come back.

832
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,600
They're losers.

833
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:31,740
Losers.

834
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,960
No man, those who graduate from Dobbs Town come back changed.

835
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,800
In a new form.

836
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,120
You can't see them like you can see others.

837
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,740
Graduated like the chrysalis to the elf.

838
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,440
All the way up to a higher being.

839
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,080
They grow and grow.

840
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:57,140
Now, their tiny skin's hardly large enough to pop them as they begin expanding into that new form.

841
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,340
Dobbs Town!

842
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,320
It's where UFOs are not just a fact of life.

843
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,120
They're the law.

844
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,660
Of course it's a law here.

845
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,160
Of course it's a law.

846
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,380
Everyone needs to live by laws, by rules.

847
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,380
We need to have our lives doubled by...

848
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,440
Dobbs Town!

849
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,940
It's where the bad little girls and boys go.

850
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,740
It's where something is happening all the time.

851
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,040
And most of it unsolved.

852
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,800
Some of it is so hard to locate.

853
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:41,940
Many of the people from the Saucer Ship Emblem itself have been sucked out and left here.

854
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,200
Dobbs Town.

855
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,560
I didn't want them to be oblique.

856
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:52,100
When they're strapped down in a chair and started asking me questions about...

857
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:53,700
Dobbs Town.

858
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,220
I gave them literally a location but the...

859
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,040
The website.

860
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,220
Dobbs Town.

861
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,060
It's Nwotchbod spelled backwards.

862
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,100
It's Brigadoon without the haggis.

863
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,140
It is surrounded by the seven cities of Cibola.

864
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,520
Which are its slums.

865
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:14,080
And it has a ferry to Monster Island.

866
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:21,020
And what a delightful pair of individuals you'll never find there.

867
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,800
The ferries of Monster Island.

868
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:28,280
Tiny little happy people who do things for other people.

869
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,300
Who live for other people.

870
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,780
So big are their hearts and so tiny is their stature.

871
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:34,980
They...

872
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,380
Dobbs Town!

873
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,120
That's where Amelia Earhart crashed, friends.

874
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,180
It's where the Tunguska meteorite came out after bouncing around in space.

875
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,220
And it was inside the Earth for a while.

876
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:53,920
Yes, if you're waiting for another salubrious comment to someway illuminate that stupid passage.

877
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,360
Just read it again, Stan.

878
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,580
Just see what you just said.

879
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,520
What? The Dobbs Town is where the Tunguska meteorite came out?

880
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,380
After bouncing around inside the planet for a while.

881
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:09,820
The Tunguska meteorite was, of course, as you know from reading your book of the subgenius, Dave.

882
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,760
Was a miniature black hole.

883
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,560
It's shot by Dobbs.

884
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,480
The young ten-year-old J.R. Bob Dobbs from his slingshot.

885
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,020
In a completely by accident.

886
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,460
In a fit of rage?

887
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,480
No, he didn't even know he was doing it.

888
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,300
It was just, you know, I mean, he picked up a...

889
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:30,220
Other kids might pick up a pebble or a cat skull for their slingshot.

890
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,880
Yeah, a cat skull. That makes a lot more sense.

891
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,160
But when Bob picked up a tiny black hole.

892
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,740
A singularity.

893
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,200
A singularity.

894
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,300
A glowing essence of nothingness sucking in all that is not Bob.

895
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,540
And that is what he shot into the Tunguska meteorite.

896
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,660
And then he shot it into the plains of Siberia.

897
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:52,440
And then past the event horizon, the little thing itself went and then became like a bigger thing?

898
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,880
And it went into the earth, Bob's tiny black hole did.

899
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,940
And it bounced around like a cue ball on a pool table.

900
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:06,400
Back and forth until finally it exited at the place we now know as Dobbs Town.

901
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,120
Dobbs Town, friends.

902
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:13,440
It is where a thing of beauty is a joy for a while.

903
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,200
It's where you are better than you were in high school.

904
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,320
It's where you get all the pets you ever wanted.

905
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,420
It was never a colony of France.

906
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:25,040
It is where science and magic are the same things.

907
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,160
It is the unfolding of miscalculations.

908
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,660
It is the dawning of the height, weight, hair and eye color of Aquarius.

909
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:41,740
It is the fizzling, crackling, itch, itch, itch.

910
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:42,440
It is the dissonant...

911
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:46,880
... dissonant fifth vortex disrupting the harmonic convergence.

912
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,020
It is where the early worm gets away.

913
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:55,840
It is where the grave-dickers leave their shoes in the middle of the night.

914
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,480
Dobbs Town!

915
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,580
It is for when you are too lazy to kill yourself.

916
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:01,940
Dobbs Town!

917
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:07,940
Where there are no lawyers and where the government never tries to be helpful.

918
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,900
Dobbs Town, friends.

919
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:15,200
It's where you can make your imaginary friends fight to the death.

920
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,640
Dobbs Town!

921
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,700
It's between the dark and daylight.

922
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:21,220
When the night is beginning to lower.

923
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,820
It is where neither heredity nor environment matter.

924
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:33,960
It is where the lamb and the lion lay down and have sex together, friends.

925
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,320
Dobbs Town!

926
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,140
It is proof.

927
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:46,280
It is proof that hell is full and the dead walk the earth.

928
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,860
It is where the fabric is worn clean.

929
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:54,600
Like yourself, one thread can back you to thousands of other threads.

930
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:05,100
That is our caustic solution for you as members of this solemn group gathered together,

931
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:09,100
squandered and quashed and pushed under heavy stones,

932
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,800
so that you may not know the truth that we speak.

933
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,000
And yet here we are, speaking it to you.

934
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,580
Dobbs Town is not a place where a man or woman dwells,

935
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:23,860
but a place in the heart as big as that mighty elephant yoke

936
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:27,740
and twice as tasty as all the trees that you could imagine.

937
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,880
Now, imagination is not a place you want to stay.

938
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,740
It's not a place you want to bring the kids, grandma, and ride the ferris wheel with.

939
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,380
It's not the kind of place you want to leave for a better home.

940
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,300
It's a place you visit over and over again,

941
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,380
with your pants on, your pants off,

942
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,660
and your heart ripped right out, hanging from your chest.

943
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,600
Dobbs Town.

944
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:02,280
Where Bob comes home after an easy day's work.

945
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,280
And where you can come home too, friends.

946
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,500
Where you'll be home!

947
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:11,160
Where you'll finally realize why.

948
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,680
Why.

949
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,140
Why.

950
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,180
And why you can find out more about beautiful Dobbs Town

951
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,080
when you join the Church of the Subgenius,

952
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:29,200
the world's only, first, true, last, final, one, true religion.

953
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,840
Because it admits it is full of crap.

954
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,860
It is the only one that's not full of crap!

955
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,100
And age, I know it's coming.

956
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,540
Each time I can tell it, you tell it.

957
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:53,780
It's where Ennio Morricone was delivered of his inspiration for this music in the background.

958
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,900
Huge, huge mandibles.

959
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,320
Large, large, fresh, gammy legs.

960
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,820
And now the matador Dobbs steps out before the enraged...

961
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,320
triceratops dinosaur.

962
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,580
Flashing his red Dobbs-headed cape in front of the maddened beast.

963
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,020
The furious creature stomps its feet and paws at the ground.

964
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:18,600
Dobbs grins! He smokes! The creature charges!

965
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:24,520
Dobbs whips out his pipe and gives it a little conk on the noggin as it runs by.

966
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,360
And after that...

967
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,300
it sits and pants like a little puppy dog.

968
00:52:47,920 --> 00:53:03,800
And the structures on his back are underneath a familiargiving rock.

969
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:03,800


970
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:03,800


971
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:03,800


972
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,360
Pikes in place, we'll both they march together, hand in hand

973
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:11,560
The starkest of removal will strike a mighty blow

974
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,860
And we'll be free of the normal and the big

975
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:20,260
So give him Bob, Bob, Bob, and you'll feel a whole lot better

976
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:24,520
He's your Bob, Bob, Bob, send a dollar and a letter

977
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,800
He will change all your behavior, he's your short-duration savior

978
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,360
He is Bob, Bob, Bob

979
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,320
Bob!

980
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,620
That's me.

981
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:10,960
Dr. Philodrumon, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy, Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh, Glass Madness,

982
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:16,920
Mythical Burrowing Animals, Doctors for Bob, Doctors for Wotan, Orton Nenslow,

983
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,780
with that song, There's a Feller, G. Gordon Gordon, Dr. Onan Canobite,

984
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:27,100
The Swinging Love Corpses, Reverend Gudrun Thompson,

985
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,820
Gary Gebogfran, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Pope Sternodox,

986
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:38,820
This, um, that Dobbs, what is Dobbs Town thing was written by New Monet.

987
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:43,020
And now, friends, Brother Cleve.

988
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:58,060
Well, there once was a man, the world's greatest salesman.

989
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:05,620
And he had devised a plan to get the shackles from my feet.

990
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,900
Oh, yeah, but now he's gone.

991
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,040
A martyr for the cause, for the fallout.

992
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,560
And he's coming again.

993
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:26,460
Who knew that the first shot was gonna be the last shot?

994
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,140
Oh, yeah.

995
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,040
But he's gone.

996
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:30,200
He's got a hard-driving pipe.

997
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,380
The gas won't go through the night.

998
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:39,140
And although he may be hurting the universe,

999
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:42,320
he'll keep on squirting all the fun.

1000
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,340
Oh, and he's coming again.

1001
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:47,760
Yeah!

1002
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:09,380
Oh, yeah.

1003
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,100
Oh, yeah.

1004
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:16,100


1005
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,560
He can save us from the men in black.

1006
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,740
We're just a shot from his mighty sack.

1007
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,160
If only he could make it back

1008
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,200
from the land of the dead.

1009
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:33,120
But until that happy day,

1010
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,680
we can only drink and say,

1011
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,460
Father, follow.

1012
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,060
And he's coming again.

1013
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,080
I know he can make it.

1014
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,940
Without him, we can't take it.

1015
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,180
We'll lose the pieces of our minds

1016
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:57,000
to the pink boys and the whims.

1017
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:01,140
Until the day that he comes back,

1018
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:04,640
it'll be a world without slack.

1019
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,740
Bombs and bombs, oh.

1020
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,360
And he's coming again.

1021
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,340
And he's coming again.

1022
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,140
Bombs and bombs.

1023
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,260
Bombs and bombs.

1024
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,620
Bombs and bombs.

1025
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:22,640
Bombs and bombs.

1026
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,340
And he's coming again.

1027
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:29,380
If we don't want the exits upon us,

1028
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,680
then we need bombs to be honest.

1029
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,820
Bombs and bombs.

1030
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,060
Bombs and bombs.

1031
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:40,240
Bombs and bombs.

1032
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:40,960
Buyeeeet!

1033
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,820
I'll be hard.

1034
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,420
I can't imagine I didn't consider

1035
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,360
the title after

1036
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:48,420
to keep myself clean.

1037
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:48,740


1038
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:52,720
now that I became famous

1039
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:52,720


1040
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:52,720


1041
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,060
That's what I love.

1042
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,540
That's what I love about the show.

1043
00:57:59,540 --> 00:57:59,540


1044
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:05,020
I'll tell you what I mean?

1045
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:06,680
No.

1046
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:19,700
box. 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118. This will enable us to continue with the marvelous

1047
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:27,000
operations which we've known about and we've tried to spread throughout the western hemisphere

1048
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:39,100
to change this CFR trilateralist oriented goal reachers of the beyond noids getting here in this.

1049
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:47,880
Send, you will get sex. This is a subliminal message brought to you in care of the subliminal

1050
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:56,820
message corporation. Sex, money, Bob. These three concepts will always be linked in your mind.

1051
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:07,780
Sex, money, Bob. Sex, money, Bob. Sex, money, Bob. Yes, this is a continuation of the flow spew

1052
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:19,060
that the doctors of feel-good-ites now got for us here. You would have been told which Bob to tune

1053
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:25,200
to in your area. And this is not a burned out, radiance-oriented cult, ladies and gentlemen.

1054
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:26,980
This is a cult.

1055
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:37,980
This is a spouting spew and tumping of graven images. Spewn-eyed, blunt-yield, nor-deed-yield.

1056
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:43,880
My mind is my own and nobody's going to change it. I'm not going into that room.

1057
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,040
Nobody is. Come on.

1058
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,340
Break out of that glass box.

1059
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:54,940
And join the church of the subgenius.

1060
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:03,460
You are listening to the Hour of Slack. For more information, check out www.subgenius.com.

1061
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:09,520
And friends, you can write to Bob or the Hour of Slack at

1062
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:20,560
Post Office Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1063
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,140
After relaxing on the lake,

1064
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:29,320
Bob's ready to have a great time entertaining his friends.

1065
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:30,440
Right, Bob?

1066
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,200
Bob?

1067
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,140
Bob?
