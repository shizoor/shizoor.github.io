1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
It's chaotic.

2
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,520
Y'all swag.

3
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,600
It's chaotic.

4
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,540
It's chaotic.

5
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,900
It's chaotic.

6
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,380
It's chaotic.

7
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,280
It's chaotic.

8
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,760
It's chaotic.

9
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,060
It's chaotic.

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,540
It's chaotic.

11
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,420
It's chaotic.

12
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,100
It's chaotic.

13
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,280
Thank you.

14
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,400
Thank you.

15
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,300
Thank you.

16
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,420
Thank you.

17
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,160
Thank you.

18
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,360
Thank you.

19
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,060
Thank you.

20
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,980
Thank you.

21
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,220
Thank you.

22
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,040
Thank you.

23
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,060
Thank you.

24
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,880
Thank you.

25
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,460
Thank you.

26
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,080
Thank you.

27
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:43,760
Thank you.

28
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,320
Thank you.

29
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,680
Thank you.

30
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,120
Thank you.

31
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,540
Thank you.

32
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,220
Thank you.

33
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:09,700
For in a world of darkness, danger, and despair, we can go on smiling, cause we know that Bob Dobbs is always there.

34
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,220
And I know that Bob's on my side, I know it as sure as I'm born.

35
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,580
He will make the proper deal with the exes' whore.

36
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,040
Then we'll come to meet him, and we'll greet him, and rule forevermore.

37
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,620
Bob is my one true savior, you can't keep all of the rest.

38
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,660
Looking at his smiling face helps me when I'm depressed.

39
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,620
For the pinks, I sure feel sorry, for tomorrow they'll fry with all the rest.

40
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:49,140
Bob's got no real brain to speak of, though his luck has seen him through the lack.

41
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,560
For all the geniuses led us down the wrong track.

42
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,160
Least we know a subgenius won't turn around and stab us in the back.

43
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,440
The con thinks they have us suckered, but I know that that is a lie.

44
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,940
They're due for a big surprise from demons from the sky.

45
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,380
Makes me so glad I wised up, got it sized up, hell I'm a lucky guy.

46
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,880
Bob brought me slack and that's lots more than I ever got from the con.

47
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,300
Though I know it's only...

48
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,760
Cause of all those pills...

49
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,980
Heck, I know he ain't too clever, but whatever he says I'll do or die.

50
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,680
Ah, yes, dear friends.

51
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:47,800
That was Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger, Bob's my one true savior.

52
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,080
Before that, we heard the swinging love corpses doing pick a booger.

53
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,920
One of their most popular songs.

54
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,040
That's Dr. Philo Drummond and his brother Sphinx Drummond on vocals.

55
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,820
That was the Drummond Brothers and Cousins Band.

56
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,260
The swinging love corpses.

57
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,280
And the song Praise Bob, that was the walk-ins.

58
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,440
That's from a long time ago.

59
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,340
From our old Bob songs CDs.

60
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,860
Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger, who did the song I just played.

61
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,340
He's...

62
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,420
Publishing short stories.

63
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,340
I've been reading them.

64
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,120
They're great.

65
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:37,900
He publishes them under his human street name of Seth Deitch.

66
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,440
That's D-E-I-T-C-H.

67
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,480
And if you weren't poking around on the internet for Seth Deitch,

68
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,320
you would find some really good books.

69
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,220
Also, we'll be talking about...

70
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,280
Lonesome Cowboy Dave's book Neighbor World.

71
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,180
Because it actually is out.

72
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,900
But...

73
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,660
First...

74
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,560
Oh, oh, here's a...

75
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,080
Okay, I'm going to play another couple of songs.

76
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,800
This one coming up is written by me and it's me talking.

77
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,900
But the music and the mix were done by D.K. Jones.

78
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:14,920
Hmm.

79
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,040
Ahem.

80
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,120
In answer to your first question, can good Bob quit you a job?

81
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,340
Well, hi.

82
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,520
I only shite Bob the Doggy.

83
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,400
Or I'll be gobs of gully gosh.

84
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,720
You better puke your pee on full throttle puffed teeth.

85
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,680
Elsewise, your wonks will be a wagon down on Mammy's hind nanny.

86
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,300
Cause there's a case of slaves and slack robbers out to chop your slobber.

87
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,060
Pigs and dicks licking the icky stinky off your tongue.

88
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,840
Just when your rifles will throw them the bone, slap back them and bomb ass.

89
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,240
They don't...

90
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,200
Want your bone to be.

91
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:01,360
And if you got the cleft in step, Mammy-o, they'll hate your work.

92
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:01,780
Hey.

93
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,740
Way worse.

94
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,900
So why can't your peezer pop a squeeze?

95
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,660
Your women gushers are going all normal and anti-right-line.

96
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,060
Cause you're no gaseous sex in your sneezing chamber.

97
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,200
Ticing an empty splatter in your beanbag, boy.

98
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,640
Where's your rollerball then?

99
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,220
I can't drop me no love.

100
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,340
Roll on me.

101
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,560
Loochoo, loochoo, logo man.

102
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,080
They cut your check purse and water your creamery coming and going.

103
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,160
And the slob to love it won't be near your oven.

104
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:39,100
Cause the slacking ass of the grinning sinner be there claw to bleed.

105
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,020
They are dogs who do ya.

106
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,400
But you are letting them bang down the barn doors.

107
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,440
And your cows are getting it and out.

108
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,700
You be gonna moon the man.

109
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,200
Or boar.

110
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,200


111
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,760
Or jolly oaf mooing to the slacker house.

112
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,660
Like cool babies, but her butt her dog.

113
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,240
You're gonna have to spreach English, Jake.

114
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,680
Get right with your muscle snake, snuff monkey.

115
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,000
Quick spritz in your blizzera.

116
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,420
Lessen it snowing like lupin' juice.

117
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,040
Elsewise, you're clickin' bleeders blowin' hot water.

118
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,620
You'll co-bind or please your neethers tryin' not to.

119
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,260
Either way, you're gettin' up on the wrong side orbit.

120
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,180
For this kind of rollin' bitch.

121
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,620
free peed-needed side trade.

122
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,420
Well, won't you just stand there like a Danny Nichols slug?

123
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,960
Or are you going to bust your flipperer in a righteous harmony?

124
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,840
Hey, boy, you've got weenie ribbers in your fluter tube.

125
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,300
Join Guncho with the true and the seed brave.

126
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,360
And Pete from Bob, man, it's senior jeans.

127
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,480
Buy out the gland owners with what you earn.

128
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,500
With your skinny, peely face of pain.

129
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,520
Bleach a piece of the fine ass.

130
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,280
Have a fuzzy, big bock.

131
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,700
And strut your heart-bent, soft blow.

132
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,020
For the rack court, the rocket racket.

133
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,360
This space outer belongs to your worship and the crutch of your choice toys.

134
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,860
And I've been plumbing the flush lugger of beers to let them sack.

135
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,920
You know who's a cop?

136
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,020
Them gins ain't mean to harm our nobody.

137
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,040
Know some ass?

138
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,920
Cause you just worked in the buzz of the good.

139
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,780
And they'll be some gone by now, baby.

140
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,720
But this has been your re-enunciator.

141
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,780
Thank me.

142
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,980
Thank me.

143
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,600
Thank me.

144
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,720
Thank me.

145
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,800
Thank me.

146
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,900
Thank me.

147
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,820
Thank me.

148
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,140
Thank me.

149
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,340
Thank me.

150
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:55,600
Thank me.

151
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,040
Thank me.

152
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,460
Thank me.

153
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:56,460


154
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:56,460


155
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:56,460


156
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:56,460


157
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:56,460


158
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:56,460


159
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:56,460


160
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,420
Oh yes, dear friends, DK Jones did the music on that.

161
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:09,920
You know, Princess We, since I got these hearing aids last year, when I hear these old sub-genius

162
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,380
songs, I'm hearing details that I missed 30 years ago.

163
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,980
I guess I've been deaf for that long.

164
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,460
So what do you think?

165
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,460


166
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,460


167
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,460


168
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,460


169
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,460


170
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,460


171
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,460


172
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,460


173
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,460


174
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,680
or my hearing was compromised.

175
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,480
Wow.

176
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,000
Even that one.

177
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,900
Well, you know how it is.

178
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,280
When I've been listening to old rock songs,

179
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,020
I can understand lyrics that I didn't understand

180
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,460
when they were new rock songs when I was 25.

181
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,400
So it's kind of frightening.

182
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,400
Hearing aids are weird, folks.

183
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,320
Yes, they are.

184
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,780
They make human speech sound clearer,

185
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,680
but they do make things sound a bit weird.

186
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,520
Of course, I guess it depends on how you're hearing those.

187
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,400
It's kind of like eyeglasses.

188
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,820
They're made for the individual person.

189
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,040
If I put on Princess Wee's eyeglasses,

190
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,320
I feel like I've become instantly drunk.

191
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,240
And we've never tried Trey.

192
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,020
Even hearing aids.

193
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,920
Yes, you tried putting my hearing aid in the other day.

194
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,820
I did.

195
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,440
You said that it wasn't very strong.

196
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,140
Oh, right.

197
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,000
That's why I don't remember.

198
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,840
It didn't do anything.

199
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,960
I was still deaf.

200
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,760
Yeah, whenever I just need the world to become quiet,

201
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,480
all I have to do is turn them off.

202
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,680
Yanka Mountain, there's this big soft blanket on everything.

203
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,380
Princess Wee and I have been packing up our stuff

204
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,400
because we really are moving to Texas.

205
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,340
We'll be back in Cleveland in the summertime

206
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,100
to run our festivals, Starwood and so forth.

207
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,920
But this weekend, it was our old LP records,

208
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,220
the final records.

209
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,280
That's kind of a strange thing for old folks.

210
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,400
We haven't actually played any of them in 20 years,

211
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,160
partly because they were blocked by other things in front of them.

212
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,140
But there's, of course, you know, a thousand of them,

213
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,680
something like that, about 12 feet of them.

214
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,700
Yes, and it's funny how just looking at the album covers

215
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,060
makes the songs start playing in your brain

216
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,840
that you haven't heard in all this time.

217
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,540
Right.

218
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,260
Right.

219
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,300
Which is why we ended up...

220
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,860
We ended up photographing a lot of them

221
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,200
and we're going to give them or sell them or whatever

222
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,380
to our buddy, Reverend Angry Larry,

223
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,460
because he runs a used record store in Detroit

224
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,680
called Weirdsville.

225
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,800
Now, it looks like...

226
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,900
You know, I deliberately didn't play a Rainmaker song

227
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,160
I was going to play

228
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,620
because it was 920.

229
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,160
But then nothing happened.

230
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,000
And now it is 923.

231
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,480
Yeah.

232
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,460
And there is still no Dave on the phone.

233
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,800
What has happened?

234
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,580
He forgot.

235
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,280
And so I'm going to play this song by the Rainmakers

236
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,800
about life, the universe, and everything.

237
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,140
It won't make any sense to you, but it's great.

238
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,540
If you're going to play it, go ahead.

239
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:55,540


240
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:55,540


241
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:55,540


242
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,340
When I was just a baby back in Roskitt Heights

243
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,920
Tonight at 57 on a Friday night

244
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,660
Scooting on the road on a hardwood floor

245
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,200
Mama hadn't grabbed me, I'd been sucked out of the door

246
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,280
Singing to the left, to the right

247
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,300
Like you're not going any one direction

248
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,560
Singing to the country

249
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,300
Singing to the country

250
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:19,300


251
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,360
Back to town

252
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,340
And do not pay to follow me down

253
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,860
Me and Brother Billy won't begin the search

254
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,440
While our daddy played the guitar at the Methodist church

255
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,000
Cheap hot rattlin' china with a gospel choir

256
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,700
Blowing up salvation on a long tripwire

257
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,100
Singing to the future

258
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,780
Billy's gone

259
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,940
I do not go according to directions

260
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,500
Singing to the future

261
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,200
Men the muscle

262
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,900
Set the tone

263
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,640
And do not pay to follow evil

264
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,580
I am a!

265
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,600
I am a!

266
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,940
I am a!

267
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:10,960


268
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:11,340


269
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:11,860
I am a!

270
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,240
I am a!

271
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,860
I am a!

272
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,240
I am a!

273
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,480
I am a!

274
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:15,840
I am a!

275
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,480
I am a!

276
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,180
I am a!

277
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:17,520
I am a!

278
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,300


279
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,360
I am a!

280
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,640
I was hoping out of Dixie just like I've been trained

281
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,460
Nothing ever ventured was, nothing ever gained

282
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,880
With the flash of a bulb I was chasing the muse

283
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,420
Broke through the smoke and the smell of the fuse

284
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,020
Hour on hour till the end of the week

285
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,380
Minute after moment of the blissful evening

286
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,080
Day after day on this captainless ship

287
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,600
Taking turn after turn on this glorious trip

288
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,860
Singing, to the left, to the right

289
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,840
I do not go in any one direction

290
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,820
Singing, when I'm lost, where can I be

291
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,780
Just by pain and wonder with you

292
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,960
Only you really can take me

293
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,680
Never knowing how my dreams

294
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,140
They will shatter to hate

295
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,140


296
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,760
I just need you

297
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:31,840
aí

298
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,800
Thank you.

299
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,840
Thank you.

300
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,140
Thank you.

301
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,120
Thank you.

302
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:18,940
Thank you.

303
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,140
Thank you.

304
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,080
Thank you.

305
00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:00,160
Thank you.

306
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:14,340
Hmm, I see.

307
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:14,960
If you can.

308
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,340
Uh-huh.

309
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,860
Uh-huh.

310
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,580
Yeah, it is an uh-huh kind of thing, you know?

311
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,360
Yeah, it's kind of an uh-huh sort of thing.

312
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,040
It's also, uh-huh, uh-huh.

313
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,880
And there's a whole bunch of them.

314
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,100
That would be a whole fun thing to do for a couple weeks.

315
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,880
All the uh-huh things?

316
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,960
Yeah, just all the different ejerculations of a visible audio,

317
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,940
really, audio.

318
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,180
Yeah.

319
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,700
And then, you know, the reality that you want to come up here,

320
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:50,860
you can just like, you know, all the way from ah to ah.

321
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
You know what I mean?

322
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:53,780
Yeah.

323
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,180
Oh, yeah.

324
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,520
Everyone.

325
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,140
Yeah.

326
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,420
Some of them would be Mandarin.

327
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,440
Some would be side pork and belly jar.

328
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,400
We need the Dr. Sinister for that.

329
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,840
Because he has five sinister.

330
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:10,820
Yes.

331
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,300
Hi, Dave.

332
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,900
Hey, Doug.

333
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,800
I mean, Earl.

334
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:15,620
Stang.

335
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:16,860
Reverend.

336
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:17,660
Reverend.

337
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,900
Reverend Stang.

338
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:19,840
Yeah.

339
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,900
Or Mr. Doug.

340
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,880
Mr. D, you could call me.

341
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,920
Well, luckily, there is a delete button on everyone's forehead.

342
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,600
And you can all.

343
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,660
Yeah, but it only works if you hit it really hard.

344
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,840
It's delete?

345
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,380
I thought it was delirious.

346
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,320
It's delete?

347
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,220
I thought the D was for delirious.

348
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:40,700
It is.

349
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,860
It's for, well, delirium, actually.

350
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,600
No.

351
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:43,880
It's delirium.

352
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:43,880


353
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:43,880


354
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:43,880


355
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:43,880


356
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:43,880


357
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:43,880


358
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:43,880


359
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:43,880


360
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:43,880


361
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:43,880


362
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:43,880


363
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,680
It's slightly different.

364
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,940
Dave was talking about a button.

365
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,960
You were talking about the letter D for desperate that you see on the foreheads of many young

366
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,480
men.

367
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,160
Oh.

368
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:53,720
And old men.

369
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,160
Oh.

370
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,720
The D for desperate that keeps girls away.

371
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,220
It's the D that only girls can see.

372
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,820
They can tell if you're desperate.

373
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:07,200
And they, it doesn't, you know, that's the biggest turnoff is the big D on your forehead.

374
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,200
Yeah.

375
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,040
And also, when you think of D, what do you think of as far as service to the Crown or

376
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,640
the obsequious and bold?

377
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,620
What?

378
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,560
Like, that's, D means poor.

379
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,880
So, that's what women are actually seeing, like, what is this per person's per personal

380
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,280
sexual instincts and performance ratio?

381
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,360
And you say, he's stinky.

382
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,800
Well.

383
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,880
D is poor?

384
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,560
D is poor.

385
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:42,940
Well, if the poor guy is actually rich, the ladies can look past that.

386
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,440
Right.

387
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,140
And he's fair.

388
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,240
He's fair.

389
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:54,140
If he's suddenly average or C or minus above, which is when they, like the Galapagos Islands,

390
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,380
they've been doing that for centuries, trying to get turtles to look alike.

391
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,120
And some people have, everybody's same haircuts and stuff.

392
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,400
That's sick, if you ask me.

393
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:12,540
I'm looking at an ad next to the catalog listing for this book called Neighbor World.

394
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,280
On Kindle, on Amazon.com.

395
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,940
The ad says it's for a book called Clones.

396
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,260
They're clones.

397
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,440
They're identical.

398
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,740
And they're falling in love.

399
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,360
And it's got a picture of these two boys that look alike.

400
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,940
Now, is it another book with the same name?

401
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,780
Or are you articulating?

402
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:34,860
No.

403
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,940
Well, it's a clone of a book called Clone, about two clones that are falling in love.

404
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,520
And it's being advertised on the same website?

405
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:42,520


406
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:42,880
Yeah.

407
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,940
And it's being screened as Neighbor World.

408
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,400
Yes.

409
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:56,340
The point is, the point of this show is, the sci-fi novel by lonesome cowboy Dave, The Lucky, is published.

410
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,140
It is.

411
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,700
You can actually find it on Amazon.com.

412
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,620
And you can, that's the Kindle version right now.

413
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,360
The paper version is not on Amazon.com yet.

414
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,640
But there's a Kindle version on there.

415
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,780
And it has a preview of the book and everything.

416
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,520
Woohoo!

417
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:23,340
And at the, I don't have copies of it yet to myself for my subgenius.com catalog.

418
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:33,020
But CreateSpace store will send you a copy of Neighbor World.

419
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,020
218 page long copy.

420
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,740
Here it is right here.

421
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,920
Listen to the pages go by.

422
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,340
Hear that?

423
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,520
That's an authentic copy of Neighbor World.

424
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:42,940
218.

425
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,800
218.

426
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:51,400
It's a dog-eared, dog-legged copy of Neighbor World because this is one that we use for proofing.

427
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,140
It's a proof copy.

428
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,140
And I'm, hey guess what Dave?

429
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,820
I wrote a synopsis of Neighbor World that you haven't heard of.

430
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,100
Oh, you wrote a synopsis?

431
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:01,780
Yeah.

432
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,240
Oh, cool.

433
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:12,500
Well, the, when you look at the, the, the listing on Amazon.com for Neighbor World, it's a copy of Neighbor World.

434
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:12,500


435
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
It says the same thing on the back.

436
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:19,800
A bulldada science fiction novel by lonesome cowboy Dave DeLuca.

437
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:25,520
The astounding improvisational wizard of the church of the subgenius radio show, The Hour of Slack.

438
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,160
A little bit of Clockwork Orange.

439
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,420
A taste of the Firesign Theater.

440
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,620
A dab of Flight Crew Brothers cartoons.

441
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,460
A dash of Kafka.

442
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,300
A splash of Fellini.

443
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:40,240
And a whole fistful of lonesome cowboy Dave.

444
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,540
But, but here's the part you haven't read yet.

445
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,260
It's about, it's about 20 years into the future.

446
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:53,700
And the lines between television, the internet, and the real world have not merely blurred.

447
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,100
They've disappeared.

448
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:01,060
Stan Moszc is an advo, part content provider, and part detective.

449
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:07,240
With a daunting new assignment to uncover and report on a mysterious group called the Weirds.

450
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,220
These grotesque characters seem to be the most dangerous.

451
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,120
They seem to live completely off the grid.

452
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:21,520
Yet have extraordinary powers to manipulate and twist not only the social media net, but reality itself.

453
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,300
Stan's head is already pretty twisted.

454
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:31,600
But when the Weirds climb into it, they steer him into a collision course with himself.

455
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,580
Jeez, oh man, that's better than the book, Stan.

456
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,220
I hate to start cracking up and laughing like I don't respect my own feelings.

457
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,480
I'm just trying to get myself out of this.

458
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,320
This is one of the finest snot-pees I've ever heard in my life.

459
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,720
I've spent years trying to just, I think I'll sit down and frown up a little bit.

460
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,600
And just write a new synopsis.

461
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,340
And just, you know, like, think of really, but that was excellent.

462
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,640
As opposed to...

463
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:05,340
When you publish on CreateSpace, they kind of hold your hand and walk you through the whole process.

464
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,100
And it's like, well, when you write your, your, uh...

465
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,740
Author's bio.

466
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:16,300
And when you do your synopsis, here's some things to keep in mind.

467
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,860
You know, I actually paid attention to it.

468
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,580
And then I, oh man, I worked on it for at least 20 minutes just on that paragraph.

469
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,300
Uh-huh.

470
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:37,080
It's a good thing you kept the 20-minute paragraph because everybody of the ignoble belief systems of the articulate or the inarticulate, you know, the ancient architecture of the mind.

471
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,300
So to speak.

472
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,400
Yeah.

473
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,200
So to speak.

474
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,620
And so to speak, it just, you know, makes everything kind of neutral and blasé in content.

475
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,280
While at the same time exploring the outer fringes of consciousness.

476
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:58,820
We're in certain Republicans, people with, like, chimpanzees and stuff who have, like, tried to braid their armpit hair.

477
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,180
And a real old-fashioned pie, like alien smegma pie from the desert.

478
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,300
Oh, alien smegma pie, man.

479
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,700
Delightful alien smegma pie.

480
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,380
Delicious.

481
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,840
I can taste it already.

482
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,700
I knew golf ball and honey mustard flavor was mine.

483
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:21,720
Well, the idea behind all this is, of course, to get people to want to read Neighbor World.

484
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,700
And, oh, I should mention, here's the easy way to find it, folks.

485
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,840
And when I get home from the station tonight, I'm going to look and see if there's, if any copies have sold.

486
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,460
Because there's a little page.

487
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,500
I could give you the URL, Dave, where you could look and see.

488
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,380
You could see whether I was cheating you.

489
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,400
How's that?

490
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:51,580
But the subgenius.com, I put a link to the book on the very first page at the top of the page.

491
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:57,000
Right underneath the become an ordained minister instantly link.

492
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,880
It says that we started publishing again.

493
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,400
We're publishing actual paper books.

494
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,380
And starting with Neighbor World.

495
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:15,520
And I'm excited because it was really fun to get a copy of the thing to begin with.

496
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:22,980
Even the sloppy proof was just so much fun to hold that in our hands and go, we printed a book.

497
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,940
You've got printer's ink in your blood.

498
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,480
Because I've seen, you know, you do, I don't know if you remember, but you gave me two.

499
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,180
Count them.

500
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,520
One, that's one smack smack.

501
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,380
And two, galley proofs of your book.

502
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,860
I've got two books of Revelation X and the other one before that.

503
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,700
You did?

504
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,060
Yeah.

505
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,620
I've got them in the department here.

506
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,280
I got them.

507
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:45,620
Huh.

508
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,460
That was the conspiracy publishing those.

509
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:57,320
When the conspiracy sells your book, you get, say they've got a $20 price tag on it, you get two bucks.

510
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,120
And if you're me, you have to split it with Philo.

511
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,160
And you know, the printing costs are cheap.

512
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,940
And Hagenbrenner and Wellman and Sterno.

513
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,580
And Mavridis.

514
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,580
I said Mavridis.

515
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,380
Oh, you did.

516
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:15,820
Yeah.

517
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,480
The next book we're going to publish is another science fiction book.

518
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,060
Yeah.

519
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:34,340
That's by an Australian fellow who I've never met, but he's been real funny on the Scrub Genius members only subgenius forum for years and years.

520
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,140
And he, he's a genius.

521
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:42,960
He started posting chapters of this book and it was a, it was, it's, it's part of subgenius mythos.

522
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:48,980
It actually has some connections with our exist prophecies and stuff.

523
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,420
And that's, that one's.

524
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,940
How would you.

525
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,760
Eyelash is the name of it.

526
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,740
Isn't that what it is?

527
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,580
Eyelash?

528
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:00,860
Yeah.

529
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,360
I'm crazy.

530
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,520
Can't remember.

531
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,380
It's just when you most want to remember something, you get confused.

532
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,460
But yeah, yeah, that's.

533
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:16,180
And then I'm going to reprint our old magazines that I lost my butt on financially in the eighties and nineties.

534
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,180
Yeah.

535
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,220
I used to print.

536
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:26,980
We did seven issues of something called the stark fist of removal that the most of them were over a hundred pages long.

537
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,280
They each took about two years to put together.

538
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,500
And when I finally mailed them out.

539
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:41,260
I was broke because the subgenius is we're owed that, but then they didn't order every, all the tapes that were advertised in there.

540
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,560
I thought that would help.

541
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,500
And they were highly graphical too, weren't they?

542
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,580
Much in this way of the clip art movement of punk rock days.

543
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:57,160
Well, actually we mostly did original art, but we did use clip art.

544
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:57,440
Yeah.

545
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,360
In those days, the copyright problem was not such a big deal.

546
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,020
Fuck God.

547
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,680
You know, I'm going to have to think about that when we reprint those.

548
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,680
But there was a lot of art there.

549
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,380
Yeah.

550
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:07,680
Yeah.

551
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,340
There is a lot.

552
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:08,600
Yeah.

553
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,980
They're very, very graphic heavy.

554
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:15,760
My policy was half art, half text, no blank space allowed.

555
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,460
That's not actually a good design move.

556
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,420
No white space.

557
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,000
Right.

558
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,560
It goes against the rules of design.

559
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,340
White space is easy on the eyes.

560
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,040
But, but we were.

561
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,800
They never wanted to be easy on the eyes or anything.

562
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,000
I don't know.

563
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,360
There's nothing else.

564
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,060
No.

565
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:39,740
Now that I'm 65, I understand why the old folks complained to me about the small print.

566
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,460
Our books are all in like nine point print.

567
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,920
The magazine we use nine point.

568
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,120
Well, so did Time Magazine and most newspapers, but now I sympathize, you know.

569
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,900
I'm getting kind of watery eyed as time goes on.

570
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,880
Oh, when I went, when I was looking for neighbor world.

571
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:07,280
It's like after I pushed the approve button and it said, okay, your book is out there.

572
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,220
I went, well, what happens if you just type in neighbor world now?

573
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,280
And actually, what did I do?

574
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:25,320
I ended up typing in the word subgenius and doing a search on create space and what should come up but a rip off.

575
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:31,860
Some guy named Darryl B. Cobb had published a book.

576
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:31,860


577
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:31,860


578
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:41,620
With create space that had J.R. Bob Dobbs as a character and used our trademark image for their graphics.

579
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,800
Stole some art that Sterno did years ago.

580
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:56,480
And Darryl B. Cobb, if you're listening, you better tell your relatives to buy copies of that book today because tomorrow it will not be there.

581
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:01,360
All I have to do is send create space a link to my trademark page.

582
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:01,840
Okay.

583
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,760
And then I'll send it to the U.S. trademark office and they'll take it right down.

584
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,140
They will cease and desist.

585
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,240
I hate doing that.

586
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,560
What a, what a.

587
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,540
Rip off is a rip off.

588
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,380
Yeah, what a rip off.

589
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,440
What a dictionary definition jerk.

590
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,100
That was what you were about to say, right?

591
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,340
Yeah, that's what I meant.

592
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,480
That's what I was about to say.

593
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,220
Of course, I wouldn't have tried to intimate anything foul or vile.

594
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,400
Right.

595
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,260
No, never, of course.

596
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,200
No.

597
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,100
No.

598
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:38,180
Well, yeah, man, we're, we're, you're an author again and I'm a publisher again.

599
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:38,980
Woohoo.

600
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,860
I think it's a cause for celebration.

601
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,220
Let's break out the champagne.

602
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:44,860
Let's.

603
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,080
Well, you know, the big difference is.

604
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,060
Morphine into our nostrils or no, let's not do that.

605
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,280
The thing that made this possible is this print on demand technology.

606
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:54,840
Right.

607
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,660
Because previously, if you wanted to be a publisher, you had.

608
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:08,380
To pay somebody to print your books and then they sat in your closet and filled up your closet for 15 years.

609
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,260
Now, I didn't do that, but that's what happens.

610
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:21,340
The same thing was when you publish your CD, you know, you get a thousand copies pressed of your CD and well, you have a thousand.

611
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:26,160
You have 990 CDs in your closet for the next 15 years.

612
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:39,020
So when you can let somebody else do that, the way this works is when somebody orders Neighbor World, a machine prints it up right then and there.

613
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:44,420
And I guess a little robot carries it to the post office or something.

614
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,080
It's all very automated.

615
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,520
Yeah.

616
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:56,140
Or a little drone or sometimes just a regular old tube of toothpaste works or a wax mustache, you know, and a couple of happy days out in the woods.

617
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,140


618
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,140


619
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,940
Or a little robot in Michigan wilderness with her underpants on your head.

620
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:05,620
They were talking about Amazon was seriously talking about delivering stuff by drone.

621
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,800
Did you know that?

622
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,200
Yes.

623
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,320
Princess, we that seems so crazy.

624
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,440
Yes, they were going to auto deliver to people with drones.

625
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,100
Right.

626
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:20,120
But you would have to have a special Amazon delivery landing place.

627
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,620
Yes, everyone would have to have their own little landing pad for their Amazon deliveries.

628
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,200
Right.

629
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,900
And there couldn't be any trees nearby.

630
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,520
No.

631
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,720
Or power lines.

632
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,500
And it couldn't fly over any public people.

633
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,120
Just that's why the Euro rules about that stuff.

634
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:36,980
Yeah.

635
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:46,140
That's why the Euro model and the American model are so different because the Euro model, everything's just like about six inches to a foot underground.

636
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:54,600
And then the United States, everything is up in the air, like, you know, your electricity and your cell towers and all that.

637
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,500
And all your stuff like that.

638
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:01,380
And they like fewer to go to Deutschland or Italia or France or someplace like that.

639
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,200
You'd notice very less.

640
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,420
You'd notice a lot less of those.

641
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,980
That's because them foreigners are chickens.

642
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,360
They're hiding in the ground, hiding their wires.

643
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:20,280
No, it's because they're not scientifically goofballs like American is.

644
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,140
You know.

645
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,260
Oh, well.

646
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,080
You can't.

647
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,520
You gotta put your cell phone towers up high.

648
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:38,340
My brother leases a part of the property to a cell phone tower, beaming microwaves everywhere out at the ranch.

649
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,600
They had goat yoga yesterday.

650
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,360
Yes.

651
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,640
Yesterday was goat yoga day at the ranch.

652
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,580
That's not a joke.

653
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,760
It's now a family business.

654
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,140
They even hired a.

655
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,460
A professional yoga team.

656
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,060
Absolutely.

657
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:55,900
To come out.

658
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:00,300
And the only difference between it and any other kind of yoga is there's a bunch of goats running around.

659
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,600
Well, it's a bunch of dang goats.

660
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,080
Dang it.

661
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:19,600
If there are any goats around that can just, you know, the little goats that can hop up on your back when you're doing a, oh, let's say, child's pose or.

662
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,520
The down dog.

663
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,020
Cat and cow or a down dog.

664
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,300
Yeah.

665
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,060
And you have a, then you have a goat just hop up on your back.

666
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,480
And it's a, it's like a massage.

667
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:31,500
Yeah.

668
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,920
If you lay on your belly and the little goat walks back and forth across your back, it feels great.

669
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:46,500
I think it's very, I think it's very silly and not unwieldy, but like an orthodox and a little bit like, because you're training goats.

670
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,160
You know, goats were meant to be at state fairs.

671
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,520
They're just blowing up balloons with their flatulence.

672
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,660
Have you ever played, what's that game?

673
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,320
I keep wanting to say goat yoga.

674
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:59,700
Goat simulator.

675
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:00,760
Goat simulator.

676
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,600
It's the greatest game in the world.

677
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,020
Yeah.

678
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:13,120
It's all you do is just kind of be the goat and you butt, you get points for butting people and destroying things.

679
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,060
But you can't.

680
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,760
But don't lick a passing bus because your tongue will stick to it.

681
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,560
And then the goat will be pulled by his tongue tumbling down the street.

682
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,360
Oh, that's horrible.

683
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:23,920
Get out of here.

684
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,160
That sounds like a fun game.

685
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,740
Remember when Bucky showed us?

686
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,320
Yes.

687
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,980
He was the one who first showed us that.

688
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:29,380
Yes.

689
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,700
Reverend Bucky Argyle.

690
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,660
It was amazing.

691
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:41,040
He had that, he knew how to make the goat get to the top of a skyscraper and under construction.

692
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:41,740
Yes.

693
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,620
And then do stunts and damage.

694
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,520
I love the music that goes with that video game.

695
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,180
I have played that music in this studio before.

696
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:51,640
It's great music.

697
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,660
I held it up to the mic.

698
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,560
Kind of like Clasper.

699
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,620
What's in the background?

700
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,460
Is that which disco or is that?

701
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,760
Yeah, it's which disco.

702
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,120
Jay's which disco.

703
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:08,620
It's which disco with you on guitar and the late Chaz on keyboards and Michelle George on electric violin.

704
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,900
The Hendrix of the electric violin.

705
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,300
The Hendrix of the electric violin.

706
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,740
Only much, much better looking than Jimi Hendrix.

707
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,060
No comment.

708
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,060
And frankly, he was kind of a scruffy looking fellow.

709
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:22,500
Yeah.

710
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:27,780
But if his daddy could only see him now, then that would make a big difference, I think.

711
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,200
It is.

712
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:42,580
See, when he was pre-pubescent, do you remember like in the locker rooms like before they had the famous warfare films about France and stuff like that?

713
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:47,040
And Hendrix would come out in his center stage and he'd light the guitar and fire it.

714
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,680
And then he'd start whopping on somebody in the audience.

715
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:53,480
You know, he'd like to hold up that fiery guitar, just beat him down with it.

716
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,520
I told you Dave was kind of weird.

717
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:59,800
He'd get the hot fiery fire in the fire face and burn him with the hot fire and stuff.

718
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,940
Except Dave, I never heard of that before.

719
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,940
All this stuff that you're saying, I never heard of it.

720
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,420
I think you're making it up as you go.

721
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:05,760
Fake news.

722
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:11,780
Excuse me, I just need to avenge your ridiculous theocrats.

723
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,320
I told you Dave was extra surreal tonight.

724
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,720
Man, he is off the hook.

725
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:16,980
Yeah. Should we call him?

726
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:17,440
Should we call the hospital?

727
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,680
I guess we may, maybe we better call him.

728
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,920
Dave, do you need to go to the hospital?

729
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,860
Why do I think so too?

730
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,640
You're teetering off the hook, dear.

731
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,040
I say I'm round the bend or something like that.

732
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,900
I'm going round the bend.

733
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:38,420
Again.

734
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:39,580
Again.

735
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:39,940
Again.

736
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,620
Choo choo boom, choo choo boom, choo choo boom, boom, boom, choo choo boom, boom, boom.

737
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,480
Round the bend again.

738
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:52,400
Like a flag on a violator with a dog's rear end.

739
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,340
You know.

740
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,140
Yeah.

741
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:56,860
Yeah.

742
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,240
See, he just came up with a new song right there.

743
00:48:59,240 --> 00:48:59,560
Yeah, what he sang.

744
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,680
Yeah, that thing he just sang.

745
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,520
Yeah, that.

746
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:11,400
I recall when that whole band, Chaz, you, and Michelle, and Bob Mosick, the drummer,

747
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,600
would all come to the radio station and jam right here in the radio studio.

748
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,440
While ranting.

749
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:19,260
Yes.

750
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:20,560
Yeah, that was wild.

751
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,200
Back then you could smoke in here too.

752
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:22,860
I witnessed that.

753
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,560
You weren't supposed to, but everybody did.

754
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,420
Yeah.

755
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,240
You could put beers in the refrigerator and do all kinds of things.

756
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,780
Before 9-11, oh yeah, you could do.

757
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,040
Oh, they'd smoke out the window.

758
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,080
They'd hold a cigarette out the window and smoke.

759
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:34,520
Yeah.

760
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:34,680
Yeah.

761
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,680
I remember that.

762
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,360
What do you mean, they?

763
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,020
We.

764
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,760
I don't smoke.

765
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,120
I haven't smoked from-

766
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:40,980
We did then.

767
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,260
When the old studio, when did we quit?

768
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:45,580
Nineteen?

769
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:45,580


770
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:45,580


771
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:45,580


772
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:45,580


773
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:45,580


774
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:45,580


775
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:45,580


776
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:45,580


777
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,480
Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine.

778
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:48,900
I don't know.

779
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,860
I quit in 99.

780
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:50,620
Yeah.

781
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,060
But I mean, they weren't just smoking cigarettes, some people in here.

782
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,820
They were smoking that May-Riwana.

783
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,780
I've seen them do that.

784
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,220
No.

785
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:58,780
No.

786
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:03,440
I would see big, like, officially large and small people, some of them that have like

787
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,120
funny elf ears and stuff like that, laying on the couch.

788
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,260
And they'd get angry with you because you turned on the light because you go in the,

789
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,780
in the what you call it, room there.

790
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,560
And somebody thought it was like his own private bedroom because there's a lot of people

791
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,560


792
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,560


793
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,560


794
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,560


795
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,560


796
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,560


797
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,560


798
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,560


799
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,560


800
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,560


801
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,560


802
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,560


803
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:15,560


804
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,140
there doing a real late shift and everything.

805
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:22,960
So they'd just go in there and close the door and spread out, get a pillow and a blankie

806
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,780
and a little huggy bear and a little snuggle bun and, you know, and have a few of somebody

807
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,820
else's beer and fall asleep there.

808
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:34,300
Well, that's what student and independent radio is all about.

809
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:40,880
It's a crash, it's really more of a crash pad for the DJs than any, any earnest attempt

810
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,920
to entertain the listening public, as the listening public can tell right now.

811
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,640
Right.

812
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:50,000
It's like, why don't those people just shut up and go to bed and put on some decent music?

813
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,520
In Prentice Local, whatever that means.

814
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,520
What does In Prentice Local mean?

815
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,780
It means Lonesome Cowboy Dave is crazy.

816
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,160
In Prentice Logo?

817
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,040
In Prentice Logo?

818
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,040
In Prentice Logo.

819
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:09,960
It's a legal phrase.

820
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,760
I used to non...

821
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,900
I used to...

822
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,940
There's a legal phrase for people who are crazy.

823
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,840
Of course...

824
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,400
Non-compost mentis.

825
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,300
Right, that's it.

826
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,020
Yes.

827
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:25,640
Yeah.

828
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,640
There you go.

829
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,800
And when I don't have my telephone, I don't really have a brain.

830
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:35,300
Not able to look things up and I cannot say things.

831
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,020
Non-compost mentis.

832
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:37,280
Yeah.

833
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,760
Not in your right mind.

834
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,860
Not in your right mind.

835
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,300
Your mentis is not composed.

836
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,140
Non-compost mentis.

837
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:43,460
Yeah.

838
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,860
You're out of mind.

839
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:51,460
It's like scraping the scrotum sack of a very, very, very old man when you've reached

840
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,420
a level like that there because it just doesn't have to be that way.

841
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,220
Speak for yourself, old man.

842
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:58,600
I don't...

843
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,740
You're a scrotum old fellow.

844
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,920
Who all goes back to that?

845
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,220
He's so scrotum.

846
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:05,420
Dave?

847
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,820
Yeah, that's why they call him Scrotum DeLuca behind his back.

848
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:10,980
They do not.

849
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,100
You just made that up.

850
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,440
I've heard of people who are scrotum.

851
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,700
People call me Scrotes.

852
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,620
Old Scrotes.

853
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,340
Yeah, sure.

854
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,240
Scrotie man.

855
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,560
And then there's that Reverend Pease.

856
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,240
Why do they call him Pease?

857
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,160
Because of the way he smells, man.

858
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,420
And not like little green peas.

859
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,000
That's not the kind of peas.

860
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,960
I don't know that he knows that.

861
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:40,000
He'll learn that for the first time on this episode of the Hour of Sluck, number 1642.

862
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,660
That's how many.

863
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,420
That's how many.

864
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,420


865
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,420


866
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,420


867
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,420


868
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,420


869
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,420


870
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,420


871
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,420


872
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,420


873
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,420


874
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,420


875
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,420


876
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,420


877
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,500
He's a little bit less than a little bit.

878
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:44,500


879
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:48,920
I'm sure you are when you want to be rather than like last week when you couldn't remember

880
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,260
what the ethos was or the diameter.

881
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:58,240
And speaking of the policies that have been frequently passed out like a seizure post,

882
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:02,360
have you ever visited one recently in the last few years or months?

883
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,880
A seizure post?

884
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,800
A seizure post.

885
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,120
Where you go and you strap yourself in, in the log jam, and you have a seizure or two.

886
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,400
That's when you get out of bed.

887
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:13,400


888
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,300
And the log jam measures your seizures?

889
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:16,920
Yeah.

890
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:17,760
How do you induce?

891
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,320
A little electrovolt thing they put on the side of your mouth socket here,

892
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,080
so when the foam comes out, you don't short, you know.

893
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,340
Wow, that sounds intense.

894
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:32,520
Yeah, it's like when they used to do divascular tune-ups

895
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,140
and prefrontal lobotomies, and they'd make you bite on a chair

896
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:41,260
or a rubber log of some kind so you wouldn't bite your teeth off.

897
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,020
Right.

898
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,700
Good Lord, Princess Wee, there's 41 listeners.

899
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:45,660
Yeah.

900
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,200
It must be because they know this show's about to end.

901
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,540
Because I started, when we started, there were only 28.

902
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,220
All right.

903
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,020
These are online listeners, okay?

904
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,400
That's pretty pathetic.

905
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:59,180
There's puzzling evidence, and they usually have like 100.

906
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,920
But they have a bigger system,

907
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,440
and KPFA is one of the giant Pacifica stations.

908
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,200
Yeah, man, they have a cult following.

909
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,920
Well, they also get rebroadcast off of,

910
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,600
you know, four other stations in Northern California.

911
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,700
You can actually hear the puzzling evidence show

912
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,280
almost all over the whole top of the state.

913
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,000
Wow.

914
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,920
At four in the morning.

915
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,020
You can still hear them in Monterey.

916
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,020
You can get pretty far south and still hear them.

917
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:27,840
Yeah.

918
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:28,960
Yeah.

919
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:36,300
Yeah, WCSB here in Cleveland, though, we have to reach Leipzig, Germany.

920
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,180
We have to use the internet.

921
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,620
But you have 41 listeners.

922
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:41,980
That's true.

923
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:41,980


924
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:42,560
That's really good.

925
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,740
I feel so sorry for them.

926
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,680
Especially the 39th one.

927
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,240
The number 39 there.

928
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,880
Look, he's really bored.

929
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,600
You think they all have headaches?

930
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,380
Yeah.

931
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:55,860
Yeah.

932
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,320
I don't know why they listen.

933
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:57,400
Like a little girl.

934
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,220
Yeah.

935
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,820
Yeah, my daughter says that this show instantly gives her a headache.

936
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,240
She used to try to...

937
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,620
Strength jobs or something like that.

938
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,940
If we can edit anyway at any time,

939
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:17,620
torture any member of Stan's family, especially and mostly him, it's a good thing.

940
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:23,320
It's a spiritually no brainer, especially if there's going to be had.

941
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:27,740
Like a lot of times people think organ meat is cheap and it certainly is not.

942
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:31,300
If you're making the right kind of fried up delicacies there.

943
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,380
Church of the subgenius.

944
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,020
It's a no brainer.

945
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,900
No brainer required.

946
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,160
It's more of a no.

947
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,460
You better not have a brainer.

948
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,680
We'll throw you out anyway.

949
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,380
Well, the funny thing is that a friend of ours came up with that slogan.

950
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,140
Dennis Murphy came up with the phrase.

951
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,860
Hey, I got a new thing for you.

952
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,780
Church is subgenius.

953
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,860
It's a no brainer.

954
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,740
And I thought, God, where's that one been all our lives?

955
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,160
That's great.

956
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:01,360
And I put it on the back of our last book, the Bob Leografon.

957
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,520
And great big print.

958
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,140
And I showed it to him when the book was published.

959
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,900
And he went, so what?

960
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,380
I said, well, that's your line.

961
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,800
I got that line from you.

962
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,280
That's our big blurb on the back.

963
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:11,680
And he went.

964
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,480
I don't remember.

965
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,100
So it was literally true.

966
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,680
It is a no brainer.

967
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,020
It deletes your brain.

968
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,040
Even after you come up with a great line, you totally forget it.

969
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,060
It's a no brainer.

970
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:26,120
And it's a hummingbird's tongue of a delicacy.

971
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:26,960
And you know what?

972
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,520
The show is over now because it's time for.

973
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:29,920
Over?

974
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,520
Well, actually.

975
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,200
Over?

976
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,440
Or is it ovoid?

977
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,760
Where is Dr. Sinister?

978
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,500
I have seen Keith.

979
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,440
Where's Dr. Overy?

980
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,500
I have not seen Dr. Sinister.

981
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,900
Where's Dr. Overy?

982
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,800
I've seen Keith.

983
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,260
Where's Dr. Memory?

984
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,500
I do not know where Dr. Sinister is.

985
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,800
Are we just going to fade out without any music?

986
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,240
I don't want to fade.

987
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,860
I never want to fade out.

988
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,600
I have to play a song, though.

989
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,620
Well, play a song then.

990
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,980
It's exposed foreheads.

991
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,460
Exposed spelled with an X, not an EX.

992
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,580
Exposed foreheads.

993
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,000
With a four.

994
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Spelled with a four.

995
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,560
Numeral four.

996
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:08,940
Okay, Dave.

997
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,160
So I'm going to pot you down.

998
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:11,500
I can hear.

999
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:11,660


1000
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:11,660

00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:11,660

00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:11,660


1008
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:11,660

in the past

1020
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,080
didn't know

1021
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,860
that it would last

1022
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:05,480
Should I leave it the way

1023
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,300
it was

1024
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,160
or try again

1025
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,940
to pick up the cause

1026
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:13,120
remembering how to

1027
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:13,940
sing the tune

The next day

1031
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,320
Is it ever

1032
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:23,980
complete

1033
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,160
The next day

1034
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,200
Keep trying to

00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:31,580
reach

1036
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,620
The next day

1037
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,880
A hunger inside

1038
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,060
The next day

1039
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,100
Can't be satisfied

1040
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,420
Feeling our way

1041
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,700
Feeling kinda good

1042
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,560
Asked you to come

To the next day

1044
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,440
Didn't know if you would

Something new

1046
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,200
but sounded the same

1047
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:17,960
Seeing if we can rekindle the flame

1048
