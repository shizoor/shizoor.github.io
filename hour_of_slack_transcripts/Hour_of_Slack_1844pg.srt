1
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,880
The subgenius powerhouse.

2
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,620
Bob!

3
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,800
Bob!

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,660
All right!

5
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,100
Well done!

6
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,540
Thank you!

7
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:53,960
we'll see you next week.

8
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,680
Thank you.

9
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,020
Thank you.

10
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,640
Thank you.

11
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:43,320
This week is also from 24XDay, the fourth hour of Slack, second hour, with Dr. Howell, Reverend Pease, Papa Joe Mama, and myself, as follows.

12
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,900
That free beer is a good example of what we're talking about, the problem of everything being too perfect.

13
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:59,980
Because it's free, I've been finding warm, opened, almost full blossom, orange blossom.

14
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,480
Blossom cans.

15
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,160
Everywhere.

16
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,720
Everywhere.

17
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,200
Very warm.

18
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,160
I've obviously, you know, they've been sitting there at least five minutes.

19
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,400
Popped open.

20
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,760
Two sips taken out.

21
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,780
Oh, thanks, Dr. Howell.

22
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,100
This will last about five minutes.

23
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,140
That orange blossom special.

24
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,680
Yeah, and it's because it's free.

25
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,500
They, you know, they don't, if they had paid for that beer, they'd carry it around until it was finished.

26
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,460
But as it is, they just put it down somewhere and look around.

27
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,460
Oh, where'd that beer go?

28
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,620
I'll just get another one.

29
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,680
A ridiculous number of cigarettes laying around.

30
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,520
Why is it that the old timers end up doing the cleanup?

31
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,200
Oh, I know.

32
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,080
Oh, now I remember why I've got OCD.

33
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,680
Yeah.

34
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,720
I would do it anyway.

35
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,500
You would do it anyway.

36
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,040
It doesn't have anything to do with the good feelings.

37
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,000
It's like, oh, there's a thing that's out of place.

38
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,060
I must put it in order.

39
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,280
If they weren't there, you wouldn't know what to do.

40
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,020
So you took too much OCD when you were young?

41
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:57,980
Yeah.

42
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,280
Yeah.

43
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,720
It's.

44
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,160
It worked for me.

45
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,880
I mean, it's.

46
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,300
Hey, that's all wrong.

47
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,440
That's all wrong.

48
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,340
No, it's right my way, though.

49
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,340
It's wrong for you, but it's right for me.

50
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,800
No, this is wrong.

51
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,900
There's the perfect balance.

52
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,220
No, no, no.

53
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:16,580
It's.

54
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,100
Immersion tile versus the reward.

55
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,540
Ian.

56
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,580
Easy staying.

57
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,180
Yeah, that's right.

58
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,560
He's got ADHD.

59
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:29,580
Yeah.

60
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,160
OCD says, why we need to stick together together.

61
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,000
Together.

62
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,040
We're almost an alphabet.

63
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,860
I was telling my grandson could finish this puzzle game in two hours.

64
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,340
It took me two days and he goes, I'm smarter than you.

65
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:48,500
And I said, your brain works faster for sure, but I know a lot more.

66
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,280
So we need to work together, kid.

67
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,600
And I'm convinced that that's what you have to do.

68
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,200
The speed of thought might be overrated.

69
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,100
My wife is a complete reward in hoarding.

70
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,760
Now, do the do the grandsons do Legos?

71
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,060
Do they do the Legos?

72
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,380
The kids?

73
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:10,880
Yeah.

74
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,900
No, I haven't.

75
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,280
Adult foot torture devices.

76
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,800
They were they've been into all the kid fads, but Legos is old time.

77
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,240
Well, see, that's the thing.

78
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,600
I asked my daughter to get me this Lego cake because I thought, oh, that'll be relaxing for me.

79
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,060
So I have her get me this Saturn.

80
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,160
Five replica of the Lego thing.

81
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,360
Right. And I'm like, I'm a I'm a jam this out.

82
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,080
Right. Well, I get about third way done.

83
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,760
And there's just one little thing that I didn't do right.

84
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,720
So I got to take it all apart.

85
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,620
I don't think I'm ever going to finish that rocket.

86
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,480
I think I got a toy that was a toy is too challenging for peas.

87
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
Well, there's not an age limit on it.

88
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,940
Promises a future.

89
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,700
You need even if it's a future of putting together a Lego.

90
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,740
I read the instructions.

91
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,560
I looked at the emergent tiles, read the instructions first.

92
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,460
Rewarding is only that never read the instructions.

93
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,580
I just want to rock it.

94
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,360
I remember when Legos came in.

95
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,060
That was in my lifetime.

96
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,840
And they replaced what I used before that, which I liked much better.

97
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,200
American plastic bricks.

98
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,280
Yes, American plastic bricks were great.

99
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,560
They overlapped and so on.

100
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,720
They were somewhat like Legos, but with them.

101
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,280
It was all about building.

102
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:37,080
Miniature buildings with windows and doors, stairways, chimneys, all that stuff with the bricks.

103
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,220
You can get them all interlocked and, you know, make perfect buildings.

104
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,240
But those are real hard to find now.

105
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,420
I know. Well, they broke very easily.

106
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,460
The they weren't tough like Legos.

107
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,760
Nothing can break them.

108
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:59,300
Then there was the kits that have little plastic girders and panels that you've made skyscraper.

109
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,060
Yes.

110
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,160
Well, the erector set was metal.

111
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,920
The erector set was metal.

112
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,980
I'm talking about plastic.

113
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:06,840
Meccano.

114
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah, I had a little plastic thing and you had a little friction gun that you melted the girders to each other with friction.

115
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,160
And then you put little plastic sheets on.

116
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,460
You could build these really elaborate skyscrapers.

117
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,560
But it was kind of a gyp toy because once you had soldered the girders together.

118
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,640
Why would you solder them?

119
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,500
They just snapped together.

120
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,360
Well, I'm just telling you my version of that toy.

121
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,440
Mine didn't snap together.

122
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:36,940
You had to like get the end of it like gluey with this little friction thing that spun around and then you stuck it to another girder.

123
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,760
Are you sure that you just didn't read the instructions?

124
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,020
Maybe I was doing it wrong.

125
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,140
Maybe you were creatively customizing it.

126
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,700
I think I'm going to find that toy.

127
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:57,340
But once again, we're talking about toys that existed in the 60s and nobody even knows what the hell we're talking about now.

128
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,220
The 60s?

129
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,620
I was talking about the 50s.

130
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:05,040
But in the 60s, things came in like the Great Garlou and so forth.

131
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,120
Oh, I wanted the Great Garlou so bad.

132
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,700
Yeah, the other kids all had it.

133
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,500
I'll have one tomorrow.

134
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,460
I wasn't allowed to get a Great Garlou either.

135
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,320
I was told it was ridiculous.

136
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm going to have the Great Garlou tomorrow.

137
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,340
Anything I can remember.

138
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,260
And those building kits.

139
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,840
How about Robert the Robot?

140
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,900
I never had that.

141
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,840
The other kids had Robert the Robot.

142
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,480
I had Mr. Atom.

143
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,200
However, Mr. Atom.

144
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,500
had many praiseworthy features.

145
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,200
But it didn't talk like Dan Robert the Robot.

146
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,840
Was that the one that had a top hat and went like this?

147
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,980
That's Mr. Machine, which is sort of a two-dimensional robotoid thing.

148
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,220
It did have a top hat.

149
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:50,040
Mr. Atom had changeable eye lenses in his atomic eye sockets and so forth.

150
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,500
But was mainly a walking robot of the boxy kind.

151
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,180
Everybody's rockin' so much.

152
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,160
We rockin' robots.

153
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:05,620
When the Japanese actually did break that barrier and create the first humanoid robots

154
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:14,840
in 1999, the Honda company, what was so strange was they looked like those boxy robots of our

155
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,760
childhood with feet like shoe boxes and so forth.

156
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,820
But they could move with exquisite gliding.

157
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,160
They could go up and down a flight of stairs without clanging on to anything.

158
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,680
Dr. Hal, did you see this?

159
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,860
Dr. Hal, did you see this?

160
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:57,680
Dr. Hal, did you see this?

161
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:28,120
Dr. Hal, did you see this?

162
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,820
Dr. Hal, did you see this?

163
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:18,520
Dr. Hal, did you see this?

164
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:58,120
Dr. Hal, did you see this?

165
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:27,560
Dr. Hal, did you see this?

166
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:51,480
Dr. Hal, did you see this?

167
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:28,120
Dr. Hal, did you see this?

168
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:58,140
Dr. Hal, did you see this?

169
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:28,120
Dr. Hal, did you see this?

170
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,780
highly evolved magnolia blossoms painted in the famous

171
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:41,120
Rudolf Zellinger mural at the Peabody Museum in Yale, you know, life through the ages that one. They were

172
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,600
more like proto flowers, but it doesn't take long for

173
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,920
things that are on a good course of evolving to

174
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,200
evolve and so the

175
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:58,140
you have the gymnosperms and the angiosperms

176
00:17:59,360 --> 00:17:59,800
and the

177
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:07,440
So anyway, they probably had some crude butterflies something they had the things before they had the insects to pollinate them

178
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,580
Yeah, apparently

179
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,460
I'm sorry. I have that wrong. They had the insects and then they had the things well

180
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,520
You know think about maybe it would be that's why it would destroy

181
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,440
time because it would be like the first butterfly and

182
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,040
Then that because you stepped on it that eliminated that whole food source

183
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,140
For the and it could be it could be a desolate wasteland

184
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,760
If we did that perhaps we should heed and take heed and take caution and maybe

185
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,800
Slay not the moth nor the butterfly

186
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,260
The big lesson is you go back in time to try to fix things

187
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,220
For the last judgment draweth nigh

188
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,400
Any time you go back in time to fix something you break something else

189
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,420
It always happens. So you can't get back to your own timeline

190
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,820
You have to go with this timeline that you created

191
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:55,860
The church used to be much bigger till Stang went back in the timeline to fix it and here we are

192
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,900
Here's it. Here's a

193
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,100
Green play all to avoid a certain is pretty good movie

194
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:07,560
Harold Harold and Kumar meet Hitler they they go back in time to kill Hitler

195
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,560
but they they

196
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,720
He said he hadn't joined the Nazis yet

197
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,140
and he's just a frustrated artist and they go wait a minute, let's just get a whole bunch of his art and

198
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,040
And take that back. He'll be worth millions, you know

199
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:27,660
In in our times an original they make friends with Hitler the pre-nazi Hitler

200
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:35,500
and he's never been laid and and they and he's never been high and they get him drunk and high and they get him laid and

201
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,040
He's not interested in the Nazis the Nazis start, you know trying to recruit him. He's like I'll go away fuck off

202
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,860
I mean, I like these guys with their pot

203
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:51,240
he was party member number eight and so they they go back to their own time with all these Hitler paintings and

204
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,300
Everybody's going who's Hitler? These are mediocre landscape paintings

205
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,680
Why the hell would we pay you for the badly done?

206
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:57,940
architectural

207
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,780
Wanderings

208
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:05,920
Well, so not only do you humiliate Hitler who however in this scenario is not guilty

209
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,180
But you prevent the suffering in the terrible war

210
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:15,200
It's funny. I know but poor sure that the World War two never happened and the world is much better

211
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,460
But they can't sell those stupid painting that Adolf Hitler went on to win the Nobel

212
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,620
priest mentioned it from PR news in Washington

213
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,400
I'm decrying the violent political crisis in Nicaragua

214
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,240
Saying I'm repressing social protest to launch a nationwide collaboration

215
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,300
The collaborative will seek data driven answers on the causes and patterns of PR news

216
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,360
Scientists will examine characteristics risk factors and interventions

217
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:47,920
Tonight in Oakland, California White House economic adviser Larry says don't go to school

218
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,860
meanwhile, there are reports of death threats against PR news a

219
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,480
Houston foundation is giving two dollars to launch a study on

220
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,180
hot dry and windy violence from other philanthropists in Santa Fe, Texas

221
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:10,600
The New York Times says it's spreading officials say that may help in the short term, but this is PR news in Washington

222
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,940
Mentioned this before but the modern world was created by Annie Oakley. I told you about this

223
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:24,740
You know the famous little sure shot. Yeah, she could shoot. She was at Buffalo Bills Wild West shows

224
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,240
He was a great attraction there

225
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,480
She used to shoot

226
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,000
Cigarettes out from between her husband's lips backwards with a rifle looking in a mirror

227
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,220
She could always do it and one time these visiting Germans

228
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,360
insisted especially this one German princeling

229
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,460
insisted on getting down there and being the guy that she shot the

230
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:52,840
The cigarette out from he screamed I insist and he stamped his boots and so Buffalo Bill said, you know

231
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,380
It's his dime and he's down there. He's holding the cigarette and Annie is so

232
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,120
She's a little bit nervous, but she shoots and she makes the shot but four inches to the left

233
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,980
There would have been no Kaiser Wilhelm

234
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,800
certainly no

235
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:16,140
Assassination at Sarajevo no World War one no angry corporal Hitler no Dachau Belson Hiroshima

236
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:24,620
Any of that all because Annie Oakley was such a good shot and she really was it was instinctive

237
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,040
to her but sometimes

238
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,500
This fucking up can be the greatest gift that you can give to the

239
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,880
World that's how Bob does everything

240
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,560
And up is how I

241
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,800
Lived my life

242
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,500
I was I wasn't gonna say I wasn't gonna say anything

243
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,580
It's a hard path of chosen, but it's mine

244
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,480
Yeah, you can. You're welcome to it, please. Yes the way you walk is thorny

245
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,460
Well, look at this. I mean it's it's

246
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:57,460


247
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,020
It's succeeding.

248
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,620
He's replaced Bob.

249
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,520
The Dobbstown Weekly Whiff Reader doesn't have a single picture of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

250
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,360
It has pictures of peas.

251
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,860
It has all these hideous pictures of peas, dozens of them.

252
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,760
Everything's about you these days, Bob.

253
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,520
They put in your picture and mine at the end.

254
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,920
All you do is f*** up.

255
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,040
I know.

256
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,040
It's a claim to fame.

257
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,060
Isn't it awesome?

258
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,120
You fall upwards.

259
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,660
He's a good example of a subgenius.

260
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,220
Almost Bob-like in his childlike simplistic idiocy.

261
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,660
You may be comforted by that thought until he purges you from the party.

262
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:42,820
In incompetence and completely shot memory, he's kind of a little bit more Bob-like than most of us.

263
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,640
What were you saying?

264
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,180
There is that.

265
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:51,640
You're entering the fringes of overman territory, the way you've been acting, like Philo.

266
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,520
Yeah, Philo.

267
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,600
Philo is a lot like that.

268
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:03,400
Internal transformation that takes place upon oneself as you near the rupture time.

269
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,400
The landing side is here.

270
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,380
I'm starting to feel the power of the collective nature of the subgenius

271
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,940
and getting excited about my pleasure vessel and the sex goddesses,

272
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,980
which is, you know, as Stang has said, it's very important you understand his distinction.

273
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,060
Sex goddess takes on whatever form you like.

274
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,220
You like hamsters?

275
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,320
Sex goddess is a hamster.

276
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,420
On the other hand, they employ a chemical...

277
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,940
Watch two girls making it.

278
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,100
I'd rather be two girls making it.

279
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,580
So strong that what you want is what they are,

280
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:44,560
even though they may look like a cross between a steel spring mattress and a giant crab or something.

281
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:52,640
With this chemical attractant, you will frenziedly copulate with these so-called sex goddesses.

282
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,740
And enjoy it.

283
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,640
The first film screens wiele videos material.

284
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:22,640


285
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:22,640


286
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:22,640


287
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:22,640


288
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,380
Grandma's smashing the cats again

289
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,380
She's calling the class

290
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,500
She says I gotta feed them less

291
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,740
I can't do that because my furballs are the best

292
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,220
Yes

293
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,540

321
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,580
Grandma lifts my cat, she says it's unbelievable

322
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,000
That I even let him get this big at all

323
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,760
I said it's not my fault, he loves to eat, he loves his treats

324
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,360
And when he's good, I feed him his favorite good old fancy feets

325
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,500
So best for me to live one most delicious meal in every camp

326
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,580
Every camp

327
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,100
Every camp

328
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,920
From PR News in Washington, I'm searching for 36,000 people buried

329
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,540
Because of a volcanic same-sex

330
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,980
couple, citing his religious wildfire

331
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,120
The Dow is 91-12-33

This is PR News

337
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,300
I'm gonna go turn off that coffee machine

338
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,400
It's probably already scorched the coffee

339
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,540
I didn't think this coffee was so bad

340
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,440
In fact, I enjoyed mine

341
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,040
Good to the last drop

342
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,200
Well, I need to mix the stuff in

343
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,820
I'll mix the stuff in

344
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,040
Alright, make sure you put lots of it in

345
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,600
Oh, I will

346
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,780
I can't believe you're

347
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,180
Thank you

348
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,920
Dr. Howell has an iron tongue and stomach

349
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,620
Do I?

350
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:23,180
I guess it's from reciting all that poetry

351
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,000
That could vulcanize your throat, certainly

352
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,180
Sorry, it's too late for me to offer to move the chair

353
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,920
Watch out for the extra briefcase there

354
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,840
I attempted to make his egress more simplistic

355
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,180
But he, being the master, knew better than I, the young acolyte

356
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,740
Well, Reverend, I'm sorry, but I'm not sure you're going to be able to do that in the next few days

357
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,200
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure you're going to be able to do that in the next few days

358
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,200


359
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,300
How do you like the great state of Florida

360
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:51,980
And its marvelous invasion of walking catfish yesterday?

361
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:58,700
Well, I couldn't believe that we were all so blessed to have seen this miracle of Bob come about

362
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,500
I was told you were tripping at the time

363
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,940
Well, I stumbled here and there from place to place

364
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,880
But, you know, this is what I want to do in a wet environment

365
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Some of them even wriggled into the house

366
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,040
Across the carpet and so forth

367
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,560
Wow

368
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,040
You are crafty devils

369
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,940
Yeah, well, it's not good for them because the carpet is not wet with the dews of heaven

370
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:27,680
But it's dry and it's scraping off the mucus layer that generally surrounds and protects them

371
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,820
It brings back memories of the failed church venture of marketing those fish as pets

372
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,820
And it did not work out well and Stang had to move

373
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:44,540
My memory is vague, but I do remember that these same walking catfish created no...

374
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,400
National attention a few years ago

375
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:53,400
There was some national story about walking catfish disturbed Floridans and so forth

376
00:29:53,400 --> 00:30:00,080
Yes, it was a walk across America to gather funds for the Lou Gehrig's disease

377
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,320
But they didn't have as many catfish participants as they wanted

378
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,960
So it kind of fizzled out

379
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,320
Philo's daughter was at the X-Day in Wisteria a couple of years ago

380
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,540
And she didn't want to come anywhere near the catfish

381
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:14,540


382
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,640
She didn't want to come near the adults because she was afraid she'd see the naked person

383
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,260
She was what a prude

384
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,360
I mean, that was her choice

385
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,160
She also didn't like it when she heard bad language

386
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,480
This is the daughter of a subgenius

387
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,720
This is going to be in the Bulldada auction

388
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,240
A DVD of God's Cartoonist, the movie I was talking about yesterday

389
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did that cover

390
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,960
What? Really?

391
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,400
A documentary by...

392
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,480
It's possible you might even autograph it for someone, isn't it?

393
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,360
I've never met him

394
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,480
And now I'm involved in drawing another one of those things

395
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,380
And it has...

396
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah, it's got animated versions of chick comics brought to life

397
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,200
Of the history of the great man and all of his artists

398
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,900
It's got me making a terrible mistake

399
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:04,060
I don't know, I hope people think I'm doing it on purpose

400
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:08,260
Where I mention John 3.16 instead of 3.17

401
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,940
Oh yeah, that really stood out

402
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,880
It did

403
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,240
Because that's the Jesus...

404
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,780
John 3.16

405
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,120
For he so loved the world he gave his only begotten son

406
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,200
Yeah, yeah

407
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,000
There's a store in West Virginia where everything was priced

408
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,920
Three, either $3.16, $31.60

409
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,980
Jesus Christ

410
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,820
That was the only prices

411
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,860
It didn't last long

412
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm not guilty

413
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,460
Ethiopia was set to expire

414
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,540
Ethiopia was beset by a storm

415
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,180
Sparking power

416
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,800
The head of the Roman Catholic Church sent a telegram today saying

417
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,400
This is PR News

418
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:58,040
This Don't Think button goes very well with this wonderful t-shirt image of Bob's pipe

419
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,120
Smoking Bob's brain

420
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,560
It almost looks like a tree

421
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,880
I saved this one for today

422
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,700
It's my favorite

423
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,280
Emerging from the bowl of Bob's pipe

424
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,880
I think Aspira did this

425
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,320
Beautiful job

426
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,480
Oh yeah, it's one of my...

427
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:13,980
It says...

428
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,820
Subgenius Olympic Doping Committee

429
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,320
That's me

430
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:24,960
See, subgenius olympics, you are not allowed to participate unless you're doping of some kind

431
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,880
Okay, we don't want really good athletes

432
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,820
Oh, you can just be a dope

433
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,180
Or a dope, yeah

434
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,240
And by definition...

435
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,320
But the dope is such an ugly word

436
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,440
We prefer the term subgenius

437
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,420
There, see I do it every day

438
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,180
Why do you think they call it dope?

439
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,000
Every single day

440
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:39,760
Yeah

441
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:43,960
Subgenius Olympic Doping Committee

442
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:43,960


443
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:43,960


444
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,600
Doping Committee

445
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,140
We're going to have our own version, sort of, of the Olympics today

446
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,380
We're going to have the Olympics

447
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,620
The Special Olympics

448
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,720
And it will be a phallic festival of fun

449
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,780
I saw that in the schedule

450
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,180
Yeah

451
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,680
No, it was the Olymp-dics, wasn't it?

452
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,540
The Olymp-dics

453
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,840
Yeah, well that's easy

454
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,140
Did I say it wrong?

455
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,500
I should win that one real easily

456
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,480
I've got so many of them, and pretty much all of them have gone limp

457
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,180
I was thinking...

458
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:13,940
There's one that I forgot to mention...

459
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,080
I can still crank up if I work at it

460
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,360
I was thinking... well...

461
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,380
And by crank up, I mean pee

462
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,880
Is it a manual type crank, or is it like one of those push buttons for your blinds?

463
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,180
Both

464
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,340
You know how the blinds kind of...

465
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,000
Either one

466
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,160
Oh, okay, that's handy

467
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,060
That's handy

468
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,740
It's based on a garage door opener, actually

469
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,820
Well, Dear Abby recommends putting some sort of device in there

470
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,620
That can be activated from a remote control box

471
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,380
It's like a comedy

472
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,220
One of her columns that I read

473
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,320
Dear Abby suggested put a thing in there that you can control with a remote control

474
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,800
TV remote control box

475
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,220
An automatic stiffening device

476
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,500
It was in her column, her serious answer to somebody's question

477
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,100
Well, I was thinking something between an auto-suck and a garage door opener

478
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,920
And a garbage disposal

479
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,300
Why not both?

480
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,660
All three, yeah

481
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,080
Yeah

482
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,120
Yeah, why not all three?

483
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,200
Yeah, I don't know why not all three, but...

484
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,520
Three sometimes comes up

485
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,960
I think the auto-suck combined with the garbage disposal would be really awesome

486
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,840
But it depends on which end you put the garbage disposal

487
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,740
Like if it's first...

488
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,080
Oh yeah, you don't want to screw...

489
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,620
You don't want to do it when you're drunk

490
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:25,960
Yeah

491
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,420
Just what kind of disposal are you...

492
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,240
Stay sober for that type of pleasure

493
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
Yeah

494
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,480
As if the garbage ever really went away

495
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,420
It never actually goes away

496
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,760
That's the illusion

497
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,040
That you whisk it away

498
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,120
It's just food for the sea friends

499
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,080
Uh huh

500
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,600
That's what the walking catfish eat

501
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,840
The algal slime set to cover the earth

502
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,680
Now is that what makes the coating on them?

503
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,620
Or that's the secretion that they exude?

504
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,440
What's the secretion?

505
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,540
The catfish, you were...

506
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,900
Earlier you were giving a warning that you...

507
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,300
Besides touching them because of the barbs

508
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,600
That there's a mucus...

509
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:06,820
Yeah, they...

510
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:11,300
That's an interface they have between themselves and the environment

511
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,320
I got it

512
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,360
So they...

513
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,080
But they can scrape that mucus off

514
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,360
Particularly when they slither into your house

515
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,520
And are scraping across the carpet and the floor

516
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,220
You know, you're gaining no liquid

517
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,540
And you're losing that mucus

518
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:33,220
So those fish had to be helped out by helpful human xanthia

519
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,200
I got to be good friends with several of them

520
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,700
Before I cast them back into the pond

521
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,720
Well that's good

522
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,200
I'm sure that will count as well

523
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:43,760
That's part of your score

524
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,580
I've got to say this is my favorite part of X-Day

525
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,700
A new animal

526
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,260
I've never encountered before

527
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:48,800
And never...

528
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,900
Hundreds of them

529
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,920
All over the yard

530
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,480
All I could think of was

531
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,320
Peas is tripping

532
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,580
He's going to freak out

533
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,860
It took a long time to see them

534
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,080
But then after seeing the first one

535
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,520
We saw hundreds of them

536
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:00,980
Billy, you deal with shit

537
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,540
He was completely immune to it

538
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,700
He was a regular Ken Kesey

539
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,660
Walking fish

540
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,540
Mary Prankster school of acid overdosing

541
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,940
And still functioning

542
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,200
You have to be able to drive the fish

543
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,120
You have to drive a school bus

544
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,880
While tripping on four hits of acid

545
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,120
And you pass the acid test

546
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,060
Peas passed that test yesterday

547
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,200
I'm so proud

548
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,600
I can't wait to tell my mother

549
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,560
I've passed that test so many times

550
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,860
I don't need to take it anymore

551
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,660
The school bus?

552
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,220
Really?

553
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,260
Well a school bus full of hippies

554
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,280
Not full of kids

555
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:31,920
Not children

556
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,420
That would be criminal

557
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:33,820
That would be irresponsible

558
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,660
If it was like that it would happen

559
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,960
No one cares what happens to you

560
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,400
I've ended up tripping and driving

561
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,240
But I don't recommend it

562
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,460
When I was 18

563
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,420
I read Tom Wolfe's

564
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,640
Glamorized story of the Mary Pranksters

565
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,120
The electric Kool-Aid acid test

566
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,140
And I distinctly remember thinking

567
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,620
Man, what a cool scene

568
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,260
I wish I could do something like that

569
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,360
Well since then

570
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,100
I've actually seen the bus movie

571
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,920
Kesey sent it to me himself

572
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,140
And we so totally outdid the Mary Pranksters

573
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:15,200
And Kesey, we never went as far as having the Hell's Angels hanging around

574
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,680
To scare everybody

575
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,500
And I never had to escape the police in a helicopter

576
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,640
And I never went to prison

577
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,380
Because we didn't have LSD

578
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,220
Jars of LSD around

579
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:31,020
But we managed to do the big national freak out thing

580
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,920
Better than those guys ever dreamed of

581
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,100
Of course they didn't have the internet

582
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,720
And they had to use 16mm cameras

583
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,120
But then so did I for a long time

584
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,380
Anyway, Kesey was a subgenius

585
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,660
He actually wanted to come

586
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,120
I didn't know that

587
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,840
Yeah, yeah, he would have been at the first convention

588
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,620
If I'd had money for a plane ticket

589
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,600
Not only that

590
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,960
He said, you know, get me a plane ticket

591
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,060
First church of the last laugh also

592
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,780
Yeah, I never met Kesey

593
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,940
He was there for one of those

594
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,800
His buddy Ken is still in touch

595
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:10,100
And his son is selling Bob Blotter replicas

596
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,500
Somebody sent me a link to

597
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,760
Some asshole is selling fake acid

598
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,660
Blotter acid with Bob on it

599
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,220
And I looked at it and it was like

600
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,400
Oh, that's Ken Kesey's son

601
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,980
Oh, we owe them, that's okay

602
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,920
He's allowed

603
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,860
I'm not gonna bother him

604
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,780
I should have hit him up for a free copy though

605
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,420
But, yeah, boy, Kesey died real suddenly

606
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,440
Exactly when he was my age

607
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,260
67, I think

608
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,140
Everybody thought he was just fine

609
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,880
It was liver, some liver thing

610
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,260
But you had a close brush a couple years ago

611
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,380
The same thing could have happened

612
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,700
But they rushed you in the helicopter

613
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,080
Helicopter, yeah, yeah

614
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,780
Saved you

615
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,360
Yeah

616
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,020
Oh, I wasn't any

617
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,580
I was just a mere 90% blockage

618
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,460
Yeah, you'd be fine

619
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,740
I waited three hours to go to the doctor

620
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,740
Reading about heart attacks

621
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,100
Guys, I love you so much

622
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,340
Taking aspirin and drinking beer

623
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,240
And thinking, listen, go away

624
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,020
I'm gonna take a break

625
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,700
And let Papa Joe Mama come up here

626
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,940
And get ready for the rest of our crazy events

627
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,000
That we got planned up

628
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,260
The Ask Dr. Hal show

629
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,020
Olympics

630
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,000
Uh, baptism

631
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,920
Oh, man, how could I forget that?

632
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,520
Baptism

633
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,340
You've gotta get

634
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,180
I'm gonna get baptismed again

635
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,660
Just cause I don't like it when Stang touches me

636
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,280
So

637
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,480
No, we're gonna do that in the pool

638
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,640
Or, I think the pool

639
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,400
No, there's an alligator in the damn pond

640
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,380
We're doing it in the pool

641
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,360
Well, I did heard the hot tub

642
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,820
And I thought that's a dumb idea

643
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,280
Too small

644
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,320
That's just gonna be a subgenius stew

645
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,000
As somebody pointed out

646
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,840
Since all of our funk washes off

647
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:37,920
You know, we're gonna have to

648
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:37,920


649
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:37,920


650
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:37,920


651
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:37,920


652
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:37,920


653
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:37,920


654
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,780
Get off into that pool water

655
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,860
When we go home

656
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,020
We'll be covered with each other's germs

657
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,100
Like, did you say funk or stomp?

658
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,100
No, I don't know if that's togetherness

659
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,040
Or just gross

660
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,720
Well, I

661
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,400
Maybe both

662
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,660
Why not both?

663
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:48,880
Trust me

664
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,580
Keep the pH of that pool

665
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,260
Stomach turning and endearing

666
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,200
At the same time

667
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,880
There'll be lots of new subgeniuses in nine months

668
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,620
All from the pool experience

669
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,780
Well, it'll broaden our gene pool

670
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,680
That, too, is often a topic of

671
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,620
We've never had the problem that the Amish had

672
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:03,800
Dear Abbie

673
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,580
Could you be impregnated by being in a pool

674
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,900
While someone had been masturbating?

675
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:07,900


676
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,740
They asked Abbie that

677
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,880
And Abbie went into it and said that

678
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,840
There was a very remote possibility

679
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,040
That that could happen

680
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,180
Now, hold on, Hal

681
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,820
People describe me a good debater

682
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,860
But a master debater

683
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,200
That's taken a little far

684
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,440
No one is more than momentarily mastered

685
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,300
Then there's the relaxation and ease

686
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,140
That would just take me too long

687
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,960
I used to be able to knock one off

688
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,980
In about 30 seconds

689
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,740
Oh, is it?

690
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,660
I mean, in about an hour and a half

691
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,460
Coming and going

692
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,540
Coming and always too soon

693
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,880
Used to be able to hit the ceiling

694
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,620
Crumb said he felt he'd been released

695
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,560
By some force that made him act like an idiot

696
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,220
And I'm glad it was gone

697
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,920
Oh, old man at old age got me

698
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,160
What you got in there?

699
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,000
Eh, he brought some nuts for the nuts

700
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,060
Yeah, there you go

701
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,600
Soup to nuts

702
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,940
For some nuts

703
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,900
Well, there's some odd stuff

704
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:07,900


705
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:07,900


706
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:07,900


707
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:07,900


708
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:07,900


709
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:07,900


710
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:07,900


711
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:07,900


712
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:07,900


713
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:07,900


714
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:07,900


715
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:07,900


716
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:07,900


717
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:07,900


718
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,920
Almonds in there

719
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,060
Some color-appropriated raisins

720
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,960
And all sorts of unusual

721
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,240
The rural rednecks of Texas

722
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,780
Seem to think that California

723
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:29,280
Is just a bunch of silly antifa libtards

724
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,900
Burning all their cities down

725
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,960
They don't seem to understand

726
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,940
That most of California

727
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,300
Is actually farmland

728
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,400
Full of conservative rednecks

729
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:36,920
Absolutely

730
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,880
And fruit-saving

731
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


732
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


733
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


734
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


735
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


736
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


737
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


738
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


739
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


740
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


741
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


742
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


743
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


744
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


745
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


746
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,880


747
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,280
Fruits and nuts

748
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,560
They have

749
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,320
It is a land of fruits and nuts

750
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,600
And the human ones live in the big cities

751
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,980
But the countryside is regular edible fruits and nuts

752
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,940
And they're really good

753
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,400
And I've never understood

754
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,640
Why these rural Texans hate California so much

755
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,520
Well, that goes for the rest of the country

756
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,860
They say California starts a trend

757
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,580
And then the country follows it

758
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,260
So what's in California now

759
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,820
Will be universal soon

760
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,800
And much sooner than it used to be

761
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,920
You being in the religious biz, though

762
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,860
I mean, any good religion person

763
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,760
Should know that

764
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,920
It's not about loving your own religion

765
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,800
That brings people together

766
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,620
It's hating the other religions

767
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:18,960
Right

768
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,040
That's why

769
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,900
The dream of everyone else going to hell

770
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,800
The same thing happens with politics

771
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,040
You gotta hate the other side

772
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,740
That's what brings all of your side together

773
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,920
Right

774
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,020
You gotta really

775
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,740
And it's become

776
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,520
That's what all it is now

777
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,000
Nobody can say anything good about their own side

778
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,860
They can only say

779
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,780
Infinite bad lies about the other side

780
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,880
I'm still waiting for the

781
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,540
Biden's the best president ever bumper sticker

782
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,960
It's out there somewhere, I'm sure

783
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,440
But we're still getting the we hate Trump stickers

784
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,680
And of course, when Trump was president

785
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,260
Obama was his turn in the barrel

786
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,700
Everybody hates the other guy

787
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,680
When Trump is reinstated in August, you mean?

788
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,000
Lock them all up

789
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,320
Lock them all up

790
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,540
Lock them all up

791
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,880
Lock us up

792
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,020
Lock us up

793
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,100
Lock us up

794
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:06,280
Lock us up

795
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:06,840
Lock us up

796
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,320
They've all thrown a little in a hole

797
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:10,540
1947

798
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:19,540
What at the end of the wing

799
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:26,060
Wait what's he doing

800
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:26,680
Oh I was withdrawal

801
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,180
Isn't it ridiculous

802
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,640
Why not

803
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,260
Look at the

804
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:30,260


805
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:30,260


806
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:30,260


807
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:30,260


808
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:30,260


809
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:30,300
We've always been

810
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:30,320
We've always become

811
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:30,320


812
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:30,320


813
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:30,320


814
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:30,320


815
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,440
Everyone's a one-man band

816
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:31,520
Somebody called it

817
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:31,800
Media

818
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm saying

819
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,000


820
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,000


821
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,000


822
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,700
There's Toward

823
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,240
On the bar

824
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:34,340
There's Crystals

825
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:34,340


826
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,340
I think

827
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:35,940
On the bar

828
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,360
We'll see what happens

829
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:41,180
I'm looking out at my class here today and I'm noticing you're all wearing blue jeans.

830
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,480
Do you mean like that?

831
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,640
Yeah, well, you see, it's a convergence of forces.

832
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,200
And one of them is convenience.

833
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:57,660
Because if you just dress like everybody else, then you don't have to spend time thinking about it or worrying about it.

834
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,060
So you are free to do other things.

835
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,180
You're not occupied with something that is trivial.

836
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:10,980
The Brundlefly School of Clothing Fashion just wear the same suit every day.

837
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,540
We got that idea from Einstein.

838
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,660
He said, I essentially do pretty much the same thing.

839
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,880
I just don't even think about it.

840
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:26,020
I'm not fabric oriented and don't give a shit what other people think about how I look.

841
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,880
That would never have worked for me.

842
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:33,860
There was never any point in which I thought, if only I looked a little more slick.

843
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,900
Wait a minute, what am I talking about?

844
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:36,980
Well, it's a slippery slope.

845
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:42,300
If you start caring about the way you look, the next thing you're going to worry about is the way that other people perceive your thoughts.

846
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,100
Right, exactly.

847
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:47,040
It can be more motivated by the way you don't want to look.

848
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,520
So that ends up determining how you look.

849
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:51,480
Defiance.

850
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,520
The central ingredient to subgeniusness.

851
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:02,820
Says the guy wearing the SS uniform hat, but with a Dobbs head stuck on top.

852
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:03,540
No, I'm not.

853
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,360
This isn't SS.

854
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,220
This is actually a communist hat.

855
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:06,800
Is it?

856
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,080
Yeah.

857
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,740
Papa Joe was Stalin.

858
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,020
Uh-huh.

859
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,480
But, you know, I don't want to put down, I mean, after all, the Nazis did come in second place.

860
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,280
But first place actually goes to Mao Zedong.

861
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,340
Yeah.

862
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:27,740
And then I guess it depends on where you draw the lines, but Papa Joe Stalin did come in a close second and Hitler third.

863
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,520
Did you ever read the last Doc Savage novel ever written, but not Papa Joe?

864
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,040
No.

865
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:34,040


866
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:34,040


867
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:38,500
I think it's the last one he published where Doc and his men go into Stalinist Russia for an operation.

868
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,860
No, no, uh-uh.

869
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:45,260
I thought the last Doc Savage novel he actually started down to hell.

870
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,920
Up from Earth's center.

871
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:47,940
This is the one.

872
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,280
It's the last one because he gets killed.

873
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,100
And he ran into something that terrified even him.

874
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:52,860
Yes.

875
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,480
But there was another one after that?

876
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,820
It's called The Red Spider.

877
00:45:58,980 --> 00:45:59,540
Wow.

878
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,640
Did it get reprinted somehow?

879
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,420
I have it with me.

880
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,340
I'm going to put it in the bulldog to auction.

881
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,180
He keeps it with him at all times.

882
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:08,980
Okay, I got dibs on that one.

883
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:09,920
Oh, really?

884
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,080
You may have.

885
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,620
Why bother putting it into auction?

886
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:20,860
Onan recently sent me a collection of every Doc Savage comic book.

887
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,640
Oh, yes.

888
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,080
They had Street and Smith published them.

889
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:24,680
I had no idea how many times.

890
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,360
I didn't know how many times it had been attempted.

891
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,320
There were like 20 different versions.

892
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,200
There was a slight difference about it.

893
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,440
I had to wear this hood with a special jewel in it that gave him his powers.

894
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,380
Do you remember that?

895
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,640
No.

896
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,360
That he got from an old priestly llama-like person?

897
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,340
I don't know.

898
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,180
In the comic.

899
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:52,920
He wore high boots and pants, no shirt, and this hood with the jewel on it.

900
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:58,440
And if you weren't totally pure and a super being like Doc Savage, it would kill you to

901
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:58,900
put it on.

902
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,180
But Clark Savage was a super being.

903
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:03,740
And I knew, I knew he was a super being.

904
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:03,740


905
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:03,740


906
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:03,740


907
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:03,740


908
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:03,740


909
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:03,740


910
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:03,740


911
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,400
That's the way it was in the comic book, not in the pulp magazines.

912
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,600
So he survived.

913
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,440
He was worthy.

914
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,820
Worthy of the jewel.

915
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,080
He perfected himself.

916
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,820
That was his idea.

917
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:22,740
Like Batman, Doc Savage just started out as an ordinary person who trained himself with

918
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:30,940
exercises and mental exercises and acrobatics and chemistry and science and ballistics and

919
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,080
...

920
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,820
Batman owes Doc Savage an explanation for sure

921
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,120
well my favorite

922
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,180
the utility belt and all that stuff

923
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,920
Doc Savage had all that

924
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,460
and he didn't need a mask

925
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,860
he had a fortress of solitude before Superman did

926
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,900
that's where Superman got that idea

927
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,760
well I could tell you

928
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,080
Arctic retreat where he goes and meditates

929
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,100
in the snow in his speedos or something

930
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,100
well think about it

931
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,000
Clark Kent

932
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,280
both Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne

933
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,220
would have been the right age to have been reading

934
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,860
Doc Savage pulp novels

935
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,520
that's true

936
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,640
when they were coming out in the early 30s

937
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,740
deep into his увPeter

938
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:56,740


939
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:56,740


940
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:56,880
even with new technology

941
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:56,880


942
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:56,960
cunt

943
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,060
cool

944
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:01,920
your empty soul

945
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,180
It can't possibly be that hard

946
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,600
I get impatient as well

947
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,400
But I'd rather wait

948
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,220
for the second

949
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,160
to see if I need to jump out

950
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,160
guitar solo

951
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,840
These kids are pretty quick

952
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,840
on their feet

953
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,340
So you're looking

954
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,580
for some trouble

955
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,040
When you're going nearly

956
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,860
60 down my street

957
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,620
guitar solo

958
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,860
guitar solo

959
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:02,040
guitar solo

960
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,040
guitar solo

961
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,000
Thank you.

962
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,020
Thank you.

963
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,520
Thank you.

964
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,900
Thank you.

965
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,320
Thank you.

966
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,480
Thank you.

967
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,320
Thank you.

968
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,180
Thank you.

969
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:44,320
Thank you.

970
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:44,980
Thank you.

971
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:14,980
Thank you.

972
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,180
Thank you.

973
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,360
Thank you.

974
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,820
Thank you.

975
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,660
Thank you.

976
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:19,660


977
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:19,660


978
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,540
Thank you.

979
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,080
Thank you.

980
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,040
Thank you.

981
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,980
Thank you.

982
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,480
Thank you.

983
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,700
that on VHS somewhere.

984
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,160
Supposedly part of that was filmed

985
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,100
in Glen Rose.

986
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,780
Well, there's an attempt to do some

987
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,680
creditable stop motion dinosaur

988
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,020
effects, but of course those things are hard to

989
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,220
do gracefully and symmetrically.

990
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,180
I've wondered

991
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,060
if maybe they used the Dinosaur

992
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,960
Valley State Park for

993
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,080
Dinosaur Valley Girls, if only for

994
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,040
the title sequence.

995
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,240
They've got a free sign there.

996
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,580
So-called

997
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,140
scream queen

998
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,080
starlets of the time

999
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,400
in Cave Girl

1000
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,220
drag and then these

1001
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,360
oafs with beards

1002
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,300
grunting with clubs and so on.

1003
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,840
All very stereotypically.

1004
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,460
In sequences which

1005
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,700
go on far too long.

1006
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,680
But it's

1007
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,560
an oddity. That's the sort

1008
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,020
of thing we should be showing for

1009
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,520
Oddball Movie Night

1010
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,820
and so on.

1011
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,380
The same things tend to be shown

1012
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,340
over and over.

1013
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,120
Is that a VHS copy or a DVD?

1014
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,080
I believe it's a VHS copy

1015
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,420
that the late Pedro recorded

1016
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,320
for me.

1017
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:53,000
Just for those in the know, Hal's

1018
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,240
room is essential

1019
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,260
visiting grounds if you're

1020
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,320
a bit of a hoarder like myself. I made sure

1021
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,100
that my wife had a chance to see it.

1022
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,500
It's not hoarding, I just don't have enough room for the stuff.

1023
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,700
Readjust what her definition of cluttered is.

1024
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,460
Some sacrifices are worth

1025
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:09,720
making.

1026
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,240
And that's why

1027
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,140
he also gets a little bit

1028
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,000
exacerbated if you send him something he already

1029
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,780
has. Because it's like

1030
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,520
this is just what I need.

1031
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,780
We'll continue this

1032
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:23,020
nostalgic nerd out another

1033
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,440
time. Thanks to Reverend Pease,

1034
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,200
Papa Joe Mama, and Dr. Hal.

1035
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,260
And thanks to Rubik's

1036
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,180
Pube for all of the songs in this

1037
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,620
show. And

1038
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:35,340
thanks to Lemur for the titles

1039
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,400
and PR news.

1040
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,840
You can find everything

1041
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,360
about everything at subgenius.com

1042
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,420
including how to become

1043
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:44,900
an actual minister

1044
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,340
in the church of the subgenius.

1045
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,620
To end the show,

1046
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,420
let's go to another album by

1047
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,220
Rubik's Pube, the album

1048
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,940
Bob Comp 1,

1049
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:58,080
also easily found on bandcamp.com

1050
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,620
as are, for that

1051
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:01,420
matter, a dozen subgenius

1052
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,980
official music compilation

1053
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,120
albums spanning decades.

1054
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,340
But now, Rubik's

1055
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,040
Pube.

1056
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,920
Yuttyism in a young

1057
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,560
female

1058
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,040
Enlargement of the

1059
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,360
feet and shoulders, and of course

1060
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,300
the third nostril.

1061
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:36,060
Spaghettification

1062
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,360
and reversion.

1063
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:39,760
Isolating yourself

1064
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,560
from them.

1065
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,660
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

1066
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,480
Ooh.

1067
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,220
Ooh.

1068
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,320
Ooh.

1069
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,020
Ooh.

1070
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:46,860
Ooh.

1071
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,100
Shapeshifting,

1072
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:49,840
pre-gifting,

1073
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:50,660
bestiality,

1074
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:51,920
insanity, defying gravity,

1075
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,260
exposing yourself, unfortunately,

1076
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,720
to the underlying primal hierarchy.

1077
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,460
And not giving a Bob damn.

1078
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,600
.

1079
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,420
.

1080
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,480
.

1081
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,520
.

1082
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:27,780
.

1083
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,180
Oh God.

1084
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,240
Oh my babies.

1085
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:32,920
Oh if.

1086
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,620
Oh if.

1087
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,580
Okay for all your left.

1088
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,860
Off the top of my bed.

1089
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,180
Of course you throw.

Bye!
