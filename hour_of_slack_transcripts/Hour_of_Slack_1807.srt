1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,600
Bob

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,840
Bob

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,240
Bob

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,460
Bob

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:16,860
Bob

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:16,920
Bob

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:16,940
Bob

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,120
Bob

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,000
Bob

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,300
What we've got here is a failure to communicate.

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,120
The subgenius powerhouse.

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,320
I don't like it any more than you, man.

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,320
My CPE is intact.

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,520
Thank you, LeMire.

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,100
This episode is another one of those perverted group marriages of young, old, and in between.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,680
From Hour of Slack number 88,

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,280
we hear from

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,720
the young 1987 puzzling evidence,

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,960
Paul Mavridis, Dr. Hal, Ivan Stang, Pope Sternodocs,

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,940
St. Viren Werner, and Dr. Philodrummond.

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,040
We hear those selfsame early apostles as doddering old codgers

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,640
in an excerpt from Sandy Boone's fine documentary film about the Church of the Subgenius.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,220
In between, from the future year of 2000,

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,880
we hear the middle-aged Stang, that's me,

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,960
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and Professor Chaz Smith,

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,500
back before the wars and the diseases and the deaths

27
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,660
when we were all ever so happy-go-slacky

28
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,020
at ESO's Swamp Radio on WCSB Cleveland.

29
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,680
There's not much music, but what there is,

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,220
is the Rudi Schwartz Project and Shemiki,

31
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,080
Shemikiya Copeland.

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,700
The music in the background is CyberChump from this moment of perfect happiness.

33
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,240
And now, back in time.

34
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,620
I'm gonna start all over again.

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,500
I've got to start this damn show all over again.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,200
God, I'm so sick and tired of having to start this stupid show

37
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,960
over and over and over again.

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,640
This show never seems to go anywhere.

39
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,020
It's nothing but an endless beginning.

40
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,880
A thousand beginning sequences, it seems like.

41
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,260
Ugh.

42
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,020
Oh, yes, dear friends.

43
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,260
You're listening to the Ivan Stang Theme by Nino Rota,

44
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
by way of Snakefinger.

45
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,320
We got some, a whole bunch of stuff from Ralph Records.

46
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,940
Oh, praise Bob.

47
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,340
The wonderful Reverend Sheena over there at Ralph Records

48
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,660
has converted to Bob and to the Hour of Slack,

49
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,000
and so I've got an infinite supply of all the stuff that's coming up.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,260
All the material from Ralph Records.

51
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,540
And I'll be playing some of the new, oh, a little bit of new residents,

52
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,300
new negative land,

53
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,740
and Snakefinger.

54
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,920
But, but you know those things pale in comparison to that

55
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,400
which has been sanctified by Bob.

56
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,180
Because, dear friends, which came first, really?

57
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,800
The mistake or the excuse?

58
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,860
You know, the astounding power of the human mind

59
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,220
is nowhere better illustrated than in its ability

60
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,280
to rationalize its own mistakes.

61
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,780
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

62
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,120
It can devise wonderful machines and soaring concertos.

63
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,240
But those wilt, dear friends, besides the inventiveness of its excuses.

64
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,860
After all, must we not survive before we can afford to indulge in such pleasantries?

65
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
As pleasantries is culture and science?

66
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,240
The alcoholic, for instance, or the yogi,

67
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,120
or any cult member or subgenius,

68
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,160
by intuitively recognizing this, can bypass it.

69
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:36,600
And even in that, find excuses to bypass survival itself.

70
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,120
Yes, alcohol or Bob, in other words,

71
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,480
can be more seductive than life itself.

72
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,880
Ah, yes, praise Bob.

73
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,140
This is your friend, Reverend Ivan Stack,

74
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,840
and you're listening to The Hour of Slack on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

75
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,620
Oh, yes.

76
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,060
Thank you.

77
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,140
Thank you.

78
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,120
Oh, yes.

79
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,220
Thank you.

80
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:24,760
Thank you.

81
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,160
Thank you.

82
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:49,540
at some point one of us said something like why aren't we we rich yet we've got all these skills

83
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:59,100
and things and and Philo goes well I guess we're not geniuses we're really just subjeans and in my

84
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:09,440
head everything fell together like a puzzle box a Rubik's Cube that suddenly formed itself a weird

85
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:17,420
fringe cult for weirdos specifically for weirdos that was the Church of the subgenius

86
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:26,460
when we did the first pamphlet it was really a labor of love the pasting up the cutting we

87
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:33,380
tied together every fringe belief you could think of it was like getting all your toys

88
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,400
your dinosaur toys and your army men toys and your cowboy and Indian toys putting them all

89
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,460
together on the floor and having this whole world that was a conglomerate of all the cool stuff ever

90
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:49,440
it was so much fun we had this sort of an icon we can blame everything on the conspiracy

91
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,320
of normalcy there's Bob the conspiracy and slack you know if you're gonna have a cult you have to

92
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,880
have a cult leader well that's Bob we need to put a face to that entity we can't afford artwork no

93
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,800
this clip art the public domain stuff it's old nobody cares about it as we flip through the

94
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,400
catalog there was that face we both instantly knew that's Bob

95
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,460
after a couple of months we had assembled subgenius pamphlet number one

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,480
when the printing bill came in on the first pamphlet it was sixty dollars my wife got very

97
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,960
upset with that you're going to have to send these to publishers we can't afford that kind

98
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,720
of thing you need to try to turn into a book or something publishers wow okay I got writer's digest

99
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,840
every publisher in the United States and mailed the pamphlet to him

100
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:01,240
we got 150 rejection slips back the rest of them didn't say anything

101
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:18,000
I was living in San Francisco working with my comic partner Gilbert Shelton at ripoff press

102
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,920
I wandered into the publisher's office a fellow named Fred and he opened some envelope up and

103
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:34,080
pulled out the initial pamphlet he grumbled something about it and threw it in the trash can

104
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:43,020
next to his desk to his complete irritation I pulled it out and just laughing at it it's the

105
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:49,200
funniest thing I've ever read it was kind of like how refreshing I think my first act was

106
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,440
to like get an envelope and put all the cash I had in my wallet in it and wrote notes saying send me

107
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:09,720
more pamphlets pamphlet pamphlet number one is the significant document in many ways it is the vector

108
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,760
by which many people have had their most significant introduction to the church of the subgenius Doug

109
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,440
Doug sent the pamphlet to KPFA and so I saw that and really loved it and for years, since

110
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,980
I was a kid, I've been putting stuff in the mail to strangers.

111
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,720
So they became new strangers.

112
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,680
They start mailing stuff back.

113
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:34,300
It was like the internet really, but instead of a thousand people it was ten or fifteen

114
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:34,840
of us.

115
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,940
It was really fun.

116
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,180
It was such a seminal little pamphlet.

117
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,980
It was almost like a test of your mindset.

118
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,640
Like were you a subgenius or not?

119
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,280
If you got it, you were a subgenius.

120
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,300
It really spoke to me.

121
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:54,600
It had this whole thing about how the goal is slack and the motto is fuck them if they

122
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,420
can't take a joke.

123
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:01,500
The central doctrine more than anything else in the church of the subgenius of course is

124
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,760
this slack thing.

125
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,460
It's probably one of the hardest things to describe in the church, you know.

126
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,840
We don't describe it because by definition slack is really different for each person.

127
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,080
Slack is what everybody wants.

128
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,620
It's what we sell.

129
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,060
It's what we still want.

130
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,740
This idea of, you know, a place where people can live, where they don't feel harried by

131
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,800
just the multiple things that one feels harried by all the time.

132
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,680
You know when you don't have it, that's for sure.

133
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:34,060
It was like finding like-minded people, if you could truly say any of us have minds to

134
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,520
be alike.

135
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:41,000
You know, somebody with the same type of cynical perspective, same reference points.

136
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,900
They were so layered in everything.

137
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,400
It was part pop culture, part science, part religion.

138
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:55,160
So it appealed to me a great deal and I did do just as it said, I sent a dollar with the

139
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,460
letter.

140
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,640
What's that say, send a dollar?

141
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,520
Even I've got a dollar so I sent off a dollar and I got this little pamphlet and that was

142
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,460
where the crushing loneliness started to get chipped away.

143
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,480
I was doing a magazine called Famous Potatoes.

144
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,740
Using a lot of ads and clip art stuff.

145
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:13,880
I was doing a magazine called Famous Potatoes.

146
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:13,980
Using a lot of ads and clip art stuff.

147
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,340
And it was a fine artist, Robert Williams, who said, hey, you ought to send some stuff

148
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,480
off to the Church of the Subgenius.

149
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,120
They're doing a bunch of clip art stuff like you do.

150
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,480
So I sent stuff off and I think it arrived just after Stang's birthday or something and

151
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,120
he just flipped out over the Famous Potatoes and he sent me all the pack, you know, and

152
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,780
I didn't have to pay.

153
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,880
And there was a flyer on a phone poll that said, get ready for a pretty tough future.

154
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:43,880


155
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:43,880


156
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:43,880


157
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:43,880


158
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:43,880


159
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:43,880


160
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,360
What scientists are afraid to tell us.

161
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,980
And then there was a picture of Bob.

162
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,600
I showed it to all my pals and they were just like, yeah, yeah.

163
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,200
So we didn't send him a dollar.

164
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,600
We sent him $100 from Little Rock.

165
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,520
And we got the first pamphlet back.

166
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,060
That just bobbed us all up immediately.

167
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,460
It was a little bit of a sense that there are other people interested in these things.

168
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:12,460
They might be far away and they might exist from post office box to post office box, but

169
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,420
they are out there.

170
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:13,860
They're out there.

171
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,700
They're out there.

172
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,900
It was intoxicating to think that there was somewhere where you didn't have to fit in

173
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,720
where people were crazy in the good way.

174
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,040
So I sent him my 10 bucks and I became a subgenius.

175
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,780
We got the first few orders coming in.

176
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,680
Remember, we were so excited and then all of a sudden...

177
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,960
Terrified more like it.

178
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,400
It was like, what?

179
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,980
Somebody actually sent us $10?

180
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,360
Now we're going to have to do that.

181
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,240
Now we actually had to start working and doing stuff.

182
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,800
From PR News in Washington, I'm making final preparations just hours before the start

183
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,120
of PR's historic Trump of the Trump being Trump tested so far.

184
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,700
The Trump is hoping to help the greasy dead bodies of migrants who have drowned at sea.

185
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,880
But the European Union says it's dishonest and weak.

186
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,160
Experts say the Trump or the Trump or also the Trump is looking for his PR News Washington.

187
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,420
Sanction.

188
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,440
Trump requires cooperation, not PR News.

189
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,060
Critics fear this could severely and fairly disrupt people's PR News.

190
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,940
But there are concerns about a large scale burger testing lab that's hostile to PR News in Amsterdam.

191
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,640
Health officials in Democratic Republic of Congo say this is PR.

192
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,580
They also confirm 38 infections.

193
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:41,100
...to the US as well as round the clock radio messages to the American population urging them to overthrow the evil robber barons.

194
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,840
...who have seized power in this bloodless coup.

195
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:51,480
Presidential appointee George W. Bush showed little understanding of the gravity of the situation after UN sanctions were explained to him.

196
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,740
If they don't like it, maybe they should look for a new home for their organization, he reportedly said.

197
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,360
Sanctions are scheduled to begin immediately.

198
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,920
What kind of flavor sanctions are we going to be having?

199
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,080
Well that is, that's not only disturbing but it's also very, I don't know, I don't know.

200
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,820
Kind of exhilarating to think that we might be liberated by UN troops soon.

201
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,360
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

202
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,260
Come to restore Martian law.

203
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:24,680
Right, the Nicaraguans and Colombians and so forth will be sending police keeping, peace keeping troops here too.

204
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,340
I hope the drug lord sends some, send a few squads or squads.

205
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,420
Squat teams.

206
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,080
Squat teams.

207
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,420
That's all you can think about, isn't it Dave?

208
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,760
Squatting or teams?

209
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,000
Boats, teeing and squatting and stuff.

210
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,920
Actually all I can think about is like riding around in a boat with a bunch of girls.

211
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,640
But that's, that almost got me into an accident on the way here.

212
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,320
I saw some home movies of you skiing behind a boatload of girls.

213
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,100
Yeah but that was.

214
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,480
They were all laughing at you and you had no skis.

215
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,780
See I was an extra, remember the island of Dr. Moreau, not the ones, you said there were three like major classics and a couple rip offs?

216
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,000
No, two classics and one terrible rip off.

217
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,640
Well this was kind of like an island of Dr. Moreau thing except for there were all these like sexed up babes who had lived near a nuclear power plant and stuff.

218
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,060
And my testosterone was somehow quantified.

219
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:18,540
And I had to water ski like endlessly like for hours and hours and hours around the same little puddle.

220
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,720
I had seen everything before a thousand times.

221
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,940
I heard they made you do that.

222
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,780
And I got no pay.

223
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:29,000
You know your usual chicken sandwich bidet and so forth that you get as your offerings for having done your doo doo.

224
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,060
You just, I didn't make anything off of it.

225
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,620
Not even a concept that made sense.

226
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,200
And still don't.

227
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,960
But if you can imagine a bunch of like female werewolf queens.

228
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,880
Whoa, now you're talking.

229
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,180
And one of those like really hot Chris Craft, you know like outboards and stuff from the 50s and everything.

230
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,280
Wearing those Donna Reed bathing suits like smiling and waving and stuff like that.

231
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:58,360
And sometimes their hands fall off because I guess they're trying to weave a leper colony thing in there with you know the people being bestial and so forth.

232
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,580
And I had to have sex with all of them too.

233
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,960
Werewolf cheerleader babes did you say?

234
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,860
Cheerleader kind of beach babes, more like a net you know fungicide or something.

235
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,520
You bet.

236
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:16,740
You know the sexy aspect of werewolf women, werewomen wolves has not been explored except in very few movies that the howling.

237
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,340
I lost on you.

238
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:28,720
The first howling movie I remember had a sexy werewolf scene where this couple goes out waiting for the full moon because they're into it.

239
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,900
Yeah, I remember that.

240
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:35,660
And the full moon comes up and they're making the beast with two backs.

241
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,120
Two backs.

242
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,500
Wild like change into werewolves.

243
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,680
And of course they end up at the end of the climax of the scene the male is.

244
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,820
And talk about dog breath.

245
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:59,420
Now speaking of hair covered monster babes there was also a movie in the late 50s called the Neanderthal Man which I saw when I was a kid.

246
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,780
And it really impressed me because the cops broke in and they found photographs of the mad scientist.

247
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,100
Real Neanderthals having sex.

248
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,480
And the guy who was the mad scientist had been experimenting on his Mexican maid.

249
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:18,860
And there were a series of photographs that showed her as a nice looking young lady and then gradually reverting into a Neanderthal.

250
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,900
He had a devolution drug or something.

251
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,700
Which of course we've all been seeking our whole lives, many of us.

252
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,220
Well we're looking for Hirsute women if that's what you mean.

253
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,160
Well either one.

254
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:29,640
I want.

255
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,500
You know one or the other or both would be the best.

256
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,040
Back to the canthropy again.

257
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,740
But not Hirsute.

258
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,840
No it's not the hairiness that's the kick.

259
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,820
It was the.

260
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,660
The prognathous jaw.

261
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,160
The sloping brow.

262
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,200
The slow paw.

263
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,080
The heavy brow ridge.

264
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:42,640
The increased.

265
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,140
The lupine elven neck bones.

266
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,500
The heavy muscle structure.

267
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,680
The strong yet arching neuro nucleoid pieces of flesh hanging from below the neck.

268
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,600
It was the difference that turns you on.

269
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,980
Just a difference huh.

270
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,780
Well but it was a major.

271
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:04,940
I could see you like chasing like these weird like poor war veteran guys and stuff from 1942 and everything around the block and like grabbing them.

272
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,660
Oh there they go now.

273
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,140
Those funny looking dudes.

274
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,620
White canes.

275
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,440
Someone wearing the DAV bracelets around their necks.

276
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,400
And it looks so much like dog collars.

277
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,960
I'm sorry.

278
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,280
Chaz I understand you were at some sort of a convention.

279
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,780
The stone hand axe convention was it?

280
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,360
And you had to dress like a woman.

281
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,020
And carry stone tools.

282
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,380
Titanium tools they're making now.

283
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,640
By hand right with those little they smelt them by themselves in a little shack in the back.

284
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:43,120
Were these like scrapers and choppers and or was it the new modern day hand axes?

285
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,600
Were there scruffers and scribes?

286
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,440
Or were there people who worked with their hands and feet like mom and dad?

287
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,360
People were taking pictures of them.

288
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:51,960
Going.

289
00:18:54,020 --> 00:19:00,140
Were there little homo habilis people working and chipping away at the church and flint?

290
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,640
Were there little homunculi working away in the dark basement?

291
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,520
There were monkeys with apples on their backs all over the place.

292
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,220
Monkeys with apples on their backs?

293
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:17,440
See that's the new word for a gyrating junkie.

294
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,180
That's the new word for a person like what they used to have a gorilla on their sidecar.

295
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,440
No they're just mac monkeys.

296
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,240
A bunch of mac apes.

297
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,500
Mac apes.

298
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,260
I'm one of them.

299
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,260
I'm a mac ape.

300
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,780
That means in Celtic that means sunny.

301
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,640
I'm one of the ape.

302
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,800
You know that's how mankind started out.

303
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,380
My eyes go.

304
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,960
In the plains of Africa.

305
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,380
I mean.

306
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,840
The old Dubai gorge.

307
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,580
It's now a gorge.

308
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,200
It used to be just a lakeside.

309
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,020
An alagorge?

310
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,300
That was the song of the Australopithecus and homo habilis.

311
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,660
What was the alagorge of the homo habilis?

312
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:02,780
The alagorge was do not step on moist rock five million years from hence.

313
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,760
You know the paleo.

314
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,520
I was reading a Martian paleo anthropology book and they.

315
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,880
Dr. Zorg.

316
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,960
Dr. Zorg.

317
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,220
Yes.

318
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,100
Dr. Zorg's book.

319
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:19,180
Actually it was by Dr. Shreve right here in Cleveland and Dr. Johansson, Lucy's child.

320
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:19,840
And they were.

321
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,360
And Buster Poindexter's brother.

322
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:30,740
They were suggesting that perhaps human intelligence evolved in concert with our society.

323
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:37,740
And that we become the apes that conquered our environment.

324
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,020
Yes friends.

325
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,720
Because we had our own selves.

326
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,040
We have become the apes.

327
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,260
So dear to us in our memory.

328
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:43,700
Our own society.

329
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,420
Our own human and private ape society.

330
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:50,980
When I think back of the many times I wished I could think back and could not think beyond

331
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,620
that ancient lie.

332
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,240
That our own fate of each other was what drove us to evolve such demonic cleverness.

333
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,640
Dividing the cosmos between me the ape and the rest of the apes.

334
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,920
Such demonic cleverness.

335
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,240
That's why.

336
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,260


337
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,320
I'm a human.

338
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,340
I'm a human.

339
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,340


340
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,340


341
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,340


342
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,340


343
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,340


344
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,340


345
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,340


346
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,340


347
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,160
You think they're demonically clever?

348
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,240
Your pronouncements are yet so hollow to me.

349
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:05,860
I cannot.

350
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,520
You say in one breath.

351
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,520
Yetis are president.

352
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,540
I don't consider that man of yeti blood.

353
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,660
I consider him a spurlish, a curlish, a snake.

354
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,040
A pink.

355
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,740
A human.

356
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,260
A name.

357
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,280
A pure human.

358
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,900
An escaped lab rat.

359
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,940
George W. Bush might as well be an escaped lab rat.

360
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,780
Most of them.

361
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,960
Most of them might as well be.

362
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,720
A beaten drooling lab dog with the whole body covered in blood.

363
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:30,720


364
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:30,720


365
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:30,720


366
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:30,720


367
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:30,720


368
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:30,720


369
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:30,720


370
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:30,720


371
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:30,720


372
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:30,720


373
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:30,720


374
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,240
It's only five teeth and a bad heart.

375
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,100
Aw, yes.

376
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,840
Yeah, we're back to normal.

377
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,940
Now, let's see what's on TV tonight.

378
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:49,120
There's a special on one of the, well let's see, it's channel 38 if you get cable, Froffability

379
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,480
Live in Nashville.

380
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,520
On channel 27 tonight, the men from planet, er, the man from planet X.

381
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,160
And if you tune in right now, you can catch the very last episode, which is called The

382
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,160


383
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,720
And, uh, just, if you tune in right now, you can catch the very last episode.

384
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:00,720


385
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:00,720


386
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,920
end of our squirting universe on PBS.

387
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,980
The 39, I think, has 20 million miles to Earth.

388
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,320
And Mars Needs Women right after that.

389
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:22,600
Both of those feature cameo appearances by J.R. Bob Dobbs on CBN, the Christian Broadcasting

390
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:22,920
Network.

391
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,460
We've got Love That Bob.

392
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,340
And after that, Bob and Connie and Jim and Tammy.

393
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,800
Oh, I can't wait.

394
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,580
That's like a softcore porno.

395
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,020
And then Fort Dobbs.

396
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,500
What is Fort Dobbs about?

397
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,880
Apache's try to regain their sacred pipe from a mad Caucasian plunderer.

398
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,880
And, oh, that's with John Wayne.

399
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:54,120
And then at midnight, Dante's Inferno with Spencer Tracy, which also has.

400
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,540
An amazing appearance by Bob Dobbs.

401
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,880
But, oh, let's see.

402
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,840
If I can just get my technical act together here, friends.

403
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,780
And I think I can.

404
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,720
I want to play this song I'd like to.

405
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,440
No, I'm serious here.

406
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,760
It's a quiet moment.

407
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:20,960
I'd like to dedicate this to those, the kids that were lost in the Guadalupe River this

408
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,340
weekend.

409
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,800
Oh, Jesus.

410
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,580
Baby, what?

411
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,060
He gave me water.

412
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,480
You gave me water.

413
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,120
Jesus, he gave me water.

414
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,940
He gave me water.

415
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,400
You gave me water.

416
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,760
You gave me water.

417
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,280
He gave me water.

418
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:41,020
What a, what a, what a,

419
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,220
what a loving water.

420
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,420
When there was none in the well.

421
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,340
There was a woman from Samaria.

422
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,080
Came to the well to get some water.

423
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,800
It was there she met her and said,

424
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,640
..

425
00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:07,500
So the story tell, how that woman dropped her pitcher, but her drinking was made richer, by the water he gave her, when there was none in the well.

426
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:19,680
Jesus gave water, he gave water, Jesus gave water, he gave water, Jesus gave me water, he gave me water, he gave me water, he gave me water.

427
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:30,740
Jesus gave that woman, he gave her water, he gave her that running, he gave her water, he gave her water, he gave her water, when there was none in the well.

428
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:58,240
He's out of the way now, sad, sad, but you know he's gone on to a life in Bob, a new life in Bob.

429
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:19,180
Did you hear the theory about how, if aliens come here, that they're probably already here in the microbial form, and that they're going to, in intelligent form too, and that they're going to take over.

430
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:29,460
Through the internet, through the world wide web, that they're just, that they're not microbial, I mean they're nano, they're like nano, nano virulians.

431
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,520
Oh man, how could you be a digital life form though?

432
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,720
It's required to form the physical body that we know as Bill Gates.

433
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,740
God, just think of all the...

434
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:47,540
How many microbes, and how they hold themselves together into a semblance of a human-like thing that breathes and talks, probably even eats.

435
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,100
Peanut butter cup, Dave?

436
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,460
No.

437
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,560
Oh no thanks, I was going to have some Smarthy tumor juice over there, and also a piece of hemlock pie.

438
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,940
I see the reverend brought his Slim Fast with him.

439
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,720
You've got to drink three coffee.

440
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,040
You have to drink three or four of those every day.

441
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:08,140
Now why would a man of your small, not your girth, want to have a Slim Fast for lunch or breakfast?

442
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:19,120
Because I can't suck down the blood of a newborn kitten every hour like I would like to, so I have to suck down one of these damn humanoids.

443
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,480
I can't even drink one of those.

444
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:20,980
I can't even drink one of those.

445
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:20,980


446
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:20,980


447
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:20,980


448
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,840
Well, that's why I drink.

449
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,700
It's for the protein.

450
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:26,300
I have to have protein to balance the sugar and caffeine.

451
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,140
Well, I think...

452
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:34,800
So therefore I have to eat nuts or frop, or some other form of protein.

453
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:44,540
Nuts and frops and other colloquialistic terms for human bodies when you crunch off the tops of their heads and dig right into that fleshy medulla oblongata.

454
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,480
Froppalop, sips of tops.

455
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,660
Have you ever sliced the brain?

456
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,440
So what do you think about that?

457
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,660
Aliens and nanobots?

458
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,960
Well, I was trying to ask you a question.

459
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,280
How could they make my biotic form become digital from a digital form?

460
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:14,100
Actually, boys, the nano-aliens that you're talking about, Chaz, are in fact the WOM supercomputer predicted by J.R. Bob Dobbs, described in not very much detail in either of the baubles, so to speak.

461
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,660
This WOM supercomputer is actually like a zoo.

462
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,440
It's a supercomputer that can actually make a billion, billion, billion nano-alien creatures which...

463
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:23,760
Hmm.

464
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,080
What is?

465
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,880
Or creatures, nano-creatures.

466
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:31,300
They're artificial, but you know, they're as alive as any virus or bacterium.

467
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,560
And these...

468
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:33,280
These...

469
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:41,080
This supercomputer of the excess aliens, because of the nature of it, is able to exist as

470
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:46,200
a permeating gas, as a paint upon the walls, as the carpet underneath...

471
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,340
An all-pervading feeling.

472
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:47,740
...as...

473
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,080
Very slim, fast in that can and as the can itself.

474
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,400
Or a lack of oil in one's carburetor.

475
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:53,840
Those are all part of the Xist computer.

476
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,700
That is how the Xist supercomputer is able to instantly grant the wishes of all those who paid their $30.

477
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,160
And simultaneously deny the heartfelt desires of those it wishes to crush and conquer.

478
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:17,760
Following the rupture or predicted XXXX day, 4X, 4XD we like to call it, coming up this July 5th, 2000.

479
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,400
Foreskin day.

480
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,780
Foreskin day?

481
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,020
2001.

482
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,700
Foreskin day.

483
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,740
As Bob predicted, yes.

484
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,760
Oh, holly hot foreskin day.

485
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,360
When our mothers and grandfappies laid down the flap.

486
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,020
Flare the skinners of Bob.

487
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,660
That would create a new hoonan.

488
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,040
Me.

489
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,660
Being here on this consecrated ground.

490
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,820
We just decided.

491
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,780
Actually, there was a vote.

492
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,500
Shouldn't we demand that everybody in the church be circumcised?

493
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,420
Whoa.

494
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,940
Or circumvented by faith.

495
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,800
I think you got mixed up with a certain heaven's gate.

496
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,800
Or a certain Judaism or some such thing.

497
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,280
Or a certain medical American conspiracy.

498
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,380
But no.

499
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,140
Trepanation was the...

500
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,180
We got all the meat we were born with.

501
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,060
I think everyone in the church...

502
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,500
The church should have a sex change and then have a sex change back.

503
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,120
Well, you've already had that.

504
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:10,740
No, that's been done.

505
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,640
That's already happened in this church of excrescence and putridity.

506
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,660
I can't even keep up with the names of some of our ministers.

507
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,880
Whether they're Mrs. This or Mr. That.

508
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,700
Hot, stinky, in-between man-woman.

509
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,960
Maestress This.

510
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,300
Lethargic thing, purple...

511
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:25,660
Yeah.

512
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,740
Popester This.

513
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,060
Mary Popester This and That.

514
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,640
But all of these predictions shall come true.

515
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,820
As the end times unfold...

516
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,800
Listen to the mic.

517
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:37,900
What happened?

518
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,960
I could do the whole song and dance.

519
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,340
I'm sure you've heard it a million times.

520
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:39,680
That's kind.

521
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,440
And it's arm juices.

522
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,940
Just like a thick little salami.

523
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,540
How do we expect to get to the moon if we can't even talk between two buildings?

524
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:52,100
How can we expect trees to communicate when we cannot even talk with our own urine and

525
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,000
other bodily fluids?

526
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,780
It's just, you know, too much I think sometimes.

527
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,380
It always comes back to bodily fluids and genitalia.

528
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,460
That's Dave...

529
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,940
That's little baby talk.

530
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,360
That's sophomore talk.

531
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:04,620
I like it.

532
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,960
I know, Chess, that you and I would prefer to keep the conversation on a lofty, rationalist,

533
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:19,060
humanist level and eschew this metaphysical claptrap nonsense and random errancy.

534
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,040
Fleshy, fleshy.

535
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,400
Genu-oriented and poo-poo-oriented individual.

536
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,360
But of course that's what the audience wants.

537
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,220
That's what they pay.

538
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,300
That's what keeps the advertisers coming in here at WCSB.

539
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,260
Dave's poo-poo talk.

540
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:03,720
Choins with piece falls in likeного

541
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,880
called Old Western Music, Western Germany, 1500s.

542
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,260
Ah, it feels so good.

543
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,220
Yeah, back at the house, I'm the proud owner of two little kids, believe it or not.

544
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,220
Yes, I am.

545
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:27,160
Both of them are old enough to read, but neither one of them is old enough yet to, well, for

546
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,920
me to break certain things to them about Santa Claus.

547
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,780
Now, it makes me mad that I can't tell them certain things, but it almost shames me that

548
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,420
I have to tell them other things at all.

549
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:44,160
Some of these monstrous truths don't slide by as easily as the one about Santa Claus.

550
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:51,280
One day, and this is the truth, I had to warn my kids about certain grown-ups who were so

551
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:58,360
twisted by their own messed-up parents that they want to, quote, do bad things to you,

552
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,060
unquote.

553
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,920
And it feels awful to break that kind of news to a kid, and it's frightening to think

554
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,520
what they're prompted to imagine about the world they're going to grow up in, no matter

555
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,360
how you soften it up when you're telling them about it.

556
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,820
And I've never been able to tell them about the bomb, or the germ, or the gas, because

557
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:24,920
I knew what would happen if my kids started thinking about those things all the time.

558
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,120
They'd end up like me, dear friends.

559
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,180
And through all...

560
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:34,740
All through high school, I was dead sure the future would see us back in the caves.

561
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:44,120
As Einstein or some other wise guy once said, quote, I don't know what World War III will

562
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:51,420
be fought with, but the one after that will be fought with sticks and stones, unquote.

563
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,600
And now, dear friends, we don't even have that to look forward to.

564
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,420
That was a naive...

565
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,880
A positive thinking kind of view of the end of the world.

566
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:08,340
With the weapons they have now, there wouldn't even be sticks and stones.

567
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:13,860
There'd be nothing, dear friends, nothing left if the big mistake happened.

568
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,500
By the way, my kids did figure it out for themselves without me having to say anything.

569
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:25,740
Between TV cartoons and the news and conversations on the playground, they were able to put two

570
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,320
and two together before first grade.

571
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,160
And you'll be glad to know that...

572
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,040
They did adjust a lot better than I did.

573
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:38,100
But, friends, most people cannot conceive of worldwide extinction of all higher life

574
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:38,740
forms.

575
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,000
Nay, they've got a lot of trouble, for that matter, conceptualizing so much as a rape

576
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,960
or a car wreck.

577
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,920
At least until it happens to them.

578
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,300
Positive thinking.

579
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,080
You know, oh, positive thinking.

580
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,440
Oh, don't you love it?

581
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,020
And that escape into affluent isolation, dear friends.

582
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:04,480
It becomes so socially desirable, the idea of preparing for the worst.

583
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,440
That's a bad habit now.

584
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,220
Only survivalists and cooks would do something like that.

585
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,540
To most Americans, friends, a big mistake is, oh, say, forgetting to photocopy that textiles contract

586
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:24,500
before the board meeting or burning the roast when guests are expected for dinner.

587
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,160
People nowadays, they won't build themselves a fallout.

588
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:29,540
They won't build themselves a fallout shelter.

589
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:34,040
They won't even, I won't even quit smoking myself, for that matter.

590
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,400
And yet, they'll donate to save the whales.

591
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:48,720
Strange paradoxes, but you see, friends, most human beings have no idea how real they are.

592
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,980
And for that matter, they don't know how smart they are.

593
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,680
But at the same time, they grossly underestimate their own stupidity.

594
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,320
And...

595
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,140
They don't know how smart they are.

596
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,140


597
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,240
They...

598
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,680
Think about it.

599
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:09,060
They could wreck, permanently wreck the rest of the planet, for all of us, by just for

600
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,660
no other reason than not giving themselves enough credit, either for brains or for the

601
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,760
lack thereof.

602
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:21,140
And if they distrust themselves so much, friends, think how much they distrust you.

603
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,520
They assume that they wouldn't be good enough at anything important, like stopping the arms race

604
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,780
to take a stab at it.

605
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,900
And in all too few cases, they're right.

606
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,840
And so they cling to the safe and the meaningless.

607
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,720
And they wish everyone else would, too.

608
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:43,240
When somebody tries to warn them about a danger they didn't already know about, well, they

609
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,600
take that as an insult.

610
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:53,180
Now, as Bob Dobbs said to a Sunday school class in 1955, if they all thought they were

611
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,640
as great as I think I am, everybody'd get along just fine.

612
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,060
Even though they'd all be wrong.

613
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,600
That's what Bob said.

614
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,580
So how much do you tell your kids about the future?

615
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:15,420
About pollution, about overpopulation, and war, and crime, and just exactly what those

616
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,420
statistics are pointing to?

617
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:23,040
When does it get past survival training friends and start making them suicidal?

618
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,620
For that matter, how much can you psychologically afford?

619
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,080
How much can you afford to tell yourself?

620
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,080
Maybe a lot more than you think.

621
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:47,700
Earlier today, Chaz was giving a sort of a trance lecture about, that ranged from the

622
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,420
protoplasmic beginnings of all life to space exploration.

623
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,780
And this lovely dome here is certainly a good...

624
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:03,760
A good place to think about that because if we're not lucky, all of our descendants will

625
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:10,060
live inside little puffer domes like this because there won't be the right kind of air

626
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:10,860
outside.

627
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,540
And if we are lucky...

628
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,340
Ah, yes!

629
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,520
Oh, baby!

630
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,980
Do that again!

631
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,000
I say!

632
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,960
Oh, I say!

633
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,740
Oh, hit me one more time, please, darling.

634
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,560
Oh, oh, oh.

635
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,080
Oh, baby, you're my baby!

636
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,980
Oh, baby, you're my baby!

637
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,580
Oh, baby, you're my baby!

638
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:37,980
You know, if you increase the oxygen in here too much, a spark like that can cause an explosion.

639
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:45,040
We'd all be fried like those poor brave astronauts on one of those ill-fated missions.

640
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,680
Turn up the oxygen, man!

641
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,940
On the other hand, if you turn the oxygen up, you get kind of high.

642
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
Well, let us be first, guys.

643
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:09,200
Now, remember, the air outside is not exactly the same as inside, so you might want to go

644
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,160
through that decompression chamber first!

645
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,640
Oh, man!

646
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,560
James!

647
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,960
Look at these kids!

648
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:20,320
They just go right in and out from earth atmosphere to outside atmosphere.

649
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,060
It doesn't even bother them!

650
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,860
Oh, man!

651
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:24,860


652
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:24,860


653
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,300
I have to wear a mask to go out there!

654
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,140
Yeah, it's hard to keep up with evolution, man.

655
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,800
It was hard enough just to crawl out of that pond and use them lungs.

656
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,100
That hurt!

657
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,660
You kids don't know nothing!

658
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,960
You never did have to crawl out of that ocean and use them lungs the first time.

659
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,840
And that first time we had to invent murder.

660
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,400
That was hell, baby!

661
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,480
But man's got to eat.

662
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,780
You've got to build that spaceship somehow.

663
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:11,220
And if you have to start by chipping flint rocks together, well, that's a start.

664
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,300
Better than sitting on your butt and scratching your butt.

665
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,220
Or is it, friends?

666
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:22,820
Wouldn't it have been better for early man to have merely sat upon its butt, scratching

667
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:30,200
that butt, and picking its nose and flees off into each other and rutting like happy

668
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,180
little monkeys in the wilderness instead of all this progress?

669
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,880
Which, while it has brought us these apps and things, they're still not working right.

670
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:48,320
We have to breathe this processed atmosphere or else end up like those new breed of kids

671
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,440
with the giant lungs and stuff.

672
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,480
John?

673
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,260
Yeah?

674
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,820
Sometimes I get mixed up and can't even remember what century I'm in.

675
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,000
I remember that one time when we invented legs.

676
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,400
That was out of necessity, believe me.

677
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:18,560
No, but, you know, I mean, there's some people think that, that, uh, well, I used to thank

678
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,000
Chaz.

679
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,740
No, we're, you know, we've been exhorting people to build their own ships.

680
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,440
Just in case the aliens don't save our butts.

681
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,360
But I used to say to people, well, hell, we got a whole nother planet right here on this

682
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,440
one that's a lot closer than Mars or the moon and a lot more hospitable, that being the

683
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:35,900
ocean.

684
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:42,300
Oh, we got a whole nother two planets worth left to pollute if that's what we wanted to

685
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:42,540
do.

686
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,140
No!

687
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,680
He's a maniac.

688
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,980
Out to rule the world.

689
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,760
What can I do to make you understand?

690
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,900
I love you.

691
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,120
I love you.

692
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,220
I love you.

693
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,220


694
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,220


695
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,220


696
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,260
I love you.

697
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,260


698
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,260


699
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,260


700
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,260


701
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,260


702
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,260


703
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,260


704
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,260


705
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,260


706
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:58,160
And what will the new year bring here, my friend, what will Santa bring you for the

707
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,820
new, the true new millennium?

708
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:09,720
Will Santa bring you a giant black slab and when you throw, a will you throw a bone into

709
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:16,140
the air, will it turn into a nuclear bomb or into a checkbook, which will it be, my

710
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,620
friend, who will you follow?

711
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,980
The black slab or the flying pipe with the wings?

712
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,240
I'll tell you guys, this is Bob Flynn.

713
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,240


714
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,240


715
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,240


716
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,240


717
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:28,560
I tell you, saying the conspiracy's got big red straps, they want to strap that big black slab onto you with big red straps.

718
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,460
And keep it strapped to you.

719
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,840
Do you have protection, my friend?

720
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,600
Are you wearing protection for the new year?

721
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,940
Or do you have that $30 membership skin on?

722
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,340
Tape your stomachs in.

723
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:09,400
See, Dristan tablets shrink swollen, congested nasal and sinus passages.

724
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,300
Public life, I have always tried to do what was best for the nation.

725
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,660
But the interests of the nation must always come before any personal considerations.

726
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,000
Therefore,

727
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,720
I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tonight.

728
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,960
Vice President Bush will be sworn in as president.

729
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,520
That I will.

730
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,220
Precious if you are the moments we two can share.

731
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:50,160
Quiet and blue like the sky, I'll hug over you.

732
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,680
And if I can't find my way back home,

733
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,340
it just wouldn't be fair.

734
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:09,780
It's precious if you are the moments we two can share.

735
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:19,640
Maybe it's you on my mind, your love is so rare.

736
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,700
And if I can't find my way back home,

737
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:24,700


738
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,120
Being with you is a feeling I just can't compare.

739
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,000
And if I can't hold you in my arms,

740
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,420
can't hold you,

741
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,480
oh, it just wouldn't be fair.

742
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,800
Wouldn't be fair.

743
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:49,020
Precious if you are the moments we two can share.

744
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,240
Quiet and blue like the sky, I'll hug over you.

745
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,600
And if I can't find my way back home,

746
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,800
can't find my way.

747
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,360
Oh, it just wouldn't be fair.

748
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,540
Wouldn't be fair.

749
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:15,960
Cause precious if you are the moments we two can share.

750
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Precious if you are the moments we two can share.

751
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,240
Precious if you are the moments we two can share.

752
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,060
All the moments we two can share

753
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,920
Quiet and blue like the sky

754
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,400
I'm hung over you

755
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,800
And if I can't find my way back home, my pretty baby

756
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,140
Wanna take a little break right now and we come back?

757
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,260
Oh, that just wouldn't be fair

758
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,640
Wouldn't be fair

759
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:54,640
And whose precious and few are the moments we two can share?

760
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:59,520
Precious and few are the moments we two can share

761
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,040
The Rudy Schwartz Project

762
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,520
from Sunshine Supers hits

763
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,420
and now back to ESO Swamp Radio of the year 2000

764
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,600
The season is now entering

765
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,300
the Dark Zone

766
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,440
I have one more specious argument to make with you, Dr. Goddard Ammerung

767
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,720
If the day of the end of the hand is at coming

768
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,520
what can we do?

769
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,420
How can we do it?

770
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,380
And when, above all, must we perforate it?

771
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:54,720
And among other questions I have for you, Dr. Goddard Ammerung

772
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,580
is when is the Valkyr storm coming to my backyard?

773
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,960
Well, son, to release the essence

774
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,980
you must go into the chamber of excremeditation

775
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:16,820
and there grip upon that which has troubled you and itched you

776
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:22,980
that which has strained and pressed outwards from you

777
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:29,740
and wring it like the turkey's neck of America

778
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:34,880
and give thanks unto the bathroom tiles

779
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:42,820
in your whiteness and discolored blood-tinged

780
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,340
Thanks for the wild turkey

781
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,680
and the passenger pigeons

782
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:53,080
designed to be spit out through wholesome American guts

783
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,500
Thanks for a nation of figs

784
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:04,160
turkey fried dinner so automatically that I can hardly stand with you

785
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,020
The printer is in my head

786
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,240
Oh, dear Lord

787
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,260
Oh, there's blood everywhere

788
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,880
Slowly I turn

789
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,480
Oh, God, no

790
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,740
Step by step

791
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,340
Inch by inch

792
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,700
As I can see, the clothes were burning

793
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,500
Thank you for the Indians who put up some minor resistance

794
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,480
Thank you for government narco-police and laboratory aides

795
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,940
Thank you for P-Dog and Poop Dog

796
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,200
Thank you for reminding us

797
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,820
Thanks for the war against subgeniuses

798
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:50,700
Thanks for Dave killing lawmen feeling up their notches

799
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,920
Oh, thank you for not time to lay feedback

800
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,700
Mine fell out

801
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:01,780
I'd like to give thanks right now for this beautiful pumpkin growing out of my pie eyes

802
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:07,160
And as God has made this turkey for me and this wonderful gravy Aunt Betty brought

803
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,180
On her bare hands and knees for three weeks, I'm glad to have you here today, Mr. President.

804
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:10,740
I'm a big fan of you, but I'm a little bit worried about your health.

805
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:17,540
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to take care of you, but I assume this is probably going to be one of my best lung savings and thanks days forever

806
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:22,860
I know you're growing, my children. I can smell it.

807
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,780
Your eyes are glowing like the old ones now

808
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:36,540
Soon you will be ready to have a thanksgiving of your own on the martyred corpses of the Hunan bin

809
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:47,640
The color drifts around the studio and is decapitated by Hal, who presses a button for yet another

810
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,940
It's hot. Oh yeah. It's live.

811
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,920
I'll keep you awake for no reason at all

812
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,400
No reason is right, dear friends. Listen, I'm...

813
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:04,140
The Willa Dobbs just pointed out that, you know, the only call we've gotten down here tonight was what?

814
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,620
Somebody wanting Madonna tickets? Great show to call for that, friends.

815
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,080
Phew. Madonna.

816
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:10,420
Geez.

817
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:16,720
Unless you're thinking about Jesus' mother. Now, we can get you tickets for her.

818
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,180
She's meeting all the boys back in the garage after the show.

819
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:30,380
But listen, what makes us mad, what really makes us sick is that nobody has gotten mad and sick at us yet.

820
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:37,460
Why is it I can get on the air and make underhanded, nasty...

821
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,560
Well, now, satirical. Strictly satirical.

822
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,180
Uh, and absolutely satirical.

823
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,460
Absolutely has nothing to do with the station.

824
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:47,080
But nasty comments about certain disasters that have happened in the Dallas area recently.

825
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:50,660
And nobody calls. Nobody's upset about that. Oh no.

826
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:58,160
But if we mention one wounded animal, if we say, even once, I like to kill animals.

827
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,660
Well, that, oh, then, oh, the lines light up.

828
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:06,320
You people are so, so angry.

829
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,340
You're so ready to get up and fight.

830
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:15,200
When you hear somebody insult your four-legged friends. They're so poor and helpless.

831
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:21,980
But when we get on here and insult living human beings who died for nothing, oh, that doesn't bother you a bit.

832
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,340
You don't care about that. That's just people.

833
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,320
Oh, there, oh, that Nicaragua stuff, that's all just people. I don't care.

834
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:32,360
Oh, Vietnam, oh, those were just humans. Those were just two-legged animals.

835
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:38,600
Go ahead and napalm them again. Do it again. If you can't do it in Vietnam, go ahead and do it in, uh, oh, El Salvador.

836
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,300
Do it instead of Nicaragua. Do it anywhere you want. I don't care.

837
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,960
My hero, Ali Norris, said it was okay, and he was told it was okay by somebody ahead of him.

838
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,500
But, but he doesn't remember who, and they certainly don't remember either.

839
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,520
Because, because that's okay. It's okay to kill people.

840
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:05,440
But it's, it's a terrible, terrible thing for us even to do a satire of making fun of someone not liking animal liberation.

841
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,100
You new age people.

842
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:08,360
You new age people.

843
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:20,980
Pinks! You pathetic, pathetic, useless excuses for human, I mean, you're useless excuses for human beings, much less subgeniuses.

844
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:31,040
My God! By gobs, this, I mean, the whole thing, it's just, it is, no, we've been doing this show, this is Hour of Slack number 88.

845
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,580
We've been doing this for 88 weeks, and no one has killed us yet.

846
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,340
You call this a fight?

847
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:38,760
You call this a free country?

848
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:43,900
You call this a patriotic, uh, American state of Texas?

849
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:57,640
Where subgeniuses can get on the air, or publish, uh, pamphlets and books and things out of P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214, and nobody's killed us yet?

850
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,860
Oh, no, no, that's too much trouble to go to.

851
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:05,440
Only if we kill somebody, uh, kill an animal, then you'll get upset.

852
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,420
Oh, yeah, yeah.

853
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:08,820
Sick!

854
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,560
This is not the Dallas show, this is, this is KNON.

855
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,380
Wait, I'm Doug Smith. Come on, let me be Doug Smith.

856
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,620
No, you said it was my turn to be Doug Smith.

857
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:25,440
Hey, listen, you were, last time you were on the air, you got to be Buck Henry, or whatever that other guy's name is.

858
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,920
I think this confusion breaks out when Bob's re-erection is evident.

859
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,440
Bob's come back to life.

860
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,260
No, don't worry, didn't I?

861
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:38,000
He's killing everybody on the list, and your name's next!

862
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,260
For everything!

863
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:50,300
Now listen, I, I know this sounds funny, but this, this Bob, this creature, this werewolf, uh, monster, monster, I don't know how we're gonna kill him, but...

864
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:57,160
...has some vulnerable spot, and, and all we have to do is figure this out, and, and then we can, well, we can find out its weakness, and, and we can kill it.

865
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,800
No, we must communicate with him. He has much to teach us.

866
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,780
I don't know whatever's down in that pit. It ain't human, and it ain't an animal.

867
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,140
But it's smoking a pipe.

868
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,900
Look at the glint on its hairdo.

869
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,100
Look, it's, it's beckoning to us.

870
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,740
They're gonna open up with 20 million...

871
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,200
I almost thought it was Ronald Reagan.

872
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:23,600
Go ahead down in that pit and communicate with it there, Mr. College Professor.

873
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,940
Oh my gosh, look what it's doing, I guess that's why Bob's...

874
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,580
Uh, hi, uh, we bring you greetings from our civilization, uh...

875
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,620
Ahhhhh!

876
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,240
Oh, look what we did.

877
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,900
Good morning.

878
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,760
Subdemus guys, uh...

879
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,240
What happened, little fella, what happened?

880
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,580
Slimy sub-demeuses.

881
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,560
What's Reverend Stang doing out here in the Bay Area?

882
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:51,080
He was caught in that, uh, love nest with, uh, Reverend Gamey, and, uh, they made him leave Dallas.

883
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,780
They made him leave the Shining Temple of Bob.

884
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,260
Dr. Stang, could you hand me that giant light right there?

885
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,480
Everything I say is a lie, including this very statement.

886
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,160
Wow!

887
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,340
Yes, that's light. I need that light.

888
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,660
Yeah, did you ever stop to think that this show just may be a...

889
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,240
A little...

890
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:13,280
A little show inside a larger show?

891
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,100
That somehow is inside an even larger show?

892
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,360
Yeah, I had that same, I had that same thing too.

893
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:22,620
Hotel accommodations question.

894
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:26,140
It seems like someone's buying you out behind your back, and you don't even know it's a swine.

895
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,860
No, we're buying you out from behind your back.

896
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,160
Are you really? Well, no one's behind me.

897
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,580
Here's your back now, being bought out.

898
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,000
Well, I can't see, it's behind me.

899
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,840
Oh, here it is.

900
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,600
Did you look at...

901
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,340
I don't want to see my back.

902
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:37,720
I can't remember.

903
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,180
Three bucks.

904
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:54,720
But let's leave things of this world behind, and walk now down the path of Bob

905
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,480
for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.

906
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,500
And, uh, we find then the family falling apart.

907
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:13,840
Oh, they wail and gnash their teeth, our rival churches do, about how the children are getting exposed to too much this and too much that.

908
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,580
What they ain't being exposed to is a little bit of mom and dad.

909
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,320
Forget the pornography, I don't care...

910
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,840
It makes me mad, my friend!

911
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,500
The hypocrisy!

912
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,500
Now, I have nothing against hypocrisy.

913
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,500
Every religion must have its fair share of hypocrisy.

914
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:34,060
As Bob Dobbs once said, I don't practice what I preach, because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

915
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:42,100
But that preacher can get up there on TV, and oh, he's so glad to keep you normal, keep you working so hard you don't even know your own wifey anymore.

916
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,280
And your kids, you don't know your kids any better than your employees.

917
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:50,180
So, friend, let there be slack.

918
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,800
Subgenius.com

919
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,200
And now, Shameikia Copeland.

920
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,780
Uncivil War

921
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:20,640
Uncivil War, uncivil war, how long must we fight this uncivil war?

922
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:29,460
Same old wounds we opened before, nobody wins.

923
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,580
And...

924
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,060
Uncivil War.

925
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,300
Uncivil War.

926
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:49,680
The lines are drawn, gloves are off, smiles are gone, we're all talking tough.

927
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:55,720
You curse me out, and I cuss back.

928
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:01,240
Everything we love is under attack.

929
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:07,500
The spirits are back in rags blue and gray.

930
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:12,980
Thought they were gone, but they won't go away.

931
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:24,980
Uncivil War, uncivil war, how long must we fight this uncivil war?

932
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:31,220
Same old wounds we opened before, nobody wins.

933
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,380
And...

934
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:32,380


935
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:38,220
Nobody wins an uncivil war.

936
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:48,680
You're sure you're right, I'm sure you're wrong.

937
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:54,180
Why can't we all just get along?

938
00:57:54,680 --> 00:58:00,420
You yell fake, and I yell real.

939
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,200
But I'm not the one who's gonna get it wrong.

940
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:01,200


941
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:01,200


942
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:06,540
Nobody seems to care how the other guy feels.

943
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,880
Keepin' count of each other's sins.

944
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,800
Only problem is nobody wins.

945
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:29,460
An uncivil war, uncivil war, how long must we fight this uncivil war?

946
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:38,220
Same old wounds we opened before, nobody wins.

947
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,720
An uncivil war.

948
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:52,580
As times are chill, agree to disagree.

949
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:58,460
Cut out all the hostility.

950
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,440
Uncivil war, uncivil war, how long must we fight this uncivil war?

951
00:58:59,440 --> 00:58:59,440


952
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,740
Call off the fighting and bring it to an end.

953
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:10,300
We can shake hands and be friends again.

954
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:24,380
Uncivil war, uncivil war, how long must we fight this uncivil war?

955
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:27,500
Nobody wins an uncivil war.

956
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,040
Nobody's backing down.

957
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,840
Some won't even talk.

958
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,840
The table's empty.

959
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,600
We all took a walk.

960
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:45,520
He says left, and she says right.

961
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:51,500
One says peace, the other says fight.

962
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,260
One hand's a palm, the other's a fist.

963
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:57,480
Uncivil war, uncivil war, how long must we fight this uncivil war?

964
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:57,480


965
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:57,480


966
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:14,860
Uncivil war, uncivil war, how long must we fight this uncivil war?

967
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:25,060
Same old wounds we opened before, nobody wins an uncivil war.

968
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,480
Uncivil war.

969
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:27,480


970
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:27,480


971
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:27,480


972
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:27,900
Until the war

973
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,280
Nobody wins an

974
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,700
Uncivil war

975
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,880
Fuck this shit

976
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,920
Fuck it slow, fuck it fast

977
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,060
Fuck it, till it is the past

978
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:44,660
Fuck it slow, fuck it fast

979
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,740
First ones now, later last

980
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,980
Fuck this shit

981
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,040
Fuck this shit

982
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,120
Fuck this shit

983
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:13,600
Here we go!

984
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,900
Everyday motherfuckers in my way

985
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,020
Every hour, every minute

986
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,620
Everyday these motherfuckers didn't come to play

987
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,360
It's my internet

988
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:26,760
Whatever you got

989
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:42,280
We didn't ask to have to write that song, okay?

990
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,560
It's not our fault.

991
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,760
We didn't ask to have to write it.

992
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,400
But we had to write it.
