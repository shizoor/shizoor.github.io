Like to drop by the fantastic bag?
Well, welcome to the Hour of Slack!
Praise Bob Gold and Connie Drag!
Yes, welcome to the Hour of Slack!
La la la, la la la!
La la la, Hour of Slack!
Slack!
It's great, faster than any other leading cleanser!
As well as leading cleansers!
As well as...
Bob!
But let's leave things of this world behind,
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.
And so, once again, we find this deep-rooted contradiction within the Word of God.
Who He Himself has said,
I am everything, but yet everything is me.
And by this very selfsame contradiction,
we know that we do have some measure of free will.
Yes, free choice.
And it's up to us to decide whether we're going to sin in the ways that God wants us to,
or if we're going to sin against God.
But yet, since He is everything and everything is Him, or her, it, or everything,
one could say, well, everything is everything, so a sin might as well be a good deed.
Helping a little old lady across the street,
might be a sin if everything is everything.
Now, this is an acid-head sort of mode of thinking,
and I don't think anybody wants to go along with such a vague and, say the least, fluid philosophy.
Because we have to have some sort of standard reference for goodness or evilness.
We've got to zero our meter on something.
So why not let that something be Bob, friend?
Let there be slack.
Oh, that's crazy talk.
I think Bob is just the guy with the pipe.
Friendship!
Are we controlled by secret forces?
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?
Do people think you're strange?
Do you?
Then you may be on the right track.
Give me slack, or give me food,
or kill me.
Give me slack, or give me food,
or kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
It's time to be manipulated.
Brother, I want to tell you something.
The world is tired of dead preaching preachers,
dead preachers preaching dead sermons to dead congregations.
They're tired of cold services and cold churches.
This world is hungry for reality.
They've had enough of Hollywood.
They've had enough of Nashville.
They've had enough of show business.
They're hungry for the mighty power of the man that walked the shores of Galilee 2,000 years ago
and raised the dead and cast out devils and healed the sick.
And I'm here to tell you tonight that Jesus Christ is still raising the dead.
Oh, he's back from the dead.
That's right.
His grinning skull floats ever in front of your eyes.
And Jesus brought him back, and he's lusting for the flesh of the living.
And these things are coming and coming speedily.
We are near the very, very end of the church age,
and of course the Gentile time has already come to a close.
For the archaeologists.
Every day is a hair day.
Slacks are always Jesus Christ's name.
I got just what I wanted from everybody here today.
And everybody said,
NAMIET.
NAMIET.
Now I reason because here is inflicted unbelief.
NAMIET.
Unbelief is the lifeless body of his sister.
Right now, man.
It's autistic.
It's satisfaction.
Secure my weapon, corporal.
Again?
Again.
Big day.
Did you get my present?
I punched a hole in Harvey Goldman's trailer.
Hm.
The world owes me a living, and I want my money back in one lump sum right now!
That's the way you ought to wake up.
Friends, it wasn't your parents' fault.
They were just as screwy as you.
It was the conspiracy's fault.
It really was.
Money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money, money!
Friends, the conspiracy has hogged fascism long enough.
We're taking fascism back!
For the people, man!
Fascism for the people!
Fascism for the individual!
It's what we call,
Patriopsychotic Anarchomaterialism.
Money, money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money, money!
Money, money, money, money, money!

Some people realize that it's the best thing you can do.




Now I just want you to hang on one minute.
I want you to hang on one minute, please.
And I want you to hear something.
And I want you to hear it.
Good.
I just want to tell you people something.
There's some good people out here.
And you are insulting their intelligence.
And if you come to this country at our invitation,
and we have to charge you through no choice of our own,
right?
If you don't want to pay it, don't.
I've come.
I wanted to be firmly established
that any person that feels that strongly
has the right to come to this microphone and speak.
I cannot help the system that is here.
It is my job to entertain you.
The fact that there is an exchange from this stage
whatever it costs has to go out there in the form of music
is the way that the world is made up.
I cannot help it.
I have no control over that.
I can't even walk the street
because they never know who in the world they're going to be.
you call the police
Nothing good continues
But people talk about how hard their body can be
I can't offer up my life
What is the problem?
No comment on it.

You'll forget about them and you'll marry some blonde, dull, non-entity and bear a brood
of snot-faced, drug-snorting brats who can't believe what a doddering dullard you are and
can't wait for you to die or leave so they can kill you or something while you sit there
exhausted, sweating blood, staring at the TV, pondering your incredible degree of debt,
drinking yourself into a stupor and going, what the hell happened?
I know money is a root of all evil, too funny thanks to some people.
It'll be a nickel, but I can't use that money, but it can drop some people out of their lives.
We're all just gonna have to, like, the police force, the lawyers, all the people that are
running the whole thing, these hippies with long hair are just gonna have to be killed.
They're gonna have to braid their hair up, put on a hat, man, and become policemen, you
know, become lawyers, become doctors, you know.
But then we're the same as everybody else.
No, I mean, but with the idea.
I mean, with the idea that you want to change the system.
Oh, you can't defeat the system from within the system because then you're just part of it.
My dear, could you imagine?
I mean, Walt Disney is the...
Living in the ghetto, you know, a kid three years old using Mighty Mouse or Mickey Mouse,
whoever it was, for an idol, right?
You can't go kid...
Running across the room for a...

Great rap singing was Mighty Mouse?
We can't...
Are you ready?
We can camera all of Walt Disney.
Well, I can bring almost all of it, or half of it.
Half of it.
Watch music for a short time.







All right.
Have a lot of egy.
Huh?

Got to have it.
I really need it.
Everybody.
How many things have I heard you say?
Come on...
Everybody.

I want to lay down

This is Pennywise. Joan, you're next.
This is Sue.
Hi Sue, how can I help?
Jim, I really have a problem with impulse buying.
I never have money left for anything.
Oh, boy.
Jim, I really have a buying impulse problem.
Well, buying, buying, anything, anything, anything.
Now wait a minute.
Go ahead and use some of that money to bring some happiness.
Jim, I really have a problem.
Jim, I never have money left for impulse buying.
A lot of people have that problem.
Take cash.
Good idea.
I feel we really need to buy right away.
After all, money is only paper and metal until you put it to use.
I never have money left.
But you've already decided to buy.
Impulse, impulse.
I really think it'll help.
Good idea.
Oh, thanks.
Okay, let's go to line...
Line four, this is Pennywise.
I'm Jim Phillips and your name is...
Bob.
Hi, Bob.
What can I do for you?
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.
Oh, this is Pennywise.
Line six, you're on.
And your name is...
Bob.
Caller number five, you're on the air with Pennywise.
I'm Jim Phillips.
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.
Oh, let's go to line seven on Pennywise.
Hi, I'm Jim Phillips.
Bob, commercials.
Oh, oh.
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.
Oh, well, listen.
I think your first responsibility is to yourself and your family.

Thanks for the call.
Hello.
You're on Pennywise with Jim Phillips and you are...

Okay, let's go to line four.

Oh, and your name is...

Hi, Bob.
What can I do for you?
The what?
Go ahead.
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.
Oh, you sound frustrated.
It's because I am.
Well, I get you.
I, for example, love to build things with scrap lumber.
The what?
All right.
Thanks for the call, Carl.
Bob.
Oh, this is Pennywise.
Line six.
You're on.
Bob.
Yeah, Barb.
Bob.
Go ahead.
Claims made in commercials.
Oh.
I get confused.
Why?
I get commercials confused.
Like magic.
The what?
Well, many religious people follow the biblical plan of tithing.
You may want to visit with your clergy about it, but of course...
The what?
The what?
Commercials.
Commercials.
I get confused by all the claims...
And your name is...
Bob.
Oh, that's a tough one.
A lot of people have that problem.
The what?
Truth in advertising.
I get confused.
Advertising, though, can be a really good source of information because of the truth in advertising
policy.
The what?
Because of the truth in advertising policy.
The what?
Truth in advertising.
The what?
Truth in advertising.
Truth in advertising.
You see, the law requires advertisers to tell the truth.
The what?
The truth.
The truth.
To tell the truth.
Truth in advertising.
Good point.
Oh.
So, listen carefully to the wording of an ad.
The what?
The truth in advertising.
The what?
Well, then you have to decide.
Yeah.
Fine.
goes both ways, right? After all. So, this is Pennywise. You're on the air. Hi, Bob. What can
I do for you? Yeah, Jim, this is Charlie. I've got a moral question for you. The what? Wait a minute.
Thanks for the call, Bob. This is Charlie. I've got a moral question for you. Well, that's a matter
for your own conscience, Charlie. I figured you'd say something like that. All right. Why don't you
give it a try this year? Okay, but they'll never catch it. Well, thanks for calling, Charlie.
Thanks. This is Pennywise. Line six. You're on. Yeah, Jim, this is Charlie.
Negative Land. Friends, before that rainbow bridge, some utopia and breaching from Austin

plus music from...

I want to be a member of your church. I want to give all I got. I want to love Bob. I want to love

monster is bigger than your invisible monster. And friends, that's what most religions are all
about. Yeah. And you may laugh at that, but I'm afraid to tell you that according to the latest
study I saw, over 87% of Americans believe that there is an invisible monster that will take care
of them if they kiss its ass. And friends, because of those idiots believing in that monster,
there is one. He certainly made a lot of laws that we've ended up having to live by. But friends,
you can fight back. Yes, we can turn the tables and declare war on God. Now, frankly, some people
might say that was real disrespectful sounding. You, I think you, most of you understand what we
mean when we say we're declaring war on God. Repent, friends. Repent. Repent. Repent. Repent.

And every jury has its prize. They bring the kids and show the why.
It makes them proud to be around and take their summer pickies. To drink at night in soul class

Lovely money. Rubbernecks with cash to burn. Export criminals return. They keep on coming, never learn.
They fill their diaries page by page and make it sound so thrilling.
They're hunting for the real thing. They're flushed and they are willing. And we're all making money.
Lovely money.
Want it, want it, want it. Pay, pay, pay.
The victors of the open wars. They take their tips and open doors. They stand up on the actual floor.
Actual souls. Actual souls. Actual souls.
It makes them proud to be around and take their summer pickies. To drink at night in soul class and end up feeling sicky.

Rumour has it that the bloodstains of Charles I's decapitation
were never actually washed from the stones.
Friends, the tribulations, the saucers, the rupture,
all of those things that are discussed in Dobbs' prophecy
will come true.
But prophesying from it all,
of wading through the blood of the baptism of the fist face of Bob,
burning through the titanium steel fortnox doors
with the power of that mighty pipe,
friends, it will be Bob!
Bob is coming, and he will burn away the hate,
he will burn away the radiation,
he will burn away the fire itself.
But you have to keep your hate burning, friends.
You have to feed that fire.
Repent! Quit your job! Slack off!

My life has changed in many ways,
Since I first saw his face,
I know that Bob will triumph,
With our friends from outer space,
And though we suffer needy,
I know that it's alright,
Cause I know Bob and I,
But tell me what to think,
The church of the subject,
And the genius,
Will spread across the land,
With pipes in place,
Will both they march together,
Hand in hand,
This dark fist of removal,
Will strike a mighty blow,
And we'll be free,
Of the noble and the big!
So give to Bob, Bob, Bob,
And you'll see a whole lot better,
Sir Bob, Bob, Bob,

He will change all your behavior,
He's your short-duration savior,
He is Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob!
Woo!

You're a miserable parasite!
You're just after my money!
But let's leave things of this world behind,
And walk now down the path of Bob,
For this brief minute of slack,
From the church of the subgenius.
No intelligent person would be,
Uh, go far right to that kind of stuff.
Then what do we expect?
All this perversion and sex?
Are them oily pores in your back?
All we care about is slack.
Then let all the slack get out.
The devil has to be behind that.
Think I'd follow that? I don't think so.
I was about to grab the nearest object,
And smash the mirror into bits,
When I saw one with columns of numbers,
Running across it.
I fancy myself comfortable with numerals,
But these were beyond even me.
Fortunately, its words were not.
As cycles came and went,
In groupings of ten thousand years,
The sixth ice age receded,
Leaving behind denuded landscape,
And four continents.
By the four hundredth millennium,
The genetic separation was irrevocable.
Occasional mutations proved the rule,
Rather than overturned it.
Separated into Heloatus humanus,
And Morloccus dishumanus,
The former homo sapiens left no genetic trail,
By AD 492,900 years.

The Lord had met Outsider's beginning.







Do I surprise you?
A little, yes.
We weren't always like this.
After the moon,
fell from the sky.
The Earth could no longer sustain the species.
Some managed to stay above.
The rest of us escaped underground.
Then centuries later,
when we tried to re-emerge into the sun again,
we couldn't.
So we bred ourselves into casts,
some to be our eyes and ears,
ears, some to be our muscles and sinews.
Oh, you mean your hunters?
Yes.
Bred to be predators,
but bred also to be controlled.
You see, my cast,
concentrated on expanding our cerebral abilities.
You control their thoughts?
Not just theirs.
Heli.
So it's not enough that you hunt them down like animals?
That's their role here.
To be your food?
Yes.
And for those who are suitable to be
breeding vessels for our other colonies.
You see, I'm just one of many.
Is this the hour of slack?
No.
Yes.
Oh.
Oh.
Rocknard, you're not really Reverend Cardboard Box, are you?
These kids with their names,
Reverend Cardboard Box.
Hey, come on, homie.
It's a gang, okay?
Gang people, it's funny, weird names, weird costumes.
Cool tags, you know.
Got their handles, man.
Jumbo was here.
Every boy should be in a gang,
but a gang can be a bad influence
or a good and slackful influence.
Yeah, but Army's a gang.
Army's a gang.
It's a conspiracy of dunces.
Wasn't it?
Conspiracy of dunces.
Isn't it true that most of the people
in the Church of the Subgenius
are those like idiot savant innates?
Those people who don't really recognize
what they're actually establishing?
No.
No, half of them are like...
Dave, you're their patron saint.
Yeah, half of them are your people
who are the greatest thing in the world
at one thing.
Because I don't have the energy.
You're their patron saint.
I'm their patron saint, man.
They've been honoring you
or listening to you for 20 years now
or something like that.
Well, I'm about ready to start
dealing out some funeral parlor
holy cards.
I mean, prayer cards.
I'm going to start flipping
from the bottom of the deck
if these people don't stop bothering me.
Well, those are the voices in your head, Dave.
Those aren't real people bothering you.
How come they're...
Okay, well, then how come they're so clever?
How come they can make things...
Because you're clever.
Because you're a saint, man.
That goes with the territory
when you're a saint.
You're saying the mind stuff.
...is what drives the cosmic engine.
Yeah, Dave.
The phone calls are coming
from inside the house.
Oh, man.
I thought I had this place
nailed down tight as a drub.
What, your brain?
No, this house brain.
I mean, the higher...
No, it was a metaphor.
That was a metaphor, Dave.
That was a metaphor.
You did.
The calls are coming
from inside your house.
I thought we were going
to go into something else.
It's just that one cell.
It's that one beautiful cell.
That one brain cell you have, Dave.
And then why did you...
Treasure.
...tell me it's ours
if it's just a brain cell?
And if the truth is so horrible,
it will haunt your dreams
for all time.
Well, I think I'm used to that.
No, wait a minute.
No, you wait a minute.
I love that area.
And I...
Hello?
Yes?
Who is this?
Who is this?

Who was he who wrote to us

Another natural product made better by chemistry
Anyways is marijuana
Years of research where necessary in order to improve the saç
But it doesn't take long for the drug habit to make anyone over.
In all the colors of the rainbow.
A few years back, the United States of America had nearly gone crazy.
They were lining up dope peddlers and shooting them in the back of the head.
Just take it or leave it.
Then it's chemistry to the rescue.
The answer is a simple one.
Just use your head.
But there's one sure thing.
If you use narcotics,
the horizon is unlimited.
Talk to someone who has had the experience.
All around us are the products of modern chemistry.
Heroin.
Morphine.
Red.
Crack.
Sleeping pills.
Something that came out of a test tube created in the chemist's laboratory
by a miracle of modern science
folded into a compact little package
many times as strong.
And the dope addicts say...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yes, chemistry has changed the world we live in.
Something that came out of a...
test tube
is going to have been transformed into the destructive forces of useful life.
Most teenagers start off with marijuana.
Some of the boys smoke them.
You know, the ones with backbone.
My girlfriend Anne and I went around with Bob.
They both smoke pop.
That's jive talk for marijuana.
So I tried it.
Funny what it does to you.
Everything speeds up to a hundred miles an hour.
There was something intriguing and different when I came home high that night.
You're real sharp and you laugh a lot.
You're the biggest person in the world.
All you think about day and night is...
the radiance of sparkling colors.
And then you pass out, but when you wake up it starts all over again.
And that's the story.
Unbelievable, isn't it?
Chemistry takes a hand in such commonplace things as...
dope traffic in the United States.
It's certainly true that the increased use of narcotics...
is a thing of beauty.
Carrying off the harmful fumes from other chemical processes,
there's always the gentle dew,
which cover the surface with a film of gritty, scratching particles.
It feels like your skin is being torn right off you.
It does.
Some young man may develop startling,
stupid, ghastly, tragic,
hidden secrets of nature,
the pioneer of tomorrow.
That's another mandatory.
I'm baked, man.
They're all laughing like lunatic demons and stuff.
I call this radio show because I'm baked.
I'm baked.
You are the inescapable result of your tragedy.
Just as I...
I'm the inescapable result of you.
Of you, of you.
Marijuana, marijuana.
Ba-ba-dum.
Marijuana-
Yeah, um.
This-
Marijuana. Mar-

A new, completely new
silicon brain.
Sorry.
It's so bouncy and glowy and round.
Oh, I hear them.
It's so smooth and
unwrinkled in Dave's case.
It's like a sheet of pudding
without the curge on top.
Oh yeah, that's the shmegma pie.
Watch as we slice down.
Watch on the webcam as we slice
down into Dave's brain.
It's like butter.
It's so soft and yielding.
It just fills right open.
The moons of Jupiter, they just
slide so...
And it's as if there's nothing inside,
just this goo.
You know, this is not an intelligent
or refractory lubrication
machine if you'd like to pipe up your organs.
This is me, and this is
you, baby.
This is a perversion of every natural law.
And what is
time travel?
But you're pathetic.
You're trying to control the world around you.
Your futile effort to have a question answered.
Do you think I don't know you, Alexander?
I can look inside your memories.
Your nightmares.
Your dreams.
You're a man haunted by those two most terrible words.
What if?
Mr. Dunn.
What is it, Jimmy?
I'm busy.
Yes, sir.
I know.
Only, it's Sheriff Gillis.
And he says he needs to talk to you.
Ah.
He says he needs to talk to me.
The truth is, he's in pursuit of an immodest amount of that curious weed which you and
your school chums seem to find so fascinating.
Dob.
Dob?
Dob?
This one's your professional lead.
Yes, it is.
opinion about a hunch I've got.
A hunch? Something just keeps going around in my head.
Will you give my preoccupation?
I've replaced missing eyeballs with sawdust,
and glued the lids together.
I've used bent aluminum combs for dentures.
I've used the back part of the scalp when there was no front part.
And I've folded one hand over wadded-up newspapers
when the other hand had no fingers.
You find all this obscene?
Do you know what is really obscene?
Look at this.
Look at the work I've done.
This is an art.
And I am the artist.
One more time, I take it from the top.
Say you never let me stop, stop, stop.
One more hit, just a little pop.
To get me on away until I drop, drop, drop.
Can't come down, gotta be high.
Say you never let me die, die, die.
One more time, but just a little try.
You know how much I love you when I'm high, high, high.
Well, I can be sweet, but I'm better when I'm bad.
And I can be a hippie when I'm mad, mad, mad.
Gotta be high with a twinkle in my eye.
Listen to the music on my high, high, high.
Can't come down, gotta stay high.
Can't come together, but we try, try, try.
One more night, the feeling's on Godive.
Gotta keep a bop until I die, die, die.
Can't come down, gotta stay high.
What'll I do without my high, high, high?
Life's too fast, I need a lot of slack.
Gotta get the piggies off my back, back, back.
I can be sweet, but I'm better when I'm bad.
And I can be a hippie when I'm mad, mad, mad.
Gotta be high with a twinkle in my eye.
Listen to the music on my high, high, high.
On my high, high, high.
On my high, high, high.
On my high, high, high, mad.
Gotta keep a bop until I die, die, die, die.
What'll I do without my high, high, high?
can' make a troubled eyes, I just don't want to die

You know, because that's where it's going to be in the future.
The 14th

I brought a banana, but I can't find it.
I lost it somewhere, and I'm hungry now.
The show is just going on and on, and my hunger is...
One of the best things to do for your brain.
Really?
The show is, yeah.
I know.
If you listen to the show, you are smarter by 23.5%.
I like to do good things for my brain.
I like to give my brain a good massage.
Are you a break thinker?
One of those shiatsu massages.
Just open up my skull.
Yeah.
And start kneading the gray matter.
Uh-huh.
Sort of a self-trepanator, right?
I don't use any fancy cutting tools.
Yeah, none of those sharpened pieces of jade.
I hear somebody's cell phone making that weird buzz.
Yeah, you know who that is.
That's my breathing.
Hear it?
That's my air tube.
Oh, okay.
That's the government listening to this show and all the other shows on KPK.
Are you still in that iron lung?
Um, I've upgraded to a new plastic lung.
Oh, okay.
One of those new fangled things.
Now, friends, this church of the subgenius, this story of Bob,
it could be the greatest joke ever told.
But if and only if Earth can make it to the punchline.
And we can do that, friends.
If you...
We'll use your own...
Your own hate.
You...
Actually, you don't have to use anything of yours.
As Dr. Legume said, use their hate and their fear.
Pump up your mutant abnormality.
Flaunt your weirdness and wag it in their slack-jawed, uncomprehending faces.
That will do more than your vote.
Wag your weirdness right there in public, friends.
As St. Hendrick said, let your freak flag...
Wave your freak flag high.
You, it's up to you.
Cause yourleyers have gotta fuckin' five minutes to şimdiutre the

You, it's up to you.
You wanna charge with me.
As dialogue, it'sash.
You know you're not gonna bathe me with painful somber Baylor.
Eat your fucking bacon.
You wanna throw».
UGH!
I don't know.
I don't know.
And then you whisk back to the waterhole.
I tried to play like Jimmy with my teeth.
The dentist, when he saw them, said good grief.
So when it is nearing Christmas,
the present I always wish for is
Jimmy Hendrix Strat!
Oh, when he played it,
it was a crazy sound.
He played his bloody guitar upside down.
I won't have seen him play the Isle of Wight.
I gave a pinching halfway through the night.
All right!
So when it is nearing Christmas,
the present I always wish for is
Jimmy Hendrix Strat!

Uh, uh, uh, where she has a three and a half year old toddler who's already been told to hate Bob.
And to basically kill him.
Bob.
Jim, thanks for the call.
You know, uh, it's funny because I called it.
About a, uh, 50 years ago and tried to get a hold of Dr. Triggerberger.
Because I guess there was some other doctor who was, um, possibly getting somebody for me to talk to.
An official declaration of war against Bob.
Shock and horror lingered.
And there goes the torch parade.
What sort of goings on is that anyway?
Some sort of rites for the Temple of Vampires.
Jack, you mean to sit there and say all that gang was vampires?
How do I know?
At least they seem to be priests of the temple.
Yeah, robes and torches and stuff.

Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.
And not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.
Subgenius.com
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,
you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages
and help out financially as best you can.
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.
But some of you still have jobs.
Even five bucks.
Makes a big difference.
Even if it's only once a month from enough of you.
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay
Dobbs.
We also take checks and money orders to subgenius foundation.
