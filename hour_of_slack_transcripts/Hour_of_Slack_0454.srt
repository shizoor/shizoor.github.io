1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Now, that would be part of the joke, part of this, because we're on the radio, that would be part of the satire.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,600
We'll just say we're doing it. We'll say, no, we'll say we're doing it so that when we're really doing it, they won't know we're really doing it.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,920
I'm a satinist.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,960
I felt that's what you were saying.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,900
I told you, Susie, you shouldn't have joined the church.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,740
You fool.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,760
No, no, no, no.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,480
No, no, no.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,800
Now you know the truth, the hideous truth about what hides inside.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,340
Put it away, put it away.

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:34,740
No.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,120
Can't get foreskin covered, pipe.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,140
But Susie, Susie, I could help you out. I'm an amateur gynecologist, a self-taught gynecologist.

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,660
Get this foretail out of the way, this foretail.

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,140
You're feeling good today. I mean, how are you feeling today?

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,060
With my hands.

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,520
I could check for myself. I don't have to ask you how you're feeling.

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,620
Looks a port low.

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,960
I'm going to have to take another read here.

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,440
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

21
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,260
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,500
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,020
The Self-Genius Hour of Slack.

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,320
The Self-Genius Hour of Slack.

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,940
I mean, I guess the dumb guy loves...

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,040
Ararabundi. Ararabundi.

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,880
You are a good power of his evil insurance.

28
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,980
And then all of you go, we're turning to bed.

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,760
They laughed at my face.

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,720
I remember after the explosion in the laboratory which caused the disfigurement.

31
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,600
Then when I had to see my fiancÃ©, she turned, she screamed, she fled.

32
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,060
Yes, the other scientists at the academy laughed at me.

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,580
They called me mad.

34
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,380
My experiments at bringing a corpse to life.

35
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,880
Would they call me mad if I were slowly torturing them to death

36
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,400
with a Chinese water torture?

37
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,060
Would that be called mad?

38
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,320
They laughed at my face.

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,060
So that was why I decided to wear this lead mask everywhere I go.

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,860
But that didn't work. They laughed at my mask!

41
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,360
They laughed at my mask!

42
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,640
Ladies and gentlemen, many of the stories are based on actual experiences

43
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,440
I endured in my nine heart-stopping years as a cult member for the ATF.

44
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,020
Although some names and places have been changed to protect the innocent...

45
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,900
He's reading from a script.

46
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,720
I think it's made up.

47
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,100
Didn't it used to be that the ATF must be kept a strong nation free

48
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,320
from the pestilence of unwanted cults?

49
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,520
And we, who love this country, must constantly be on the guard

50
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,240
against the traitor.

51
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,540
The imposter...

52
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,020
I'm sure you've heard of the imposter.

53
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,020


54
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,060
The imposter is the imposter that the founders of the ATF

55
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,060


56
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,960
And that's why we, at the ATF, must assume extra-constitutional powers

57
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,920
to eradicate this weed from America's sacred soil.

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,060
Join us this and every week as we continue our crusade.

59
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,480
You know what?

60
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,460
And yet you find yourself reflexively thanking them

61
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,400
for that spiritual castration,

62
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,200
that amputation of your abnormality glass!

63
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:21,340
I'm not saying that you should be thankful.

64
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,720
I'm saying that you should be grateful that you are a man!

65
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,700
Oh, life is a bitch and then you die.

66
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,860
One big treadmill to nowhere.

67
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,160
A cancer-ridden rat race around a sinking ship.

68
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,540
You'll marry some bland, dependable non-entity

69
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,880
and bear a brood of snot-faced, drug-snorting brats

70
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,920
who can't believe what a doddering dullard you are

71
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,300
and can't wait to leave or kill you

72
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,820
as you sit there, exhausted and trembling,

73
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,560
looking at some mediocre TV show,

74
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,640
considering your brain-wrenching degree of debt,

75
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,500
desperately trying to drink or frop yourself into a stupor

76
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,020
and wondering,

77
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,900
what the hell happened?

78
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,520
Well, by all means, pal, go ahead!

79
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,520
It's your soul!

80
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,480
There is a hell, all right,

81
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,320
and you're already in it!

82
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,660
And yet when the demons try to tell you that,

83
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,180
you think they're doing a satire or something.

84
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,020
Join us this and every week as we continue our crusade.

85
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,020
You know, one thing you can do is tear a baby's...

86
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,400
Shall we eat the rancid liver?

87
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,120
The iridescent, iridescent luv?

88
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,260
God, this stuff is rank!

89
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,340
You know, one thing you can do is tear a baby's head off

90
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,160
and then they go running across the ground with blood shooting out

91
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
about the next...

92
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
That's not funny. I was at one time a baby.

93
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,940
That's where the...

94
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,040
Don't make any noise. That's what I don't like about it.

95
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,140
That's kind of a gushy thing.

96
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,640
...from running around like a baby with its head cut off.

97
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,340
That's where the saying comes from.

98
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,140
We want to know about this joke.

99
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,640
At least let me tell the punchline.

100
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,640
That's where the saying comes from,

101
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,400
running around like a baby with its head cut off.

102
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,540
Okay, was that the punchline?

103
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,660
All right, thanks.

104
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,300
Now, the baby union is going to sue,

105
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,160
so we want to see you in court on Monday morning

106
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,100
about the punchline alone.

107
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,060
I'm not sure what I meant.

108
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,720
I don't know. I want to feel that way.

109
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,540
What's pink and red and sits in a corner?

110
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,840
A baby with a razor blade.

111
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,680
But you heard that one in ninth grade.

112
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,840
I just thought I'd tell you again.

113
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,440
That's kind of cool.

114
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,280
I bet I can apply that formula to another joke.

115
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,120
That's in bad taste.

116
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,480
Gotta do it real fast, though.

117
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,000
Doesn't make any noise.

118
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,840
A baby in a plastic bag.

119
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,060
Hey, we can start a whole new routine on that.

120
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,740
They don't have to be funny.

121
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,320
They don't have to be funny.

122
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,180
You can just say something like,

123
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,300
I killed a baby.

124
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,460
You know, it's kind of like...

125
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,140
There's no real wit to it, is there?

126
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,200
Hey, look, he's got his dead baby out.

127
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,820
But if you're talking about, I mean, dicing a baby,

128
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,720
I mean, can you say that on community radio?

129
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,480
You mean like a baby in a blender?

130
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,820
Is this like college alternative?

131
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,240
No, we can say puree.

132
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,760
But dicing is considered to be a little extreme.

133
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,660
You can't puree an infant on the radio?

134
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,360
Puree seems like it would be a more instantaneous thing,

135
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,580
whereas dicing would be agonizing.

136
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,420
But pureeing a fetus, now forget it.

137
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,920
Once they're born, no problem. Death penalty.

138
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,420
Pure protein.

139
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,920
You can even eat the bones.

140
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,660
But they have a soul until they're born.

141
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,540
That's the important part.

142
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,260
But why did the critics say that our new,

143
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,420
our new work was sophomoric?

144
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,720
What's wrong with infantile?

145
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,220
What's wrong with fetal?

146
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,500
Why don't they call our humor embryonic?

147
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:27,820
Spermazoan.

148
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,400
Yes, the Church of the Subgeniuses show Saturday night

149
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,640
was quite spermazoan, wasn't it?

150
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,240
It was quite blink and quite gleam in Daddy's eye.

151
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,940
It was pretty eggy, too.

152
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,440
It was quite zygotic.

153
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,940
It was quite atomic.

154
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,760
It was genetic.

155
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,320
It was DNA.

156
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,540
It was in my genes.

157
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,400
It was in everybody's genes.

158
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,300
I'd like to be in your genes.

159
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,920
Our inseams ran with slag.

160
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,200
You guys just take a word and say they're not wearing any genes.

161
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,320
Great gobbets of slag pooling up on the floor.

162
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,180
We had to slog.

163
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,680
We didn't care.

164
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,400
That's funny, right?

165
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,300
That happened ten years ago, and we're still beating it.

166
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:13,520
There's no reason to beat a dead donkey into the ground

167
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,040
or a dead, a dead...

168
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,360
You can't just keep beating a dead normal into the ground.

169
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,540
Oh, why not?

170
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,580
The audience loves it.

171
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,860
I mean, it's always a new crowd.

172
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,740
It's always new kids that haven't seen a normal...

173
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,480
Who haven't burned out on us yet.

174
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,380
It doesn't have to be funny.

175
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,160
I mean, they're all high.

176
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,780
You can't just keep beating a dead bobby into the ground.

177
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,980
It's going to do lots of gyrations now.

178
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,360
You can't just keep beating a dead baby into the ground.

179
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,320
The normals, smug yuppies, po-bucker Nazis

180
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,800
who are seemingly shopping around you

181
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,200
in blissful, self-sustained ignorance

182
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,460
actually form a vast conspiracy against you.

183
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,000
Unfortunately, belief in some big man in the clouds

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,140
in a white robe or some big Disneyland in the hereafter

185
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,220
will not help you a bit.

186
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,300
Will you be ready, my friend?

187
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Will you have an out when the whole thing blows?

188
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,680
Be not, be not disheartened.

189
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,080
For there does exist an underground resistance force, yes.

190
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,720
An army of idiopathic deviants and angry mutations

191
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,120
ready to help you lash out, to make you lash out,

192
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,180
pretending to obey by day like gorillas in the zoo.

193
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,420
But guerrilla fighters by night and by coffee break,

194
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,280
they continue to fight for what was taken away

195
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,160
when they were born, dear friends.

196
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,380
They're slack. Yes, they're slack.

197
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,980
Thop slack, sex slack, medicinal slack,

198
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,780
all the slack.

199
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,680
Freedom of speech, freedom from work,

200
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,620
and freedom of religion.

201
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,000
Our religion.

202
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,160
Now our brothers, the Christians,

203
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,640
like to drink the symbolic blood of their quitter god at the altar,

204
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,700
whereas our warrior priest witches demand the real thing.

205
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,360
And guess whose real blood it is this time?

206
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,340
Now when people, when we say things like that,

207
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,020
some people go, well, this church is so genius, kind of negative.

208
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,940
Yeah, they, they sound kind of like some sort of fascist.

209
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,920
And they'd be right, my friend.

210
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,880
The conspiracy has hogged fascism for too long.

211
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,100
We're taking it back.

212
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,980
We're going to take fascism back for the people.

213
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,560
For the people where it belongs.

214
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,900
Fascism for the individual.

215
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,040
Patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism, dear friend.

216
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,820
Every yard a kingdom.

217
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,820
Every checkbook a queendom.

218
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,200
Every dog and child a serf.

219
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,620
But it's going to require a new prophet.

220
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,200
A religion based, a religion based on pure capitalism,

221
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,900
on the divine logic of supply and demand,

222
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,360
but unfettered by conspiracy-implanted neurons.

223
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,360


224
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,540
And it's going to require a new set of neuroses about what will sell.

225
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,820
As a great man once said, offer it and they will buy.

226
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,380
That religion is the church of the subgenius.

227
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,200
And that prophet is this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

228
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,580
Avatar of slack.

229
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,960
An immaculator of this very age.

230
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,420
This is...

231
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,320
Yeah, it's better.

232
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,120
It's groovy.

233
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,320
Wow, it's kind of a lounge version.

234
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,780
It's an equal opportunity.

235
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,040
Cinesac religion, my friends.

236
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,000
A cinesac religion for strange people,

237
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,020
now a go-go mutants and descended masters.

238
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,180
A smuggled knife that one can use to saw free of the straightjacket

239
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,800
when the attendants aren't looking.

240
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,260
That way it doesn't seem like it's just, you know, a show.

241
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,840
It's an event.

242
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,480
I have trouble following this show sometimes.

243
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,720
You don't want to follow it too closely.

244
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,560
Why not?

245
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,420
Because of the fire hose.

246
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,960
Just think about the shows that come on after this.

247
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,660
Yeah, Philo's here now.

248
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,720
Philo.

249
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,460
Oh, that was you under there.

250
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,880
I thought this chair was lumpy.

251
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,440
Well, Philo...

252
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,020
She named her chairs.

253
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,000
You broke his glasses, Susie.

254
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,540
He shouldn't wear them there.

255
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,400
He's going to have to follow his nose from here on out.

256
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,860
Picture yourself in a car.

257
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,440
The part about the show is all during the show you hear like what sounds like the end of a record.

258
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,880
You cannot sniff the seat that you've been sitting on after the show, Susie.

259
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,660
Oh, I sell those later for coffee filters.

260
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,600
Your genitals.

261
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,880
What color are the walls?

262
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,140
Ladies and genitals.

263
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,100
Speaking of glittering genitalities.

264
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Please stand by.

265
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,400
Ladies and germs.

266
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,160
Please stand by.

267
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,780
I never want to become some kind of Milton Berle for acid heads.

268
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,220
Well, your wish is our command.

269
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,640
It happened.

270
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,180
Either that or that's the only thing I'd ever consider becoming is another Milton Berle for acid heads.

271
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,320
Where'd Lonesome Cowboy Dave and them go?

272
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,200
Are they out with Philo and the Swingin' Love Corpses?

273
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,620
I don't know.

274
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm not...

275
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,820
I don't know if Jane or Hyper Sleet had tripped out of the window, jumped, or whatever.

276
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,180
I still don't know for sure.

277
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,580
But I do know that Sting left town that same evening.

278
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,580
Is Brain Rot really here?

279
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,720
As Dr. Howe put it, his work there had been finished.

280
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,760
I'm talking about...

281
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,840
Hey, Philo.

282
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,680
Oh, Philo's waking up.

283
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,820
Hey, cute.

284
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,060
It's about time Dr. Truman talked about it.

285
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,060


286
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,060


287
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,560
Right here, right here.

288
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,040
Okay.

289
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,980
Tired old man.

290
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,900
Hey, you old poot.

291
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,640
Out of the box.

292
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,100
Come on.

293
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,880
Times hate to the Google power.

294
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,540
Times hate to the infinitive.

295
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,220
I want to eat.

296
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,260
The infinity of power.

297
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,280
Times the infinity of hate squared.

298
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:41,900
Okay.

299
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,040
I'll try it once.

300
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,820
Plus...

301
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,820
It feels so good to have a decent mic.

302
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,920
I've never once cheated on my hero.

303
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,340
Once a month or so.

304
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,880
Too much of a good thing can be wonderful.

305
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,900
Even a rubber banded one looks good, huh?

306
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,740
All right, now we're running the film of Suzy's Entertainment on Channel 5.

307
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,880
Suzy, I didn't do it.

308
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,020
I would show you my little black book if I could lift it.

309
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,060
Oh, I want to stay on the ceiling.

310
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,980
Put that forked tail away.

311
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,980
Suzy, keep that tail straight.

312
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,980
Keep that tail out of my way.

313
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

314
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,200


315
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,200


316
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,200


317
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,200


318
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,200


319
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,200


320
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

321
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:18,480
Now to conspiracy blinded doubters, the church might look at first glance like some fantastically

322
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,700
well developed parody.

323
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,260
A parody of religions and so forth.

324
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,320
That's understandable.

325
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:31,160
You know, after all, most people still think man either evolved from apes or was created

326
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,460
by a god and actually believed what they see on the TV news.

327
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,180
We're all human beings, aren't we?

328
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,180


329
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,180


330
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:43,540
First of all, they keep trying to force the natural contradictions of life into making some sort of sense.

331
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,100
And that is the ultimate folly.

332
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,460
That is what shall bring us down, my friends.

333
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:58,540
Now, to you loving Christians who want to kill us, think about it.

334
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,220
You worship a dead guy nailed to a stick.

335
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,400
We worship a head that gets knocked around by a stick.

336
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,120
We're not that far apart.

337
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,680
We're not so easy ground.

338
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,320
You know, there are, in fact, many gods.

339
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,680
Many gods who don't want you to believe in them.

340
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,520
That's exactly why we do believe in them.

341
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,800
To defy or else to negotiate with those very self-same gods.

342
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,320
Like Jason in that movie, Jason and the Argonauts.

343
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,020
Now, that was cool.

344
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,280
And to do that, friends, you need a new kind of Jesus.

345
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,100
A Jesus like nobody's ever seen.

346
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,660
The Jesus that didn't get nailed.

347
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:47,240
If you look deeply into the jello, you will see him.

348
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,600
But by then, it will be much too late.

349
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,260
As an anonymous subgenius once said.

350
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,500
And friends, in this church, there's only one heresy, and that is orthodoxy.

351
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,060
Peer pressure to fit in and be popular is the conspiracy's biggest...

352
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,140
trick on you.

353
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,140
Quit wishing you could be like those pink jerks around you.

354
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,440
If you're a loner, so be it.

355
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,220
You can't learn to think for yourself.

356
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,040
But only Bob can show you how.

357
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,640
Crack the safe of your brain, my friends.

358
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,180
Fiddle with those tumblers inside your head.

359
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,620
Knock the hinges off the locked doorway...

360
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,420
and lay into your mind.

361
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,160
And clear this planet!

362
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,340
Oh! Oh!

363
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:42,500
Shh!

364
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,160
What?

365
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:43,800
Shh!

366
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,320
Oh, I say, do that again.

367
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,060
It feels so good when I stop, doesn't it?

368
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
That oxy-sophomoric.

369
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,900
The instructor commends you on your last stretch.

370
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,760
That was very cruel of you to start whipping me with that tail, Suzy.

371
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,160
And besides, it wasn't hard enough.

372
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,520
All right, guys, we're gonna have to get serious.

373
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,100
Well, that was your fault, honey.

374
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,620
Yeah, that's right. The show starts in like four minutes.

375
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,920
Where's the DJ? When's he coming?

376
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,700
Oh, yeah.

377
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,860
Oh, yeah, you're gonna say, not hard enough.

378
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,940
When you were walking funny for two weeks, you're gonna say, oh, yeah, not hard enough.

379
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,220
Uh-oh, it's really starting to sound like a subgenius show now.

380
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,620
There's four records at once.

381
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,000
Ten infantile, pre-infantile fetal...

382
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,820
fetal...

383
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,260
fetal...

384
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,400
Your humor was quite fetal.

385
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,780
Yeah, we did that one already.

386
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,720
But it was new that time.

387
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,320
Yeah, well, see, that's how fetal we are.

388
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,660
We do the same joke twice.

389
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,960
That's fetal of us, is it not?

390
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,460
We're gonna have to check the microphones here in a sec.

391
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,320
Where's the DJ? When are we going?

392
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,580
Oh, we're doing sound check now?

393
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,000
We don't do college alternative.

394
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,580
We do junior high alternative.

395
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,380
Let's get a sound check now.

396
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,520
Kindergarten alternative.

397
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,620
Okay, I'm checking the sound.

398
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,060
Special education nursery school alternative.

399
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,900
Yep, there's the sound.

400
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,980
All right, you're on audition.

401
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,480
Embryonic alternative.

402
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,080
I think it's a bobby.

403
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,540
At least we got someone to laugh.

404
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,160
They're chasing after all the bobbies with their mallets.

405
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,820
He's chasing Philo out on a horse.

406
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,480
They're lopping off the bobbies' heads and rolling them across the floor.

407
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:04,620
There he goes.

408
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,800
I would call you a jackass, but I wouldn't want to insult the American Donkey Breeders Association.

409
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,940
It could be considered some kind of slur.

410
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,740
Well, it is a slur because, after all, if you can't call a jackass a jackass...

411
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,860
You can't do a Dames of Genius show, that's for sure.

412
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:28,960
I would call you a Nazi, but it might reflect badly on the positive public image and the integrity of the Nazi party

413
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,200
by suggesting that Adolf Hitler would lower his standards to accept you as a member.

414
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,600
Hey, this thing keeps it real.

415
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,240
It's got a good rhythm.

416
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,520
Yeah.

417
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,640
Oh, it's the orgasmic drum.

418
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,240
Get off of that.

419
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,080
Yeah, get off.

420
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,800
That's a dryer.

421
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,580
She loves that orgasmic drum.

422
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,860
She loves to sit on the dryer.

423
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,600
She puts an uneven load in there.

424
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,800
What thing are you talking about?

425
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,560
It's a dryer.

426
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:45,760
Out of balance.

427
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,540
Out of balance, aren't we all, when you get down to it?

428
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,460
Hey, guys.

429
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,080
We're going on in just a minute or so.

430
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,440
We're going to have a good time.

431
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,700
Oh, just leave me here.

432
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:52,960
Be cool.

433
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:52,960


434
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,740
Okay, you got that.

435
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,580
You have to come up with some ideas.

436
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,720
Oh, I'm a speed queen from way back.

437
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:56,840
What are we going to talk about?

438
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,960
Are we going to see the Rocket Away opening or the Hour of Slack?

439
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:04,820
Oh, we're opening.

440
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,440
Philo should be here any second.

441
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,520
He took a spin on that Rocket.

442
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,900
We'll have to make music.

443
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,000
Look, man.

444
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,320
I didn't have time to talk to you.

445
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:10,980
I didn't have time to talk to you.

446
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,540
I'm pretty .

447
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,620
I said that those are .

448
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,980
Friends, those of you, those of you who have listened to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour,

449
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:30,220
hey, Kurt, the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour and Slack will recognize as soon as you hear

450
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,600
the ringing tones of this horrible voice, the voice that is so powerful, so powerful,

451
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:34,600


452
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:34,600


453
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:34,600


454
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:34,600


455
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:40,260
so powerful, so powerful, the voice, yes, yes, the voice of, the voice of ... Boy,

456
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,820
he just went over there to talk with me.

457
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,360
He got scared, though.

458
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:42,780
The voice of ...

459
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,100
He got scared.

460
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,460
Senator.

461
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,540
He was scared.

462
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:45,820
No.

463
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,020
He's father.

464
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:48,620
Joe.

465
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,440
Joe mama.

466
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,300
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

467
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,560
Preach.

468
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,220
Preach your ass off.

469
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,420
Hello, friends, and welcome.

470
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,500
Preach your ass off.

471
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,600
The sermon tonight is a discussion on the subgenius radio ministry, the subgenius radio

472
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,600


473
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,600


474
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,600


475
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:04,600


476
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:15,180
entitled True Believer. What is belief? Well, Webster says, it is to view as true the existence

477
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:23,340
or possibility of a thing or idea. You believe you're in love, so you get married and wear

478
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,840
a ring on your hand. That's a nice symbolic act of intent, proclaiming you believe that

479
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,940
you will stay married until death do you part. But obviously it's not always true now, is

480
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:39,440
it? Because most people wind up divorced. That's right, like Jayner. If you truly believe

481
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:48,680
in something, you should be willing to sacrifice something. History does not remember symbolic

482
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:58,320
acts, only sacrificial deeds. Joan of Arc burning at the stake for her love of France,

483
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,920
or Socrates drinking the imloc out of Princesses.

484
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,820
A veil, the veil of France, the veil of Rome, the veil of France. All of them were crucified.

485
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:11,000
Lots of people have been crucified. Happened every day in Rome. But when Jesus of Nazareth

486
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,760
did it, the whole damn world heard about it. Now why do you think that is, dear friends?

487
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:25,940
Jesus wasn't a criminal. He wasn't a rapist. He wasn't a murderer. He wasn't a thief. That came later.

488
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:36,880
His crime was his beliefs and he was willing to die for it. He really believed he was the Messiah.

489
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:46,680
Now whether or not he was is debatable. But what is not debatable is the fact that billions of people also believed him.

490
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:52,900
Because of his belief. And more importantly, his sacrifice.

491
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,280
Now you're probably thinking, yeah but they were all experts.

492
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:13,060
Joe Navarre, Socrates, Jesus, they were all seasoned professionals that devoted most of their lives to a public performance that climaxed in some sort of sensational suicide or headline grabbing execution.

493
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,660
There is nothing I, a lowly man, can do.

494
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,160
of genie could possibly do that would have the same significance. That's what you're

495
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:29,320
probably thinking, isn't it? Well, let me tell you a little story. It's a true story

496
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:39,020
torn from the pages of history. It's about a little boy, a kid, a child. He was a young

497
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:47,100
shepherd, barely a teenager. His name was Stephen. And this all took place during the

498
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:54,360
time of the Great Crusades. All of Europe was trying to drive the Arabs out of Jerusalem.

499
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:01,100
The Pope couldn't do it. The king couldn't do it. All the armies of Europe couldn't do

500
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:06,520
it. But young Stephen, he believed that he could.

501
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,100
He went from town to town to build up an army to liberate Jerusalem. Oh, the adults,

502
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:20,920
they wouldn't listen. Oh, no. They were too old, too wise. After all, how could a kid

503
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,180
achieve what so many great men and leaders had failed to accomplish? But the other children,

504
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:36,820
dear friends, they believed. And they listened. The adults, they all laughed. This army has

505
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,000
no money. It has no ships. How will they get out of here? They didn't have any money. They

506
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:47,160
didn't get their Stephen believed God would provide an answer. He believed that God would

507
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:56,340
split the seas and let them cross. When they reached the sea, dear friends, it didn't part.

508
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,900
But something almost as incredible did.

509
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,920
Some merchants who worked for profit suddenly had a change of heart.

510
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:15,900
And they paid for four giant ships to haul this army of children across the Mediterranean.

511
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,360
Hard to believe. You don't believe it, do you?

512
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,780
But it's true. It's in the history books. And you know why? Because the children believed

513
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,880
it would happen. And so it came to pass.

514
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,000
When the Arabs realized they were surrounded by children, they were going to go to the

515
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:54,640
ramparts and be with the home. But the bodies collapsed. Behold theæ¹ flaming

516
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,400
Satan.

517
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,680
The liar who shall scatter away this land, they shall all who have not begun to die from

518
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:55,680


519
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,140
When they learned that, they were finally sharing yourvette and they were going to go

520
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,460
into Cher annihilation forã  Skeleton.

521
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,680
They sunrise right after what the Se Vielen were doing right now.

522
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:03,680


523
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:03,680


524
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,660
jaeh dilemmah did.

525
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,960
And we are in the city provefuly made to believe, Simon The Bayern, if it wasn't

526
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,000
å¬ flock to the gate for the effigy of this act of worship, they wouldn't have

527
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:15,160
Yes, dear friends. It's in here. It's right here in the history book. It says right here.

528
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:22,060
What all the other crusades failed to achieve was swords, bloodshed, and millions in gold.

529
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,280
Frederick VII achieved through mere diplomacy because Frederick...

530
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,200
Oh, wait a minute.

531
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,360
Oh, I'm sorry. Wrong page again. Okay, okay, here.

532
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,100
Ah, because Stephen believed in his cause.

533
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,500
He was willing to sacrifice himself to achieve it.

534
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,900
He was no great man, but a child, and so was everyone else on board.

535
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,500
It was belief that filled the sails and blew those four ships safely across the Mediterranean.

536
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,860
Wait, whoa, hold on. I'll strike that.

537
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,840
Okay, three ships were lost at sea with all hands because of the storm.

538
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,660
But even that, even that was not enough to stop their mission.

539
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,920
When that one ship full of true believers landed in Egypt,

540
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,980
having been blown...

541
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,360
Blown off course by the storm.

542
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:17,860
They marched off that gangplank, preparing to trek millions, all right, hundreds of miles to the deserts.

543
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,880
And they were quickly sold into slavery and prostitution.

544
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,640
I, I, I, I, I'm sorry.

545
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:36,220
What it was is the girls were sold into prostitution to pay for the weapons so that the boys,

546
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,980
so that the boys could afford to be used as sails.

547
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:38,980


548
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:38,980


549
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,260
Sex toys for the great sultan.

550
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,480
And wait a minute.

551
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,420
Enough of the history.

552
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,260
The point is, the point is,

553
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:55,480
they believed in something enough to sacrifice everything for what they believed in and their God.

554
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,660
And I bet you right now, they are all up there in heaven, looking down and smiling.

555
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,880
Assuming, of course, they were allowed in after all the abhorrent sexual acts they were forced to commit.

556
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,420
Ha, ha, ha.

557
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,060
But at least they tried to fight for something they believed in.

558
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:19,000
So now the big question is, dear friends, what have you done for Bob Dobbs lately?

559
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,040
Hearing is the word of our priest Bob.

560
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,680
Amen.

561
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,060
Praise the priest.

562
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,580
Praise Bob.

563
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,400
Praise Bob the idol of God.

564
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,060
The great, the great Father Joe Mama.

565
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,440
Yes, it, God.

566
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:38,100
Oh, dear friends, you know science, this is a science fiction convention.

567
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,440
You know, ain't it a shame?

568
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:46,720
I mean, we should be in a big cathedral or something, but no, no, they decide, well, it's subgenius stuff.

569
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,320
We'll pay them if, as long as they'll call it comedy.

570
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,840
Yeah, as long as they'll shut up, maybe that'll work.

571
00:26:52,940 --> 00:27:03,140
But, dear friends, you know, what's a lot sadder, and this is really the subject of my sort of sermon in progress,

572
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,080
that science fiction is not nearly as weird as science fiction.

573
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,080


574
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,780
It is a subject of history.

575
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:15,260
And history is falling far behind in weirdness compared to the daily news.

576
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:23,280
But what's more frightening than any of that is, well, as one person asked Bob,

577
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,620
are you trying to see behind the veil of illusion?

578
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,080
And Bob said, no, I'm trying to see behind the veil of ordinary reality.

579
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:29,720
Woo!

580
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,400
Praise Bob!

581
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,080
Firebirds and Camaros, as Dr. Filo does.

582
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,080


583
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,620
As Bob Drummond told me one time, are the cars of choice of one of the mainstream types of pinks.

584
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,660
Pinks, normals, mediocratons, the cage men, Barbies and Kins.

585
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,880
Well, now that can include subgeniuses in some cases.

586
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,580
Their cars all look exactly alike, you know, the Firebirds and the Camaros,

587
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,920
and the people who drive them are all exactly alike.

588
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,920
And they all listen to the same radio station, no matter what part of the country they're in,

589
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,860
because even if the call letters are different,

590
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,140
it's still the same radio station.

591
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,120
The DJs all say the same jokes over and over again at the same time of day,

592
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,620
and it's always real rock radio.

593
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:25,900
And it's the same songs are always playing simultaneously in every nook and cranny of the nation.

594
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,920
I don't know if you travel much, but I do, and all the cities are starting to look the same.

595
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,020
It's the rise of the mediocratons, my friend.

596
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,060
Everything starting to look just exactly like it does now.

597
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,460
It's the rise of the mediocratons, my friend.

598
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,520
Every city is the same city.

599
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,200
They're just spores of one great big amoeba-like mall

600
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,220
that will someday cover this entire benighted globe,

601
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,540
like an endless ant bed.

602
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:56,460
And from any given downtown, you can drive for hours through the identical mini malls,

603
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,160
the pizza huts, the apartment complexes, the housing developments,

604
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,540
in endless, endless repetition.

605
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,540
Now, that used to be considered dystopian science fiction.

606
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,800
Remember?

607
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,880
And now that it's here, we think it's perfectly normal.

608
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,600
Small towns, they used to all be different.

609
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,440
Now they're all the same.

610
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,060
They all have the Whataburger and the Burger King and the mall and the Cinema Octoplex,

611
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,020
while everything that made them unique or quaint or whatever

612
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:28,100
is swallowed up, friends, by the devouring pinkness,

613
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,280
the clockwork orangutans.

614
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,500
Attention, pinks!

615
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,060
In Sunsite meet puppets.

616
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,040
If you can step away from your new home,

617
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,400
plant a species of world first-generation parasite,

618
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,020
or encounter the whole world at you.

619
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,960
One day catch either one of these people and bathe in their own hens

620
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,540
before a monster gets to consciop right in front of him.

621
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,380
Want some?

622
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,300
Me too, me first!

623
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:06,120
And space of no egg in the incubator.

624
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,680
Things are going.

625
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,020


626
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:14,540
can eat it too, can you? Don't make waves, okay? Or it's more like, well, we're free

627
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:20,620
enough. Yeah, we're free Americans. We can indulge in the properly ritualized bad behavior

628
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:26,260
like going to the lake and watching the game and getting real drunk and beating our dogs

629
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:32,080
and wives. Oh, but that's understood. We all do that. Now going to the lake and launching

630
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:39,880
golfer heads while chanting and levitating naked, frocked to the gills and performing

631
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:48,180
acubating rituals with our neighbors' wives and dogs. No way. No way. No, it's okay to

632
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:53,620
supplement our sexual drives into things like despoiling the landscape at the expense of

633
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,700
health and self-awareness just for money because the only thing that gets our tired, twisted

634
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,060
old nervous systems going again is the thought that we need to be able to do something about

635
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,060


636
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,340
it. We might be able to buy more things. Your body keeps clocking in, my friends, functioning

637
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:15,900
on 10% of your life essence while the conspiracy gets the rest. You moron. They've got you

638
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:26,320
thinking that it's natural to work for a living. Now, what you want to do is real work and

639
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,800
there's nothing wrong with that. What you have to do is slavery, my friends, and no

640
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,000
matter what they're paying you.

641
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:40,240
You're selling too cheap. In the Middle Ages, they called it the obscene kiss. Kissing Satan's

642
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,360
bum was the way a sorcerer or a witch was initiated. And today we have corporate style

643
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:55,540
butt kissing. As Dr. Drummond said, bestowing that submissive kiss upon the posterior of

644
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:01,820
the cheap executive devil. The work ethic is satanic, my friends. Mark Bob's words,

645
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,520
and he's not going to say it again.

646
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:02,520


647
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:02,520


648
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:02,520


649
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:09,260
It would be our downfall, our doom. Our little aquarium earth is turning into a toxic toilet

650
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:15,320
soul farm, controlled by aliens and their conspiracy stooges. And day after day slips

651
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:23,160
by, time that you could have invested in saving the universe with Bob. Oh, but instead, you

652
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:30,200
sold those days cheap to the conspiracy like a sucker. Years and years out of your life

653
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,060
with nothing to show for them. But, they're going to have to pay you back. And I want

654
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,000
a bunch of paid household bills,

655
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,640
you'll never get any of those precious years back.

656
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,940
You'll just get older and older

657
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,140
and develop more and more chronic aches and pains

658
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,960
and regrets.

659
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,320
And when you die, the conspiracy will just say,

660
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,680
well, there's plenty more where that one came from.

661
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,640
Friends, it may be a little too late

662
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,780
to stop being optimistic.

663
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,660
But it's never too late

664
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,960
to start being totally and bitterly pessimistic.

665
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,620
Remember, things could be much worse.

666
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,420
Things could be a hell of a lot worse.

667
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,820
That's the consolation.

668
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,800
You could, suddenly, one minute from now,

669
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,060
be screaming in unimaginable pain,

670
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,380
half burned to death and trapped inside

671
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,480
the white-hot twisted metal and broken glass

672
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,680
and charred wood of wherever you happen to be

673
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,160
when it happens.

674
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,040
Or you could be lying on the floor

675
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,740
on parched ground with bones so brittle from malnutrition

676
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,960
and a brain so ruined by disease

677
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,620
that all life for you becomes that one little tiny piece of rice

678
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,840
on the end of your tongue.

679
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,340
Or you could be rich, rich but afflicted

680
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,580
with something caused by your own lifestyle

681
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,500
that slowly bites deeper and deeper into you,

682
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,500
but ever so slowly,

683
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,820
so that you never stop thinking about killing yourself.

684
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,860
Then they'd be sorry.

685
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,220
Or you could, conceivably,

686
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,260
be so wrapped up in your job or your comic books and movies

687
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,500
that you haven't noticed

688
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,140
that you've gone completely crazy

689
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,440
and that you've only been hypnotized

690
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,820
into thinking that everything's okay.

691
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,220
But actually, there's starvation and misery all around you

692
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,440
that's gonna catch up with you sooner or later.

693
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,900
But that hasn't happened yet,

694
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,260
so in the meantime, who cares?

695
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,000
As long as the power plants still run

696
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,900
and we can still televise yearly rituals,

697
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,200
we can still be happy.

698
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:32,200


699
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:32,700
we can't say nothing until Earth Days

700
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:37,460
when the Liberals congratulate themselves for being Liberals

701
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,160
and the Conservatives congratulate themselves

702
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,520
for fooling the Liberals.

703
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:46,920
And the ones in between are ground into dog food.

704
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,900
And my friends, there is a man here who can tell you...

705
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,600
I mean, you're sitting here going,

706
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,760
now, what is this Church all about?

707
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,180
I've got me really depressed now.

708
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
Is there an answer?

709
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,960
What do I do about it? There is something you can do. It's the most important thing you can do.

710
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:07,320
No, it's not repent and no it's not. It is getting slack. But to get slack first you must hate!

711
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:15,440
And the man to tell you all about hate is the very, his, we are all but infants in hate compared to this man, Jane or Hyperclink.

712
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,140
Stank! Jane or Hyperclink. Praise that man!

713
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:28,500
I'm an artist. I'm a celebrity. I created something with your wife that's different. Creating something with your wife.

714
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,020
Do you have the copyright on it? Having sex with your wife. Those are two very different things.

715
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,180
The show ends and the show begins. Another show cycle starting up.

716
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,140
They could never capitulate for the word capitulation is not found in our vocabulary.

717
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,700
Arm-pitulation. No, never, ever, for the word capitulation has no meaning. Snake-pitulation.

718
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,760
It's a word that's being taught for us. Tar-pitulation.

719
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,280
And if we are to fail we shall drag down with us a world in flames.

720
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:02,000
Now you notice that Jane or can quote Hitler or Charles Manson word for word. How about some Thomas Jefferson?

721
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:08,820
How about some Benjamin Franklin? Some George Washington? I bet you can't quote one more kid. Quote me John 310.

722
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,800
He can't do it. I lied there for a while thinking. All I know is Satanism.

723
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,600
Hey Stank, how long does our battery last in that our Grasmatron?

724
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,420
Wasn't operating in South America.

725
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,920
It could capitulate. I mean we are kind of broke. I mean I could actually get a job.

726
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,680
The word capitulation could be found in our vocabulary.

727
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:33,060
Well look here's a dictionary right here. Capitulation. To surrender.

728
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,900
Abject self-abasement. To just completely and totally give up.

729
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:47,860
Unconditionally give in to one's opponent. That's Webster's Third American edition, 1994.

730
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:53,440
While the rest of society sleeps, the church fizzly goes about laying the ground on their bloody hangover.

731
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,480
The so-called X-Day, when every non-coal member is eliminated in a general massacre.

732
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,360
See why you ride the pot so close, Doug?

733
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,160
The A-T-F.

734
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,800
Either sit or get off the pot.

735
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,740
Exactly.

736
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,720
Sit or get off the volume pot.

737
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,500
Either smoke or get off the pot.

738
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,080
Or the smoke pot, as they say in Hollywood. The brain is smoking.

739
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,600
The $50 subgenies of strange ritualistic cults.

740
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,700
Is the show over yet? Did it ever start?

741
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,580
Don't answer that either way.

742
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,900
I'm afraid it's going to happen.

743
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,480
Turn the normal.

744
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,640
I'm sorry darling, but the...

745
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,160
Now tap dance?

746
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,240
I know you love the show, Tavis.

747
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,720
Back up, back up.

748
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,400
Don't touch my hair.

749
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,560
Stand back please.

750
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,860
Don't touch my hair.

751
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,860
I saw Elizabeth Montgomery wiggle her nose.

752
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,100
Genius deities leaving the room. Everybody stand back.

753
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,080
We're all insolent till proven silky.

754
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,020
Okay, move up the guard dogs.

755
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,360
Look, I can't do you when I'm working, baby.

756
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,800
Look, I don't sit on the edge of the bed and yell stuff at you when you're working.

757
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,720
You know, it's easy to just sit there and criticize, but I mean, how easy is it to sit there and...

758
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,920
All right, that's it, Chandler. You just blew her cover.

759
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,420
...be creative. Just sit there and, you know, make a...

760
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,620
Oh, and I didn't get to watch the show.

761
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:05,740
She was about to give the church $500, but no, she had to listen to a joke and now she's gone.

762
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,660
Well, guys, we can...

763
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,180
Have we done any jokes tonight?

764
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,300
We're going to have to write some jokes and stuff like that.

765
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,000
You are the joke.

766
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,200
We go on here and just...

767
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,580
You, the listener, are the joke.

768
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,060
You.

769
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,780
The very butt of this foul radio show.

770
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,800
You say something funny, don't make me laugh.

771
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,320
You have been listening to...

772
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:25,940
WREK Atlanta.

773
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,280
And...

774
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,260
This is only a test.

775
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,060
You probably think everything we say is a lie, but it isn't true.

776
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,980
Yeah, you're on KPFA 94.1 in Berkeley, California right now.

777
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,540
We haven't even started to lie yet. We haven't had to.

778
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,560
That's the truth.

779
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,080
There is no truth.

780
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,300
You're also on...

781
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,400
I don't even understand what we do. What is this?

782
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,220
Magnetic tape.

783
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,740
What are we doing? Why did we start all this?

784
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,840
It was to prize Bob.

785
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,740
Get slack.

786
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,340
Destroy the conspiracy and to hate the normals.

787
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,240
It's as simple as that.

788
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,260
One, two, three, four.

789
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,260
In that order.

790
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,300
Starting with the praising Bob.

791
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,620
I noticed we never did that.

792
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,040
Seems like we've forgotten about Bob.

793
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,220
Seems like we've forgotten this was a war for the...

794
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,960
We're about to burn out old farts.

795
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,820
When did this happen?

796
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,500
Do the sacred noise.

797
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,000
We have to get back to the orthodox stang, brainwash everyone mentality.

798
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:08,500
Yeah.

799
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,900
What about the orthodox stang-ian megaphistopelogism?

800
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,300
Oh, yeah. We can't do anything creative.

801
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,420
The fundamentalists just got into the church.

802
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:16,580
It always has to go back to Bob.

803
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,080
Kill the normals.

804
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,300
All those old 1981 concepts that he just keeps pushing year after year.

805
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,140
My friends are tuning in at two o'clock.

806
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,820
Where he tries to grow into something else.

807
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,300
Oh, bring it back to the same old Bob.

808
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:28,980
You're gonna turn on and get the regular...

809
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,460
The kind of joke you might see in a 50s sitcom.

810
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:32,520
Hold on.

811
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,040
We're going on the air now, so hold on.

812
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,120
I have a special relationship with my...

813
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,080
Oh, I'm not dressed.

814
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,480
We're breaking air now.

815
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,880
Listen, I'm starting to record the show.

816
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,460
We're breaking wind.

817
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,040
We're ready.

818
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,940
I've got a one-hour tape.

819
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,160
I'm trying to record the tape.

820
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,260
We're ready to zygote.

821
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,280
I'm ready to zygote.

822
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,140
I'm ready to zygote this show.

823
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,920
I don't want a bunch of music on this thing.

824
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,160
Let's just dump it down the shunt.

825
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,320
Is this the sport that you guys were talking about?

826
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,140
Ooh.

827
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,400
Let's dump the show.

828
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,220
Send it right on down the shunt.

829
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:53,680
You can't listen to...

830
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,020
Which one is the abort switch?

831
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,360
Hand me the coat hanger.

832
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,700
I'll do it myself.

833
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,920
You can't listen to your own show.

834
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,180
Oh, my God.

835
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,220
You can't call your own telephone.

836
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,720
You can't...

837
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,600
It's hideous.

838
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,520
You can't see with your own eyes.

839
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,620
You can't talk with your own mouth.

840
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,280
You can't think with your own brain.

841
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,260
You can't start fire with your own...

842
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:14,260


843
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:14,260


844
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:14,640
With your own lighter.

845
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,400
With your own...

846
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:15,920
Wait a minute.

847
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,700
But that does make sense.

848
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,120
Why are we saying...

849
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,220
But you can do all these things.

850
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,680
It's just religion.

851
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,600
It's a leap of faith.

852
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,780
It doesn't have to make sense.

853
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:22,940
You can't hear.

854
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:22,940


855
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,840
It doesn't make sense for us to make sense.

856
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,580
You can't use your mind to think about your religion.

857
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,220
Two words were never spoken.

858
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,500
There we go.

859
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:32,920
Finally.

860
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,580
Two lies were never screamed, were never babbled.

861
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,380
Think about your religion now.

862
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
I'm going to start the recording.

863
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,460
More false schizophrenia was never babbled.

864
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:41,920
Okay.

865
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,260
Oh, yeah.

866
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:42,680
We got a song.

867
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,240
We're on the air.

868
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:43,860
In ten seconds.

869
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:44,660
Three.

870
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:44,660


871
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,180
First.

872
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,000
Welcome.

873
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,280
You are listening to...

874
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,540
The Subgenius Hour of Slack.

875
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,560
The Subgenius Hour of Slack.

876
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,060
More than an hour of Slack and less than an hour of Slack.

877
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,900
Less than a show.

878
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,420
Less than a true experience.

879
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,580
Double your slack back if not...

880
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,280
We could go on and on about it.

881
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,560
Well, boys, was it good for you?

882
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:05,700
We just did.

883
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,740
Follow the script, okay?

884
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,380
All right.

885
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:07,600
All right.

886
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,400
Hand me a wet nap.

887
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,440
Now we're going to slip the little show condom over the antenna.

888
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,200
You give good show.

889
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:12,240
Okay.

890
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,400
Hi, guys.

891
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:13,840
I'm late.

892
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,300
I'm late.

893
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,520
Let's slip these trash bags over the microphones.

894
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,180
We do get kind of juicy when we start venting.

895
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,320
Now, are we going to start ranting now?

896
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:23,920
Right now.

897
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:24,800
Go ahead.

898
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:24,940
Now.

899
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,580
When do we start acting silly?

900
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,960
When do we start acting insane?

901
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,320
When do we start ranting and babbling?

902
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,080
When do we do the humor?

903
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,940
The humor.

904
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,360
Stop.

905
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:32,920
Listen.

906
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,060
I don't know how to be funny.

907
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,180
Wait.

908
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,560
I'm going to stop the tape and start over again.

909
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:35,740
Okay?

910
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,500
This is a bad beginning.

911
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:36,900
Okay.

912
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:37,520
All right.

913
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:39,920
Kurt's funny.

914
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,400
All you have to do is look at him.

915
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,220
One, two, three.

916
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,640
The subgenius hour of slack.

917
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,740
You call this slack?

918
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,200
I haven't slept three hours in all weekend.

919
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,820
Don't superstar me.

920
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,420
I don't think we're going to pull it off.

921
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,040
Can we cut that?

922
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,680
There's scissors.

923
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,920
I think there's scissors space.

924
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:03,860
Don't compare me with Chad.

925
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,540
Let's start over.

926
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,840
Don't compare me with Groucho Marx.

927
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,580
We've got time.

928
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,440
We can do this right.

929
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,160
Don't compare me with WC Fields.

930
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,200
Don't compare me with Jonathan Winters or Robin Williams.

931
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,200


932
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,200


933
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,200


934
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,200


935
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,200


936
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,200


937
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,200


938
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,200


939
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,200


940
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,560
I was thinking John Wilkes Booth.

941
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:14,560


942
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,000
They had what they had to say and do, and I have what I had to say and do.

943
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,700
I'm a snake. I'm an eagle in the desert. I'm a coyote.

944
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,480
You're stuck play-acting as a human.

945
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,580
I'm not in prison. You are.

946
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,320
We've been listening to this now for five years.

947
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,560
We belong behind bars.

948
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:32,380
Man, we forgot to free Charlie. All this time we've been sitting here blabbering on the radio.

949
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,920
Charlie's still locked up. That means we have to go back to the 60s.

950
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,160
He's only in there because he wants to be.

951
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,340
I'm going to start the tape over.

952
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,620
Well, you know, word has it you shot Shorty Shay.

953
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,280
We have to start over again now.

954
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,080
Well, word has it you're an old woman.

955
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,080
Word has it there's a turkey in the sky.

956
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,560
Did you order the slings of the La Villancas? Hell no.

957
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,060
Did you shoot Shorty Shay? Hell no.

958
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,820
Did you cut Gary Hinman's ear off? Hell yeah.

959
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,700
Whatever that means.

960
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,680
Okay, Charlie, why don't you tell me what happened that night?

961
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,140
What happened?

962
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,000
That night. Let me see. That night.

963
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:16,300
You know exactly what I'm talking about. October 10th, 1969. The slings of the La Villancas.

964
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,380
Oh, that night.

965
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,100
Oh, yeah, that night.

966
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,140
The chocolate milk, the fork in the stomach.

967
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:26,620
Susan Atkins testified that you ordered the slings of the La Villancas. Susie said that?

968
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:32,320
You know very well that she did. It was the most highly publicized murder trial of the decade.

969
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,640
Susie's just jealous.

970
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,160
Now, tell me what happened that night.

971
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,820
Oh, yeah, that night.

972
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:44,000
There was a castle of Frankenstein, and there were vampires and hunchbacks and lightning and the whales dying in the ocean.

973
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,740
Oh, yeah, Charlie, you can go on and on talking about Hiroshima and the whales dying in the ocean, but this is your ball game.

974
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,660
I'm all alone in the world?

975
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,480
Yeah.

976
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,700
On this one, I'm afraid you are.

977
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:04,120
Yeah, okay, thank you for that very funny show, very wise words of encouragement for this radio program.

978
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,380
Everybody else want to start sweeping this place up?

979
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,580
Listen, I need this tape for tomorrow.

980
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,840
I'm not a lawmaker. I'm a lawbreaker.

981
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,140
And this time, don't take the light bulbs with you when you leave.

982
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,100
Listen, I'm really sorry. I can't record this thing. I need this tape for the Klingon.

983
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,080
What happened that night at that radio show?

984
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,580
I'm hand recording it for you.

985
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,600
Oh, yeah, that night at the radio show.

986
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,420
I will magnetize tape by hand and hieroglyphics.

987
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,400
There was lightning in Castle Frankenstein.

988
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,680
I'm a slow learner. I can't pick up that Klingon.

989
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,740
John Carradine is the mad scientist.

990
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:29,840
Klingonese.

991
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,440
And, you know, memorizing.

992
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,880
Bell Lugosi dying in the ocean.

993
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:34,100


994
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,960
Let's just kill this show. It's not working.

995
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,060
It's directed by Al Ackerman.

996
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,620
Oh, you can stake through the heart. That's the usual.

997
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,720
You can go on and on about Bell Lugosi dying in the ocean.

998
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,400
Let's poison it. Let's poison this show.

999
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,680
What's around here?

1000
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,360
Record cleaner. We can kill this show with record cleaner.

1001
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:48,720
This show is your...

1002
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,620
Where's the mouth? There's all these slots.

1003
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:54,560
This is your ball game. You mean I'm all alone on this show?

1004
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,820
Hey, this is alcohol. We can pour it all over the board and light it.

1005
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,460
This is just crazy enough to work.

1006
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,280
We can just like, you know...

1007
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,700
Don't use that word.

1008
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,160
Oh, God, that was close.

1009
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,460
Work is a four-letter word.

1010
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,560
No, I don't mind work. I can watch it for hours.

1011
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,880
We can just move our lips and let someone else lip sync what we're trying to say.

1012
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,100
Yeah, this has all been prerecorded.

1013
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,680
Sink into the lips?

1014
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,140
Because none of it is real.

1015
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:18,180
We'll do an interactive show where like, you know, have it just silence and the audience fills in the blank void.

1016
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,760
And just got the sincerity just dripping like honey off of our voices.

1017
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,420
Hey, St. Jane or Harper Cleats, my friend!

1018
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,480
The tongue!

1019
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,080
You can cut off one Jane or tongue and a thousand more will grow in the ocean.

1020
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:34,800
And the ocean will grow in its place.

1021
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:43,380
You'll love this new method he's come up with for exterminating nine-tenths of the population at once.

1022
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,140
Through acubating, time control, and memory editing, dear friends.

1023
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,800
Now, Sister Susie the floozy is going to come up, I believe, pretty soon.

1024
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:59,340
But I was just thinking, boy, that videotape is about to get over into the lewd and lucidious stuff.

1025
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,480
Almost by coincidence.

1026
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,720
Yes, exactly.

1027
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,000
It'll be just perfect.

1028
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:12,640
And we will, all of us, learn to pull the wool over our own eyes and relax in the safety of our own delusions, as Bob taught us.

1029
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:20,300
Yes, you can also learn in this church, you can learn to masturbate without going blind.

1030
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:27,620
You can perform astral, astral sex with anyone you meet.

1031
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,840
It's not pornography, ma'am, officer.

1032
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,700
It's impassion.

1033
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,140
It's empowerment.

1034
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,740
You can learn to live with your sins because Bob Dobbs is a sex god.

1035
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,500
And he has come again and again to justify your sins.

1036
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:51,280
To teach you about the sacred doctrine of sex hurt until it feels so good that it hurts.

1037
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,220
You too can be a Jedi Knight of sex energy.

1038
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:01,240
And, oh ma'am, you won't care how dumb he is when you see the incredible results.

1039
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,400
A purer squirt, my friends, than drugs, the Bible, or even TV.

1040
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,500
But best of all, best of all, and I know this is going to be meaningful to some of you in here,

1041
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:20,760
but yet, you can be a virgin or an atheist and we'll still let you be a subgenius.

1042
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,220
Moses, as Steve Anzac once said, Moses parted the Red Sea.

1043
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,040
Oppenheimer split the atom.

1044
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,360
But J.R. Bob Dobbs cut the crap.

1045
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:42,560
As Papa Joe Mama once said, if man had been meant to feel guilt, he would not have been born with a Bob.

1046
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:49,700
Now Bob Dobbs, you can bet, he will not die for your sins.

1047
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,880
He's not that well connected.

1048
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:52,700
He couldn't do it anyway.

1049
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:57,540
He won't forgive your sins because he doesn't believe that you've got anything you need to be forgiven for.

1050
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,480
Bob will justify your sins.

1051
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,660
He will rationalize your very sins.

1052
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,080
You don't need forgiveness.

1053
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,480
You need what Bob brings.

1054
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,320
The sloppy second coming, dear friends.

1055
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,940
God, God may be everywhere, but Bob Dobbs has already been everywhere else.

1056
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,460
And Bob brings slack.

1057
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,060
Yes, he does.

1058
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,420
Slack.

1059
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,780
That state in which you need nothing because you have it already.

1060
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:28,140
And he brings slack without guilt because you will pay for it with no strings attached.

1061
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,160
Yes.

1062
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,140
He's the first industrial church, friends, ready to let the customer decide what it needs in a religion.

1063
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,160
Only Bob Dobbs has paid all his taxes.

1064
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,360
All the others still owe.

1065
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:45,580
Meanwhile, we continue to exploit women and men and how they love it.

1066
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,720
And Reverend, there's a mighty preacher here tonight.

1067
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,440
She hasn't been preaching for the church for long.

1068
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,900
She's been in the church for a long time.

1069
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:55,480
She's been in.

1070
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,760
She's a personal friend of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1071
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,240
Primary wife, Connie Dawes.

1072
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,920
Now, love corpses, I hope you're ready to do that proper bump and grind material.

1073
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:08,580
Yeah.

1074
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,640
All right.

1075
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,180
See, this is how you can't seem to play Amazing Grace or anything like that.

1076
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,920
I bet they could play In a God in a Vita.

1077
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,560
We're still working on it back there.

1078
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,780
We were practicing just then while you were talking.

1079
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,300
Okay.

1080
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:29,360
Presenting, dear friends, Reverend Susie the Flusie, also known as Louis Common Denominator.

1081
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:52,220
She will be even Mona Lisa-ing the Heritage Landmineiran seasoning after her other shows like

1082
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:58,020
IIÐ¸Ñ Mind Ã¤ndernation and our special ubiquitous story in Loolee yOu.

1083
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,020


1084
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,420
We face ships from far and wide, such asotee and Wesleyanand,

1085
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:58,420


1086
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:58,900
Good to back you up.

1087
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,500
You can always see me on TV, over the radio or audio,

1088
00:49:59,500 --> 00:49:59,540
or on their Don't Your Deus Family page.

1089
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,140
Onizes and CDs are still available.

1090
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,380
We really

1091
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,020
It's in the shape of a golf club.

1092
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,120
I don't know if you can see it.

1093
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:45,120
It is a church game in the shape of a little golf club.

1094
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:48,760
If only we had a tiny little golfer head, we could launch it.

1095
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,140
No, no, no.

1096
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,720
We'll leave that for later.

1097
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:02,160
It's best not because if we did the head launching wrong, it could destroy the foundations of this.

1098
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,300
Well, hell, let's do it anyway.

1099
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,980
All right, it's time for the musical interlude, isn't it?

1100
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,860
Okay, I come out the other side of China, but that's as low as I go.

1101
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,540
Ladies and gentlemen, the subgenius, Hour of Slack.

1102
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,220
Are we starting now?

1103
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:23,580
Yeah.

1104
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,100
Is this the funny part?

1105
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,180
Yeah.

1106
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:27,880
Go.

1107
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,580
Continued next week, same Bob time, same Bob channel.

1108
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:38,380
Could this be the downfall of the dynamic Dobbs?

1109
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,000
Strange indeed.

1110
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:43,280
Will Kurt Kursteiner be sawed in half?

1111
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,760
What about the Fibber?

1112
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,300
If he's lucky.

1113
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,300
What about the Puz?

1114
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,800
Flatman and Robin.

1115
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,400
The Puz.

1116
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,240
Human pancakes.

1117
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,360
Stuck in bubble gum again.

1118
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,540
Good.

1119
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,320
Surprise, kitty speech, the Joker.

1120
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,520
The dynamic duel.

1121
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,340
Too bad the Churchill has to save your friend.

1122
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,520
Ooh, I'm not cleaning that up.

1123
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,600
Exactly, Batman.

1124
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:17,720
And now as I make my exit, exactly as I planned.

1125
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:18,340
Perfect.

1126
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,380
Dynamic duo out of Slack.

1127
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,780
Dynamic again inside the church of no return.

1128
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,580
So that I may relish this.

1129
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,200
My moment of criminal genius.

1130
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,860
Have Batman and Robin found the end of the pipe?

1131
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,940
You're not a nice woman, Catwoman.

1132
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,640
Catwoman, you're not a nice person.

1133
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,240
But am I Eartha Kitt?

1134
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,420
Am I Leanne Merriweather?

1135
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,260
Am I Julie Newmar?

1136
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:43,920
That was a close one.

1137
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,100
For a moment I was scared.

1138
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,980
I was not frightened for a moment, Robin.

1139
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,900
Haven't you ever noticed that we always escape the vicious ensnarements of our underhanded opponents?

1140
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,280
Don't you know why?

1141
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,120
Because we're smarter than they are.

1142
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,700
I prefer to think it's because...

1143
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,060
Because we're pure of heart.

1144
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,520
It's because the script writers are on our side.

1145
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:03,560
Oh.

1146
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,140
Dynamic duo.

1147
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,560
Curses spoiled again.

1148
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,240
And the tar baby of religions?

1149
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,780
Will Dobbs destroy all Gotham City?

1150
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,140
Well, we'll have to wait until next week to find that out, Seekers.

1151
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,840
Because we're not out of a lot of things, but we're out of time.

1152
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,980
And this has been a special extension.

1153
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,560
Strapped onto Bob's Slack time finale.

1154
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,960
And I ask for all you Seekers out there.

1155
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:32,720
And next week, we will have the right, rigid Reverend Mike Rofone,

1156
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,560
who will have to answer to us.

1157
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,800
He was supposed to be here.

1158
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,120
He may be under Philo.

1159
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,020
We'll have to go look in the body room.

1160
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,680
Oh, and they're decomposing.

1161
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,540
How are we going to...

1162
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,900
Philo's so old.

1163
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,920
Hand me those dental records.

1164
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,760
The little trolley car's about to lead to the land of reality.

1165
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:51,660
Quick.

1166
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,140
No.

1167
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:52,700
No.

1168
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,200
No.

1169
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,980
Do we have to go back to reality?

1170
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,480
Reality in the form of that science fiction convention?

1171
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:58,660
Bob Bob's crack house.

1172
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,260
Here's your pipe.

1173
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,920
Bob Wee's crack house.

1174
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,120
And don't let this deter you from doing business with us again.

1175
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,980
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1176
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:22,760
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, send a self-addressed stamped

1177
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,700
envelope to...

1178
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,640
Got your pencil ready?

1179
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:24,960
Yes.

1180
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1181
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1182
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1183
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1184
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1185
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1186
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1187
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960

00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1190
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1191
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1192
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1193
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1194
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1195
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1196
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1197
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1198
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1199
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:24,960


1200
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:54,980


1201
00:54:54,980 --> 00:55:24,980


1202
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:54,980


1203
00:55:54,980 --> 00:56:24,980


1204
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:54,980


1205
00:56:54,980 --> 00:57:24,980


1206
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:54,980


1207
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:24,980


1208
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:54,980


1209
00:58:54,980 --> 00:59:24,980


1210
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:54,980


1211
00:59:54,980 --> 01:00:24,980


1212
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:25,160
