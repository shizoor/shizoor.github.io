1
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,620
And it was the strangest thing.

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,280
It was amazing.

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,080
He turned to Bob.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,920
Did you like it?

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,040
Not much.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:20,900
You're lying.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,240
Maybe he's not.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,520
I know him. Look at his face. He's lying.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,220
And then there was suppressed laughter.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,620
I don't trust him.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,680
Yes, Bob!

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,300
Who else am I talking about?

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,160
This man is obviously a psychotic.

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,300
The third nostril.

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,160
That whistling sound.

16
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,040
All right, Bob is my only hope.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,220
I think he's dangerous.

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,660
But please don't suppose I'm dangerous because I'm unfamiliar.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,380
I ask that you believe in me.

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,440
As what?

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,060
As a friend of yours.

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,020
Your town.

23
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,040
Of all human beings.

24
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,540
That's all I'm taking from you.

25
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,700
Get back here, you devil!

26
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,200
He should be destroyed.

27
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:00,980
Destroyed?

28
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,420
Yes.

29
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,820
For our safety.

30
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,360
So I hear all the gossip, you know.

31
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,100
He got busted by the feds. Numerous guys.

32
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,220
Sure, sure.

33
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,320
Who hasn't?

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,660
Really?

35
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,100
Yeah.

36
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:10,580
Whoa!

37
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,600
That's amazing.

38
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,680
Okay, okay.

39
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,920
Somebody should sue your ass for copyright.

40
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,720
You're under arrest!

41
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,320
You know you're my hero.

42
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,600
I've spent ten years getting ready for this day.

43
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,460
That is, if we don't let...

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,160
The forces destroy us before that time.

45
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,300
What other forces?

46
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,400
Never mind that now.

47
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,660
As if on cue.

48
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,920
I want to go home.

49
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,660
Well, not yet.

50
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,700
I want to go home.

51
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,620
Are you still now?

52
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,680
Help me!

53
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,060
Not later than 7am of July 5th.

54
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:44,740
It's too long.

55
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,240
Why is it too long?

56
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,480
Such nonsense.

57
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,000
Selling things to people who don't want them.

58
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,420
That's how a scam works!

59
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,420
I want to go home.

60
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,400
But please do not.

61
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,660
But this is a scam on a global scale!

62
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,540
Do you f***ing get me now?

63
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,740
And like a child,

64
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,540
Yeah, beautiful.

65
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,160
It's wonderful.

66
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,760
It's good.

67
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,200
put his hands over his ears.

68
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,880
Blah, blah, blah.

69
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,700
I can't wait till that Bob-time train comes around the bend.

70
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,100
Make the man wish he had a third nostril.

71
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,060
Oh, look out, son.

72
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,580
Here it comes now.

73
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,560
I'm a space invader.

74
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,200
I'll be a rock and roll abyss for you.

75
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,500
We stand at a crossroads.

76
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,260
The tenuous slack that a subgenius may occasionally enjoy,

77
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,120
could be rent to shreds at any moment.

78
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,800
For the human puppets of the elder gods continue their senseless plunge into madness and anti-slack,

79
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,240
dragging us and our whole beloved planet ever closer to the brink of destruction.

80
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,020
Be it by the nuclear kiss of Jehovah One,

81
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,600
ecological disaster,

82
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,840
or invasion by hostile aliens.

83
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,440
Which will it be?

84
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,720
Destruction of planet Earth,

85
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,720
or eternal slack under the benevolent rule of the gods?

86
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,060
I don't know. I don't know nothing.

87
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,620
At a time like this, we can't afford the luxury of thinking.

88
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,080
Hey, back off and give Bob some room to think.

89
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,340
You'll get to hear it on the radio one day.

90
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,080
We hear most everything on the radio.

91
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,460
Turn something on. I'm starting to think.

92
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:13,920
Click.

93
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,460
This is a Conor Rad radio alert.

94
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,860
Normal broadcasting will be discontinued for an indefinite period.

95
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,560
Oh, Jesus, when are you gonna cut me some slack, huh?

96
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,740
Does it worry you, Bob?

97
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,420
Yes?

98
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,080
All right.

99
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,500
Yes?

100
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
Bob told me personally he will walk off this show to express himself freely.

101
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,580
Let him walk.

102
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,480
If you wanna make an omelet, you gotta break some meat.

103
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,300
What's going on here?

104
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,700
Gob, you're dead. You're dead. I mean it, Gob. You're dead.

105
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,500
Yes! And then he shut the door!

106
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,220
He can't do you nearly the damage that he did on the radio.

107
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,120
No, he can't.

108
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,080
Bob. Hey, Bob.

109
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,120
Where you going?

110
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,500
I'm gonna get going.

111
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,400
Bob, don't leave me. I'm gonna go.

112
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,740
You're gonna get me out here.

113
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,040
I wouldn't go too deep in the desert if I were you. You might never come back.

114
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,820
In fact, maybe you better stay here with us till it's over.

115
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,080
Sorry, I gotta do this.

116
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,980
You come back here!

117
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,200
You idiot! You can't go down there! You listen to me!

118
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,260
He went into the fields and into the towns and into the suburbs

119
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,340
and gathered together all those who despise pinks, perverts, and perverts.

120
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,600
Silence, you perverts!

121
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:19,880
Bob.

122
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,120
Bob, call for all of those that believe in his power.

123
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,060
Rise up and come to him.

124
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,080
Gather round!

125
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,220
They all turned to him as if they had been waiting for his voice and for that word.

126
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,200
High above!

127
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,180
He was naked.

128
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,420
He's got these eyes that like hypnotize you.

129
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:39,860
Whoa!

130
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,520
And then his thing, it's huge! It's like a rocket ship!

131
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,100
I dig.

132
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,320
Dig!

133
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,460
Time is running out on that big LP called life!

134
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,100
And the greatest disc jockey of them all is gonna come and take it!

135
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,560
Take us by the hand and lead us to the flip side of life called eternity.

136
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,800
Eternity!

137
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,160
I know all things begin and end in eternity.

138
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:10,260
Yeah, but before we groove that final date, before we head for that last eight bars,

139
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,560
we gotta make our peace!

140
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,920
Make it, Daddy!

141
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,660
Make it, Daddy!

142
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,120
Make it, Daddy!

143
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,120
You know I'm gonna make it.

144
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,980
And I want you cats to listen to everything I'm gonna lay on you as of this point.

145
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,560
Number one!

146
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,820
Thou shall not blow thy minds on school nights!

147
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,300
You're a very devout group, where'd you ever find?

148
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,040
I'm on a mailing list. It's the Church of the Month Club.

149
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,200
Number two!

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,740
The pipe.

151
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,080
You're gonna really love this one.

152
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,220
It holds a promise for anyone who smokes.

153
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,840
Will you teach us how to smoke?

154
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,900
Sure I will. Sure.

155
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,220
Can I go first?

156
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,420
First what?

157
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,520
No, Susie!

158
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,320
Shut up!

159
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,220
I hope you're not claustrophobic.

160
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:50,680
Why?

161
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,260
Because it is sinful!

162
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:52,800
Huh?

163
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,700
Well...

164
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,340
Bob's smile vanished.

165
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,560
So I suggest if anybody's holding, drop it.

166
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,120
Drop out.

167
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,460
Ow!

168
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,640
Before the fuzz arrives.

169
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,060
Reveille at 0700 tomorrow.

170
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:05,860
That early?

171
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,120
Three minutes.

172
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,000
Hey, yeah.

173
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,020
We get by.

174
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,020
We get by.

175
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,360
All right, boys, good night.

176
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,880
Next time, Tuesday night.

177
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,680
This day is the one.

178
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,600
Seeing the cards.

179
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,940
I see things.

180
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,680
He sees things.

181
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,020
What things?

182
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,580
Nothing.

183
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,540
I'm just kidding.

184
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:23,540


185
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:23,540


186
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:23,540


187
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:23,540


188
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,500
Is that little rocket ship of yours?

189
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,020
I don't mean that unkindly.

190
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,140
Hey!

191
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,320
My ticket is open-ended, and my work here is never done.

192
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,740
Bob's eyes shot to him swiftly.

193
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,260
He was not smiling.

194
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,080
It's too late for this spooky .

195
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,140
I think it's over.

196
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,420
I'm not gonna go back to bed.

197
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,380
Bob!

198
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,400
Take a social sleep.

199
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,200
Tonight's the night.

200
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,360
Tonight's the night they come.

201
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,360
It's a freak show.

202
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,040
Do you believe in UFOs?

203
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,360
We believe that the alien will come and land on our landing pad that we are going to build.

204
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,340
It's a structure that we're trying to raise funds for.

205
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,180
So far, we have about $17.

206
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:13,080
And there are people, I guess, and they believe that they were abducted by aliens and taken

207
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,320
to Mars or whatever they call their alien planet.

208
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,320
Yeah!

209
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,640
What do you think?

210
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,880
Do you believe in UFOs?

211
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,900
Oh, yeah.

212
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,520
Yes, sir.

213
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,160
Definitely.

214
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,180
They're out there, man.

215
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,840
I've seen them.

216
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,420
I've been out there in Aurora, Texas.

217
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,680
They got them little graves and stuff.

218
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,540
Yeah, I've been out there and, I don't know, I'm planning a trip.

219
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,980
We're going out to like Arizona or something.

220
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Or not Arizona.

221
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,360
What was it?

222
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,220
Yeah, it was Arizona, right?

223
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,680
The Air Force One where they found all that stuff.

224
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,900
I got pictures, man.

225
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,560
I've seen them.

226
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,620
They're out there, man.

227
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,320
And I'm flying in the plane.

228
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,340
I'm always hallucinating, but who really knows what I'm looking at.

229
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,120
You know what I'm saying?

230
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,580
It said July, sir?

231
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:50,980
Yeah.

232
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,820
July, sir.

233
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,700
We can't wait for alien explorers to solve all our problems.

234
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,300
Do you believe in UFOs?

235
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,200
There's no such thing as UFOs.

236
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,840
Boy, I'm really lost now.

237
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,480
Radiation must have affected his mind.

238
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,220
Face it.

239
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,780
He's a mutation of this new atomic world of ours.

240
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,820
I'm no UFO freak, if that's what you mean.

241
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,020
No.

242
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,840
He's a freak.

243
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,080
He's a freak.

244
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,060
He's really a freak.

245
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,420
I don't mean that unkindly.

246
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,560
I like freaks.

247
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,860
That's why I like you.

248
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,140
Shut up, you freak!

249
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,280
Lord, I love freaks.

250
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,900
Freak, freak freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak!

251
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,700
Pretty mistake.

252
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,280
He doesn't like freaks.

253
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:28,620


254
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:28,680
Freaking freaky hoje do you get it?

255
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,700
Tell me!

256
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,700
Freak and freak freak, God

257
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,400
Wake up!

258
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,640
IN INFO

259
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:46,780
Secretary Hampshire

260
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:46,780


261
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,580
On the morning of the 15-

262
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,780
On a certain day called X, the sun came up at 6.45.

263
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,460
This is a Conorrad radio alert.

264
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,760
Set official broadcast on the 5th.

265
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,040
There is no cause for alarm.

266
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,720
Ah, crap, is that the time?

267
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,720
Time to get out.

268
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,180
Logan, the engineer, had known this would be the end of the journey.

269
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,280
7 a.m. July 5th.

270
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,800
David Bowie.

271
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,320
All right.

272
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,980
Come on, give me another hour.

273
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:20,680
Oh!

274
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,260
Rise and shine, rise and shine.

275
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,420
All right.

276
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,960
Bob, get up.

277
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,600
Get up.

278
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,840
Logan stood looking down.

279
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,100
Bob lying casually on the floor, eyes closed,

280
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,440
smile on his face, conscious of nothing but slacking.

281
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,980
Bob, come on, Bob, get up.

282
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:39,940
Bob.

283
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,640
Get up.

284
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,920
Come on.

285
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:43,980
Bob.

286
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:44,980
Bob.

287
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,480
Bob.

288
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,780
Bob.

289
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,240
Bob.

290
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,280
Come on.

291
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,180
No, no, no, no.

292
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,040
Bob.

293
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,200
Oh!

294
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,000
Wake up, Portland.

295
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,580
It's a wonderful day.

296
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,180
The time is 7.

297
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,860
It is later than you.

298
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,360
Oh, of course.

299
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,500
That's just the start.

300
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,940
Is it the fifth?

301
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,840
What time is it?

302
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,040
It's 7 a.m.

303
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,520
What are they cock-a-doodly doing?

304
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,180
Normal broadcasting has been discontinued until after this emergency has passed.

305
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,600
What?

306
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:36,880
What?

307
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,940
What is that supposed to mean?

308
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,220
What?

309
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,760
What?

310
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,100
What?

311
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,160
What's going on over there?

312
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,560
There were spots of the crowd.

313
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,880
It was a sudden stillness like spreading blotches of paralysis.

314
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,460
What are we going to do?

315
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,460
What are we going to do?

316
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,580
What are we going to do?

317
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,560
I'll tell you what's going to happen.

318
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:50,560


319
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,340
gonna do we're all going to die then came the frantic purposeless movement of people

320
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,980
people running out running to one another clattering in the panel

321
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,540
armed forces blocking out the entrances to the city and we will take necessary

322
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,080
precautions to assure nobody leaves until we can contain this pandemic

323
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:20,000
state and county police have set up an effective roadblock diverting traffic

324
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,740
line at the city's most important intersection

325
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,200
keep your radio tuned to this frequency remember there is a traffic plan for the evacuation of the

326
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,340
city all cars in the downtown area must follow the green lights they will lead you out of the

327
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,820
danger area by the quickest route do not try to cross the flow of traffic

328
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,120
civil defense is not apart from normal city functioning

329
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:50,760
not only are we in the middle of the city but we are in the middle of a city that's

330
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,900
surrounded by a whole range of people who are not alone the only people involved in caring for a city

331
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:58,000
in peace are those equipped to care for her in an emergency and when the siren sounds each man knows

332
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,820
his responsibility

333
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,280
and now i would like a brief situation report from all departments on how we stand

334
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,520
at the operation center with time running out

335
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,000
Vaseline.

336
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,380
Oh, my.

337
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,260
Oh, man.

338
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,100
That's ugly.

339
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,700
He did not have to continue.

340
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,700
It's based on fact.

341
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Chief Simpson.

342
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,120
Oh, crap.

343
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,200
It's on fire.

344
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,200
Oh, it's not fair.

345
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,160
Dr. Robert Slack.

346
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,640
We have constructed a mass deanimation facility and have nearly completed cleansing the region.

347
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,520
Witnesses have been located and silenced.

348
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:52,420
Local police have been supplied the misinformation outlined in film RT-514, and it is being distributed to the area citizens.

349
00:12:52,820 --> 00:13:00,680
It has been confirmed that four of these Soviet spies have direct involvement and may be carrying on their work to spread airborne toxins.

350
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,800
These subjects have been captured, and information is being extracted.

351
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,940
I didn't even know about it.

352
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,940
I wasn't aware.

353
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,300
We'll have more updates on that coming up.

354
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,400
But right now, Dr. Bob from the Center of Disease Control has some informative.

355
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,280
Advice for people in the Red Zone.

356
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
Gentlemen, the series of alarming events.

357
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,720
Thank you, Dr. Bob.

358
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,880
Stocked in film RT-515.

359
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,820
Testing, testing, recording.

360
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,840
Everything going fine.

361
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,480
No trouble.

362
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,460
Now, remember, you have to poke your face into that big, soft, pointy thing.

363
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:42,220
And the legions of Argentine army ants are continuing on their incredible journey.

364
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,880
All through the camp, they can be observed.

365
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,060
And, uh...

366
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,540
Welcome to the Hour of Slack number 1500...

367
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,040
Yes, may you be truly slackful.

368
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,360
And refreshed unto slack.

369
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,100
Broadcasting from beautiful Wisteria Community Campground.

370
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,540
This at Tarzan's radio station.

371
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,960
Nestled in the heart of the...

372
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,380
Southern Ohio tropical wilderness.

373
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,600
Says something is not working here.

374
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
Something is wrong.

375
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,680
Something is very wrong here.

376
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,160
Something is dreadfully...

377
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,860
Something has happened.

378
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:30,340
I'm sure we all remember where we were, whatever we were doing on that moment of that day.

379
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,000
Now we got...

380
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,800
Now am I coming through?

381
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,300
November 22nd, 1963.

382
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,780
When C.S. Lewis died at home in bed.

383
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,260
Timing.

384
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,900
Nobody noticed.

385
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:43,940
Yes.

386
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:44,700
Yeah.

387
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,860
All right, Dr. Howell, it's now time to pick the show background music.

388
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,180
Nooooooooooo.

389
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,660
I don't know if I can hear what...

390
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,240
Let me see it.

391
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:54,960
Well, we all...

392
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,700
Yeah, we're...

393
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,080
Today we choose from Exotic Lounge.

394
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,500
Oh, that's always good.

395
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,180
Oh, no.

396
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,200
Sleaze music.

397
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,160
Yeah.

398
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:02,760
Mm-hmm.

399
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,120
Yep.

400
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,060
Exotic Lounge.

401
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,700
Yeah, that's...

402
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,600
That's pretty good.

403
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,200
That might be good for having Susie.

404
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,660
Yeah.

405
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,600
That'll go with Susie.

406
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,300
And then we can swing back to...

407
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:10,700
It's always better to have me when...

408
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,160
The mole people and...

409
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,280
Exotic Lounge music.

410
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,920
...other exotic treats.

411
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,880
Yes, the mole people themselves were...

412
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,740
I think better when I get my hands involved.

413
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,780
...chumps, let's face it.

414
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,800
Exploited underground workers, essentially.

415
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,140
Unionize!

416
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,840
There we go.

417
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,300
Okay.

418
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,720
Wear your union suit whenever possible.

419
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,580
I can edit out the dead air.

420
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,420
That's no problem.

421
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:34,860
Dah!

422
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,200
We're not...

423
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,980
We're not too...

424
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,280
You're gonna edit out the whole thing?

425
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,740
...to the internet.

426
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,520
Well, you could replace it with a synthetic...

427
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,300
...uh...

428
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,120
...analog.

429
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,140
Have you...

430
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,780
Have you managed to replace us yet?

431
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,980
No, we're still...

432
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,900
I'm still loading the replacements.

433
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,760
If you weren't spending all your time with Monster Hunter,

434
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,180
you could have digital analogs...

435
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,400
Screw that.

436
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,540
...of Dr. Howl and Lonesome Cowboy Dave and...

437
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,700
Digital analog?

438
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,640
Yeah.

439
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,680
I've already had digital analog with those guys.

440
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,480
They're not that hot.

441
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,880
He's, uh, just...

442
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,320
She's saying that you could, uh...

443
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,500
You didn't take your time...

444
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,520
...create, uh, artificial avatars representing us all...

445
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,140
...and put them through... Mm-hmm.

446
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,140


447
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,420
...through their drill, if that was your fancy.

448
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,060
That's how I usually do, for sure. I'm nothing but stick.

449
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,980
It comes around.

450
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,500
Yeah.

451
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,460
Yeah. You can hear it.

452
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,220
I can hear it.

453
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,500
Recording.

454
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,420
Everything going...

455
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,080
Oh, we did that.

456
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,300
Uh...

457
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:24,820
Why?

458
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,500
I'm... I'm like one.

459
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,260
Well, uh, today is the...

460
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,340
...first of July...

461
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,520
...and, uh, the full of the moon...

462
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,060
The first day of the end of your life. ...is tonight.

463
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,800
The moon will be completely full at night, and, uh...

464
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,720
...tonight here at Caffeena's, uh, your...

465
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,300
...Camp Reverend Andrew Genis is going to perform...

466
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,640
...and I will support her in some small way...

467
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,120
...right here on our wisteria stage.

468
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,460
Don't forget that after that, from 10 o'clock on...

469
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,620
...open mic...

470
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,660
...preaching...

471
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,320
...bands jamming...

472
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,300
...screeching...

473
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,180
...shouting...

474
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,260
...and various types of...

475
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,340
...loud sonic disturbances...

476
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,380
...together...

477
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,540
...with parties at various camps.

478
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,180
I did bring a knife to open mic this time.

479
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,680
An open mic?

480
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,740
Yeah, which one? Who's Mike?

481
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,640
I'm more interested in the open leg, uh, session.

482
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,040
That's... that one.

483
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,700
Is that performed by Yogini's Stang?

484
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,760
We do get the open mouth knife.

485
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,780
That's all... that's a given.

486
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,600
Yes, the mouth of fate...

487
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,480
...ever yawns wider...

488
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,240
...to engulf us all. If you're lucky, it's just words coming out.

489
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,340
Well, uh, radio listeners, once again, we're doing this show, uh, completely in the nude.

490
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,180
Mm-hmm.

491
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,460
Although we have a tablecloth to hide the lower parts.

492
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,300
Mm-hmm.

493
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,580
And you'll just have to imagine that part.

494
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,160
Hey, you gotta leave something for the buying public.

495
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,300
Ah, they can restore it digitally themselves.

496
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,160
They also are digitally adroit, and they can't keep their digits off these various mechanisms.

497
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,920
Feels so good when they stop. Why should they?

498
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,040
Well, also, it feels good when they continue, so, uh...

499
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,500
...one must simply roll with it, uh, and...

500
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:10,860
Mmm.

501
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,160
...slide down this easy channel.

502
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,960
I like fiddling with these machine buttons.

503
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:24,080
No fumbling under the sheets, uh, but why not? I mean, fumbling under the sheets is fun, so I'm...

504
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,660
Fumbling rumbling.

505
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:32,400
So, anyway, here we are, and it's a beautiful day, with temperatures hovering in... what's the problem?

506
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,820
I'm not sure I'm here. I'm not seeing... I'm not see... I'm getting...

507
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,880
My voice is coming off of your mic.

508
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,520
What happens if I...

509
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,900
Test, test. Oh, there I go.

510
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,580
There, now we've got the manly stang back again.

511
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh, oh, now I understand.

512
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,040
No...

513
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,340
Hal is on mic one, and I'm on mic two.

514
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,740
Well, well, well, isn't that interesting? I should have engineered it better, but I failed!

515
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,340
There...

516
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,120
...I tell you...

517
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,800
...is a destiny that shapes men's ends.

518
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,780
It's a lie, it's a quench or...

519
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,340
...rough-hue them how they may.

520
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,240
Okay, this should work.

521
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,880
Uh, so...

522
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,240
Now that it's working...

523
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,440
Yes.

524
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,560
...and everything's going fine, we're recording...

525
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,420
Recording everything going fine.

526
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,500
...yeah, I'm gonna bring you back a piece of green cheese that, uh...

527
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:15,900
Yeah.

528
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,080
...you've been wanting, and, uh...

529
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,940
...this show is on the go. I mean, it's crackling with energy.

530
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,640
Oh, it's bleeding just as well.

531
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,980
One doesn't know where it will lurch and veer next.

532
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,040
Uh, it's pitching and yawing all over the nuosphere.

533
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,220
But, uh, there are many matters that we could discuss.

534
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:42,660
Uh, for example, the, uh, uh, Hitler testicle song that we sang the other day has been

535
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,300
augmented by recent research, and now we have, uh, verse two...

536
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:47,900
Wow.

537
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,180
...of, uh, this historic patriotic song, which...

538
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,620
You might want to remind them of verse one, since they're all asleep...

539
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,220
You can't overdo history.

540
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,140
...in shows most of the time.

541
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,480
Oh, well.

542
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,580
That, this is for people listening in the future, not people in the present who are

543
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,000
not listening.

544
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,720
So, to those attentive ears...

545
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,200
Uh-huh.

546
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,400
...I say, uh, it was, uh...

547
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,580
Hitler has only got one ball.

548
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,040
Goering has two, but very small.

549
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:20,380
Himmler is somewhat similar, but poor old Goebbels has no balls at all.

550
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,960
Rommel has four or five, I guess.

551
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,420
No one's quite sure about Rudolf Hess.

552
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,800
Schmeling is always yelling, but poor old Goebbels has no balls at all.

553
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,020
Oh, that's beautiful and historically accurate, too.

554
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,220
Oh, that's beautiful and historically accurate, too.

555
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,660
The rarely heard second part of the Hitler one-ball song.

556
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,780
And one can see why.

557
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,660
The rhyme scheme is imperfect, and the scansion is highly questionable...

558
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,320
Oh.

559
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,860
...in this piece of folk art.

560
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,840
As G. Gordon Gordon once pointed out, I have one ball like Hitler.

561
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,120
And one like Stalin!

562
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,460
Ha ha ha ha ha!

563
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,460
Ha ha ha ha ha!

564
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,800
So you could make that fashionable, simply because it was your particular designation.

565
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,240
And you're always Putin.

566
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,860
That's right.

567
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,080
Well, I can almost hear everything with these special blue headphones.

568
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,520
After all, Hitler himself said...

569
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,300
I'm gonna buy blue headphones from now on.

570
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,140
I think mine are blue, too.

571
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,560
Now, we were talking about balls, and those are kind of bluish.

572
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,240
I wound up here with a bunch of blue balls.

573
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,360
By accident.

574
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,240
Really?

575
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,080
No, Sherlock. Yeah.

576
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,520
Bouncy mofos.

577
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,020
A bunch of blue balls?

578
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,780
Blue balls. I'm sorry, I already...

579
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,660
I already cussed, didn't I?

580
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,240
No, that's okay.

581
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,320
I try to be good.

582
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,340
No, you don't.

583
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,280
Yes, I do.

584
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,600
Well, then you're falling down on the job, Reverend.

585
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,360
I'm totally unable to, so it's the same effect, though. So you may as well say yeah.

586
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,500
Now, uh...

587
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,120
Reverend Susie the Flusie is not supposed to be good. Well, good at things, yes.

588
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,520
Yes, of course she's... I understand she's very good.

589
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,580
I'm conflicted.

590
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:59,600
Now, tonight at 11.30 a.m., to continue our trip through the schedule...

591
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,480
Tonight?

592
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,780
The, uh, uh, ones...

593
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,120
How is he pink?

594
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,640
Hit wonders.

595
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:12,520
Uh, we'll play at the Mediocre Monster Matinee, uh, starting with Larry Hagman in Beware the Blob.

596
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,140
Wow.

597
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,640
I think that's the one also with Godfrey Cambridge, you know. It has some good things about it.

598
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,060
And, uh, Larry Hagman was at, uh, Burning Man a few years ago. Now he's...

599
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,280
Really?

600
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,700
No longer on this planet.

601
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,320
Wow.

602
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,180
You say Larry was at Burning Man?

603
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,460
Daniel Cameron starring Roddy McDowell, uh, Dr. Faustus, the Richard Burns.

604
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:35,200
The first Burton, uh, version, which also features Elizabeth Taylor as...

605
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,420
Oh, but, but Richard Burton is, is Faustus in this.

606
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,700
Uh, he, uh, he does the whole thing. It's practically a monologue.

607
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,760
The brakes are off.

608
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,720
And he has the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium.

609
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:58,920
Then we have Human Highway starring Dean Stockwell with an appearance by Neil Young.

610
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And the D-Faus.

611
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,280
And the D-Vos.

612
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,240
And the D-Vos.

613
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,440
And...

614
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,500
And Boojie Boy is in this film.

615
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,400
Dennis Hopper.

616
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,640
And Dennis Hopper.

617
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:07,800
Dancing.

618
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:14,600
It's all being shown tonight. Yeah, Dennis Hopper dances in this film, followed by The Telephone with Rip Torn.

619
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,380
Oh my God!

620
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:21,000
And concluding the evening, The Room with Tommy Wiseau. That's, uh, Grindhouse...

621
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,300
Wait, that would be, that would be the phone call of the Nelson Lyon movie.

622
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,140
Grindhouse 2015...

623
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,040
My God, that was amazing.

624
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,980
...shows this entire mediocre monster matinee for your...

625
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,600
...your pleasure and entertainment tonight, starting at 11.30 a.m.

626
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,880
That's down in the dingly dell where my inner spoiled child reigns.

627
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,400
The Grindhouse.

628
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
The Grindhouse.

629
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,040
Buldada uber alles, it says on the poster.

630
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:52,140
That's right. It constantly occurs here at X-Day for your delectation and information.

631
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,020
Ah, I see.

632
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,120
So, don't miss it.

633
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:59,120
Notice, uh, we, over at the registration table, we have some new inductees.

634
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,900
Fresh meat.

635
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,360
They're now having their special, uh, bracelets welded on and so forth.

636
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,600
The electro-stimulo-negative-reinforcement wristband...

637
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,520
Right.

638
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:16,340
...which prevents you from leaving. It won't activate unless you leave, and then it'll tighten up and cut your hand off.

639
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:22,620
Not responsible for malfunctions in cases of ball lightning and other acts of God and the devil.

640
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,620
Blue ball lightning?

641
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,400
That's the best kind.

642
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,100
It's in your subgenius charter. Paragraph four.

643
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,880
I just signed. I didn't read.

644
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:38,540
They're, uh, checking in rev- that's Reverend 80 they're checking in, and you know what Reverend 80 has that I have besides that disease?

645
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,320
Uh, well, what, uh, Stang? Don't, uh, keep us on 10-

646
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,840
He's got a- he's got a Nintendo 3- new 3DS in his pocket with a copy of Monster Hunter on it.

647
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,780
Boring.

648
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,400
So, I'm gonna quit this show and go play Monster Hunter now, okay, you guys?

649
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,760
Sit your ass down here. You're the hot-

650
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,620
Reverend, uh-

651
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,060
You're the sacred scribe. What are you doing?

652
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,540
I'm going over the hill.

653
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,560
Reverend MacFacfas is also bringing similar equipment.

654
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:08,880
I can never pronounce his name right, but he sure is a nice boy, and he's got a hot wife.

655
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,760
Which I always- I always liked that combination, nice boy, hot wife. We got a lot of those here.

656
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,220
I have the hot wife.

657
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,340
Oh, there's lots of hot wives.

658
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,880
My son is a nice boy.

659
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,860
But are you truly a nice boy?

660
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,700
Are you not a nice boy for Bob in your way?

661
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:26,900
Nice boys.

662
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,040
That's not part of my job to say.

663
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
I don't know the description actually, Dr. Al.

664
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,400
Okay, I was just inquiring.

665
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,320
No, I don't have to be a nice- I have to pretend to be nice sometimes. That's what I'm doing right this minute!

666
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,520
Oh, I know, I know.

667
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:48,980
Pretending to be nice! I walk around and when I see a new subgenius, I walk up and introduce myself and introduce them to people.

668
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:56,760
And then I trick them into going back into one of those sweat lodges with me, and then I do things to them.

669
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,480
Bob taught me how to make them not remember.

670
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,280
We've learned to walk around the bodies in the morning.

671
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,660
What makes you think they don't remember?

672
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,880
They never talk about it anymore.

673
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,180
Mine remember.

674
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,220
Because otherwise they'd brag about it.

675
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,040
Uh, they- I don't know if they do that.

676
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,680
That's one of those repressed memories that comes back and you choke the chicken to it.

677
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:24,820
Those aren't accepted in court anymore. Those returning repressed memories. Actually, they are in England. That's a shame.

678
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,360
I like to think I've given a few.

679
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,660
All we know is that Bob came and did something to all of us.

680
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,260
That's true.

681
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:39,380
It started happening when we wound up sleeping in a campground. What are the chances of that?

682
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,700
It's like a slasher movie, but with our butts.

683
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,220
Dove-like Bob brooded on the vast abyss and made it pregnant.

684
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,560
Ow, my pregnant abyss.

685
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,540
During the night.

686
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,740
Anubis?

687
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,740
Or an orb.

688
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:56,740


689
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,240
An old abyss.

690
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,900
What's wrong with the old one?

691
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,980
Nothing. It is the formless chaos that existed before all being.

692
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:15,460
The primordial mixture of farmers, telephone poles, scrambled eggs, animal fuels, griffins, garbage cans.

693
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,480
And we're going to make it that way again on X-Day.

694
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,300
We're going to make a tincture out of it.

695
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,480
We're going to start the world over again. Bring it back to its natural, pristine state.

696
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,400
Turn it upside down.

697
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,000
Before the oceans were formed.

698
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,820
Scrape the shit off it and give it back to the Indians.

699
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,600
That's an indelicate way of putting it.

700
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,720
Well, that's the old way of phrasing that paradigm.

701
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,020
Not original with me, I assure you.

702
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,580
You know, I just thought of something.

703
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,440
The Earth is going to be destroyed, mostly by subgeniuses, deliberately.

704
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,720
Aside from the stuff that we say.

705
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,000
We're hoping.

706
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,380
Are we really going to kill it?

707
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,620
We're going to kill the poor Indians.

708
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,400
Native Americans.

709
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,040
You know what?

710
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,780
They have been, they have gotten the bad end of the stick for so long.

711
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,100
We're getting toward X-Day now, so we might as well be a little more honest and say,

712
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,740
subgeniuses will destroy the Earth about as well as subgeniuses do anything.

713
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,880
And the Indians are going to be just fine.

714
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,380
I guess they don't have much to worry about.

715
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:16,780
Yes.

716
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,460
We'll probably forget.

717
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,300
Whatever way they go, they'll be free.

718
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,860
Besides, our world will be better.

719
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,720
We'll have all the good stuff.

720
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:27,740
Yeah.

721
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,700
I always wanted to live in a teepee.

722
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,060
Well, don't let me hold you back.

723
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,640
Now, you know, you can, I've stayed twice at the Wigwam Motel in Cave City, Kentucky.

724
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,040
Oh, a wigwam.

725
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,040
There's only three of them left.

726
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
I'm clear for programmatic architecture.

727
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,080
Oh, man.

728
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,320
It's really, really cool and cheap.

729
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,420
Fifty bucks a night.

730
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,960
Well, how much are they going to charge you to stay in a wigwam?

731
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,840
Well, one of the things.

732
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,800
The two nights that we stayed in that place, it was like a real wigwam because a terrible

733
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,000
tornado came through and shut off all the power everywhere in town.

734
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,680
Take that, Pindarikoyi.

735
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,120
So it was cold and we had to light a little fire on top of the bed to warm ourselves.

736
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,060
Yeah, that's a true wigwam experience.

737
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,240
Couldn't get on the internet.

738
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,280
That's, of course, you could barely live through that.

739
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,380
Yes, the Native Americans couldn't get on the internet in their day.

740
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,800
Well, they used smoke signals.

741
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,520
It took a lot of smoke to make a porno JPEG.

742
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,980
That was a lot of digital smoke signals.

743
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,000
But all you need is just a one and a zero.

744
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,860
Well, there you have it on a cloudy, windless day.

745
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,740
Didn't we find a number lower than zero?

746
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,460
So this is like X day zero that zero?

747
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,980
So it's bound to work?

748
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,080
Zero minus X day zero minus zero.

749
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:52,920
Yeah.

750
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,440
X day null zero minus zero.

751
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,640
You just keep taking zero away from zero forever.

752
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:04,920
My method, my method, Maddox, but Tater, Tater knows that kind of stuff.

753
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,140
Yeah.

754
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,180
I leave that to him.

755
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,280
Too bad Tater isn't here.

756
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,260
I don't have to think about numbers.

757
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,900
Boy, he said a great line the other day.

758
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,720
He did?

759
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,240
Yeah.

760
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,940
Your slack ends where Bob's fist begins.

761
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,080
I'm not sure how to take that, but it sounds good.

762
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:20,640
Oh, it does.

763
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,740
That's one of the classics right there.

764
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,640
That's the immovable object.

765
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,640
Spontaneously spouted and thus irrevocably accurate and true.

766
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,180
I saw Tater.

767
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,620
I see Tater every now and then in different supermarkets.

768
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,680
He was in line in front of me.

769
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,060
Every supermarket has Tater, isn't it?

770
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,980
And Slave and Save just about three weeks ago.

771
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,100
I don't think he recognized me.

772
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,560
Wow.

773
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,820
He was impatient with the slowness of the girl.

774
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,180
Well, maybe when he's in the Slave and Save, he's incognito.

775
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,280
First time I met him, I had to stay blindfolded.

776
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,720
He's in mufti, as it were.

777
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,360
I've seen him drive by many times.

778
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,100
You know Tater when you see him.

779
00:30:59,260 --> 00:30:59,520
Yeah.

780
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:04,860
A guy with a name like Tater Gumphries can only look one way.

781
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,660
And he always has those blue overalls on.

782
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,060
Are you sure our background music is playing as high as it should be?

783
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,660
When I checked last night, it was just a hair hot.

784
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,260
Yes, but we should be able to hear the drumming.

785
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,620
The dreamy sounds of the lounge.

786
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:22,980
Testing.

787
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,740
Testing.

788
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,980
Yes, the lounge band playing the tiki cocktails on the table.

789
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,480
The dim light.

790
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,080
Oh, yeah.

791
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,320
Where's the sleazy hooker music?

792
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,720
How do you pronounce the name of this song?

793
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,580
Miserlew.

794
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,440
Miserlew.

795
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,320
Miserlew, yeah.

796
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,220
I'm going, someday I'm going to do a show of nothing but versions of that.

797
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,940
The amino acids play a really fast thrash version of that.

798
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,820
I love doing that.

799
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,440
When I did that, I went up to Reverend Angry Larry, who's their road manager.

800
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,660
I said, don't they owe royalties on that?

801
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,340
And he looked at me for a minute and then said very strongly, no.

802
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:03,720
Bob!

803
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,160
Bob blew himself.

804
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,860
Bob just blew over.

805
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:14,520
Well, yeah, that beat up, toothless Bob head has just hit the dust because it's windy here,

806
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:14,760
friend.

807
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,560
It's been beaten around before.

808
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,380
You may be able to hear the wind.

809
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,020
Now it knows how I feel.

810
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,800
I know.

811
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,380
Yeah, we've all been had by Bob.

812
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,740
And they smashed a big bite out of his skull, too, it looks like.

813
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:37,100
Something bit a shark-sized bite out of Bob's skull on that particular dobsail.

814
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,720
Maybe Bob is like Dorian Gray.

815
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,520
Yeah.

816
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:48,020
He doesn't age, but obviously the ones that we've been carrying out here at the campgrounds.

817
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,580
No, I think it's us.

818
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:49,780
It's us.

819
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,840
The image is never with.

820
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,140
Well, I know it's us.

821
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,200
That's how he's keeping young.

822
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:54,720
Oh, yeah.

823
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,740
He's sucking my soul away.

824
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,820
His slack comes from somewhere.

825
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,380
Hey, I'm getting sucked from somewhere.

826
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:00,660
Look.

827
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:06,800
Maybe like Tarzan, Bob had some immortality treatment somewhere along the line.

828
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,900
So he never did bother to get old.

829
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,960
Well, let's see.

830
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:18,360
The three of us have each been doing different broadcast radio subgenius shows.

831
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,400
How does...

832
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,840
Two a week.

833
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,440
And, yeah, it takes a bit out of you.

834
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,260
How many decades have you been doing it, Susie?

835
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,560
21 years.

836
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
21 years.

837
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,980
This October will be the 30th anniversary of the Hour of Slack.

838
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,280
It takes something out of you.

839
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,580
It does something to you.

840
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,780
It does something to you.

841
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:43,220
And what became the Puzzling Evidence Show actually started in June of 1982.

842
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,420
It keeps you alive while it sucks your life away.

843
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,340
Although it was ostensibly...

844
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,140
It's still Bob Nelson's show.

845
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,220
But you see, it started to become...

846
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:59,540
Puzzling Evidence and Gary, your broke friend, and Lies and Hal just kept showing up.

847
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,440
Per gradus ad ima.

848
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:08,220
Eventually, Bob Nelson faded away and went off to mine for gold.

849
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,840
He's still performing his alchemical experiments in the desert.

850
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,100
He really is an alchemist, isn't he?

851
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,640
Yes, he is.

852
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,460
He's the last of the alchemists, practically.

853
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,380
Yep.

854
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,520
But he listens...

855
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,540
He listens to my show.

856
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:25,040
Every now and then, he communicates with it.

857
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,860
So, he faded away, but not completely.

858
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,220
In a way, he was ahead of all of us because he retired soonest.

859
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,280
Well, he moved on to woods and pastures new.

860
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,060
To new adventures.

861
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,020
To stud.

862
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,120
No, seriously, doesn't he mine for something?

863
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,160
Well, he's...

864
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,720
Alien gold in Death Valley or something like that.

865
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,900
He's got minerals that he needs.

866
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,500
He has certain...

867
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:55,000
He has certain properties, and he's even, in his enthusiasm, sent me crystals and things,

868
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,180
but I don't know what they are.

869
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,240
I know what kind of crystals Bob Nelson is sending.

870
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,640
You know, I wish he had brought some.

871
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,320
They're not like that cocaine candy.

872
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,080
And by the way, that stuff is good, I think.

873
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,000
I do like it.

874
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,080
It's tangy.

875
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:10,740
Tangy.

876
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:10,960
Yeah.

877
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,360
It does make your mouth just very slightly numb.

878
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,200
I wouldn't mind it downing another one of those things.

879
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,780
It can't possibly.

880
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,360
It can't possibly really have cocaine in it.

881
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,820
It is coca leaf flavored candy.

882
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,280
Yeah, that's right.

883
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,860
The fact that you can buy it online from New York.

884
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,080
Afterdudes have already chewed all the good stuff out.

885
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,120
Perfectly harmless.

886
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,620
Made from the coca plant.

887
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,880
I think it's got guarana in it.

888
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,380
It's like a sucret.

889
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,420
That's what it's like.

890
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:39,360
It's quite refreshing, especially in midday under the burden of so...

891
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:39,760
Thank you.

892
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,640
Of so many other things.

893
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,560
They have hexachloroquine.

894
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,840
A little bit of cocaine candy can keep you going.

895
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,320
See how I keep these people talking?

896
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,480
You can if you have the...

897
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:48,660
He makes a...

898
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:48,760
He makes a...

899
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:48,760


900
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:48,760


901
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,960
Suck terrible things and we don't shut up.

902
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,920
Whoever made these packages...

903
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,420
It's like Mr. Ed and the peanut butter.

904
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,960
Some enemy of mankind.

905
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,900
Yeah, it's true.

906
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,480
I bought this candy called...

907
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,020
It's all in Spanish.

908
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,240
There's no caramelo.

909
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,960
Producto de Peru.

910
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,580
Holy cow.

911
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,480
I will...

912
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,140
Peruvian...

913
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,420
No.

914
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:16,960
Peruana.

915
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,120
Peruvian marching candy.

916
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,660
For some reason.

917
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,960
Producto Peruana.

918
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,280
Finally got it open.

919
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,500
My vision is weak.

920
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,660
As it can't be caramel because it's green.

921
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,140
As green as the Amazon jungle.

922
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,260
It's a sucret.

923
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,400
It's like a squashed flat sucret.

924
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:36,380
Kind of ovoid instead of round, but it's got that institutional green color.

925
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,420
And it tastes sort of like a hospital cleanser.

926
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:48,640
The green of light filtering through leaves of the forest canopy where all creatures strive for existence against each other.

927
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,120
I think we had Ema Sumac in the background there.

928
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,540
Wow.

929
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,080
That's a good, nice coincidence.

930
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,180
Isn't she a Peruvian goddess or...

931
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,160
I heard she was Amy Camas from, what, Patterson, New Jersey?

932
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,360
Now we're really getting syncretism here.

933
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,040
Yeah, that's Ema Sumac backwards.

934
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:09,880
Let's not run down New Jersey because we only hear about the bad parts of it, and it's actually the garden state.

935
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,780
Incredibly beautiful and verdant.

936
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,260
But whatever, she made wonderful sounds.

937
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
Isn't that what counts?

938
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,240
She sure did.

939
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,620
Yeah, she made high yipping, several octaves.

940
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,140
Above what is expected.

941
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,500
She could hit E above high treason.

942
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:28,200
And she could certainly yodel and ululate with the best of them on her many best-selling albums.

943
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,360
At the top of her tongues.

944
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,360
The hippies used to play her albums.

945
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:41,300
Hey, I'd like to hear her sing with Captain Beefheart and Nina Hagen, but...

946
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,440
Well, throw in Tiny Tim and Huey Herman.

947
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,760
If that happened, we're going to have to kill Nina Hagen on July 5th.

948
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,640
Because she's still alive.

949
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,200
She's still alive, right?

950
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,700
I think.

951
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,520
Yeah, I think Nina's still around.

952
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,440
Oh, no, everybody's been dying.

953
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,240
Who's left?

954
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,480
David Osman and Phil Proctor.

955
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,840
Yes, half of Fireside Theater.

956
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,060
Where is Philo?

957
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,760
Half of our heritage.

958
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,980
How many bullets would it take to...

959
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:17,260
Susie, perhaps you saw that James Horner, the movie composer, crashed his airplane and died.

960
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,640
Yeah, he kissed me.

961
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,060
On the canyon floor, I heard.

962
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,980
But Harrison Ford crashed his airplane and didn't die.

963
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,860
Oh, so now, what's the joke?

964
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,680
What was the last thing that went through James Horner's mind?

965
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,760
Some piece of music from one of the movies.

966
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,460
The airplane engine.

967
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,480
Oh.

968
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,420
Weep, weep, wep, wep, wep.

969
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,560
That was originally a John Denver joke.

970
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:42,820
Yeah.

971
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,000
What was the last thing that went through John Denver's mind?

972
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,980
His plane's engine.

973
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,440
Weep, weep, wep.

974
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:48,920
Weep, wep, wep.

975
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,480
Was that a disgruntled pilot?

976
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,500
Yeah.

977
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,160
Boy, that was a Santa got my letter moment.

978
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,420
That was a thigh slapper if I ever heard one.

979
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,720
Somebody stopped me before I laughed myself to death.

980
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,600
Yeah, you may need it.

981
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,560
I try to stop short of AM radio.

982
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,780
This little whistle...

983
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,880
We're sophisticates.

984
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,480
...is shaped like big red lips.

985
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,680
Yes, it's the morning zoo.

986
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,440
Nobody would be able to tell the difference, Susie.

987
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,560
I don't know where that's...

988
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:18,740
It's been.

989
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,140
It's been in my mouth, so it tastes like...

990
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,480
Yeah, but before then, it's been sitting on this table

991
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,400
in the middle of a clutch of subgeniuses.

992
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,460
And subgenius items which have been handled by many scurvy subgeniuses.

993
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,100
Who wants some Bob Virus?

994
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,080
We've got Bob Virus for anybody who wants to go...

995
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,160
Spirokeets.

996
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,540
Those derived from the Lyme disease-bearing...

997
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,500
...infectious humor.

998
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,420
...as large as bottle caps that roam the woods.

999
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:54,980
Oh, yes.

1000
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,040
Like a weeping rash.

1001
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,160
The wildlife of Wisteria.

1002
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,260
The Kendi-root toad.

1003
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,520
Those playful and insistent bears.

1004
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:06,720
Face-loving bat, as we say when kids are...

1005
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,140
They respect your face.

1006
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,620
With every ounce of their being.

1007
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,340
The arboreal prairie squid.

1008
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,740
Or forest squid, actually.

1009
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,280
They're not nearly as venomous as the prairie prairie squid.

1010
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,700
But they bite.

1011
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,480
You really have to make sure you de-beak them before you...

1012
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,640
You know.

1013
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:32,820
They is.

1014
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:38,080
I'm sure I don't have to spell out to gaggle a subgenius

1015
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,660
is what you do with a prairie squid.

1016
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,480
Once they're de-beaked, they're a harmless companion.

1017
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,140
It doesn't hurt the squid, really.

1018
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,240
That beak grows back in about two weeks.

1019
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,540
Although, usually...

1020
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:48,540


1021
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,920
After you've done them, you put them out of their misery

1022
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,180
and cook them and eat them.

1023
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:59,420
Oh, I'm going to be during the taco festival on Saturday.

1024
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,040
That's right.

1025
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,920
Let's announce that.

1026
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,420
There is going to be a subgenius taco meat festival on Saturday.

1027
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,000
Taco filling competition and contest.

1028
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:14,440
We will fill tacos with all possible entrails

1029
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,500
and then consume them.

1030
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,820
I brought taco shells.

1031
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,420
I know.

1032
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,480
Which side of the taco I need to be on.

1033
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:24,480
Yes, it'll either be taco apocalypse, taco terror.

1034
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,420
What are you gesturing?

1035
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:25,980
Hey, I'm going to...

1036
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,940
Why don't you guys do the rest of the show?

1037
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,980
Reverend 80 has his 3DS and we could be playing Monster Hunter.

1038
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,020
We could take down the...

1039
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,500
You have a problem, Stang.

1040
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,160
You need to admit you have a problem.

1041
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,540
We can play Monster Hunter and watch Monster High cartoons at the same time.

1042
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,380
It's a good time to do an intervention, Stang.

1043
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,980
Well, we all love monsters.

1044
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,400
I don't know anyone here who doesn't, but...

1045
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,560
Oh, my God.

1046
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,000
Ah.

1047
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,880
Some new kind of Bull Dada.

1048
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,920
Oh, it's Bull Dada eye candy.

1049
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,020
What the...

1050
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:54,220
Uh-oh.

1051
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:54,520
Uh-oh.

1052
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,320
And this will be really good because Reverend 80 is a fine artist.

1053
00:41:59,540 --> 00:41:59,980
Good.

1054
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,500
Well, then that shouldn't be...

1055
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,080
With a very distinctive style.

1056
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,620
Wow.

1057
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,560
These are hand-colored.

1058
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,440
Wow.

1059
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,460
I think, aren't they?

1060
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,260
Too good to sell.

1061
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:10,580
That is amazing.

1062
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,480
That's Bull Dada eye candy.

1063
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,040
My chrome.

1064
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,600
They're like tarot cards of the subgenius.

1065
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:16,860
Newsflash.

1066
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,760
Hey, kids.

1067
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,360
This...

1068
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,680
This show is interactive.

1069
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:27,700
While listening, you can view the amazing Bull Dada eye candy on the web at subgenius.com

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,440
There's a...

1074
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,740
Yeah, there's like a paramecium.

1075
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:46,900
There's a Egyptian thing with pyramids and saucers.

1076
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,560
There's DNA.

1077
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,240
There's a flaming sword.

1078
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:50,600
There's a flaming sword.

1079
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,420
How about that?

1080
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,200
Is that correct?

1081
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,920
We actually have a flaming sword here.

1082
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,920
We can only use once.

1083
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,920
Well, I remember the last time.

1084
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,980
So we have to be careful.

1085
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,960
In the middle of the field where the guar guy had rigged it and it wouldn't go off.

1086
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,560
The flaming sword when we had...

1087
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,840
We had Bob crucified and we wanted to burn him because you have to.

1088
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:14,720
Right.

1089
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,220
Yeah.

1090
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,140
Man, I wish the radio audience could see these.

1091
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,020
These are just amazing.

1092
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,760
Look, the seven-bladed windbreaker.

1093
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,220
They're beautifully made.

1094
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,380
Some other planetary hand colored.

1095
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:23,520
Those are vivid.

1096
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,520
Those are quite beautiful.

1097
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,020
Arteries.

1098
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:27,860
Wow.

1099
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,260
The stark fist of removal.

1100
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,380
Wow.

1101
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,440
A plaid dog's head.

1102
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,500
Checkered bob.

1103
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,820
Rolling pins falling down.

1104
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,080
Salak.

1105
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:37,700
Right.

1106
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,500
As opposed to Sakak, which we always avoid.

1107
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:40,920
Whoa.

1108
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:41,780
Ooh, a stretched out...

1109
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,380
Mr. Sister.

1110
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,200
Yeah, it looks like Mr. Sister.

1111
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,120
A new icon showing Mr. Sister.

1112
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,040
Mr. Sister is now part of the subgenius array of images.

1113
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:52,920
Those are beautiful.

1114
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,860
The cowboy with the H-bomb.

1115
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,300
With the tie-on yippie.

1116
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,980
It's a big dildo now.

1117
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,300
Yippie strap-on.

1118
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,480
Yeah, this is amazing.

1119
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,180
Wow.

1120
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,300
You could tell somebody's future with these cards.

1121
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,800
I wish that the radio audience could see it.

1122
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,100
Whoa, and the hits just keep on coming.

1123
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,900
The live audience is too far away.

1124
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,600
It shows the earth rupturing.

1125
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,120
Whoa.

1126
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,120
You can view the...

1127
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:25,440
The amazing Bull Dada eye candy on the web at subgenius.com slash rev80.

1128
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,840
Pills.

1129
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,800
Pills tonguing each other.

1130
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,420
A flaming pipe.

1131
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:31,960
Wow.

1132
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,260
And the flaming pipe of...

1133
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,860
A vagina-eyeballed hideous alien bob.

1134
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,200
Bob rupturing himself in wonderful ways.

1135
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,260
Fractal bob.

1136
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,460
A fractal bob.

1137
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:40,900
Creeping.

1138
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:41,700
Wow.

1139
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,180
A gray alien.

1140
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,020
Man, this has got everything.

1141
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,180
It's like a...

1142
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,120
The Jehovah One evil eye on the...

1143
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:48,560
On the pyramid.

1144
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,660
And the sacred sigil.

1145
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,960
And he hasn't repeated them, and it's been about 50 so far.

1146
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,680
It's like the loaves and the fishes, but with beautiful...

1147
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,340
There's one of the Magritte's design.

1148
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,880
And it doesn't stink like fish.

1149
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,280
A Celtic knot dob's head.

1150
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,360
And you weren't loafing.

1151
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,720
Oh, look.

1152
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,160
Oh.

1153
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,220
An ultimate...

1154
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,700
A robot Maria dob's.

1155
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,560
Smoking a pipe.

1156
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,840
Yeah, Maria the robot from Metropolis with a pipe.

1157
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:13,320
A possum.

1158
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,040
A possum.

1159
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,100
A hideous...

1160
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,760
A psychedelic possum.

1161
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,260
A mighty...

1162
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,120
A mighty...

1163
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:18,860
A marijuana plant.

1164
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,520
These are rendered in a really psychedelic style.

1165
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,860
They're so vivid.

1166
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,960
A toy robot.

1167
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,360
Classic toy robot.

1168
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,880
Nice scowling face.

1169
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,380
A cat.

1170
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,560
A robot.

1171
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,220
An evil cat with rays coming out of its eyes.

1172
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,720
And a flying saucer.

1173
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,940
And robot monster.

1174
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:38,280
Robot monster.

1175
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,920
With a volcano behind him.

1176
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,260
And it hasn't repeated yet.

1177
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,220
And yet I cannot.

1178
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,560
And a Dr. Seuss looking character worshipping Satan.

1179
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,120
A goat.

1180
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,060
A whole bunch of Saturns.

1181
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,460
A Flash Gordon type spaceship.

1182
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,460
A monkey.

1183
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,100
Space.

1184
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,000
A green monkey.

1185
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,180
A robo space monkey.

1186
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,500
With his green monkey virus in space.

1187
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,120
And we're finally back to the beginning.

1188
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,260
Back to the Paramecium or slipper animal.

1189
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,660
Well, he brought it all back.

1190
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,060
Surely this is too good for any bulldog.

1191
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,080
Bulldog eye candy.

1192
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,800
40 pieces of visual deprogramming by Reverend 80.

1193
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,840
And this is the only copy.

1194
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:16,860
Wow.

1195
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:17,440
Wow.

1196
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:18,480
Creepers.

1197
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,240
Creepers.

1198
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,420
You better not drop it in a puddle, boy.

1199
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:21,940
Well, right.

1200
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,860
Yeah, it looks like you wouldn't want to get it wet.

1201
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,180
Yeah.

1202
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,880
Maybe you need to get them laminated.

1203
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:27,960
Laminated.

1204
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:28,520
Yeah, yeah.

1205
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,080
Well, we need to get them scanned is what it is.

1206
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,080
Yes.

1207
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,280
Because then they exist forever.

1208
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,700
If you scan them at 300 dpi.

1209
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,280
That sounds so dirty.

1210
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:42,680
Well.

1211
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,700
Subgenius.com.

1212
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,080
Subgenius.com.

1213
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:48,100
Subgenius.com.

1214
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,100


1215
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,100


1216
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,100


1217
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,100


1218
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,100


1219
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,100


1220
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,100


1221
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,100


1222
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,100


1223
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,760
Rev 80.

1224
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:57,960
Well, you know, the subgenius artists being mostly unprofessionals did all their art at 72 dpi for the internet.

1225
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:08,160
And then when you go to try to illustrate your book with that stuff, why, you know, you blow it up to a decent size and it gets all jpeggy and jittery.

1226
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,900
And that's when you have to use this sacred subgenius program called Genuine Fractals.

1227
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,220
It's like Minecraft.

1228
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,480
Yeah, right.

1229
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,000
Right.

1230
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:25,980
In fact, the way that some people design Minecraft things is they'll take a picture or whatever image they want.

1231
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:30,380
And make it a tiny little jpeg and then blow it up real big.

1232
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:40,340
So it turns into a series of blocks and you can count your blocks out and make your giant dildo out in Minecraft or whatever.

1233
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,000
You know.

1234
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,680
It's another time killer.

1235
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,680
Yep.

1236
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,240
And brain mind killer.

1237
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:53,820
But, oh, it's so fun because it doesn't get you ahead in life at all.

1238
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:58,480
It has no purpose besides just pure slack.

1239
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,500
This is all like, this is not the music for this.

1240
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,640
We need something that's peppier.

1241
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,500
Pepp-o.

1242
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:08,280
Yeah, this is all that, you know, lazy.

1243
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,100
The South Seas.

1244
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:10,440
Yeah.

1245
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,220
Tropical Islands.

1246
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,360
What's on Monster Moves?

1247
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,440
This one is Jungle Madness.

1248
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:15,880
I know.

1249
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,220
How about that?

1250
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,080
But it's not nearly mad enough.

1251
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,520
Baba Lou is coming up.

1252
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,940
From island unto island at the gateways of the day.

1253
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:28,300
Desi Arnaz wiped that from another guy whose name escapes me now.

1254
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:33,100
Juan, was it, not Juan Valdez, that was the crazy, uh, Miguel Valdez.

1255
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,080
The coffee maker, yeah.

1256
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:34,860
Picker.

1257
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,260
He totally swiped it.

1258
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,680
Inflection and everything.

1259
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,420
I was, the parts of history that we don't remember.

1260
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,100
Larger constellations burning.

1261
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,360
Mellow moons.

1262
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,700
Moons in happy skies.

1263
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,140
Putting up with Lucy wasn't enough.

1264
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,180
And palms in cluster.

1265
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,100
Knots of paradise.

1266
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,380
I think we used this one the other night at the station.

1267
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,860
You're putting that in a puddle of water.

1268
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,660
We used, uh, themes from sci-fi, fantasy, and horror.

1269
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:02,880
With the mole people.

1270
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,100
The mole people.

1271
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,180
Creature from the Black Lagoon.

1272
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,020
That's the one with Hans J. Salter.

1273
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:07,800
Yes.

1274
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,840
Uh, This Island Earth by Herman Stein.

1275
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,000
Son of Frankenstein.

1276
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:13,800
Oh, oh, oh.

1277
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,080
Oh, oh, oh.

1278
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:15,940
Oh, oh, oh.

1279
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,900
Um, it's not really very frenetic.

1280
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:20,640
Ah.

1281
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,560
Now, I do have, um.

1282
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,280
That other stuff was soporific.

1283
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,320
Heavy metal renditions of Monster Hunter game themed music.

1284
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:28,940
Now that's good.

1285
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:29,560
That's good.

1286
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,640
Music with spikes on it.

1287
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,700
A house of Frankenstein.

1288
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,520
It's also good.

1289
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,600
We used that yesterday.

1290
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,840
Well, let's see what the mole people does for us.

1291
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,380
Yes, what did the mole people ever do for us?

1292
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,520
They gave us moles.

1293
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,000
They gave us Hugh Beaumont.

1294
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:43,860
That's where moles come from.

1295
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,340
Mm-hmm.

1296
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:44,560
Mm-hmm.

1297
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:44,560


1298
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:44,600
Mm-hmm.

1299
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,100
Mm-hmm.

1300
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:45,340
Mm-hmm.

1301
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:45,340


1302
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:45,340


1303
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:45,340


1304
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:45,340


1305
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:45,340


1306
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,060
He's in the mole people.

1307
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:46,740
That's true.

1308
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,260
And Nestor Paiva.

1309
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,300
And he's, he's a shorthand for Pinks when they say, who is that with the pipe?

1310
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:53,620
Right.

1311
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,820
I say, that's the beaver's dad.

1312
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:56,280
Right.

1313
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,200
That's Hugh Beaumont.

1314
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:58,720
And it, it seems.

1315
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,080
Oh, yeah.

1316
00:49:59,080 --> 00:49:59,920
I love that show.

1317
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,860
Uh, oh, Nick Van Dyke.

1318
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,240
Ha, ha.

1319
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,460
Oh, Mark Traill.

1320
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:04,200
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1321
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,160
That's what I used to tell them was it carved on my slack-o-lantern every year.

1322
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,500
Yes, um.

1323
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,960
That made sense to them.

1324
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,360
Also.

1325
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,360
But Bob didn't.

1326
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:14,640
No.

1327
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,540
This is music to trudge through Tibet by.

1328
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,880
On your way to discover the underground kingdom.

1329
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,360
God, this is, this is such sappy crap.

1330
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,360
Of the mole people.

1331
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:29,720
Yes, the mole people, uh, subhuman burrowing servants of ancient Assyrians who have survived

1332
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:37,220
to the present day in lightless underground civilization as the same as it was millennia

1333
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:37,640
ago.

1334
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:41,180
Ah, this is sentimental covered wagon music.

1335
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:41,560
Now.

1336
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,500
But beware.

1337
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,000
Now.

1338
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,900
The mole people can tunnel up under you at any time and drag you down into your, their

1339
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:54,440
tunnels where you will be, apparently, it's not very clear, horribly mutilated by their

1340
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,060
giant shovel-like forepoint.

1341
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,120
In my neighborhood, they mostly get eaten by cats.

1342
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,620
But again, a conspiracy always turns everything around backwards.

1343
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:08,220
That's the way they'd show it in a Hollywood movie, but probably the real mole people are,

1344
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,340
for all we know, they're mole girls.

1345
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,980
And when they drag you down into their roost.

1346
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:12,980


1347
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:13,520
Or mole hole.

1348
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,860
They wanna, you know, do jig-jig.

1349
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,360
Or sex you up.

1350
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,340
Or, you know, mole you out.

1351
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:28,580
Yes, but they're not even human with, uh, conical heads and huge carbuncles and great

1352
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,680
big bulging eyeballs and, uh.

1353
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,120
Urging you to let go.

1354
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,620
Yeah, that's right.

1355
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:40,120
Covered with thousands of hideous, tiny venomous fingers urging you to let go.

1356
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:40,900
Well, I'm not quite there yet, but.

1357
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,020
Urging women to let go specifically.

1358
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:42,840
Well, I'm not quite there yet, but.

1359
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,100
No, you.

1360
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,680
And you.

1361
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,320
And yes, you.

1362
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,280
Let go, baby.

1363
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,560
Just let go.

1364
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,720
The world ends tomorrow and you may die, so it's time to party, baby.

1365
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,260
May?

1366
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:55,820
May?

1367
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,340
Maybe that's it.

1368
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,180
The world ends tomorrow and you will die.

1369
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,860
I want some certainty, dammit.

1370
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:03,100
Only to believe.

1371
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:07,060
No, no, no, no, it's very important that you keep the word may in there, because that gives

1372
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:07,480
you hope.

1373
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,040
Nobody wants to be told they will, everybody's gone.

1374
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,640
No, no, we're not, we're not.

1375
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,820
The idea is that the point is that the point is that the point is that the point is that

1376
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:15,940
the other is the point is for somebody.

1377
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,840
My condition?

1378
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,680
Does it work out?

1379
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,160
For example, if somebody is

1380
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:36,960
You bother people in this kind of situation.

1381
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,580
Quite obviously, they can cast doubt upon that.

1382
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:39,880
You face on thoseú

1383
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:49,180
check for subgenius unless you put it in add to dictionary hey not only do we do

1384
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:55,340
three completely different subgenius shows for years and years and years and

1385
00:52:55,340 --> 00:53:00,720
for no damn good reason not have a life yeah but oh wait what was the other thing I was about to say

1386
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,760
but we actually are three different people yeah yeah there was some other

1387
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,740

00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:34,540
I'm forced well I know you get paid to be a grammar nazi but you are able to do it most people can't

1391
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:39,740

1392
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:40,720

00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:47,220
absolute horse pucky my own father said get used to it language changes it's fluid there's no such

1394
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:52,140
thing as correct Shakespeare spelled his name differently every time he signed it well he's

1395
00:53:52,140 --> 00:54:00,780
mostly like you know who are get out of bad lungs you got really mad when I used that on you yeah

1396
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:05,880
you are old law I got that from two beans and the thing is he was right

1397
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,720
now what is this

1398
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:28,220
this is well now Mont prophets the church is using them knocking i-zuf for presidents

1399
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,060
you're gonna make your little crates but would you let me tell more about that

1400
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:30,060


1401
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:30,060


1402
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:30,060


1403
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:30,060


1404
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:30,060


1405
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:33,320
father this is I will show you first we will be talking about you all right

1406
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:40,720
by about a week

1407
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:40,720


1408
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,400
Everybody's failed apocalypse.

1409
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:43,860
Apparently.

1410
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,720
And Catholicism for dummies, I could use that.

1411
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,980
I really don't know that much about Catholicism,

1412
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,160
aside from what you just sort of pick up.

1413
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,960
You've got to get on your knees a lot.

1414
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,740
You can read the book.

1415
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,160
And then you go to church, and there's even more of that.

1416
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,420
Yeah.

1417
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,240
Yeah.

1418
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:14,220
My son, at the age of 15 or 14 or so, as boys are wont to do,

1419
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,440
they get kind of stupid.

1420
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:19,260
And he said, what happened was he saw that movie,

1421
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,040
Jesus Christ Superstar.

1422
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,360
And like Carter LeBlanc before him,

1423
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,920
he mistook the rock and roll for the religion part.

1424
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,220
It made him feel real good,

1425
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,600
but he didn't understand that what was doing that was the rock and roll.

1426
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,060
So he goes,

1427
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,480
Dad, Mom, I want to try going to church.

1428
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,100
And we immediately go, oh, well, you know, the Unitarians.

1429
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,740
So that's a nice, no, no, no, no.

1430
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,700
I mean a real church.

1431
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,260
Oh, God.

1432
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:50,380
Okay.

1433
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:54,600
He goes, there's a great big fancy Lutheran church down the road from us.

1434
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,780
I want you to drop me off there on Sunday.

1435
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:57,420
Okay.

1436
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,080
Now, of course, I'm like going, oh, Jesus Christ.

1437
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,460
What's going on?

1438
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:04,920
Well, I dropped him off at this Lutheran church,

1439
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,080
big fancy Lutheran church, and picked him up.

1440
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,400
A couple hours later, he got in the car and he goes,

1441
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,160
Dad, I feel like I want to worship Satan now.

1442
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,460
Where'd you take him?

1443
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,080
But that's a Lutheran church.

1444
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,720
Well, after that, you know, I had to go, son,

1445
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,320
Satan's just a made-up character.

1446
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:27,460
Well, rather, he's real, but he and Bob have an understanding.

1447
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,500
The Christians have him all wrong.

1448
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,480
Dog Elves figured that out at six.

1449
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,060
Satan has helped all of us out.

1450
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:34,920
That's right.

1451
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,800
We described that on the last show.

1452
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,440
And Satan dragged me out of that quicksand at the first X day.

1453
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:45,500
He handed Hal a microphone at the last minute on a big performance.

1454
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,040
Yes.

1455
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:50,220
And what did Satan do for you besides, you know, get into your head?

1456
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,360
He dressed me that morning.

1457
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,800
That's all I could ask for.

1458
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,240
So, yes.

1459
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,680
That's why I had the pitchfork and the horns.

1460
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:06,820
You know how the New Agers are accused by ignorant Christians,

1461
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,280
of being Satanists, witches.

1462
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,460
Well, they are witches.

1463
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,980
Isn't everybody they don't like?

1464
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,940
But I was standing, back when Starwood was huge,

1465
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,180
I was standing in front of an audience of hundreds of people, literally.

1466
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,960
And first I read from the flyer that was going around town

1467
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,100
that described Satanic gang signs and symbols and what they meant.

1468
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:35,440
Of course, things like pictures of Mickey Mouse were Satanic.

1469
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,460
I passed.

1470
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,120
It's a huge crowd.

1471
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,400
You'd never have a better cross-section of pagans.

1472
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,340
I said, how many of y'all are actually Satanists?

1473
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,060
Raise your hand.

1474
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:51,640
And one metal dude in the back kind of shyly put his hand up for a minute

1475
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,880
and then pulled it down real quick.

1476
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,580
He was the only one.

1477
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:58,600
He was the only Satanist at the whole damn Wiccan festival.

1478
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,920
Well, Satan is a Christian character.

1479
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,460
If you're a Satanist, you're a kind of Christian.

1480
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,460
But on the other hand, all that's ever been written about,

1481
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,320
about Satanists and those who are demon worshippers,

1482
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,900
has been written by the other side

1483
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:16,220
and may not be dependent upon to be an accurate and unbiased assessment.

1484
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:21,920
Now, I'm given to believe that the guy who wrote the book Satanic Panic,

1485
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,320
whose name I can't remember,

1486
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:28,500
lived in Jamestown, across the lake from Brushwood.

1487
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,440
He should have lived in California to be in the middle of it.

1488
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,480
If you ask me, Satan now lives at Brushwood,

1489
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,540
but I'd rather not get that personal.

1490
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,760
You can ask me about that one later.

1491
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:46,880
Yes, we'll get into that at another time.

1492
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:47,300
Yeah.

1493
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,000
Looks like Ankara.

1494
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,360
Oh, the Tap House crew is here.

1495
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,980
Now I can go play Minecraft and Monster Hunter at the same time.

1496
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,080
Saying you have addiction issues.

1497
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,220
You guys take over the show now.

1498
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,420
He's going down to a street corner to get...

1499
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,520
Just monster crack.

1500
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,140
Hey, we did an hour.

1501
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,360
Do you know what that means?

1502
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,520
That means it's time for me to push the off button

1503
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,020
and then push the on button again.

1504
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:15,500
Uh-oh.

1505
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,520
Friends, you're listening to Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack,

1506
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:22,860
a live pre-recorded show from the...

1507
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:23,400
Live?

1508
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,860
...grounded hysteria in beautiful southern Ohio,

1509
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,920
near Mothman's house.

1510
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:29,560
Yeah.

1511
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,300
He's right over yonder.

1512
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,120
He slept there.

1513
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,460
For more information, you can try subgenius.com.

1514
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,820
And now this is where we fade everything out very professionally.

1515
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,140
Oh, this gets scary and scary.

1516
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,760
Do we have to get dressed again?

1517
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,180
As we dwindle away.

1518
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,040
Well, I'll do the fade out later.

1519
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,780
I really do have to stop this thing now.

1520
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,340
Sire, there is no more money.

1521
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,800
We gotta get some money.

1522
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:01,420
That dirty Turkish harker back flat

1523
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,040
and rotten Philip Buckaburton

1524
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,160
and Herculean Burton

1525
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,240
and Dirk Buston.

1526
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,020
I'm gonna let them all out!

1527
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,280
Beep. Beep.

1528
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:07,400
Beep.

1529
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:08,040
Beep.

1530
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,040


1531
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,040


1532
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,040


1533
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,040


1534
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,040


1535
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,040


1536
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,040


1537
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,040


1538
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,040


1539
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,040


1540
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,580
We're glad you listened to this show

1541
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:12,960
and we're even more glad that some listeners

1542
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,360
have donated enough to help us keep on going

1543
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,900
for another couple of months.

1544
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,780
And not just this show,

1545
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,960
but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1546
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:23,440
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1547
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,440
But if you truly love Bob

1548
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,020
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1549
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:32,900
you should go to subgenius.com front page

1550
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,460
or especially the radio page

1551
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,060
or the...

1552
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,380
catalog store pages

1553
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,800
and help out financially as best you can.

1554
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,300
Now, we know what it's like

1555
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,180
to be on the brink of total poverty

1556
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:46,160
and we don't want any subgeniuses

1557
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,780
to make their own situations worse.

1558
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:50,760
But some of you still have jobs.

1559
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,140
Even five bucks makes a big difference

1560
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:56,120
even if it's only once a month

1561
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,640
from enough of you.

1562
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,040
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1563
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,380
All we're saying is that

1564
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:04,920
blowjob

1565
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,820
could go the way of Steve Jobs

1566
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,860
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1567
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:12,460
We also take checks and money orders to

1568
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,380
Subgenius Foundation

1569
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,460

01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,600
Thanks for anything you can do

1576
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,040
to help let there be slack.

After Complex

1578

Okay on call
