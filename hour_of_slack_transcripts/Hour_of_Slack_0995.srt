00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,100
When you head back to the US from a trip abroad, it's nice to bring back harmful microscopic organisms.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:12,860
So please, make sure you bring back something that's prohibited, like a prohibited agricultural product or prohibited animal product,

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,360
and choose a gift that will never become a bird or animal.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,800
But if you bring back something that's like a bird or animal product, you risk exposing the country to harmful mobs.

5
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,820
Please lead this upgrading process, same as any of the other methods, in a way that will şek mudar, make it harder for you to evolve.

6
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:50,820

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:50,820


8
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,680
In order to avoidpei fail from the last episode

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,720
See you with another explanation.

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,340
listening to this and this was pleasing to god

11
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,860
let me hear those trumpets

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,760
as it can use our offslash

13
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:27,880
it cannot be erased from the mind no matter the strength of godly belief or brainwashing drugs or

14
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:34,460
fear or religion yes yes in the blinding and colorable white light of reality

15
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:40,240
you are but pawns in my game of bulldada world conquest

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,720

17
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,140
people who aren't muslims muslims look at clouds in the name of god the most gracious the most

strapping on a suicide bomb

22
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,120
starts with a b

23
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,340

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,740

Well, isn't that far out and solid and right on, Bob?

64
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,640
When you hear the beat

65
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,780
First time change us

66
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,360
Get involved, everyone

67
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,660
Clap your hands

68
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,900
Join together

69
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,340
Let's have a good time

70
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,340
When I saw

71
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
Had a long white beard

72
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,580
But the big one comes

73
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,060
The big one comes

74
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,820
Brings me the big one

75
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,680
I saw God, he was a vending machine

76
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,260
I can see God in the

77
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,280
God doesn't see us

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,660
Mystic power

79
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,880
Bumbo Jumbo

80
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,640
Bumbo Jumbo

81
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,380
Bumbo Jumbo

82
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,200
Bob criticizes the UN

83
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Blaming the UN for the New York Knicks

84
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,560
He's never looked back

85
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,880
As the intellectual historian John Bigg once said

86
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,620
Our modern culture is in fact unbearable

87
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,480
Even worse

88
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,940
That overman on a new business plan

89
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,060
Has led us to endless philosophers

90
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,520
The goal would seem to be a world

91
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,700
Where uncertainty and doubt aren't right again

92
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,060
You are listening to the subgenius radio ministry

93
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,220
Hour of Slack

94
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,540
Number 995

95
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,680
The tool users

96
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,140
Special for

97
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,540
WeToolSmart

98
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:36,880
The tool users

99
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
With a whole lot of Lee Moore

100
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,760
Like we just heard

101
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,940
And Norell Preff

102
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,980
Like we just heard before that

103
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,480
And a lot more

104
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,940
And that song

105
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,020
With the shotguns

106
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,640
Bob Squad

107
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,860
Was by the great groovy Neptune

108
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,100
And we just met the great groovy Neptune

109
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,140
At Tech's Day

110
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,340
Which was wonderful

111
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,460
There's some pictures at subgenius.com

112
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,080
And the report

113
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,600
It was just marvelous

114
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,380
And there'll be more

115
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:06,800
Of them

116
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,620
The great groovy Neptune

117
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,860
They gave us a Yeti

118
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,320
At the beginning of the show

119
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,080
We heard some Norell Preff

120
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,100
And some Ivan Stang

121
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,500
Baby Ivan Stang

122
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,280
Age 20

123
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,320
As the bozo of Bull Dada

124
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,440
From a sort of a weird introduction

125
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,860
To World of the Future of the Ancient Days

126
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,680
And the intro was

127
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,180
Lee Moore and Lee Moore

128
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,480
And silica gel

129
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,040
Remember?

130
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,940
And we've been getting some interesting stuff in the mail

131
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,140
One thing was a CD from Birmingham, Alabama

132
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,640
By something called Atomic Jefferson

133
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,160
And also from Just John

134
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,220
Just John is in the background

135
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,440
But let's check

136
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,660
This song here by Atomic Jefferson

137
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,400
At Earthlink

138
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,520
You'll never be alone again

139
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,360
And you'll never be alone again

140
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,360


141
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,360


142
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,460
Surfing on the net

143
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,440
They're watching all you see

144
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,760
And keeping tabs on people that you meet

145
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,880
They track all your movements on a cookie sheet

146
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,120
And have the files you download from the net

147
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,200
When you use encryption

148
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,480
They will forge your keys

149
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,300
And build for a forge

150
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,640
Your secrets that you keep

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,820
It's not all that hard for you to clearly see

152
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,100
The thought police are always on the beat

153
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,300
They're everywhere you go

154
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,320
And see the things you see

155
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,900
They have copies of your money list

156
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,560
And bootleg if you freeze

157
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,920
They know everything about you

158
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,360
Like your favorite kind of music

159
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,360


160
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:06,760
They'll send

161
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,080
So face it

162
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,880
You will never be alone again

163
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,540
AIM & ICQ & even IRC

164
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,780
Are monitored for acts against the state

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Ops and bots are logging every keystroke made

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,100
From their surveillance there is no escape

167
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,600
On the news net groups they lurk with baited posts

168
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,220
To catch the perverts like Disney execs

169
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,260
They slip you programs to hide on your hard drive

170
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,660
And monitor your house for sight and sound

171
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,640
They're everywhere you go

172
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,700
And see the things you see

173
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,300
They have copies of your money list

174
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,000
And bootleg if you freeze

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,320
They know everything about you

176
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,220
Like your favorite kind of music

177
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,860
They know everything about you

178
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:08,940
And bootleg if you freeze

179
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,980
They know everything about you

180
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,380
And bootleg if you freeze

181
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:15,600
They know everything about you

182
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,500
And bootleg if you smile

183
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:21,820
They all give and supported your dream

184
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,100
With父とADE

185
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,440
But boom boom boom

186
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,560
The rights are alive

187
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:30,980
It's already a dream

188
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:30,980


189
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:30,980


190
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,540
AIRA mmmmmmmmmmme

191
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,160
AIRA will always be there

192
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,200
So be patient

193
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,200


194
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,240
They're everywhere you go and see the things you see.

195
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,420
They have copies of your money list and food, they'll give you things.

196
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,660
They know everything about you like your favorite kind of sin.

197
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,820
So face it, you'll never be alone again!

198
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,200
Yeah!

199
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,820
How long's it been?

200
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,340
20 years?

201
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,500
Driving, driving, endlessly driving.

202
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,160
It's been difficult.

203
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:31,560
It's strange for a country that has grown so...

204
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,160
For a country that has become so weak.

205
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,700
It's difficult to live here.

206
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,080
And it shouldn't be so hard to live in a nation that's grown so soft.

207
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,380
Tim Russett, Chris Matthews, Katie Couric, CBS, NBC are all communists.

208
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,640
The Pope is senile and pedophilia is fine with him as long as it's not reported.

209
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,400
And pedophilia is fine with him.

210
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,240
He's a white-winged, right-winged pond scum.

211
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,480
Dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump.

212
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,600
Oh, wow!

213
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,760
That MP is so crazy, my Bob.

214
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,540
Everybody in here is so crazy, my Bob.

215
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,320
Everybody in here is so crazy, my Bob.

216
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,120
Everybody in here is so crazy, my Bob.

217
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,140
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

218
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,500
All of the religions will be having a heart attack.

219
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,080
A pipe full of rot equals what?

220
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,960
A lot of slack, no matter how you kill it.

221
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,580
He always keeps coming back, Bob.

222
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,400
I'm talking about Dobbs.

223
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,280
Repent, quit your job and slack off.

224
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,380
Get ready to blast off when Ed State comes and all the pigs are on the run from Bob.

225
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,880
Bob.

226
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,580
Bob.

227
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,120
Bob.

228
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,420
Bob.

229
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,020
Bob.

230
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,200
Bob.

231
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:52,860
Bob.

232
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,800
Bob.

233
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,820
Bob.

234
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,260
Bob.

235
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:55,700
Bob.

236
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:56,920
Bob.

237
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,200
Bob.

238
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,400
Bob.

239
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:57,440
Bob.

240
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,180
Bob.

241
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,960
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

242
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,380
Start to realize what till now has been disguised.

243
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,180
Keep looking to change.

244
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,180


245
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,700
You disguise that the sauce is by and by.

246
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,600
Or maybe by and by.

247
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,500
You will see the light at the end of the pipe that leads to Bob Dobbs.

248
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,400
Bob Dobbs.

249
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,760
Talking about the salesman.

250
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,640
To the gods.

251
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,120
He's still a chap that coughed and lit.

252
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,640
On the conspiracy of normality.

253
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Oh, who could it be but Bob?

254
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,400
Bob.

255
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,160
Bob.

256
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,280
Bob.

257
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:26,900
Bob.

258
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,760
Bob.

259
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,560
Bob.

260
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,200


261
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:34,560


262
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:34,840
Bob.

263
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,140
Bob.

264
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


265
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


266
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


267
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


268
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


269
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


270
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


271
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


272
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


273
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


274
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


275
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


276
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


277
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


278
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


279
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


280
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


281
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


282
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


283
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


284
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,140


285
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,520
Bob.

286
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,560
Bob.

287
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,740
Bob.

288
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,640
Bob.

289
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,860
Bob.

290
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:04,660
Bob.

291
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,020


292
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:05,920
Bob.

293
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:05,920


294
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:05,920


295
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,100
Bob.

296
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,140


297
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,140


298
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,140


299
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,140


300
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,140


301
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,140


302
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,140


303
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,140


304
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,140


305
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,140


306
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,680
Look out everyone, here he comes, it's Bob!

307
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,240
Bob!

308
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,340
Bob!

309
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,340


310
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,040
You'll wish you could forget

311
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,460
You'll wish you could forget

312
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,840
You'll wish you could forget

313
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,180
You'll wish you could forget

314
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,580
You'll wish you could forget

315
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,060
You'll wish you could forget

316
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,440
You'll wish you could forget

317
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,060
You'll wish you could forget about Bob!

318
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,140
Everybody up here is so crazy about Bob

319
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,740
Bob is not only sexy, he's smart and funny

320
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,720
Nobody's here

321
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:28,120
Nobody's here

322
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,100
Nobody's here

323
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,000
Nobody's here

324
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,120
Nobody's here

325
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,600
President Bush declared this a critical victory in the war on PR

326
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,520
President Bush heaped praise on PR news and remains on the loose

327
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,440
At least 100 people were centered at a center

328
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,860
On Wall Street 2, 27, 10, 3, 29, 14, 75

329
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,920
British politicians are wanted for rape and murder in several states

330
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,760
Prime Minister Tony Blair says he had been arrested three times in Georgia on minor offenses

331
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,640
President Bush declared he wants to kill PR news in Washington

332
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,700
It's so bogus to believe

333
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700
President Bush

334
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,320
Torture President Bush

335
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,340
Piece of dirt

336
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,320
President Bush

337
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,600
You're lower than dirt

338
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,340
He faces a maximum of 80 years in prison

339
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,340
Ideas are very dangerous things

340
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:44,040
Perhaps not you, but beyond the shadow of a doubt

341
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Your little children will awaken in the dead of night with the power of Bull Diner

342
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,300
Infecting and infesting

343
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,680
They will murder you and you'll lure a nonchalance and go giggling to the sun

344
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,920
Stop this

345
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,520
Your next bad Wolasilou is skilled and sexy

346
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,460
Maxine

347
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,960
Bool!

348
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,120
Come on!

349
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,940
Join this mercy

350
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,660
Let's climb and see

351
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,200
Oh, see, see, see, see

352
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,240
And we'll all care

353
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,080
Crazy

354
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,160
Crazy

355
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,840
Crazy

356
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,140
Crazy

357
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,360
Crazy

358
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,280
Crazy

359
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,340
Crazy

360
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,040
Crazy

361
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,740
Crazy

362
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,400

364
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,840
Crazy

365
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,200
Crazy

366
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,360
Crazy

367
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,260
Crazy

368
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:46,260


369
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,720
I don't know karate, but I know Karaza.

370
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,500
Look at this.

371
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,760
I'm mad.

372
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,620
Crazy.

373
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,100
I'm mad.

374
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,800
I'm mad.

375
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,680
I'm mad.

376
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,260
Oh, my, my, my.

377
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:02,500
I don't know.

378
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,680
wondrous, nice melody of strange music there, friends.

379
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,720
All of it dumped by different folks on alt.binaries.slack.

380
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,500
That last thing was the Toronto Tabla Ensemble.

381
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,100
Before that, some sort of Hebrew song.

382
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,840
Loco Weed by Norel Preff.

383
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,940
Am I Iron Man by Lee Murr.

384
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,800
The baby stang as the bozo of blah, blah, blah.

385
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,560
And now some more PR news.

386
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,640
From PR news in Washington, I'm not guilty by reason of insanity.

387
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,900
Today is election day in Britain.

388
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:55,120
Labour Party Prime Minister Tony Blair has placed and detonated explosives outside the British Consulate in Manhattan early this morning.

389
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,740
He thought he was documenting a legitimate use of a naked prisoner.

390
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,200
This is PR news.

391
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:06,140
Six million young homosexual gypsies wailed for two minutes at the notorious death camp in Britain.

392
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,340
Health officials opened fire, killing eight and wounding two.

393
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,460
Depending on supply.

394
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,840
At least police don't know who killed PR news in Washington.

395
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,000
It's a reunion that took over 30 years to happen.

396
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:29,380
A superbly preserved Jack Bruce, Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker from the 30th Pharaonic Dynasty, Cream, had been closed in a wooden sarcophagus and buried in sand at the bottom of a 20-foot shaft.

397
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,760
I'm so mad, I'm so mad, I'm so mad.

398
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:43,080
With classic songs such as Sunshine of Your Mummy, White Mummy, Strange Mummy, 2300-year-old Farewell Tour that you saw the band come to an end.

399
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,820
Cream will then be placed on the stage.

400
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,580
And on display at Saqqara's Museum of Imhotep.

401
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,360
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-hotep.

402
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,300
All of them sold out.

403
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:23,920
Ho-ho-ho-ho-hotep.

404
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,980
Whi-e-e-e.

405
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,140
Ho-ho-ho-ho-hotep.

406
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,080
Ho-ho-ho-ho-hotep.

407
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:37,360
Ho-ho-ho-ho-hotep.

408
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:37,360


409
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,180
Hoewaos!

410
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,960
Hoewaos!

411
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,420
Hoewaos!

412
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:42,480
Hoewaos!

413
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:42,760
Hoewaos!

414
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,380
Hoewaos!

415
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,300
Hoewaos!

416
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,720
Hoewaos!

417
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:44,800
Hoewaos!

418
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:44,800


419
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:44,800


420
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:44,800


421
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:44,800


422
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:44,800


423
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,500
God doesn't deal in nuance.

424
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,200
God doesn't deal in gray area.

425
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,500
God hates and despises.

426
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,280
God hates, hates, and despises gray area.

427
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,080
And the whole point of it is to make you feel better about yourself as you accomplish nothing.

428
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:32,820
My other mental illness problem has to do with art and music and movies and all the stuff that I really like.

429
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,680
And some of you may be this way.

430
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,160
If I go to a movie or a concert or see beautiful artwork,

431
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,180
for some reason it's not enough to just sit there and enjoy it.

432
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,720
I always want to do it myself.

433
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:51,460
And be glad that I don't try to sing anymore.

434
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,160
But it's kind of a handicap in a way because you can't really do everything.

435
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,720
And I'm not really that good at all the things I try to do.

436
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,360
Because I keep jumping from one to another.

437
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,000
You know, you see this great techno music.

438
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,580
Now see, I'll do techno music because anybody can do techno.

439
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,360
And with a computer.

440
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,280
There's good and bad.

441
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,460
And I do the bad kind.

442
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,580
But the same with art.

443
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,700
What it is, is I realize it's the tools.

444
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,040
I love the tools.

445
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,260
And it's a neurotic love of tools.

446
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,660
And guys are like that.

447
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,560
That's a guy thing.

448
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,500
But it's a geek thing.

449
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,940
It used to be guys would work on cars.

450
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,500
Now they brag about their computer.

451
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,320
But it's...

452
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,800
There's not that much difference really.

453
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,140
And I got to...

454
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:52,020
I was reading some paleoanthropology at one point.

455
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,100
I love cave people.

456
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,580
I feel close to them for some reason.

457
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:57,600
And...

458
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:05,360
Okay, for a million years, the main thing, the most common thing that guys did was chip rocks.

459
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,340
They did not actually spend most of their time hunting or gathering.

460
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,460
But they did spend a lot of time getting...

461
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,760
Making these stone hand axes.

462
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,520
That was the level of technology that our ancestors were at for a long time.

463
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,540
And I mean, several species of hominids were kind of in the same technological level of...

464
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,800
They made tools, but they were so good at it.

465
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,200
I mean, they were really good at it.

466
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,320
A modern person would not be able to make a stone hand axe as well as a...

467
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,660
One of these characters doing it back when that's all they did for a hundred thousand years.

468
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,560
They really got good at it.

469
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,320
And we know this because there are plenty of stone hand axes all over the world.

470
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,800
But there aren't that many skulls and skeletons.

471
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:57,360
It's...

472
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,840
That whole work part of science is very mushy and vague because there's just not that much fossil material.

473
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,780
But there's a lot...

474
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,700
They had never...

475
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,300
They kept making these hand axes because they didn't take them with them.

476
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,640
They hadn't invented the hand axe store.

477
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,780
They had not even invented the hand axe bag.

478
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,620
They'd make...

479
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,180
It's like...

480
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,700
What?

481
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,100
There's a sick baby mammoth?

482
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,980
Oh, let's go get it.

483
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,260
Let's make some hand axes real quick.

484
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,420
And run over there and kill it.

485
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,200
Skin it.

486
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,840
And eat it.

487
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,220
And then they'd wander off and leave all their hand axes.

488
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,860
That's why you find all that stuff.

489
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,880
So they kept making them over and over and over again.

490
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,200
They didn't...

491
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,560
Plus they'd get dull, you know.

492
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:40,780
Pretty quick.

493
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,400
Now the near-sighted cavemen probably chopped a lot more rocks than the others.

494
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,180
Because they weren't that good with a bow and arrow or chasing rabbits.

495
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:50,760
So they...

496
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,160
But they could chop rocks like a son of a bitch.

497
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,620
And good chopping could get you...

498
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,840
It was a status thing, certainly.

499
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:07,680
With that many centuries of this one level of technology, you know, if you could whack out a rock real quick, you'd impress the girls.

500
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,020
And...

501
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:13,580
So good chopping could get you laid and paid if you were the near-sighted caveman.

502
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,780
You could...

503
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,260
You didn't have to go out...

504
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,100
If you made good rocks for everybody else, you could get fed.

505
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:26,720
The ones who couldn't even make hand axes are the ones who invented the first religions, friends.

506
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,200
At any rate...

507
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
So think of it.

508
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,140
Here's a million years of these craftsmen, okay?

509
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,160
And they're pretty simple-minded.

510
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,040
That's all they can do is just chop these damn rocks.

511
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,300
Pretty repetitive motion.

512
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,540
All day long for millions of years.

513
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,160
Smiths, we might call them.

514
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,920
Millions of years of smiths chopping rocks.

515
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,500
And making up religions to get laid.

516
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,560
And sometimes I feel like I'm still chopping rocks to get laid and paid.

517
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,460
And that...

518
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,640
Think about, now, obsessive-compulsive disorder.

519
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,780
Now, that's not a big jump from the rock chopping, if you think about it.

520
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,920
It's like a holdover from that axe-making instinct.

521
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,860
Sitting there doing the same thing over and over again.

522
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,260
All day long, every day of your life.

523
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,480
Doesn't that kind of remind you of some of the jobs that we go to?

524
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,940
You know, jobs that are best enjoyed if you happen to have obsessive-compulsive disorder.

525
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,880
I certainly have benefited from mine.

526
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,740
It comes in real handy.

527
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,940
But then you kind of...

528
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,820
Okay, so jobs.

529
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,900
What about art, really?

530
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,720
Most art.

531
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,520
You know, that's just busy work.

532
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,620
No, but you don't have to have art for survival.

533
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:47,020
That's just a useless byproduct of hand axe-making gone hog wild.

534
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,320
It's an instinct.

535
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:53,800
And for you drummers, the connection should be really obvious.

536
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,120
Needless to say, you know, you're just chopping...

537
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,700
It's soft rock chopping.

538
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,880
But what else did people do for a hundred thousand dollars?

539
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,060
You know, they just cut it down.

540
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,060


541
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,340
And then you have a bunch of people who are just doing it for a hundred thousand years.

542
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,220
Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink.

543
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,660
And late into the night, the fire's going and they're banging away.

544
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,020
And you get kind of tripped out doing the same thing over and over.

545
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:24,260
So you look around at our modern civilization, our monorails and flying jetpacks and...

546
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,660
Oh, well, anyway, the...

547
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,540
Our subways and buses.

548
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:35,540
And friends, maybe tool-using wasn't such a good idea after all.

549
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,680
The tool-using is what got us this way.

550
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,980
And maybe it wasn't such a good idea.

551
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,520
This leads me to UFOs.

552
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:55,100
The question about UFOs and aliens is not so much, is there anyone out there?

553
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,300
They're almost certainly...

554
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,560
The question actually is...

555
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,020
There must be.

556
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:09,600
Just by sheer size and the amount of time we're talking about, there must be others out there.

557
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,020
The question is, how come they didn't contact us already a million years ago?

558
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,820
And don't say crop circles.

559
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,760
I know the guys that make the crosses.

560
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:26,220
And don't, you know, don't know, well, my girlfriend was abducted in this dream and she...

561
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,860
Well, okay, no, that's...

562
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,220
I mean real evidence.

563
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,820
Non-chump evidence.

564
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,000
That's the question.

565
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,800
You know, how come we don't have solid evidence?

566
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:48,660
And, well, friends, maybe we really don't want the super advanced gas brains of Jupiter to notice us.

567
00:30:48,880 --> 00:31:00,240
It may be that the reason that we haven't already encountered slightly more advanced tool users who manage to be able to make the distances that we can't yet...

568
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,940
Maybe when...

569
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:06,500
When the really advanced aliens detect the presence...

570
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,340
I think this happened in one of those Star Trek movies.

571
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:18,100
As soon as they detect the signal of a faster than light drive or whatever, nuclear energy, that's when the gas brains of Jupiter call the exterminators.

572
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:26,780
It's like, oh, I'm afraid you death robots are going to have to go in there and spray for tool users again.

573
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,180
Got another nice little planet down there.

574
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,860
But it's another infestation.

575
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,120
And that's why we never get visited by flying saucers in real life.

576
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,680
It's because they get shot down before they can leave.

577
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,840
And that's probably what will happen to us because the wiser ones know what happened.

578
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:52,120
You know, during the galactic wars in the previous billion years, they learned some lessons.

579
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,520
So they try to keep us down.

580
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:15,180
So maybe by ensure consequences, when we were here earlier...

581
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,660
We've distanced back to Outside of a planet.

582
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,420
Which out of the sheer اليab Problem, we might be found appropriate amongst those and have said,

583
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,540
Well, almost no future south.

584
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:23,540


585
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:28,260
Maybe it was really less proactive than the true dangercture so far though.

586
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,160
How about this one up out of a planet, then?

587
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:36,200
comic jefferson again and before that we heard some live sub-g's preaching as it happened at

00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,700
your intellect may be able to laugh smirk at this threat but your very core of being

603
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:39,260
your true self is yet being penetrated indeed twisted to the point that my words are now

604
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:48,360
irrevocably and cancerously infecting even the most secret hidden lost black labyrinth

605
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:54,520
of your most misshapen withered and abhorrent putrid gasless soul

606
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,100

610
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,700

611
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:24,920

ORDY

614
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:54,980
why do you keep correctly limiting yourself and the interest ye get

615
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:54,640
inside these

616
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,760
Taste the pigs.

617
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,260
Ah.

Hit the pigs.

621
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,100
Hit the pigs.

622
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,020
Hit the pigs.

623
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,860
Hit the pigs.

624
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,760
Hit the pigs.

625
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,700
Hit the pigs.

626
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,060
Hit the pigs.

627
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,700
Taxes and corporate profits are obscene

628
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,980
They gouge you on your cigarettes and booze and gasoline

629
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,620
Television, radio, news and magazine

630
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,400
The conspiracy owns them all, they're part of the machine

631
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,260
They feed you entertainment like a dose of orazine

632
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,740
Pouring in your ears until there's nothing in between

633
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,520
It's time to turn the tables, guys, I'll tell you what I mean

634
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,140
The bastards might be paying, but their money's mighty green

635
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,180
So please, the pain

636
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,360
Black politicians who sucker with nudges and wink

637
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,060
IRS agents and lawyers and government fink

638
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,740
Millionaire bitches all dressed up in diamonds and mink

639
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,400
Wage slavery sucks, poverty really stinks

640
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,480
So please, the pain

641
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,980
Please who?

642
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,680
The pain

643
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,380
Right

644
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,640
Fleece the Pinks

645
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,580
Fleece the Pinks by Loki Gaioti

Wiccabilly.com

651
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,220
Eh, oh yes

652
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,960
From PR News in Washington, I'm getting worse

653
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,680
A commission of military experts says Los Angeles commuters

654
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,580
Slowed down the planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from San Francisco

655
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,840
The commission says it believes Ariel Sharon attended ceremonies

656
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,300
Commemorating Nazi Germany in World War II

657
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,520
Wall Street at this hour 32-10-7-75

658
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:06,020
A girl is suing PR News claiming American forces in Iraq damaged her reputation by making remarks about her case of PR News throughout Iraq

659
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:11,400
A new report says PR's two adults spread PR News by sexual activity

660
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,940
I'm in critical condition

661
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,840
That's actually a slight improvement

662
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,120
The report also says Americans wasted 2.3 billion PR News in Los Angeles

663
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,660
And in just a little while we'll take those questions for those of you who are watching this video on YouTube and Facebook

664
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:23,660


665
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:23,660


666
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,740
And I'll see you later then, huh?

667
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,280
Okay, bye

668
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,260
God, you know, a plastic dinosaur won't help them now

669
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,960
If they just pet them, just ride them, they'll

670
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,940
Oh, I know, but then they might smear their spots

671
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,320
But then when they grow up, it's all better

672
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,180
You think so?

673
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,100
I think it's beautiful

674
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,020
Honey, I could tell you some stories that'll never get better

675
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,020
It's awful

676
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,520
I mean, once you get married, it's always like that

677
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,680
But I think that through the correct questioning that you can bring the dinosaur's real personality

678
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,680
Really? In spite of the spots?

679
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,720
In spite of the spots

680
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,480
And the tears?

681
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,440
It's a miracle

682
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,140
They'll take them away

683
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:54,920
It's everywhere

684
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,120
And they'll put them where they belong

685
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,240
It's beautiful and shining every day

686
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,040
Can I get one?

687
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,980
Everyone has a small spot of dinosaur teeth

688
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,680
Laugh and laugh

689
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,440
It's a dinosaur who disappeared

690
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,140
Teach me how to do that

691
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,420
Well, first you go and get some Little Debbie snack cakes

692
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:09,920
Who?

693
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
Do a thing, Jack

694
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,520
Little Debbie snack cakes

695
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,000
Little Debbie snack cakes

696
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,760
Yes, we used to watch her go to school

697
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,200
Let's watch this film as she goes to school

698
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,660
To meet her friends

699
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,260
To get her at last

700
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,120
Beams on us all

701
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,900
You're making her cry

702
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,800
No, no, no

703
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,300
Beams not here

704
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:25,740
You gotta stop

705
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,520
Don't cry

706
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,680
Give her some more beans

707
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,000
Give her a dinosaur

708
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,580
Give her that spotted one over there

709
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,640
There's one in every box

710
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,760
Yeah, there's two now

711
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,640
There's one on the floor

712
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,080
There's three

713
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,840
There's four

714
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,640
Okay, that's all you got, thanks

715
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,500
Okay, that was a warm tarantula

716
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,440
Hidden by the, uh, under the warm beer can in the edge of the cooler

717
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,180
A tarantula of the mind

718
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,100
Not a real thing, but a hallucination from the depths of a disordered world

719
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,500
Psyche

720
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,380
Okay, put the woman back in the wagons

721
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,460
It's a tarantula of the mind

722
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,200
It's one of them nine-pound spiders we've been having

723
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,660
Look at that

724
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,560
No, don't look at her

725
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,760
The laughing spider can paralyze with its insane, inhuman chuckle

726
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,860
Man, it's almost got his mouth

727
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,040
Doctor, how can we get the spider back in the cage?

728
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,480
The bulim laughing spider

729
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,160
The cat can fix it to do anything

730
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,960
And we can only use brute force

731
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,260
That's all it understands

732
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,500
It's a new kind of laundry detergent

733
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,280
I used it one time

734
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,480
I got rid of all the other spiders

735
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,280
There were lots of them before I used that

736
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,100
Just pour it in the jar

737
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,340
Pour some on his abdomen there

738
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,500
Holy

739
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,040
What?

740
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,620
It's shriveling up

741
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,300
Yeah, don't listen to it laugh

742
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,740
I don't think it's too funny

743
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,380
It's wacky

744
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:30,960
It's goofy

745
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,760
It's wild

746
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,300
I think we should take one of them

747
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,360
And put them in little packages

748
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,660
Where little dinosaurs used to be

749
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,420
And fool somebody

750
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,040
It's scary

751
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,360
But all those kids think they're going to get a little dinosaur friend

752
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,480
And instead they get some massive goo from the inside of the spider

753
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,140
Yeah, it's a little known

754
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,160
They don't laugh at the spider

755
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,260
It's awful

756
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,120
And then Jimmy eats some

757
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:50,880
It's awful

758
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:51,600
It's awful

759
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,700
I saw a monster with two eyes that made me

760
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,620
Good evening, you're on Baby Boy with Frank Zappa

761
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,960
Uh, yeah, hi Frank

762
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,120
Greetings from the Subgenius Church

763
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,240
Oh yeah, good

764
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,500
Thanks for holding

765
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,260
How is old Bob?

766
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,460
Oh, he's doing good

767
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,660
He sends his regards

768
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,540
You know one of the best things about Bob?

769
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,400
What's that?

770
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,200
He's a smoker

771
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,720
Yeah

772
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,060
Yeah, a frop all the way

773
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,840
Uh, anyway, I want

774
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
You mentioned in your book

775
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,660
And I hope I'm paraphrasing accurately here

776
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,560
That attitudes of a number of people

777
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,080
We have encountered

778
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,680
Fall into the realm of bad mental health

779
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,180
My question is

780
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,080
Do you have any thoughts

781
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,320
On what kind of job the mental health system

782
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,120
Is doing in this country

783
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,700
And secondly, do you have any views

784
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,840
On the prescription and use of psychotic tranquilizers

785
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,000
And other mind-altering medications used today?

786
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,080
Well, let's take the mental health system first

787
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,320
It's a disaster area

788
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,540
Because most of the facilities

789
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,420
Were decimated by the early budget

790
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,140
Cuts in the beginning of the Reagan administration

791
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,540
And when those facilities closed

792
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,000
A lot of the people who were in there being cared for

793
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,500
Wound up sleeping under bridges

794
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,760
And in cardboard boxes

795
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,880
And on gratings in Washington, D.C.

796
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,840
And people who should be receiving medical help

797
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,940
Are now regarded as these denizens of the underworld

798
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,580
And it's really a very sick thing

799
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,560
For a society that likes to think

800
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,780
That it's fair and caring

801
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,100
It's a sick thing for it to do

802
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,880
To save a couple of bucks

803
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,980
On the back of people in those institutions

804
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,400
That's reprehensible

805
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,460
Do you think that the mental health system

806
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,040
Works when it's allowed to work?

807
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,780
Well, let's just say that

808
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,200
Having one is better than not having one

809
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,960
I would disagree with some of the techniques

810
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,580
That have been used in mental hospitals

811
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,600
Not that I'm an expert

812
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,160
I've never been an inmate in one

813
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,580
But based on things that I've heard

814
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,780
About what goes on there

815
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,200
I wouldn't say that

816
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,180
We are talking about a system

817
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,340
That had spectacularly good results

818
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,600
In healing people

819
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,680
But at least in the case of the people

820
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,620
Who are now sleeping in the street

821
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,660
They had a place

822
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,200
They wouldn't freeze to death

823
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,700
Whether or not they would ever get

824
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,780
Over their schizophrenia

825
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,960
Is another question

826
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,040
But at least they're not going to freeze to death

827
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,200
Because they hear voices

828
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,740
What would you plan to do

829
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,840
If you were president

830
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,480
In that kind of situation?

831
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,740
The same thing that I would do

832
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,560
About the rest of the homeless problem

833
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,900
You go to the congress and say

834
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,640
Fix it, you know

835
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,300
Spend the money and do it

836
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,680
Because obviously there are people

837
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,200
Who have dealt in the realm of social services

838
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,500
Who know far more about this than I do

839
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,220
But nobody is turning to these people

840
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,060
Saying do it

841
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,780
Well I'll not only vote for you

842
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,240
But I'll campaign for you in 92

843
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,660
Well I've got to figure out

844
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,420
If you do decide

845
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,680
Let's keep that in the gift

846
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,900
Because I haven't made the decision to do it

847
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,120
But it's nice to talk to people

848
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,140
To see that there is some enthusiasm

849
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,360
There is a dissent

850
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,840
And keep up the good work musically

851
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,360
And politically

852
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,780
Okay let me just say

853
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,920
Something about your second question

854
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,540
About the mind altering drug

855
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:59,560
I don't think that it's a good idea to use them

856
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,040
I think that

857
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,540
One of the reasons why they work

858
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,920
Is the drug changes your body chemistry

859
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,620
Okay

860
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:10,020
The chemistry of your body is being changed

861
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,860
In most instances by

862
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,240
Artificial substances

863
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,240
In other words a chemical

864
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,540
Which is derived from

865
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,380
Isolating a molecule

866
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:20,860
That's not a chemical

867
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,580
It came from a plant

868
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,200
Or a mushroom

869
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,180
Or some other source

870
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,900
That has a special chemical effect

871
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,820
On the human body

872
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,260
So this kind of thing goes on regularly though

873
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,040
That's right

874
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,240
In other words if you want to feel mutated

875
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,440
You could just eat a strange diet

876
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,320
And you'd be out there

877
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,680
I mean how many macrobiotic people do you know

878
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,240
Okay

879
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,020
You know they're kind of bobbed out

880
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:42,500
Yeah

881
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,340
And if you want to be altered

882
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,220
I think you could probably achieve

883
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,840
Some unique results by over-enhancing it

884
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,460
Or clamping on a certain type of pizza

885
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,240
If your body responded to that chemical

886
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,200
What do you think about not

887
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:02,020
Drugging which is not of one's own free will

888
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,000
I would assume

889
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,860
Well I think that's a no-no

890
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,340
You mean like sticking stuff in the water supply

891
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,040
Well no

892
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:08,600
That's terrorism

893
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,460
Well drugging someone in a mental hospital

894
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,240
Who doesn't necessarily agree with that

895
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,420
Would probably be

896
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,860
Well now you're getting into a constitutional area

897
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,820
Because I'm not sure that I'm really in charge of this

898
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:20,820


899
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:26,020
fully informed as to what the legal status is of a person who has been committed to a mental

900
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:32,420
institution whether or not he retains still retains the right to reject medication because

901
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:37,180
he's in there because he's out of his mind right it's a little bit difficult for the doctor to sit

902
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:41,740
there and say well what do you think right you take these pills now come on let's negotiate it

903
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:50,260
okay okay it is a tricky area um thank you very much for your call bye-bye if one rocket scientist

904
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:56,640
observations are right even longer lines at the dmv revenge of the six was declared a 165 million

907
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:13,000
terrorists and criminal aliens move freely through our society critics fear so much i'm excited about

908
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,340
me making a movie about a nine-year-old boy is an accident waiting to happen heavy breathing

00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:18,900
private it's injured street since eight eight philides 다�ureance and her full-timeождения

921
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,840
the sacred circumscribe of the subgenius.

922
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,440
Circumscription is a very useful thing, actually.

923
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,040
There are certain things that we're talking about

924
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,520
and certain things we won't talk about.

925
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,360
You only talk about those things inside the circle.

926
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,240
Unless we started one.

927
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,960
We wouldn't want to start an army, would we?

928
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,420
Yeah, I've contemplated that before,

929
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,880
but I'm just not that kind of guy.

930
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:45,580
That's the thing.

931
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,480
We could get a fight club thing,

932
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,220
a bunch of loser males that have low self-esteem,

933
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,720
and we could dress them up in funny clothes

934
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,460
and give them orders.

935
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,540
Been there, done that.

936
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,240
Yeah, already tried it.

937
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,400
You've actually been involved in something like that before?

938
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,660
Were you a...

939
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:04,000
Yeah, it was called 7th grade gym class.

940
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,020
Yeah, when I jumped into a load of raw sewage

941
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,440
just to earn my wings.

942
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,520
You're kidding.

943
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,560
You can fly now, for Christ's sake?

944
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,580
What are you doing here?

945
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,360
You can fly?

946
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,380
Why haven't you flown away yet?

947
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:17,660
Why haven't you flown away yet then?

948
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,700
Hey, how many of you guys got picked on by bullies

949
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,680
in elementary school?

950
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,060
I did.

951
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:28,060
How many were bullies that did the picking on?

952
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,520
I did a little bit of both.

953
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,040
See, that's well-rounded,

954
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,300
if you did a little bit of both.

955
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,980
I know what it's like on both sides,

956
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,020
and I'm not proud of what I did

957
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,640
or of what was done to me.

958
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,200
Not proud of either one of those things,

959
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,100
but it's childhood.

960
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,860
There's a reason why we don't hold children accountable

961
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,700
the way we hold adults accountable

962
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,420
in our society.

963
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,340
Because they're mean little things.

964
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,400
There's a reason why we have a separate justice system

965
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,120
for juveniles.

966
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,620
And all this talk about,

967
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,100
oh, you know, you do an adult crime,

968
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:54,980
you do adult time.

969
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,500
I don't think that means anything at all.

970
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,380
Because the fact is, you know,

971
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,000
you think back on the stuff you did as a kid,

972
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,380
you know, it seems nonsensical today.

973
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,640
You look at the stuff that kids do,

974
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,200
it seems nonsensical today.

975
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,020
But they grow up.

976
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,720
There are whole parts of the brain

977
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,060
that are not mature until you're in your 20s, actually.

978
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,960
You know, and we hold people accountable

979
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,560
for what's supposed to be exercise

980
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,460
of that part of the brain.

981
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,160
Years before it's fully formed.

982
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,420
Well, if you can go into their high school

983
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,100
and tell them how cool it would be in the military,

984
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,440
I would say there are vast portions of their brains

985
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,780
which are undeveloped.

986
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:27,940
Yeah, well...

987
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,800
Perhaps even, you know, as flaccid as my wrist.

988
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,780
Well, it depends on what your alternatives are.

989
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,800
You know, to some people,

990
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,860
the military looks like a lot of flack.

991
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,820
During peacetime, it is.

992
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,160
Somebody wakes you up for you,

993
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,380
somebody puts you to sleep

994
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,820
and puts the food in your mouth

995
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,060
while you are push-upped for them

996
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,760
and shooted for them.

997
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:46,920
Yeah.

998
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:47,780
It's a great job.

999
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,300
Yeah, a very secure job.

1000
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,520
And you don't have to pay for food or launching, either.

1001
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,420
Some kids nowadays think they'll get to win...

1002
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,600
get their own, like, special uniform

1003
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,920
like in the video games.

1004
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:01,940
And a name.

1005
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,020
You know, they can double-click on here

1006
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,340
and suddenly they're Captain...

1007
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,420
whatever the...

1008
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,320
You know what I'm saying?

1009
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,180
I know what you mean.

1010
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,280
And, you know...

1011
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,360
Or they think they can enter a cheat code.

1012
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,340
Oh, yeah.

1013
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,860
Just press the buttons on your special weapon.

1014
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,260
They can do that.

1015
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,240
Well, they can?

1016
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:19,940
Yes!

1017
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:20,920
That's right.

1018
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,960
In today's Army of One,

1019
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:22,880
you can, uh...

1020
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,560
You get your special, uh...

1021
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,760
nano-individualized combat weapon

1022
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,540
with, uh...

1023
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,180
little keypad on it.

1024
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,080
And nobody else can...

1025
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,060
How do you get to be the commander-in-chief?

1026
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,600
You have to do things

1027
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,920
you don't even want to imagine doing.

1028
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:39,920
Right, yeah.

1029
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,160
You don't have to remember the things that you do

1030
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,700
while you're, you know, on the job.

1031
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,020
You know, as long as they...

1032
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:45,640
I mean...

1033
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,320
I mean...

1034
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:47,460
I mean...

1035
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:47,460


1036
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:47,460


1037
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:47,460


1038
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:47,460


1039
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:47,460


1040
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:47,460


1041
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:47,460


1042
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:47,460


1043
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:47,460


1044
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:47,880
You don't have to be up that high.

1045
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,920
You have to bend over quite a few times

1046
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,360
for several different reasons.

1047
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,200
Yeah, but you get the special helmet

1048
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,140
where you can control

1049
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,780
what you can remember afterwards.

1050
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:56,180
Yeah.

1051
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,200
But your plumbing's never right

1052
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,180
after they get the helmet

1053
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:58,960
or you bend over.

1054
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,300
I mean, for crying out loud,

1055
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,840
what a thing to give up for your feet.

1056
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:01,860
Hey, you know what?

1057
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:02,840
Actually, it's not so bad

1058
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,580
because, I mean,

1059
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,160
sure, you give up a lot of your freedoms

1060
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,560
to get that kind of position,

1061
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,600
but you also give up a lot of risks as well, you know?

1062
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,220
You get that helmet

1063
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,480
and you can wear that helmet

1064
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,200
because, you know,

1065
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,320
you don't need the tinfoil helmet anymore.

1066
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,160
And, man,

1067
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,360
my position needs a helmet.

1068
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,360
I need protection

1069
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,000
and I can't get up from this position.

1070
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,540
Well, we'll send out someone

1071
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,960
to help you out very shortly.

1072
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,560
Don't forget to bring the canine jelly

1073
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,060
or any kind of other, you know,

1074
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,800
liquefied dog products.

1075
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:36,520
Hmm.

1076
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,920
This is the story

1077
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,280
about a group of kids who volunteered.

1078
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,540
We fixed stuff.

1079
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,700
We moved the park.

1080
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,020
Well, that didn't last long.

1081
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,340
Kids like you

1082
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:47,700
me?

1083
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:48,720
Who cares?

1084
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:51,300
G

1085
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,480
G

1086
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,100
G.I.

1087
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:54,580
Joe

1088
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,660
Hey, Joe

1089
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,840
Where you been?

1090
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,260
You got plastic arms

1091
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,200
that's never been

1092
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,100
But sterilia

1093
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,480
is borrelia

1094
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,420
Ah

1095
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:03,760
Ah

1096
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,320
Ah

1097
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:04,660
Ah

1098
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:05,260
Ah

1099
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:05,840
Ah

1100
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,200
Ah

1101
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:06,740
Ah

1102
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,060
Ah

1103
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:07,160
Ah

1104
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:07,340
Ah

1105
