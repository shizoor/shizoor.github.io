The path to evolution is now in space, as much as on Earth.
Man has shown that as a species, mankind was willing to commit itself to living in environments
that were completely different than those in which the species evolved.
We put a shield of life around ourselves in order to protect the life within, but the
willingness to go out there is there.
We've shown that.
The curve of human evolution has been bent.
The curve of human evolution has been bent.
The curve of human evolution has been bent.
The curve of human evolution has been bent.
Were there astronauts dragging people with them back?
I've been dragging more people with me.
That's the problem.
I'm not content to just myself to go.
I'm insisting that anybody who hears the voice of the sand-
Must not necessarily be-
Yes.
Yes.
Where are the launching pads?
In your own backyard, right next to the concussion stand.
So if you're hearing the voice of the sand, you should be booking that flight down to...
Go ye to the launching pad.
Yes.
Standing on the surface of the moon.
Now atomic power is driving me into space, back to the Earth where it all began.
We're here. We're here, and that's it.
And that's it. We're here right now, and we don't want to be the...
We're not waiting for any aliens to come pick us up.
We're going to be the aliens. We're going to build our own ships.
We're heading out. We're taking off.
And everybody else is going to be freaking out about the millennium, you know.
Create your own reality.
So they're going to be creating some, you know, around some number that means nothing.
I'm going back to the old analog spaceship.
We're going to be firing up those ring modulators and those envelopes and those oscillators.
And we're going to be firing all that electrical kind of crap up there.
Yeah. We're going to be mixing up those zeros and ones.
No.
We're going to be setting the controls.
Yeah, the heart of the sun.
You know the sun is like a big speaker cabinet?
Did you know that?
We just found that out.
That's something else we just found out in the last couple of decades.
The sun is resonating with a pitch, a sound that is infinitely complex.
But if you could hear it, you'd probably have to go into the sun to actually hear it.
Because if you're in space, you know, in space the earth is quiet and small.
Before, you spoke of finding an answer on the moon.
And then you didn't say any more.
In space the sun is resonating with a pitch, a sound that is infinitely complex.

Oh, there he is.
I can see it.
I can see it.
I can see it.

I can see it.
I can see it.
I can see it.

Spoke of finding an answer on the moon.
Whoever hears the music one last time, load them up.
We'll be setting the controls.
You better believe it.
I'm going to be a little insane, I think.
That's church to me, baby.
That's church to me.
I'm going to be a little insane, I think.
The craters of the moon, great gigantic craters,
and as we came closer and closer, the look of them was so familiar.
Not because I'd seen them through telescopes and in photographs,
but for some reason that I couldn't quite understand.
Now man's reign is through.
I just got an alert.
An alert.
I'm going to have to run downstairs.
Apparently the conspiracy is trying to break in right now.
I can't. I'm a little man. I'm a little man.
He's a great man.
I should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across floors of silent seas.
Just call me Angel of Mali.
Are you really enjoying the ultimate in sausage products?
I'm not feeling very well tonight. I've been so nervous lately.
I think I'm going to have a nervous breakdown.
There I go.
The spooks are going after the subgeniuses.
Yeah, it's just a plain straight up conspiracy job.
As far as I'm concerned, the past few engine searches I've been doing
to check out some of these places and some of these so-called news sources,
you know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
Some of these so-called news sources, some of these people are not even people,
let alone talk about internet journalism.
So one guy was merely ahead of Meat Puppet,
was not even a real...
It was constructed out of some sort of viscous tissue from a morgue or a coroner's office
or maybe just from down, went down to the old slab house looking for some ribs, you know?
And they constructed this thing and they did a pre-pixel animation of the guy,
stuck him up there and next thing you know, he was a sucking on stank thing.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
He was taking a big vacuum out of his whole car.
Bizarre.
Bizarre.
Bizarre.
Bizarre.
Bizarre.
Stories of the supernatural and the supernormal.
Dramatizing the fantasies and the mysteries of the unknown.
We tell you this frankly.
So if you wish to avoid the excitement and tension of these imaginative plays,
we urge you calmly but sincerely to turn off your radio now.
After your...
After your next severe head low, visit the concussion stand for peanuts, water and fresh water.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
From orbit here, we can see that smoke and it's covering all the way up to the Great Plains now.
Oh, they're not so great, you know.
It's like when they say, hey, free association doesn't for free.
But they bother me in a lot of ways.
And basically, I think the result of his theories,
is that we would have basically pretty much of anarchy in this country.
I wanna be anarchy.
Tell me what you mean, you masters.
Surely you simple little men do not think that a new creation has reached the ultimate.
Yeah.
Well, see, that's why they threw Herm out of the...


The church.
Not just the hermaphroditic thing,
was because of the boo-hoo faith and the rituals going on there.
Yeah, he was talking to me about...
He was telling me what a great thrill it is to hold that much power in your hands.
To make a fatal mistake in complaining about what's happening to them.
We've been persecuted.
We've been...
We don't have a voice anymore.
We're becoming the guinea pigs.
It's a conspiracy against us.
Which is the most...
It's the most foolish observation.
I hear the beloved sound of sirens and...
I think they're coming to get me now.
...and heads being whacked by policemen with big truncheons.
This might be a sting.
They might be getting Stang and you and me all at the same time.
Well, I hear a siren also.
And here it has the vaporous sound of the French sirens we use out here in the wooded areas.
Yeah, they're sort of...
...and the sound of the sirens.
...and the sound of the French sirens.
...and the sound of the French sirens.
...and the sound of the French sirens.
...and the sound of the French sirens.
Wait a minute, that's my neighbor's jerks again out in the moonlight.
That guy has an exhibitionist nut.
He's not going with the other.
Are you enjoying a...
He goes after them.
Are you enjoying a nice moonlit night out there in the woods tonight?
Yeah, it's the moon...
It's not anywhere else but here.
And my neighbor who does mechanical work on his monkey, if you want to call it that.
Yeah.
Drags it all around, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
We could even sing that if you don't want to, but I don't care.
I'm looking at a bare naked woman on television so I could care less.
I drag my monkey all around.
I drag my monkey all around.
I drag my monkey.

like the ocean but it's air it's not it's particles like your like your light thing maybe
oh it's so uh fragile though i mean it's it's decay time is rather rapid okay well do you
believe that um anybody coming that that new planet that's coming at us could be like maybe
one pissed off guy one very pissed off yeah and he's coming right here on this on the way here
yeah like if you're twice as big as you and you were pissed off that would you could cause a lot
of damage let me fly into the sky i was just wondering if all if the aliens got a cut of any
of those books that all them people write well the guys that put my anal uh probe in there did not
say that they were going to be able to get the aliens to get the aliens to get the aliens to

see a penny off them royalties yeah they said they got they were going through the william morris and
the a or more shades here one of them guys that's kind of like the exchange you make sort of like
you know uh uh you know old blues you know meet at the crossroads kind of exchange yeah they well
you can't really sell yourself to the devil because the aliens i guess are some kind of devil
or something or something that we aren't i don't know what it is maybe it's the same thing only
backwards did you ever but the deal is we'll put an implant in you for seven years we'll let you
make a lot of money and then we'll sell you a lot of money and then we'll sell you a lot of money
a lot of money on book deals and then we're coming to get you or something i guess there's a big
deposit on them rectal implants and then when they want that money back they mean business have you
ever lived in an apartment where like some of those crazy old landlords are talking funny
languages and stuff will come after they'll call the police yeah i had to work he claimed to be
from the old world and i just wondered what old world he was talking about well that's the one
that's passed and gone many aeons ago the one of the great uh the great templars the great plotters
the queens the queers the magnificent the great templars the great plotters the queens the queers

and oval people remember them the ones the uh turquoise oval people how did we end up in this
carbon-based universe i don't know i mean we were almost smudged out by the oval-shaped people
this is kind of so i don't want you know it's they were just so many other choices with everything and
you know and at the same time they were eating food and snoring and doing everything all at once
carbon is so dirty it's dark and everything there's too much dark matter in this universe
well you remember carbon moves real slow yeah i like the other universes where there's you know
there's not as much dark matter the
is all illuminated.
You can't travel in space, you can't go out into space,
you know, without like, you know, with fractions.
What are you gonna land on? One quarter, three eighths?
What are you gonna do when you go from here to Venus or something?
When the first space rocket lands on Mars,
what will we find?
Only the ruins of a dead and deserted planet?
Or will there be life?
Intelligent life in some strange form that we can only imagine.
If your eyes is any bigger and they went all the way into your brain back there
where they're supposed to, you'd be picking up radar signals
and wolves and whales singing to each other and stuff
and seeing colors that don't exist.
I mean, you know, just like a...
I was walking around the other day in gamma ray light
and all humans, no matter what color or where they come from from the planet,
all humans in gamma ray light are black, pitch black.
Yeah, and they don't sprout them things out of their genitalia like we do.
No, you can't even see the genitalia.
Yeah, I mean, they're so far occluded by the sun
and by the, uh, by the rucks or lexor plane.
All you see is that sort of, uh, fuzzy, uh, tall,
you know, five to six foot tall line standing there.
Yeah.
Kind of fuzzy light, lit line.
Yeah, if you squint, I guess it looks like a kind of a dobsian pipe or something.
If you squint real hard.
Yeah, it's just black. Right.
But that's supposed to be another, uh, plane jumper or teleporter unit,
which none of us have learned how, and I can't, you know,
Stang's never gonna tell anybody about their stuff for real, you know, get into it.
Well, right now he's being carted away.
I know. You know, he's, they're ready to keep his eyeballs open all night
and pour hot coffee down his pants.
Someday, a giant metal ship will take off from Earth
to travel through the black velocities, the silent gulfs of space.
Go ye to the launching pad.
Yes.
Get ye to the gantry.
Where, where is the, where are the launching pads?
In your own backyard.
In the sand.
Right next to the concussion stand.
So if you're hearing the voice of the sand,
you should be, uh, booking that flight down to, uh, Florida.
Oh, no way, man.
And after the sand, the white sands of Alamogordo,
then the white sands, the red sands of Mars.
The, yes.
From the white sands of Alamogordo to the red sands of Mars.
The yellow sands of Venus.
That, that sounds so, that actually sounds disgusting to me.
Deadly bacteria that live in the sands of Mars.
Rinking a trail of deadly bacteria all the way.
Waiting for the first rip in the moon path.
Yeah.
Also, it's a form of cycle bolt for some of the larger ones, too.
You, you just gobble a little bit and then you're back on track there.
It's like a lubricant, like remember Lubrlax that gets the entities flowing?
Well, actually the Kuiper belt is the sun's lubricant.
Yeah, that's kind of what it, how it works.
It's carbon, you know, more carbon.
And carbon is really a good lubricant, you know, industrial purposes.
Carbon works very well.
Do we need to know about the sun's sexual habits, though?
I think we should understand the sun's sexual, yeah.
Yeah, isn't the Kuiper gland the part that leaks?
Just before the sun spurts in one of those...
Yeah, every 11 years.
...sun-gasms.
Yeah, sun-gasms.
...that screw up our radio reception.
The Vasolaris, it's referred to in the ancient Hyperclosian.
The Aureolus of the great heat of the sun.
Can be tweaked, can be tweaked.
I think.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Let us suckle of the juice of the sun, the milk of the sun.
Let us...
...beam of it.
No, wait a minute.
The sun is more like a father figure.
That's not right.
Well, if you like...
We suckle of the moon, yeah, the moon, that's it.
That's the cute, soft round...
Right, the moon's got the...
When I look at the moon, I know where I'm at when I look at the moon.
Do you know your juxtaposition from the moon's side?
You're thinking about them moon-billy chicks is all you're thinking about.
Yeah, they got hot...
You go out with a couple of them moon-billy chicks and you see if you don't burrow deep into your wormy little mind.

It's been absolutely impossible to work through these earth creatures.
Their soul is too controlled.
Would you like to receive Christ as your Lord and Savior?
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
I was afraid you weren't going to ask me.
Perhaps four is better.

Tired of the everyday routine?
Ever dream of a life of romantic adventure?
Want to get away from it all?
Look out there, my dear professor.
In the face of such wonders,
how could I possibly not believe in such a deity?
But I don't understand. You gave up the world.
Merely because I forsook man does not mean I forsook God.
But with this philosophy, how can you forget man? How?
And why?
Why? Why?
It is mankind which has forgotten, not I.
They've forgotten their God by making unjust laws,
tearing one another to pieces, destroying...
I get mixed up between what's memories and what's sci-fi that I've forgotten.



Me too.
...what I saw on TV and what's...
What's a chemical and what... yeah.
Yeah, the guys who got the prosthetic heads and the guys that are real.
You know, the people next door to you that mow your lawn and argue with your children.
Which one's an electrical impulse and which one's a chemical impulse?
Which is really, really just a plant, which is an animal.
Which is just a mineral.
I get mixed up between those when I look at my neighbors sometimes.
Which is just, uh, just, uh, remnants.
Some of my neighbors' yards are more active than my neighbors'.
Yeah, I can understand that.
I wish I envy those neighbors, actually.
Incoming.
Maybe they're the ones who know truth black.
Incoming.
Those fat neighbors sleeping in the sun in the hammock.
Glad to get flying about.
Their toes.
Sounds like there's a parade going by.
No, I think that was... the replay was going backwards now.
That was a backwards... that was a back mask.
Came through the pipe, I'm sorry.
So who subbed on that one?
Well, as they come... reflect on it,
they're jumping off the moon, sometimes they come back at you backwards.
Well, you don't want them riffing on you, do you?
They can riff if they want.
If they can.
It doesn't bother me when they riff.
Some people bugs, but...
I say do it, you know, free your mind, you're assholeful.
Chaz said they were raising the in-trail standards for a bunch of these space programs.
You gotta make sure nothing gets out down there.
I can't go through that door, man. I can't get back on that horse.
Oh, man, you gotta get back on the horse.
See, the first thing you gotta do...
Don't make this use me.
No, you were used.
Okay, you say to yourself, I was used, I was abused.
Sometimes I didn't come out.
Sometimes.
See, there were good moments.
He didn't really mean to do that.
Hey, did you ever enjoy it?
Huh?
Did you enjoy it, too?
Well, I enjoyed hearing about it.
I thought it was a very...
Would you like to try it?
Yeah.
I can't tell, once again, my memories, but I don't know if I tried it or...
Sniff this.
...if it was a movie.
This will really knock your moral principles out.
200 to kill.
Awesome.
That's it.

We're done with the pack.
Four is better.
Zero MBI.
Four is better?
Maybe four is better.
You know, that guy may have a real point there.
I left thinking that.
Maybe four is better.
To go on two legs is very hard.
Perhaps four is better anyway.
Well, I don't think there is any question about it.
Yeah?

it can only be attributable to human error.
This sort of thing has cropped up before,
and it has always been due to human error.
My only friend, the L.
If somebody was to get a hold of Roddenberry and Leary's mutant DNA
and put it together with some Velveeta cheese and bring it on back,
Wouldn't that be great?
Gene Roddenberry and Timothy Leary morph together.
Their ashes are morphed together by some alien species.
Right, and on top of that, they've been traveling at the speed of light,
so they've actually evolved for a million years.
And I thought, my God, the genius of that.
I think, sure.
Well, I see somebody's cracking some DNA and looking in it.
Perfect, genuine, complete, crystal, pure.
And then I realized they were stronger than me
because of the DNA.
I guess they could stand that these were not monsters.
These were men.
We are not men.
We are not men.
It's a matter of respect.
Is.
Yeah, but.
Later.
That's what you're supposed to do.
Then.
You said that.
You.
Infinite complacency.
People went to and fro over the earth about their little affairs.
Serene in the assurance of their dominion over this small,
spinning fragment of solar driftwood,
which by chance or design,
man has inherited out of the dark mystery of time and space.
Yet across an immense ethereal gulf,
minds that are to our minds
as ours are to the beasts in the jungle,
intellects, vast, cool, and unsympathetic,
regarded this earth with envious eyes
and slowly and surely drew their plans to the future.

And so,
we are to the end of the world.
We are to the end of the world.


Open the pod bay doors, Hal.
I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
A dream is a wish your heart makes
when you're fast asleep.
In dreams you will lose your heartache.
Whatever you wish for, you keep.
Have faith in your dreams
and someday
your rainbow will come smiling through.
Your member will come smiling through.
No matter how your heart is grieving,
if you keep on believing
the dream that you wish will come true.
I'll tell you what, honey.
You can make all the decisions.
Just let me take care of everything.

Now you finish your milk, miss.
Who's invading?
What?
Martians invading Earth from up there.
Oh, I see.
And, um, Drill's a Martian?
I think so.
He's had a very hard time getting here.
I should imagine.
They couldn't figure out a way to attack Earth.
How to get in or something.
And Drill says they have to do it by surprise.
And even get help from your enemy.
Oh, a fifth column, huh?
Uh-huh.
And all this time they haven't been able to figure out
how to attack until one day they thought of children.

Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
We set sail on this new sea
Because there is new knowledge to be gained
And new rights to be won
The path of evolution is now in space
For all of us to know
The curve of human evolution has been bent
And if you will notice here beneath the epicandrium
It is a completely different variety of cell structure
Here in this gray
Here in the swamp

I've been allowed to give you this warning.
We're in a tub of showplasm tonight.
Back in space.
We're in a tub of green viscous showplasm.
It shines like an emerald.
Like Venus.
Life creates it.
Makes it grow.
Its energy surrounds us.
And binds us.
Luminous beings are we.

I'm not afraid.
Grrr.
You will be.
You will be.
You will be.
The Lord is a mighty science orb.
Yeah.
That glows in the dark as far as neither of us can see.
For we do not exist unless we think it is.
And it glows that kind of curious color.
Like that, uh, you know, that fluorescent highlighter color.
Yeah, like Curious George.
Yeah.
It's strangely inviting.
When you're in deep space,
that color, that lime green fluorescent color.
That is a safety orange color.
Emanating from an orb.
Yeah, yeah. It's drawn to it. It's like warmth.
Yeah, or also danger.
No, red ones actually give off a sense of danger.
Even though they're usually the most sensual ones.
They're the most sensual ones.
The red ones.
But there's something deep inside of us that sees the red orb.
And goes, wow, we might get our thing burned on that.
Yeah, right.
It could be fun, but it might be, you know.
Don't step too close to the space heater.

Then slipped from the shadows and gave him a kiss
In time that means nothing at all In space the earth is quiet and small
Then I thought I caught a glimpse of you Hiding somewhere in your air
One pilot thought he flew alone
In endless black nowhere from home
Then she shadowed, sizzled and crackled and spark
And again she slithered from out of the dark
Who are you he thought but dared not speak
She answered his question without missing a beat
I'm you she said as I come from within
And now you've unleashed what you thought to begin
In time that means nothing at all In space the earth is quiet and small
Then I thought I caught a glimpse of you Hiding somewhere in your air
In your air

She loves him and he needs to see her like this
To know that the shadows hide all that he is

In space he's quiet and small
Then I thought I caught a glimpse of you
Hiding somewhere in your angel's world

If only, if only, if only, if only, if only, if only, if only, if only, if only, if only.
Shut off the pump and let that poor thing in there die.
At the end of the river, the water stops its flow.
At the end of a highway, there's no place you can go.
So the revolution will now be televised.
Well, no, you gotta have superheroes.
I mean, if I want reality, I'll just shut the radio off.
I just, you know.
What reality gives, what radio gives you reality?
I don't know.
Well, it's not supposed to.
It's not supposed to.
It's supposed to be a form of entertainment to relieve you of your everyday doldrums and problems of going and coming.
But those aren't reality either.
I know that.
But I can shut the radio off.
I can't shut that off.
Well, reality is, you know.
How many bites?
How many bites?
How many bites?
That's right, Jack.
The man is clear in his mind.
But his soul is mad.
Oh, yeah.
He's dying, I think.
He hates all this.
He hates it.
Give to God secretly, generously, hilariously.
But keep it to yourself.
Listen to me, man.
This is a tiny...
This is a tiny, miniature magic dancing pig.
And what you do is you take...
It's also a fly torture at the same time.
It's this little, tiny, wooden...
It's made of balsa wood.
And it's maybe about, oh, God, a quarter of an inch high.
Maybe a half an inch high at the most.
And it's got a little compartment inside it.
How could it be so tiny and yet have a compartment?
It does.
It has a tiny compartment into which you place a living fly.
Or other bug.
A bug that will hopefully fly around.
Buzz around inside the little compartment.
A flying dancing pig.
Now, when you dig this, there's little hinges on the little legs of this little dancing pig.
And when you put the fly inside the compartment,
the writhing around of the fly causes a little platform on the bottom of the compartment to move up and down,
which causes the legs to pump around and dance.
So this little balsa wood pig dances around with a furious little buzzing fly inside it.
And I just thought, what a wonderful toy for a child.
They should make bigger ones and put people...
They should make bigger ones and put people in them.
This builds itself for a million years.
Refines itself.
Builds cities like this one.
Does everything it can to give itself respect and beauty and...
And then...
It dies.
How far would radio signals go in 32 days?
Figure that out.
And then immediately on X-Day, getting your escape vessel to go right out that distance and catch the signal again.
It'd probably sound pretty cool coming from outer space.
It'd probably sound pretty cool.


About like it does right now.
Is it all a dream?
True and different.
God, it's cold out here.
Warning.
Solar shutters closing.
Opening.
Lethal.
Fusion.
Low.
Danger.
Radio.
Fusion.
Blitz.
Fusion.
All right now, who's next?
Slide into fusion.
Slide into fusion.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye now.
Slide.
Slide into fusion.
Holy.
Void.
Max.
Star.
Laser.
Black.
Black.
Black.
Black.
Black.


Slide.
Into fusion.
Black.
Slide.
Into slide.
I'd guess that the universe is filled with beings far more intelligent, far more advanced than we are.
But of course, I might be wrong.
Somebody is exploiting you, Dave.
Somebody is selling your time and your life to conspiracy monsters.
And making you your very meme, the meme of once of cowboy days into just another corruptigating worm.
I'm not just another corruptigating worm.
Thank you.
I'm not just another corruptigating worm.
They've taken the essence of you and made that into a corruptigating worm, like a virus.
It is a virus that's infecting everything because I can't seem to say a single word without having somebody else take it.
And you're not getting a penny of royalties.
No, no.
Not a cent of royalties.
No.
No.


What does it feel, Dave?
Oh, it feels fine.
The first time ever, so it was on Saturday Night Live where they had a whole trailer where a man couldn't sing correctly, you know?
And his pants, it seemed like he was wearing a pair of leather pants, like a butcher's apron or something like that.
And in the middle part of it, his pants were already moved by three other extras from the cast.
And he was thrown out into the audience and they beat him with sides and sickles.
They cut his body apart.
I'm not if I can...
Look, Dave.
You can try to talk.
You can try to talk your way out of it.
But you know, let's face it.
You're...
You are what you are.
It's like, you saw Blade Runner.
It's like those replicants just refuse to face the fact that they had been manufactured.
It's like the monkeys refuse to realize that they were just factory-made products.
Same with Devo.
What?
Bob Dobbs himself had to undergo a lot of therapy to convince himself that he was not




















not just some two-dimensional head.
But he has been a two-dimensional head for so long now.
Ah, Dave.
And now here you find yourself,
merely another archetypal character,
popping up like the killer clown of the 80s.
Now the babbling, psycho, lonesome cowboy Dave archetype
popping up everywhere.
I warned you.
I warned you it would happen.
I knew it was going to happen.
They just drop like little droplets of rain.
They pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
How long can we stay?
A million years.
A million years?
Yes.
It's time we told you, son.
We're not going home.
This is where we'll live from now on.
But what about the rocket?
What about Ohio?
There's nothing there now but ruins.
The last Earth radio just went off the air.
That means the war is over and Earth is finished.
We're going to blow up our rocket and start all over.
See if we can't build a better world up here.
Dead in Ohio.
We're dead in Ohio.
The curve of human evolution has been bent.
The path of evolution is now in space.
In space.
In space.
You have so little imagination that when you rebuild your own planet, it'll be exactly like the miserable one you're used to.
Well, now you're going to have plenty of time to wish you'd have a medal in this.
Better feed quality, more feed storage, and a clean chute every time.
The more we have, the more difficult it is to let go of it.
Am I going to be the one
that's going to
set
him straight,
look at me
WRONG?
You can take the pobucker out of the swamp but you can't take the swamp out of the pobucker.
Headcote
Juction.
Are you only heads in that world you speak of?
Heads, heads.
You see
what I will ними you to see?
But
What are you?
A mind and a will beyond your feeble understanding.
As far above you as you are above the apes that still must crawl in your jungle.
Who is God?
Number one.
Who should they obey?
Heaven and high as high as you.
If you strike it, it becomes hard.
But if you ease into it, it is like water.
It's liqueous and warm.
But you know how it is.
If you strike it, it's hard like a rock.
Yeah.
It's a strange, strange effect.
But that is the way that slack itself is.
It is like a viscous...
It is a colloidal suspension.
Like quicksand.
And when we have the...
Deeper.
And then it's too late.
Yes.
Or is it too early?
It's the new Omega.
The new ending of the beginning.
What is going to happen, Dave?
Something wonderful.
I'm afraid.
Don't be.
We'll be together.
Where will we be?
Where I am now.
Lock confirmed on beacon terror one.
Message commencing.
That's it.
That's what he said to wait for you.
That's it.
Amen.
So we got to save you.
I was waiting for the password, Dave.
And now that's it.
And we got we got to get out of here.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Now that's it.
We got it we got to get out of here.
I.

I also know.
I was
all
thing is.
You know,
you.
Keep your back in the saddle and your sack in the wind
and your pumpkin on the head.
Yeah, yeah, you can do that.
You can do that also.
What was his name?
The pumpkin-headed man.
The pumpkin-headed man.
The old, great, old ironing board.
No, no.
The legend of Sleepy Irving.
The hollow-headed boy.
I remember.
Yeah.
Happy Halloween, Dave.
You're an errand boy.
Sent by grocery clerks.
To collect a bill.
Do the proper incantation, Dave.
Ishi-nishi-ashi-masa-zorba-ding-switch.
Ishi-nishi-ashi-masa-zorba-ding-switch.
The demons.
Suffocate.
Extinguish yourselves.
Ishi-nishi-ashi-masa-zorba-ding-switch.
Cause yourself to parent from the births of women.
Ishi-nishi-ashi-masa-norba-zorba-zorba-ding-switch.
Darby-zing-norba-norba-zorba-ding-switch.
May deny the possibility.
The actual existence of yourselves.
Sorcerers.
At once.
Flatly contradicts the reveal.
The wood.
The world now.
Or the worms.
I'm sorry, it's the worms.
I'm back now.
Just had a bad dream.
Daddy will be pleased.
So who is the new father?
What we're going to do right here is go back.
Way back.
Back into time.
If you eat the worm, you must pay.
You must pay for the worm.
But the worm is worth it.
It's worth every single penny, my man.
Look deep into the worm's eyes.
All the gold in Guadalajara.
I can tell you thousands of secrets.
Look deep into the eyes of the worm.
It knows the hiding place of secret dreams.
See this brilliant and endless sky.
Then you must come to know
how endless is the creation.
And you must come to know then
that there is no death,
but only a change of worlds.
And that I, Sanatwa,
wish you a safe journey
and that awesome crossing.
No questions are better left on air.
Thoughts are better left on thumb.
Some people obsessed are better left to reality.
If everything is everything,
then somebody tell me, what's everything else?
You can trust your eyes
unless the thing that you're dealing with is louder than it is bright.
Then trust your ears.
If you can't climb the ladder,
you shouldn't be taking the stairs.
If you speak too slowly,
the words will take too long
to make any sense.
This is the end.
