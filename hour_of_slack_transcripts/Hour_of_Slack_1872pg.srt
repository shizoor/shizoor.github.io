00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,920
The Self Genius Power of Smoking

2
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,980
The Self Genius Power of Smoking

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,380
Don't you ever know, uber women, uber men

4
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,980
Doing everything we can to yell about the word

5
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,280
Adopt and verbally attack

6
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,780
To praise our heavy heritage and follow in our slack

7
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,660
The Self Genius Levi

8
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,160
That taps into the high vibe

9
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,460
While simultaneously and successfully

10
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,900
Manipulating both space and time

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,220
I'm a Self Genius Bar, damn it

12
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,020
I'm the head of the Industrial National Committee

13
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,920
We're blowing psychic snog rockets out of all three tonight

14
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,980
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

15
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,880
Zero, one, three, four

17
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,360
I sure ain't Cupid, but I am a Ghanaiite

18
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,980
I can feel the sounds of my farts with the meows of kittens

19
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,860
Kittens for Bob and Catnip and Fropp

20
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,620
Kittens for Bob and Catnip and Fropp

21
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,960
Fart, fart, right now, jump it up

22
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,680
Jump on the slope, get out of the studio

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,140
Go for a cab, handle a joke

24
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,700
That's my fault

25
00:01:59,700 --> 00:01:59,980
Fart, fart, right now, jump it up

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,580
Break a tornado, jump on the slope

27
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,080
Now, spin on, brains, I can't handle a joke

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,640
Spin on

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,040
Spin on

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,860
Winning most sweden baseballs

31
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,060
The greatest stuff

32
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,520
And most amazing songs

33
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,380
That big time

34
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,080
And we're on the screen

35
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,640
Yeah

36
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,840
So, screw the brainstorm

37
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,520
The only half of the way

38
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,520


39
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,520


40
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,520


41
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,520


42
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,520


43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,520


44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,520


45
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,680
One more time

46
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,480
One more time

47
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:51,480


48
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:51,620
Telling it, 한

49
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:51,720
Happy to see ya

50
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:51,720


51
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:51,720


52
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:51,780
Fallen

BLACK

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,200


57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,240
Go all your way

58
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,240


59
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,240


60
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,240


61
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,500
I am Jez基idas

62
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,020
All these things are genuinely strange

63
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:06,760
1960, which I saw at age seven, and it blew my mind and probably set me off on my journey into

64
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:14,340
weirdness and fun and bulldata. And I'd also watched a kind of making of The Time Machine,

65
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,840
including an epilogue to the story. The very next thing I did was check my email, and the first

66
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:31,100
thing up was the promo for Songs for Time Travel, a new album by Rubik's Pube. How can such things

67
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:40,100
even be? They must have been time traveling. Songs for Time Travel. Anyway, Rubik's Pube is a great

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,160
mountain-based mutant rock band that has played at many X Days and Devivals and bars and festivals.

69
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,580
In fact, some members, like Lord

70
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:50,820
Roe,

71
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:57,000
son of Sinfaltimus Ex Mortis, have been doing so since they were young teenagers.

72
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:07,760
That lead guitar player and singer, Reverend Ness, incidentally, is as jaw-droopingly beautiful

73
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:15,880
as her sounds are, as it says here. Jaw-droopingly beautiful. Well, that's good.

74
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,540
Anyway, tonight I have two news items, friends. For the

75
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:20,820
last time, I'm going to be talking about a song called Rock God, which is a song that I've been

76
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,420
playing. The last couple of shows, I've been playing readings from the Subgenius mystery novel,

77
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:33,940
The Agent and Mr. Dobbs, and I'll play more tonight. And the book is now finally available.

78
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:41,420
It's out. It's in our catalog on subgenius.com, but probably not for long. It's a very limited

79
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,900
edition in hardback. In fact, I announced it yesterday, and about half of the 40 copies are

80
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,900
already gone, even though it's expensive.

81
00:04:51,080 --> 00:05:00,340
Here's the ad. Two brain-gnarling spy thriller mystery novellas starring J.R. Bob Dobbs in one

82
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,980
limited numbered hardcover edition. Only 50 were printed, and the author has three of them.

83
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:16,160
In the early 60s, this is the plot description, an earnest patriotic and pink agent for the Feds

84
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,800
is assigned to the seriously insane national security case of Bob Dobbs.

85
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,960
He's drawn by Dobbs down a rabbit hole that turns into a wormhole of froth madness,

86
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:35,320
surreal sex with Connie, Bigfoot, and Greys, bizarre parties with JFK, Hitler,

87
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:42,860
Lee Harvey Oswald, Fidel Castro, Nikita Khrushchev, and Timothy Leary, and unspeakable

88
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:49,740
experiences that make him question what he had mistakenly thought of as reality. It's like

89
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:57,020
H.P. Lovecraft by way of Raymond Chandler by way of R. Crumb, like a David Lynch movie with a dollop

90
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:04,440
of the Three Stooges, like a Bugs Bunny cartoon guest directed by David Cronenberg, like an S.

91
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:12,060
Clay Wilson comic novelized by Franz Kafka. Now, friends, this is me talking. I've written two

92
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,120
subgenius movie screenplays, but if some Hollywood hotshot approached me saying,

93
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,140
I've got a hundred million bucks for a big subgenius movie,

94
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,980
I'd hand him this book. It's really hilarious, and honestly, it's my very favorite portrait of

95
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:36,820
Bob so far. Let us just pray that it is indeed fiction. Extremely collectible. The forward is

96
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,460
signed and dated by Ivan Stang. Don't look for this on Amazon. It's available only from

97
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:49,160
Subgenius Foundation. Look in our catalog. Actually, the link is subgenius.com

98
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:57,940
slash catalog slash books, but just go to the Bulldog of Time Control store or look at the

99
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:04,600
front page, the home page of subgenius.com, and there you will see somewhere, if you read close

100
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,660
enough, you'll see it listed, along with the other three new novels. No, two other new novels.

101
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:18,420
Oh, by the way, the music in the background is the Empire Jazz Orchestra. Our friend, Reverend

102
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:26,740
Teeters, ran that, and this was an album called Out of the Mist. This is a quiet one there in the

103
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:33,580
background. Okay. The other news is about X-Day, where and when, but first, let's hear more Agent

104
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:44,000
and Mr. Dobbs. And now I'm going to read part five of the Agent and Mr. Dobbs, which was brought to

105
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,980
us by Reverend Teeters LaVerge, although it's actually written by this unnamed agent.

106
00:07:49,940 --> 00:08:00,380
Okay. Is everything, everything's running right? Good. After all the monkey business, as Bob called

107
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:06,440
it, he was in a much better mood. I suppose all that man needs is to take a number three and fling

108
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:13,560
a bit of feces around to, quote, even his keel. His grin was radiant as we walked out into that

109
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,260
hot, humid night. We tarried around his car for a few minutes. They were the most relaxed moments

110
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:25,500
I'd had with Mr. Dobbs up to this point. I offhandedly asked him for a cigarette, and though

111
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,020
I had never seen him smoke anything but his infernal pipe, he pulled a pack of my favorite

112
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:37,680
brand of smokes, Old Tar Lung, from his jacket pocket. It was a needed smoke, one that I had

113
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,620
not had since I got rotated back from Korea in 52. Bob smiled at my obvious joy, telling me,

114
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,640
those coffin nails sure make a tasty cancer in you, Binks.

115
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,780
I put it on my fresh-sliced human pain toast every morning. Bob then hopped, like a drunken

116
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,600
rabbit, into the driver's side of the vehicle and shouted to me that, now we're gonna have

117
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,600
some real good fun, boy. Get in. Now! He then let out the most outrageously poor simulation

118
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:14,760
of a rebel yell that I have ever heard. It sounded more like the mating calls of those

119
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,120
great apes that reside in the deepest, darkest Congo.

120
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,400
Bob went in, muttering, , while crouched and

121
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:21,400


122
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,900
In fact, I think I heard him out of the car.

123
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,180
Our backs liability would be so much higher if he wouldn't be in the car, looking down

124
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,180


125
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:35,500
So, we started applying our foreign sleep cookies, in the food andósabout goods

126
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,460
that we might get taking a walk.

127
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:46,080
Birthright foremost, we needули to workues our dream. We would Dionin't take any more

128
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,600
help.

129
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,300
Of course, we needulwend to Curtis, James,Crillby.

130
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,960
me in an oily voice that you're looking sweeter by the minute. My heart was in my throat, not only

131
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:01,280
because of the insane driving, but I also feared that Bob might have other, more perverted plans

132
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:08,560
for me. This seemed too painfully real of a possibility for me, for Bob started to sniff

133
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:17,040
the air lustfully and play pocket pool again, vigorously. After a few tense moments for me,

134
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,860
Mr. Dobbs was cool as a perverted cucumber the whole time, we finally slid to a halt in front

135
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,640
of what I can only describe as the most stinking, run-down, decrepit roadhouse that ever sat in the

136
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,680
middle of nowhere. It was a truly ramshackle affair, half of the neon signs only had a letter

137
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:41,720
or two lit up, there was a huge pile of smelly trash out front, I discerned humanoid skulls in

138
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,460
the pile, and the peeling paint said it all with the structures, sign,

139
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:57,840
dangling off to one side, ye olde, exist, bar and grill-y. If the outside was a shambles,

140
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,180
then the inside was worse. It smelled like a cheap brewery that had been forgotten in an

141
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:09,540
open sewer since the reign of Ashurnasalpal II. I wondered why the hell Bob, a man of such wealth

142
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,360
who could easily afford to go to any of the finest clubs in Florida, would take me here.

143
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,020
It then occurred to me that this may be the case.

144
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,720
It could just be THE whorehouse. When we walked in the joint, the place erupted with drunken shouts

145
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:31,400
of Bob, and for some reason, JAR. I stood amazed, for the clientele was astounding by anybody's

146
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:39,740
standard. I saw John Birch passionately kissing Mousy Tongue in one corner, our vice president

147
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:46,380
rubbing the crotch of the preserved corpse of Stalin while drunkenly shouting about damn pinko

148
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:56,940
tits. Emma Goldman's disembodied head screaming the Internationale. M blanked out, M blanked out,

149
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:03,480
stabbing, I was later to learn, our actual non-clone president in the right eye with a fork

150
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,300
while Frank Sinatra groveled at her feet. There were also, and the rest of the page is blanked out,

151
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,240
and the young folk singer Bob Dylan. Richard Attenborough was filming it all.

152
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,020
The worst part, however, was that the film was not a film. It was a film that was a film. It was a film that was a film.

153
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:24,080
The worst part, however, were the whores in the joint. Greys, greens, mobs, reptilians,

154
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:31,040
anti-reptilians, them, and ones that I did not recognize. They were all gaudily dressed as

155
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,040
housewives, construction workers, maids, businessmen, house painters, bee girls, dead astronauts,

156
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:44,780
the list goes on, and all had horribly cheap bouffant wigs on. Bob handed me a jar of yellowish

157
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,000
fluid and a handful of piss. I was so scared, I was so scared, I was so scared, I was so scared,

158
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,160
telling me that he would soon be back. He took a dozen of the whores up with him,

159
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:59,420
winking sickeningly at me. I swallowed the pills dry. When Bob eventually made it back down to the

160
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:06,360
bar where I'd seated myself, sipping a cheap beer, his face was all aglow. Literally, it shone green,

161
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:15,720
then red. One of those gray creatures was behind the bar, pouring a jelly jar full of vodka for

162
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,980
premier quality. I was so scared, I was so scared, I was so scared, I was so scared, I was so scared,

163
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,160
I was so scared, I was so scared, I was so scared, I was so scared, I was so scared.

164
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,160


165
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,160


166
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,620
Bob sat down between us. He still had a satisfied grin on his face that smacked of unknowable

167
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:30,980
pleasures. Bob suggested that we have a drinking contest. The pills were really kicking in at this

168
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,500
point, so I found it hard to believe my eyes, but even harder to deny what I was actually seeing.

169
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:42,100
This is our place, the real place where things get done, he whispered to me.

170
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,600
Then, speaking directly to the premier of the Soviet Union,

171
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,080
he said,

172
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,860
So, Nicky, think you can drink me under the table tonight, eh?

173
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,520
Khrushchev looked at Bob straight in the eye, something I've seen very few attempt.

174
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:02,440
Yes, Mr. Noobs, I drink until you, how you say, blow O-ring.

175
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:10,580
The gray then passed Bob, Khrushchev, and I, a full jelly jar each of vodka. Both Khrushchev

176
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:16,780
and Bob down there, I was halfway through mine, had to run outside to vomit. I swear, it was

177
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,720
paint thinner, the label on the bottle had paint thinner crossed out and vodka written underneath.

178
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,660
My original guess of it being moonshine was awfully wrong.

179
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:33,320
When I stumbled back in, bleary-eyed, I bumped into no less than Richard M. Nixon. Even if my

180
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:39,700
eyes were blurred, I could not mistake his voice. He cursed me as he chased a small dog around.

181
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:46,340
I made my weaving way back up to the bar where Bob and Nicky were now glaring and laughing,

182
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:51,440
panicking at each other while pounding their shoes on the bar top. It would seem that Bob

183
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,860
had won the paint thinner drinking contest, for as I sat down on my stool, Khrushchev's

184
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,100
eyes rolled to the back of his head and he fell off his bar stool onto the sodden floor

185
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,740
and into oblivion. I was horrified and asked Bob if he were all right, for this could be

186
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:13,360
a potentially world destructive event. Mr. Noobs told me, he's fine, the little tyke,

187
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,760
he'll be ready for another one in the morning. But first, young man, I'm going to go to the bar.

188
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:16,760


189
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:41,820
I was so worried about Bob that I had to run back outside to get sick again. It smelled like

190
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,740
rotten fish bait. Bob seemed to relish them, for he ate the whole large bucketful, and he was so

191
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:54,500
grimy. He let out a belch and for some reason rubbed his backside. I vomited harder at that

192
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:03,280
stench. When I made it back inside, Bob told me he wanted to try my luck out at one of the many

193
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:09,540
card tables. The rest of the evening was a horrible blur, for not only did he force feed me pills,

194
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,980
but he kept buying round after round of the local actual moonshine, thank God. Mr. Noobs could hold

195
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,500
his liquor.

196
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,320
Bob was a very good guy, though he did seem to flicker bodily on and off like a broken television,

197
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:28,780
especially when he did poorly at the games of chance. At one point, we, Bob, Mao, Churchill,

198
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:35,620
a beatnik type, Ed Sullivan, a strange alien looking creature with the face of a cuttlefish,

199
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:41,040
and I, were playing some sort of complicated card game where the cards themselves represented

200
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,760
different currencies, worlds, and immortal souls.

201
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:53,580
Bob lost the big hand of the night. In a rare fit of anger, he grabbed the cards from the alien and threw them on the floor, cursing,

202
00:16:53,660 --> 00:17:03,520
Well, I do believe that I've been cheated. He then grabbed, wrong side up it seemed to me, an IOU written on a bar napkin and squinted his drunken eyes at it, saying,

203
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:10,440
I guess I'll see you in 1998. He slurred under his breath,

204
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,700
Mwuh-kuh-dee-mwuh-hah-kin-kuh.

205
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,560
Ah, screw you, you damn cheating.

206
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,680
Squid. Though it was Bob, I knew who had been the one that was cheating, for he kept, not very slickly, mind you,

207
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,300
grabbing cards out of my hand when he claimed he needed them.

208
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,460
The whole event, from what I can remember, was pathetic,

209
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,720
but what disturbed me the most was one of the cards had a picture of our planet on it,

210
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,060
and the alien looking creature seemed to relish the fact that he had won it.

211
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,740
Bob, in a panicked state that I've never seen before, hustled me so violently toward the door that we knocked over the door.

212
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,060
In his later years, which was almost never going to be as mangeous as Bob was,

213
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,060


214
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,060


215
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,060


216
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,280
it was the famous stair-walking man, perhaps the best ever, with noplace in Mr. Nixon,

217
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:52,780
who is sitting cross-legged on the floor, grilling skewers of meat over an open fire.

218
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,620
He cursed us, mumbling that he got the taste for dog,

219
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,220
while doing some brain massaging,

220
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,360
during a trip to North Korea and how we ruined his meal,

221
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,420
though we'd all soon be dancing to his tune.

222
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,180
Nixon did, however, hand us a cheaply mimeographed booklet

223
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,140
entitled How to Serve Man.

224
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,560
With that, Mr. Dobbs' face relaxed a little.

225
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,560
He nudged me with his elbow, grinning,

226
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,220
and saying in a bit of an oily voice,

227
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,800
good recipes in this one.

228
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,260
He chuckled to himself as we walked out into the misty morning light.

229
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,760
I can still hear the dreadful sound and import

230
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,480
of his index finger tapping hard

231
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,420
against that thin manual of evil.

232
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:57,960
Ooh!

233
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,280
F***!

234
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,900
F***!

235
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,520
F***!

236
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:03,880
F***!

237
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:04,360


238
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,720
F***!

239
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,240
Warning! I voted.

240
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,760
And season with a sauce that's zesty.

241
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,160
Yet delightfully mild to please the entire family.

242
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Popcorn.

243
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,920
You will feel a intense need to urinate.

244
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:49,380
Whatever happens, do not urinate.

245
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:07,760
Try your best to adapt into therie,

246
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,820
However it might help to lose your guard.

247
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,700
Last two days have illness caused by a man of yours.

248
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,520
You can live less lose him.

249
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,140
Lady.

250
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,760
the gardener.

251
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,240
How do you see it?

252
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,240


253
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,160
I don't know.

254
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:27,220
I don't know.

255
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:57,220
I don't know.

256
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,680
I don't know.

257
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,140
I don't know.

258
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:26,600
I don't know.

259
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:57,060
I don't know.

260
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:12,320
I don't know.

261
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,300
I don't know.

262
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,900
I don't know.

263
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:42,640
I don't know.

264
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:25,160
I don't know.

265
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:55,760
I don't know.

266
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,420
I don't know.

267
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,320
I don't know.

268
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,860
I don't know.

269
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:54,620
I don't know.

270
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:02,620
Mr. Dobbs then gave the man a gentle kiss on the forehead and winked at me, whispering,

271
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,160
We don't need no damn agents.

272
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:15,720
I understood, and as he left the house, I noticed that somehow, as usual, Bob had made off with their wallets.

273
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:57,240
I understood, and as he left the house, I noticed that somehow, as usual, Bob had made off with their wallets.

274
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:02,380
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man.

275
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:36,900
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man.

276
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:27,240
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man.

277
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,240
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man.

278
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:05,880
The drive through the countryside was lovely until Bob made a serious face again and said that we had best hang low until things blow over.

279
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:12,820
I know the place to go. A little inn I have that I like to call Shamalot.

280
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,260
It took us a while to get to this Shamalot, for Mr. Dobbs seemed to always forget where we were driving.

281
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,940
He'd stop off at random diners, trinket shops, gas stations, etc.

282
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:29,020
where he would feel impelled to make a sale.

283
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,160
Then we would drive back off in the direction we'd just come from.

284
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,280
Bob always had something in the trunk of his car to sell to these vendors.

285
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:45,660
It was as if he had a second sense for the sale and that was what guided him.

286
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,920
Where we ended up was exactly where he wanted to go in the first place.

287
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,940
We did indeed make it eventually to Shamalot.

288
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:54,860
Shamalot.

289
00:33:54,860 --> 00:34:02,480
It was actually an underground type bomb shelter that Bob had off the main kitchen in a sprawling hotel complex in rural Virginia.

290
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,040
I followed him through the venue. It was a very well appointed hotel.

291
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:12,340
Yet the staff seemed lethargic and prone to bumbling and stumbling around.

292
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:17,900
I thought at first that they may have all been overworked or drunk.

293
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:24,700
Until I noticed that most of them would shamble off into a dark corner and take a puff off a...

294
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,520
smile pipe every chance they could get.

295
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,080
The tobacco they smoked smelled very much like Bob's, just not as nauseating.

296
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:41,520
We wended our way through this maze until we got to a heavy steel door on which was messily painted a la The Little Rascals.

297
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,340
Shamalot.

298
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,760
No pinks a loud.

299
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,020
I recognized Bob's childish scrawl and poor spelling.

300
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,460
So this then would be...

301
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,340
our safe haven.

302
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:06,920
Well friends, that is the end of The Agent and Mr. Dobbs Part 6, translated by Reverend Teeters La Verge.

303
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:17,180
The music in the background is by Speed Cave from the CD Rocket Ships and Apple Pie.

304
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:24,840
I believe that the correct way to read Speed Cave is speedcave.com.

305
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:46,080
I Someday 1977

306
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,080


307
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,080


308
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,080


309
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,080


310
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,080


311
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,080


312
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,080


313
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:53,440
it is

314
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:54,840


315
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:54,840


316
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,360
I am a handful of brick and gravel

317
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,900
Thrown in the gearbox of the time machine

318
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,220
The beaten heart will come to a standstill

319
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,780
Throws emotion in the middle of the stream

320
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,680
As can crack a rock without a sound

321
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,180
As the clock ticks, as the clock ticks down

322
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,020
You learn to love me, you learn to leave me

323
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,520
I can't explain it, it's just something that I do

324
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,700
I drive you crazy, not in a good way

325
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,080
Life with lady comes with turning up the screw

326
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,840
In the distance hear the grinding sound

327
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,560
As the clock ticks, as the clock ticks down

328
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,100
I draw a long map

329
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,480
And watching the valley

330
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,680
I draw the long man

331
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,720
Climbing the rise

332
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,340
I ride the chalk horse

333
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,760
Over the mountain

334
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,100
I stack the stones

335
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,960
To the summer sunrise

336
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,940
You overrate me, you learn to hate me

337
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,440
It's all related to the dullness of the night

338
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,580
You learn to doubt me, go on without me

339
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,020
Ignore the numbers for the rest of your life

340
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,840
We will be moving to the higher ground

341
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,440
As the clock ticks, as the clock ticks down

342
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,000
We're all living in the lost and found

343
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,560
As the clock ticks, as the clock ticks down

344
00:37:52,280 --> 00:38:07,060
As the clock ticks, as the clock ticks down

345
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,960
I draw the long map

346
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,780
I draw the long map

347
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,920
I draw the long map

348
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:16,960
I draw the long map

349
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,220
I draw the long map

350
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,580
Bob Walkinhorst sang as the clock ticks down.

351
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,940
The latest of his monthly songs

352
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,440
that are usually available only via Patreon.

353
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,740
I happen to be a happy subscriber.

354
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,980
I'd love to play all those songs

355
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,720
but then you might not subscribe.

356
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,700
And now this.

357
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,260
Chamelot, the place which I expected

358
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,000
to look like a typical bomb shelter

359
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,780
was more a mixture of

360
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,200
a perverted hip swingers pad, a communications center of the First Order,

361
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,860
a hillbilly's hovel, and a museum of oddities.

362
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,660
There was a large, stuffed, Bigfoot-looking creature

363
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,560
standing next to a utilitarian army surplus metal desk.

364
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,200
A bloody scimitar was crudely duct-taped to the thing's right hand,

365
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,760
and at the bottom of the statue, along with a pile of dusty humanoid skulls,

366
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,720
was a plaque that stated,

367
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:26,380
J.B. Exlatel Dobbs XIII, the Beaten Fist of Jehovah One.

368
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:32,520
I could not tell you if the thing was once a real beast or not,

369
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,620
but its furry body sure stank like the froth that Bob always smoked.

370
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:44,660
As I looked over the shelter-slash-swingers pad of Bob's,

371
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,000
mostly to find an alternate escape route,

372
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,660
I became aware of the fact that we were not alone.

373
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:55,260
For, from a far corner came the sound of shallow, rasping breaths.

374
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,280
Even after all the events that I had witnessed,

375
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,060
I still held some fear of the unknown in my heart.

376
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:06,160
With trepidation, I slowly walked to the corner where the sounds emanated.

377
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,460
There, in an easy chair, illuminated by the dim and wavy light of a lava lamp,

378
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,740
sat a great, beautiful, and wonderful creature.

379
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,260
It was a grotesque version of what was once probably human.

380
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,260
Its face was a sickening parody.

381
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,800
It had a permanent sardonic grin,

382
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,780
and between its strained lips was a poorly grafted-on pipe, much like Bob's.

383
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:33,820
The thing exuded a continuous soft and disgusting chuckle

384
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:37,580
that sounded like the sarcasm of the damned.

385
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,860
I found myself backing away, but with a withered hand,

386
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,180
the thing beckoned me to it.

387
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,680
It chuckled,

388
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,060
Have I got a joke for you?

389
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,960
The thing then proceeded to tell a long, rambling, and incoherent joke

390
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,320
about a priest, a pink, and a yeti that go to some bar.

391
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,240
It made no sense whatsoever, yet the creature kept laughing to itself

392
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,780
as it puffed on its pipe.

393
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,940
I did not even notice that Bob had come over and was standing next to me

394
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,920
until he let out a room-shaking guffaw at what I suppose was the punchline,

395
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,720
which went something like,

396
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:19,620
Humanity popping like a bunch of damn crawfish in a hot skillet.

397
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,860
I shook my head and told this thing before me to shut the hell up

398
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,120
and that we may be on the brink of atomic war.

399
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,340
Mr. Dobbs twisted my ear in a most painful manner

400
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,680
and, while patting the thing on its shoulder, said,

401
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,120
F*** them if they can't take a joke.

402
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:42,180
Suddenly, a very real and cold fear gripped my heart.

403
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,720
I asked Bob if he knew something.

404
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,620
Something I didn't.

405
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,680
Did Khrushchev die of alcohol poisoning?

406
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,680
Did the commies assassinate our president in retaliation?

407
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,160
Were we on the brink of atomic destruction?

408
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,800
Bob just played pocket pool and chuckled,

409
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,840
Nuclear war is the least of your worries, young agent.

410
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,480
At least after last night's card game.

411
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,580
It was then that the room suddenly lit up in red lights

412
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,400
and a klaxon started to sound.

413
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,720
Bob jumped up and down like a child on Christmas Day, yet,

414
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:14,860
he was yelling,

415
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,320
That's Connie calling!

416
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,640
That's Connie calling!

417
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:23,040
He skipped, I'm not kidding, skipped over to a video telephonic device.

418
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,880
There he sat down, fidgeting on a large leather swivel chair,

419
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,920
furiously playing pocket pool.

420
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:35,860
Hi, sweetie spleen, he said to the beautiful image of Connie on the video screen.

421
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,100
What are you doing in our Dallas compound?

422
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,160
Mr. Dobbs smiled stupidly as Connie said,

423
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,520
Well, dearie,

424
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,220
I had a little party at the compound last night and,

425
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,940
Well, it would seem that I made a little joke with Jackie

426
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,820
about pranking the president.

427
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,240
You know what a card he is.

428
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,660
And it would seem that three of the doctors overheard.

429
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,080
Mr. Dobbs just nodded his head,

430
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,560
smiling as if he could picture the party in his, quote, mind, unquote.

431
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,340
Well, this morning those doctors got all drunked up and took some rifles and,

432
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,980
Well, dearie,

433
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:19,860
it would seem that Dr. Oswald was a tad bit too tipsy and grabbed some real bullets instead of the rubber kind.

434
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,000
Connie made a gesture and on the video screen appeared Dr. Oswald,

435
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,220
looking sheepish and more than a bit hungover.

436
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,300
Sorry, Bob, he said with a hangdog expression on his face,

437
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,540
obviously twisting his foot on the floor in shame.

438
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,060
Connie, as a reward, popped a pill in his mouth,

439
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,640
which he gobbled down like an obedient dog.

440
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,360
It's okay, Dr. Oswald, Bob said.

441
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,720
We all make mistakes.

442
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,640
F**k up, man up, man shut the f**k up is the motto, isn't it?

443
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,300
I was shocked again at Bob's levity in situations of danger.

444
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,060
Well, f**k us if we can't take a joke.

445
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,720
Bob elbowed me so hard in the ribs that I fell over gasping.

446
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,740
Have Connie give you a few more pills and fifty cents to go see a movie.

447
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,660
I'll call Johnny Boy and clear the whole thing up.

448
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,640
Dr. Oswald nodded obediently and walked away from the screen,

449
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,460
grinning like a reprieved man chewing a big mouthful of pills.

450
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,380
Look, Connie, Bob said, where is Dr. Ruby?

451
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,740
He and the other doctors are down at his strip joint keeping the party going,

452
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,360
Connie replied, looking as radiant as ever.

453
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,420
Well, do me a favor, honey bunch of synapses, and go down there and tell Dr. Ruby

454
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,720
that I have a job for you.

455
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:46,640
I want him to take Dr. Oswald out, Bob said.

456
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,900
Will do, Connie chirped as they jiggled their fingers at their throats,

457
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:55,140
making a strange noise and hung up their video phones.

458
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,260
Bob then looked strangely thoughtful for a moment.

459
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:09,900
I guess I should have told Connie that the job was to get Dr. Oswald out of the country for a little bit.

460
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,000
Hmm.

461
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,040
He then pulled a folder full of photos from the desk drawer

462
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:21,420
and started to meticulously cut and paste Dr. Oswald's head onto various figures,

463
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,860
railroad conductors, nurses, dinosaurs, and figures of men holding rifles,

464
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:31,120
with crudely painted signs that said, I did it.

465
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:38,740
He sighed a lot during the process until the sighs became a sort of barking noise, guttural, animalistic.

466
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,720
He got up and started to cry.

467
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,800
He smoothed the non-existent wrinkles from his trousers right before he pulled them down

468
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,600
and sat on a portable chemical toilet.

469
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,560
I averted my eyes until Bob yelled,

470
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,260
Gaze upon me, little pink!

471
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,080
I actually stumbled backwards at the timbre of his voice,

472
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:04,400
yet I found myself obeying his command as I dragged a metal folding chair over to him

473
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,120
and sat within a few mere inches from him as he did his business,

474
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,580
which in itself was odd, for as I gazed upon his face,

475
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,580
it turned rather vividly from green to red to blue and back to green again,

476
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,280
until, with the sound of a million balloons popping simultaneously,

477
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,340
what was previously a very serious, strained look on his face

478
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:31,180
transformed into the usual moronic and placid visage

479
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:37,420
that I not only would see in person, but in my own mind as well when I closed my eyes.

480
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:41,560
I suspect that I was going insane.

481
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:46,060
From all the pills and slack, one could only guess.

482
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:52,920
My feeling of insanity was pretty much cemented when Bob picked up a girly pink video phone

483
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,280
and called our still-living president.

484
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:03,380
It appeared that the SOB was a dipsomaniac, a whoremonger, and still at that bordello in Florida.

485
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,400
A grey with a powder blue background,

486
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,160
a bouffant wig came up on screen looking annoyed,

487
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:13,420
its huge eyes were clouded over and drunk,

488
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,500
as it rolled over and got the president on the phone.

489
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:24,180
Our president rubbed his red-rimmed eyes and in an irritated, stuttering voice

490
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,420
asked first if Jackie were there.

491
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,120
When soothingly reassured by Bob that she was back in Dallas,

492
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:36,580
he calmed down a bit until he was told of all that had transpired in his besotted absence.

493
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,880
The president jumped out of bed.

494
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:44,740
He was clothed in a, and here it's a blanked out, uniform, a something uniform.

495
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,800
I lost all respect for him at that point,

496
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:54,340
but could only admire his obvious abilities as M blanked out, M blanked out.

497
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,740
Some M something, M something.

498
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,120
I personally suspect it might be Marilyn Monroe.

499
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:07,240
As the MM and the bouffanted grey kept adjusting the eye patch,

500
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:13,800
which it would seem covered the damage that MM had done to it the night before with a fork.

501
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,740
I listened in as the two of them conversed.

502
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:21,720
Bob kept trying to explain to the whining man that it's all right,

503
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,980
and that he, I'm not sure who he meant, didn't have to worry,

504
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,380
and cause I've got it all under control.

505
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,200
The president threw another fit while Bob explained to him

506
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,860
that his trusted man, Dr. Oswald,

507
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:38,540
was the one who drunkenly grabbed the rifle with the real bullets.

508
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,140
The president suggested that they dispose of the assassinated clone,

509
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:48,540
and he himself could explain on TV that he was all right and it was just a scratch.

510
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,760
Bob snickered, saying that was a grand idea,

511
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:56,740
but obviously no eye patch is going to fool the necessary amount of people

512
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,580
when thousands saw half your head being blown off.

513
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:03,700
So just accept the island offer and shut up.

514
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,720
Bob rocked back in his swivel chair, a smug look on his face,

515
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,280
as if he had just untied the Gordian knot.

516
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,600
He played pocket pool so hard I could hear the sound of pain.

517
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,200
The president glowered thoughtfully for a moment,

518
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,580
taking in the import of the situation he found himself in.

519
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,500
Okay, master, he said, I'll take the deal.

520
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,620
Just tell Jackie that I'm getting stuff done with the Greys at Camp Canaveral

521
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,220
and send Dr. Oswald to me.

522
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,680
I have a plan.

523
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,200
I'll give him a few choice fists to show him.

524
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,880
Mr. Dobbs chuckled and mentioned that he already had Dr. Ruby on the job.

525
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,880
He is going to take him out of the country.

526
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,560
Bob then abruptly hung up the phone.

527
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Did I tell Connie the out of the country part?

528
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:57,100
He looked serious for a few moments until the thing in the easy chair started laughing insanely,

529
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,220
yelling, when Bob done f**ks up, people die.

530
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:06,380
Then when Mr. Dobbs starts farting, the world starts...

531
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,900
I glared at the creature in disgust.

532
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,000
How could you joke at this moment?

533
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:19,260
I whispered an aside to Bob, asking what manner of foul creature it was that sat in the corner.

534
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:24,860
Bob said loudly, ignoring my attempt at privacy, pointing to the creature and laughing,

535
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,100
that is a mistake.

536
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,200
A genetic mistake like the alligator people you saw in my grand mother.

537
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,040
A goat of happiness outside the factory.

538
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,560
That mistake used to be as pink as you.

539
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,820
That was my middle hand man until it decided to retire to a monastery in Tibet

540
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,700
with a big bag of my personal stash of frop.

541
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:52,100
The thing we got back from the Yeti monks was no longer human, but also not quite an overman.

542
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:59,260
So I decided to graft that pipe onto its face and make it frop up 24 hours a day just to see what would happen.

543
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:04,960
Young agent, what you see before you is the future of failure.

544
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,040
What you see is an over-under man.

545
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,400
The thing in the corner puffed its pipe and cackled like a madman.

546
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:20,660
You see, young agent, Bob told me, that I now need you as my middle hand man.

547
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:27,740
I pondered the gravity of what he told me as he put some atonal rumba music on the hi-fi

548
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,240
and walked over to the classy man.

549
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:29,240


550
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,620
He told me that he had a bar to fix us a drink.

551
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:35,260
He did a poor job of hiding the spiking of my drink with pills,

552
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,560
though he obviously tried to look innocent and hide his actions.

553
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,240
My heart dropped as he started to suddenly gyrate his hips,

554
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,760
hula-style, when he glided over with my drink.

555
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,260
We were alone and I had no escape.

556
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,760
I feared the worst, but knew that this was my duty.

557
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,240
Bob handed me the drink and suddenly got stuck in a ditch.

558
00:51:59,240 --> 00:51:59,240


559
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,000
He was serious, if you can ever call him that.

560
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,540
He heartily pfffwift the stuffy air that hung leaden in the shelter.

561
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:12,120
He told me not to worry too much, that he'd find a way to make a buck out of the whole thing.

562
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,080
Without thinking, I drank the cocktail down.

563
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:21,640
The room spun in a pleasant way and I noticed that the little umbrella that he had put into the drink

564
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:26,560
was topped off with a small plastic bobbly head of the president.

565
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,720
The head had what looked like two bullet holes in it.

566
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:37,520
I knew then that God help us if we cannot get this man squarely on our side.

567
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:42,900
Bob gyrated around me while my sight dimmed into a fearful tunnel

568
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,780
and my mind reeled at the import of this man's powers.

569
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,420
Bob stood over me as I slumped in the chair.

570
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,540
Boy, I have plans for you.

571
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,540
You're going to Dobbs Town for further and further.

572
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:02,300
I was in the middle of construction and a little itty bitty operation to open up that other hole.

573
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:13,900
I felt the room whirl as all faded out but his pipe, his grin, and that insufferable soft chuckling.

574
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,220
The music in the background was by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

575
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,840
And now, this.

576
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,160
You've been listening to Hour of Slack number 1872.

577
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:38,020
You can learn more about the Church of the Subgenius and the stuff we play and everything else at subgenius.com.

578
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,200
Oh, and we promised news about X Day.

579
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:48,380
Well, X Day is somewhere, sometime this year.

580
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:53,820
You can see all of what I'm about to read also on subgenius.com under X Day.

581
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,820
Friends, X Day is July 5th, 1998.

582
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,560
Of course.

583
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:07,840
But from 24 previous X Day drills, we now know that we don't really know when now is.

584
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,600
We also don't know where the big party is.

585
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:18,240
After years at the perfect place in Ohio, and then an all virtual one on Zoom in 2020,

586
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,320
for 2021 we found an even more perfecter place in Florida.

587
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:30,220
But this year, the owner, Reverend Zanthea, is moving that place, the Land of Id Resort.

588
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,700
She'll move it somewhere else, but it's not going to be ready this summer.

589
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:40,600
So temporarily, we might call this one DIY Day.

590
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:43,440
It takes place wherever you are.

591
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:50,020
If you decide to host a local drill in the form of a big party with all your subgenius friends and loved ones, great.

592
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,060
We'll help you publicize it if you want it public.

593
00:54:54,140 --> 00:55:02,480
Or you can join the big virtual party or parties from right in your own home via internet video conferencing.

594
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,860
But really, why not both?

595
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,420
I'm thinking I may throw a party here at Stang Ranch, but only for people I actually know.

596
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,300
No offense.

597
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:19,940
But it's not just that Reverend Zanthea's amazing Land of Id is temporarily closed,

598
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,980
or that I can't spend a week breaking my back again in Ohio.

599
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,820
There's much, much more to it.

600
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:30,000
For X Day, as we belatedly realized, is also Variable Day.

601
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:34,180
V-Day, one might say, as well as DIY Day.

602
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:40,280
We stumbled upon this discovery in the forbidden sciences that blew our minds.

603
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,660
What's the letter in mathematics that indicates a variable?

604
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:45,240
X.

605
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,640
Maybe it's X Day because it's variable.

606
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:52,800
We know from prophecy that the media will refer to the advent of the angelic host as X Day.

607
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:59,180
But now that we are less certain about the planet and the year, this day of judgment is now a variable.

608
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:04,000
The world ends on July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.

609
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,600
But we obviously don't know when that might be, might be.

610
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,680
It might be today.

611
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,460
Well, maybe tomorrow.

612
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,760
But soon.

613
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,740
Soon, surely.

614
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,600
Very soon.

615
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,480
What kind of end of the world will it be?

616
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:21,880
Road Warrior? 1984? Brave New World? Let's Visit the World of the Future?

617
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,860
Life After People?

618
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,060
That's all variable too, friends.

619
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,920
Is today your X Day?

620
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,280
Everyone's X Day?

621
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:32,180
Maybe the X Day of someone you haven't met yet or haven't killed yet?

622
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:44,880
This X equals Variable Day concept offers spiritual integrity to the notion that one may have a July 5th that isn't necessarily the conspiracy calendar's July 5th.

623
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:49,140
Like old Pogo noticing that Friday the 13th can happen on a Wednesday.

624
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,880
He was no fool.

625
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,160
We prefer the term subgenius.

626
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:59,720
Now, this also lets us off the hook, friends, for having to camp outdoors on the hottest day of the year.

627
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:05,000
And I think I covered all this in that Winter Star rant.

628
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,140
Yeah, I did.

629
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:08,780
I did.

630
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:20,220
So this weird year, we're going to hedge our bets and hold the X Day party where you are when you want it.

631
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,480
And you and you and you.

632
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:21,860
And you and you.

633
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,780
Yes, X Day in place for 2022.

634
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:30,280
If the saucers get to you first, remember the rest of us.

635
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,100
Yes, this is a desperate move.

636
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:42,380
But the alternative was to end time in the end times so that all moments would be equally distributed as 7 a.m.

637
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,340
But that sounded like too much work.

638
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:51,700
Thus, we are distributing and decentralizing X Day for one year only.

639
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,240
Maybe.

640
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,640
Anyway, X marks the spot.

641
00:57:55,740 --> 00:58:01,700
Just to make sure you're synced up, do send in that number of bucks.

642
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,840
Re-up your membership and enter to win.

643
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,600
Win, win, win.

644
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,940
Big, big, big prizes to be announced.

645
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,800
Throw an insane party.

646
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,820
Put a big X on your forehead and hang out at the courthouse.

647
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,700
Take a photo of the weirdest thing you can possibly do and post it to the subgenius metaverse.

648
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:21,680
The story is this.

649
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,960
The subgenius who ruptures with the most slack wins.

650
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:30,820
No matter how it pans out, the Church of the Subgenius offers the best apocalypse.

651
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:42,360
In fact, the single most compelling reason to join the Church of the Subgenius is that you'll never be disappointed at its failure to deliver on impossible promises.

652
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,460
Praise Bob!

653
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,280
And see subgenius.com.

654
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,200
Oh, here's a little song.

655
00:58:54,560 --> 00:59:00,260
I'll have to turn down the Empire Jazz Orchestra album out of the mix, missed from the mix.

656
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:07,280
Rue Mouse, the poor subgenius, had a very special brain.

657
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:14,240
All of the stupid normals laughed and labeled him insane.

658
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:19,180
Then one sudden X Day morning,

659
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,820
the X-Sys ships came back.

660
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:27,880
They wiped out all the human race so sub-gene I could have slack.

661
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,800
Oh, you better not laugh, you better just cry.

662
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:35,020
Death from space is in your skies.

663
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:39,120
Subgeniuses are cutting you down.

664
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,880
Praise Bob.

665
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,960
Ah-hew.

666
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,240
And good night.
