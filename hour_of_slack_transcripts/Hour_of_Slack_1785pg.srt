1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
Well, I think it's about time now.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,780
We tipped her, we tipped her, we tipped her...

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,480
He's looking at his watch.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,480
We dipped her with the prairie...

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,700
Dip the prairie squid, did you say?

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,120
I'm ready for some of that.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,280
I'll dip a prairie squid.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,500
Oh, it's that other tape. That's what it is.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,900
Chocolate-covered prairie squid, did you say?

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,740
Yeah, yeah, and that's a recipe that we probably don't want to put in.

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,560
Man!

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,280
Did I just wreck your computer there?

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,720
Oh!

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,700
I just stepped on his guitar, folks. It's been a long day.

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,960
Let's try going to the phone.

16
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,820
What a clumsy ox. You're going to pay for that.

17
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,680
Every cent should be calculated and taken against your account.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,080
I hope you're satisfied.

19
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,420
What do you have to say for yourself?

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,540
I hope you're...

21
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,020
Sense.

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,780
Well, with the surviving populace clinging tenaciously to useless routines

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,340
in hopes of retaining that one last tiny vestige of sanity,

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,420
you know, the least necessary and most superfluous aspects of society,

25
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:22,880
such as bureaucracy and red tape, will remain in place down to the final possible moment.

26
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:23,980
Mm-hmm.

27
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:32,280
And the deorgasm, popped-out, depleted mankind-ordnance of the de-unruptured subgeniuses

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,460
will be left to handle the machinery of state or snakehood.

29
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,640
Shane, look out!

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,540
The subgenius powerhouse.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,400
What?!

32
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:23,980


33
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:53,980


34
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:23,980


35
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:53,980


36
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:23,980


37
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,240
I'm tired of that cosmic version.

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,020
I'm tired of that cosmic stuff.

39
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,920
I am, too.

40
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,300
I'm into the just down-to-earth bacon and eggs, meat and potatoes...

41
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,060
Rubbing sandpaper all over your nipples and your chest and your...

42
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,480
Good old time prairie squid-loving...

43
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,440
Coffee and lemon pie.

44
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,940
Or oil and oil.

45
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,700
Or oil.

46
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,460
Yeah.

47
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,520
I forgot.

48
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,140
You know, coke, peanuts and Coca-Cola of old days.

49
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,780
Goobers and chomping on your...

50
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,940
Chomping on yourself.

51
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,580
Yeah.

52
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,540
I'm sick of plastic cards.

53
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:05,140
I'm sick of pulling up behind gas stations and punching into, like, little concrete monoliths

54
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,600
and having pieces in Unix...

55
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,200
Yeah, me too.

56
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,260
Yeah, I'm sick of it.

57
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,960
I hate that stuff.

58
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,540
I hate that stuff, and I hate when people pull up behind you in some monstrous vehicle

59
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,560
that was never meant to be, fueled by beings which may or may not have existed based on

60
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,960
someone's own Freudian preclusion.

61
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,680
Or some Velikovsky nightmare.

62
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,960
When the whole time we could be space-traveling billionaires.

63
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,000
We could be eating fried chicken in the park.

64
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,700
Yeah.

65
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,580
We could be...

66
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,540
That burns me up, man.

67
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,200
What does?

68
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,920
What you just said.

69
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,380
All those dwarfs in the trucks and everything.

70
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,520
Yeah, all the dwarfs in the trucks and the times that...

71
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,360
Hey, you guys sound like idiots.

72
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,180
There's two of them.

73
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,540
It's getting hot in here again.

74
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,500
No!

75
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,880
Wait, wait, two little pulpy and I'm praying for some pain!

76
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,800
Dave, what is this hegemonic gaze about you?

77
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,860
It's that the sound is from the Yeti.

78
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,040
Oh, Mr. The wimpy laid-back universe sound.

79
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,940
. . .

80
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,960
Yes, that's the true Yeti sound.

81
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,060
. . .

82
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,300
. . . . . . . . . . what it's like to have an eroding.

83
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,020
What it's like having an eroding.

84
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,940
. . .

85
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,340
Put that thing down.

86
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,000
Put that thing down.

87
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,480
Yeah, it's not funny, man.

88
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,560
Put the gun down, Dave.

89
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,360
It's not.

90
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,380
It's not loaded, is it?

91
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:48,880
It's not.

92
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,340
It's not.

93
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,420
It's not a real gun.

94
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,460
It's one of...

95
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:51,780
Look.

96
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,500
See, it's a liquor made thing inside.

97
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,680
Just take a little chew off the top.

98
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,500
Just put it down, Dave.

99
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,160
No, no.

100
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,680
Just try it.

101
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,520
Just come over here and try a chew on it.

102
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,540
It's got lemonade inside of it.

103
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,300
Okay, look.

104
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,260
Awesome, baby.

105
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,860
Just give it a little try.

106
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,660
It's wax, man.

107
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,000
It's made of wax and you bite it and it's got lemonade inside of it.

108
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,620
Right, right, Dave.

109
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,240
That's right.

110
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,160
Yeah.

111
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,960
Do you want some wine?

112
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,720
Would you like some lemonade stuff?

113
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,540
Ma'am?

114
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,380
Just give me the keys to the truck.

115
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,180
Huh?

116
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,240
Just give me the keys to the truck.

117
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,800
I've been driving so long, I...

118
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,680
What?

119
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,100
It's okay.

120
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,300
There, thanks.

121
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,540
Fits very good.

122
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,040
Now, Princess, we will escort you to your hive chamber.

123
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,280
Do I have to go in there?

124
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:37,980
For reprogramming.

125
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,300
I have to go in the hive thing?

126
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,660
Just put on these shackles.

127
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,520
But I can't remember all this stuff.

128
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,640
I go in there and I get...

129
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,640
Okay.

130
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,820
Be careful while I clamp them on.

131
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,380
Okay.

132
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,720
Oh, my feet.

133
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,340
Do I have to wear these things?

134
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,120
I can't stand that sound.

135
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,360
What's with the guns back there?

136
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,140
Yep, his gun still works.

137
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,680
Too bad about his mind.

138
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,860
It was said that Don Carlos, when he discovered the Emerald Tablet,

139
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,120
had devised a plan where all the priests within the immediate vicinity

140
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,220
would come to make out its veracity to check,

141
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,980
to go through various biblical sources

142
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:33,040
and see if it indeed did indicate some sort of apocalypse

143
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,440
coming in the year 1998.

144
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,460
Eh...

145
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,660
Nostradamus said that from the sky would come the great king of...

146
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,120
Jacques Horay, or could it be perhaps pronounced Jokery?

147
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,300
Could we stretch it that far?

148
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:51,980
It was...

149
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,860
He predicted Hitler, though he spelled it Hister.

150
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,660
But yet he said in 1999, from the sky would come the great king.

151
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,900
Edgar Cayce said that 1998 would be that time.

152
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,500
Would be Jacques Couture's time to come back from...

153
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,560
Jacques Cousteau said that it would be 7 o'clock in the morning on July 5th.

154
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,780
Wearing pampers.

155
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,000
Out on a broad Jamaican sea, staring scullers.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,660
People used to watch television.

157
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,640
People that make peanut butter, jelly sandwiches, and leave other people alone.

158
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,660
That's Jacques Cousteau right now.

159
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,680
I thought that was the meteor magnate.

160
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,760
Er, the meteor man.

161
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,360
Is that the weather man?

162
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,980
That's Peppy in the background. I'm home again. I'm dreaming.

163
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,500
I think it's Peppy. Listen.

164
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,540
Wake up, Dave! Wake up! Wake up, Dave!

165
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,440
I stepped on Peppy!

166
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,180
It'll be okay. It'll be okay.

167
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:42,940
It's just a dream, Dave.

168
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,160
It's just a dream, Dave.

169
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,760
I never had no dog named Peppy.

170
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,220
Your friends are still here. Me, the Tin Woodsman.

171
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,120
Tin Lizzy!

172
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,940
Yeah, and the Cowardly Lion.

173
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,080
Oh, the Cowardly!

174
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,420
Yes. It was only a dream. That horrible, boring world of trucks and sidewalks.

175
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,000
And sausages.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,440
It was just a terrible dream.

177
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,440
And banel onions.

178
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,060
You've been here in Oz all along.

179
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,360
Oh, it's my... These flakes on my mouth. It's so dry. I've been here all along?

180
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,580
Yeah, you were just... You got knocked out.

181
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,760
Well, how the hell did I get knocked out?

182
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,640
When they dropped that house on your head.

183
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,660
Oh, I thought it was when I was arguing with that bitch. You know what I mean.

184
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,300
Yeah.

185
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,840
Thank God. I don't know what his problem was. You know, what the hell. She was giving me some stuff, so I might as well...

186
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,840
Oh, there! Here it goes again! Am I in there?

187
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,260
Yeah.

188
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:43,340
Boy, I think something's missing here now. This looks like a little teeny tiny room. Now, how the hell did I get in here?

189
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,980
We've been orbiting the whole time, Dave. You're still in a little tuna can in space, remember?

190
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,220
It's gonna be another nine months before we get on all the way over to Jupiter.

191
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,620
Yeah, but when do they hatch? Do we get to get out before they hatch, or we gotta wait?

192
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,080
Oh, you'll know when they're hatching.

193
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,500
I thought I'd be in some kind of hibernation chamber or something.

194
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:13,320
Well, but you... Most people wake up for the last few seconds of their life as the thing is bursting out.

195
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,320


196
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,080
Well, what the hell are we doing this for, then?

197
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,900
Well, you signed up.

198
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:18,880
Yeah.

199
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,380
You signed up. The contract is in the computer.

200
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,320
Well, I...

201
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:39,520
You thought the corporation was a great idea. You said we should all climb into the little capsule, and we'd get paid. By the time we got to Jupiter, we'd be paid a million bucks each, and sure enough, we will. It's just that it's our estate that gets it.

202
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,120
Yeah, but it's...

203
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,000
Because you didn't read the fine print.

204
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,300
Yeah.

205
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,940
Dave, and now we're all stuck here with you for another nine months.

206
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,360
Huh. I never...

207
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:50,500
Yeah.

208
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,620
I was never capable of reading a fine print. I just...

209
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,820
And you just keep having these dreams and going off into fantasy land, thinking you're back on Earth doing radio shows.

210
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,180
We have to keep nursing back.

211
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:13,300
And every time I have a dream, how come one of you guys changes? Like, I dreamed my wife was attacking me with a car, and next thing I know, out there I was out in the side room, and some Russian was talking to me, and a woman was attacking me with a car.

212
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,120
Somehow I think you guys were involved in this.

213
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,460
Yeah, and what are you keeping back there? What's in that big box anyway?

214
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,980
That's our space hyena.

215
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,760
Well, what's the...

216
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,580
Rover.

217
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,060
And it's...

218
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,740
And the...

219
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,620
The scorpion rooster creature that we picked up on Mars.

220
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,660
Well, how come we don't get to lick at them?

221
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,900
You can lick them.

222
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:41,020
You can lick them any time you want. Remember what happened last time you licked them, though?

223
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,580
What, the eye socket thing?

224
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:42,980
Yeah.

225
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,100
Well...

226
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,620
It wasn't easy getting that scorpion rooster barb out of your eye socket.

227
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:54,120
I thought you said that was another dream. Give me a mirror. I want to see if there's anything wrong with my eye socket, man. Let me look in the monitor.

228
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,100
You can't look at your own eye, Dave.

229
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,500
Yes, you can. If I look in the monitor, I can look at my own eye. I'm not listening to you right now.

230
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,820
What the hell? I have no eyes in there.

231
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,760
Why don't you calm down and take a stress pill, Dave?

232
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,700
I don't see what difference that's going to make.

233
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,280
Now, I'm looking in there and I'm not... Am I hallucinating or something? I have absolutely no eyeballs in my socket.

234
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,660
Now, this isn't what happened in the eye socket and before. Usually, it just like ripped out a chunk of the side of my face.

235
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,120
You can't see your own eyes, Dave. You can't run from your own legs.

236
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,080
Jayner told you that a long, long time ago.

237
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,440
Yeah, but you can't talk to your own voice. You can't smell your own nose.

238
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,680
Well, now, wait a minute. If they pull one...

239
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,880
You can't swallow your own throat.

240
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,040
If they pull one eye out, as just before the...

241
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,060
Just before the optic nerve severs, that one eye just for one second...

242
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,100
That's true.

243
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,600
...can look at the other eye. Is that not so?

244
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:54,180
That's true. If you pull it out, and we did this with Jayner, we pull it out just enough and turn it around.

245
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,740
You have to be very careful turning it. One eye can actually be seeing the other eye.

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,380
But that's not really the point. The point is, say, a one eye. You can't see your own eye with that eye that's seeing.

247
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,040
You can see your other eye.

248
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,620
But you can't see...

249
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,000
...that...your eye that is doing the seeing. You can only see the other eye.

250
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,480
You can look in the mirror, but that doesn't count either.

251
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,440
This is all mere metaphysical...

252
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,580
You can't digest your own stomach, Dave.

253
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,880
...juggling and juxtaposition.

254
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,320
And you can't hide from Bob, because he's stupider than you.

255
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,860
I can't believe that.

256
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,180
No, it's true. That's the miracle of it. That's the beautiful thing. That's why Bob hates you.

257
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,100
Well, I don't know...

258
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll be whipped by Miracle Whip.

259
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,660
...and it's kind of dangerous to believe that, Bob.

260
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,660
I don't want to believe that.

261
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,340
I didn't want to...

262
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,000
Be careful with that. You could turn into a frog or something. You know, you never know by saying those kind of things.

263
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,780
You've got to keep it kind of...you know, I mean, you know you're entitled to your own opinion and all that.

264
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:57,040
See, he's talking about the convicts, too. See, he knows. He knows. I was talking about...

265
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,380
Well, when they hurled those convicts at Jupiter, I think that's the kind of thing that'll keep people...

266
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,960
Yeah, but it will turn into a frog.

267
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,900
It'll teach them a lesson.

268
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,180
When the plutonium lands there?

269
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,640
Well, it's more of a discouragement for Christ.

270
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,820
It's more of a...you know, if they see they're...you know, see, you kill somebody, you propel them into Jupiter.

271
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,460
Carrying the back...carrying plutonium on your back is...

272
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,920
I think it's a cool way to execute criminals.

273
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:33,200
I know, but don't you think it's cruel-wee to have people ejaculate into space with plutonium on their backs to ignite a third sun in our solar system just because they might have maybe murdered somebody?

274
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,400
Well, yeah, I think that O.J. guy, they ought to shoot him into Jupiter, because he's guilty.

275
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,580
I saw it on TV.

276
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,580
Yeah.

277
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,960
I saw B.Y. get drunk one time, then T.M. got drunk, too.

278
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:54,120
And then I saw Z.B. got so damn drunk, he shot his old woman, and then X.M. got drunk, too.

279
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,960
Papa Booey. Papa Booey.

280
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,280
Wow.

281
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,040
Where'd they come up with that?

282
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:18,300
We are in search of...the...f...post...at the...found of the falling tree.

283
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:38,400
And it's midnight, the witching hour, when some geniuses and lonesome daves come crawling out from under their moldering, rotting logs and their damp...stools.

284
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,720
Biting bugs and slapping each other with their long, sticky tongues.

285
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,340
All moist and sleepy.

286
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,800
Midnight.

287
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,680
Midnight.

288
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,780
When those who should not be on the streets are the streets.

289
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,620
It's red light, man! You idiot! You almost ran it!

290
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,340
Captain Anvil spit. Do you have a quarter? Do you have, like, a 50 cents or a dollar?

291
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,860
To wash a windshield?

292
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,020
Yeah, can I give you a dollar? Look at this, uh...

293
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,220
Hey, man, I'm like an alcoholic.

294
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,460
I'm really hurtin' for...like a quarter bear.

295
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,980
Can you give me a dollar?

296
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,860
I got it on the right, because it's about five and a half years ago, and that's why my arm's all bent up like this.

297
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,560
But if I had a quarter, see, then I could probably tell you...

298
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,580
Who's this balancing act?

299
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,460
All the best drunks are named Bob.

300
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,120
Bob could take a leak right there on the third rail.

301
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,980
Some guy went over there after Bob took a leak on the third rail and tried to put his tongue on it.

302
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:59,840
And, uh, it went right there, right...some Bobby, they called the guy, like a Bobby type, um...

303
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,080
You know, and he was...had all the claws on and everything, he stuck his mouth on it.

304
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,120
I'm gonna be just like Bob. I'm gonna stick his tongue in my mouth.

305
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,820
I'm gonna go commune with aliens.

306
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,680
Only just like Bob.

307
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm gonna play on that third rail.

308
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,620
Huh?

309
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:23,160
I'm gonna go...I'm gonna go lay in front of the bus like I seen Bob do that one time.

310
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,680
Why can't I commune with aliens?

311
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,540
That department's like Bob.

312
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,920
They're figuring out just how we gave our secrets all away.

313
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,640
Yee-haw!

314
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:44,720
And Congress has appointed a committee, so they said, to find out who's American and who's a low down red.

315
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,900
Keep it going, Big Jim.

316
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,460
They called him up to Washington to speak for Uncle Sam.

317
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,060
But when they asked them what they are, they shit up like a clam.

318
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,420
I wish they'd take and put me on the witness stand today.

319
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,060
I'd shout so loud old Stalin could hear me all the way.

320
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,920
I'm no communist.

321
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,560
I'll tell you that right now.

322
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,000
I believe a man should own his own house in Warrentown.

323
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,440
I like in private ownership.

324
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,300
I won't be left alone.

325
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,100
Let the government run its business and let me run my own.

326
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,640
Yes, Bob Dobbs is no communist.

327
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,920
It'd sell you the shirt off your back.

328
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,740
The more they hired to work for it,

329
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,300
the more they have to pay.

330
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,320
I'm not talking about the leasemakers.

331
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,860
Be proud and honest here with me.

332
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,400
Instead of taking bribes and dressing up their wives in vain.

333
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,880
The taxes keep on going up, of that very little town.

334
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,200
But still they just can't take it in as fast as they dish it out.

335
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,680
Our national debt is monster-sized and going every day.

336
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,120
Our children's children still unborn are gonna have to pay.

337
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,680
Our dollar used to be the soundest money on this earth.

338
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,100
But now people will even buy one good dollar's worth

339
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,460
unless we stop inflation and take care of what's in the earth.

340
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,540
Yes, that's right.

341
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,460
Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.

342
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,760
At the sound of the falling tree.

343
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,100
Can you tell me a story before I go to bed?

344
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,640
Yes, I can, dear.

345
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,160
I'll tell you a story about the shrinking intellect.

346
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,320
It's about a whole town full of people whose brains got smaller at one time.

347
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,720
Well, it actually took about five years.

348
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,360
I don't know what started this.

349
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,460
I don't know where it began.

350
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,960
But it reached such a sorry state that people would walk up and down

351
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,260
from one edge of the town to the other, burbling inanities to each other

352
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,580
and sniveling off people they didn't quite dig.

353
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,940
And then, pretty soon, big hunks of their teeth fell out

354
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,340
because the decay had seeped down from their brain area all the way into their mouths.

355
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,140
And next thing you know, the time has come.

356
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,360
The tongues was a-wiggling, and they were in pain.

357
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,080
That's right. They were in some heavy, dark pain.

358
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,740
But the tongues kept a-wagging. The brain was dead.

359
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,860
The brain had actually atrophied into a piece of lumpage.

360
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,380
Say what?

361
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,900
Another prophetic vision brought to you by WCSB Cleveland.

362
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,840
You'll think it's weird.

363
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,360
Man, I'm glad I got that one on tight.

364
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,640
Now, I heard once that Bob was the queen of sailors.

365
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,180
That Bob actually was a hermaphroditic. Was hermaphroditic.

366
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,940
Oh, Bob has...

367
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:43,180
You know, they say that God has... is everything.

368
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,500
Yes.

369
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,060
Yeah, Bob has already been everything else.

370
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,820
Well, I think it's...

371
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,860
You know, when we invited you to come on Gay People's Alliance tonight,

372
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,820
we thought maybe we would talk a little bit about

373
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,920
how Bob was androgynous, and then is Bob his God?

374
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,000
Is that what you're trying to say?

375
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,180
Well, androgynous isn't really the word for it.

376
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,140
It's more like he's all man and all woman all the time, all together.

377
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,140
Well, that's a combo I'd like to be, or...

378
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,560
He's too much of everything.

379
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,780
Too much, too much.

380
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,180
It's never not enough.

381
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:14,800
Mo' Bob.

382
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,460
So, how long will you be in town, and what's with the groovy shirt?

383
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,760
I think that's just beautiful.

384
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,800
That's a beautiful shirt.

385
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,860
It looks like Curly Howard, isn't it?

386
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,940
Yes, it's a Curly Howard.

387
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,580
Andy Warhol, Curly Howard.

388
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,500
Oh, I loved Andy Warhol so much.

389
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,680
And yes, he did Curly just before.

390
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,280
Yes, the tragic woman.

391
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,440
The tragic woman with...

392
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,320
What was her name?

393
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,740
Edie Shrimpton or something.

394
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,700
I forget her...

395
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,540
Shrimp Pocket or...

396
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,320
But I remember...

397
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,640
She was wonderful.

398
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,260
I have a lot of her things.

399
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,500
Now, again, this Bob guy, you're going to be in the Newkirk Mall tomorrow night,

400
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,300
riding the ponies, and you'll be endorsing...

401
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,420
your Bob or whatever it is.

402
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,980
Oh, I'll be endorsing your Bob, Dave.

403
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,500
Well, we're on the air right now, so we'll talk about it later.

404
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,140
We're going to break away.

405
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,940
This is really making me uncomfortable trying to talk this way.

406
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,920
I don't know.

407
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,560
I just...

408
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,320
I mean, sometimes I can at a party.

409
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,320
If I'm dressed up, if I have the wig and the dress and everything, sure.

410
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,820
But I'm sitting here with the headphones, and it just...

411
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,340
I know.

412
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,080
It feels...

413
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,200
If I'm not wearing a pair of high heels and stockings, I just can't do it.

414
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,400
That's the way I feel.

415
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,660
You know, it's like...

416
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:25,700
No, no.

417
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,040
You got to be in the mood.

418
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,480
It's more than the mood.

419
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,000
You got to...

420
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,900
It's a certain feeling when you say wig.

421
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,940
Yes, I guess it's just that certain genre that fits sometimes, and sometimes it just

422
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,860
doesn't fit.

423
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,280
Yes.

424
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:37,560
Bill knows.

425
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:37,560


426
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,760
Bill knows.

427
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,180
Bill's all dressed up.

428
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:40,600
He's...

429
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
Doing a hell of this?

430
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,180
He's looking good, Bill.

431
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,200
He's looking just like the Princess Wee-Ah-Dow from Queen of All the UFOs.

432
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,200
That's my best costume.

433
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,180
Do you also do Liza Minnellian and...

434
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,180


435
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,180


436
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,180


437
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,940
And what's the other one's name?

438
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,540
Did you do...

439
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,760
Yes, I have the Liza wig and the lashes, yes.

440
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,240
And the Connie Merkin.

441
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,300
Yes.

442
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,760
Oh, well, every woman should have a Merkin that makes her feel just like Connie.

443
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,440
Prescripture's 917.

444
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,100
That is in Prescripture's 917.

445
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,660
There's even a picture in this new subgenius book, Revelation X, of which I have the first

446
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,240
11...

447
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,060
Most of it all laid out here.

448
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,440
It looks like you have most of it imprinted on your forehead in a micro...

449
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,280
I have it...

450
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:29,220
Well, it's just behind my forehead here in the chapter four, Mondo Connie, the gossip

451
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,440
according to Connie Dobbs.

452
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,540
Look at this picture, folks.

453
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,740
Oh, I...

454
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,660
Let's just...

455
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,200
Let's get like Fiorilla LaGuardia.

456
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:35,460
Take it down.

457
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,940
Describe the three pictures you see on this page.

458
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,000
It looks like a tantric Shiva woman with a million tiny small arms looking at a bald-headed

459
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,680
Mohawk woman and struck by a hammer.

460
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,260
Am I wrong?

461
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,240
Well, but the bald-headed Mohawk woman, that's not a Mohawk.

462
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,360
That's the Merkin...

463
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:50,940
That's the Merkin.

464
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,500
...off of her head that makes her feel just like Connie.

465
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,320
And anyone can...

466
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,380
Can they snap a Merkin on, like perhaps like a teasy little toupee you'd wear out to the

467
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,500
mall or something on a Sunday?

468
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,580
Or is a Merkin something that's a weed?

469
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,220
If they can just bust free from their chains of inhibition, if they can throw away their

470
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:12,660
wallets and purses, slap that Merkin on top of their head and that underwear around their

471
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,940
brow, and just parade through the streets, just flaunt your abnormality.

472
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,400
That sounds like a point of carnage.

473
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,920
Take that hammer and nail that thing right in the head.

474
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,480
Right through that organ.

475
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,440
Nail it.

476
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,280
Nail that sucker.

477
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,820
Nail it to the table, man.

478
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,040
Just show the normals what for.

479
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,040
That's a point of carnation I think should be mentioned over and over again.

480
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,260
Nail your organs to the floor.

481
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,140
But what exactly is a Merkin?

482
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,080
It's not a weave.

483
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,960
It's not an implant.

484
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,580
It's not Rogaine or some sort of topical solution.

485
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,800
A Merkin is a sort of a wig.

486
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,680
It's a...

487
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,280
In the Middle Ages, women were often...

488
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,920
Similar to a codpiece.

489
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,900
...there were many skinned as well.

490
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,180
And the reason for that disease is of course we didn't have the miracles of modern medicine

491
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,940
that we have now.

492
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,680
And women sometimes became bald-headed just like men.

493
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:05,740
And sometimes they became bald-headed in like their armpits, shall we say.

494
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,580
And a Merkin might for instance be used as an armpit hair.

495
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,860
Because in those days...

496
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,100
Or perhaps any other part of the body where a hairy part might be needed, right?

497
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,980
You could slap a Merkin perhaps...

498
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,700
Like a forehead in your case.

499
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,080
Oh yeah.

500
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,540
Yeah.

501
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,740
I could slap a Merkin in my forehead.

502
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,060
Or a palm.

503
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,100
Yes, it does.

504
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,380
But there's a paste.

505
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,120
Is the paste have anything to do with what happens afterwards?

506
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,200
This is not really just a cosmetic Merkin.

507
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,420
This is actually a medicinal, I guess...

508
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,900
Frank Sinatra has to wear one.

509
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,680
I have that confidential...

510
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,760
He's got the medicinal blue.

511
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,300
He's got the ice blue Merkin.

512
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,200
Yeah, you can't even tell when he's singing.

513
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,380
No, the ice blue Merkin is doing the song.

514
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,680
He's just...

515
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,380
He's dancing in step.

516
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:51,740
He's...

517
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,000
It's just the bag that's singing.

518
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,580
Well, it's just like with Bob.

519
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,940
It's the pipe that's talking.

520
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,660
It ain't Bob.

521
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,380
He...

522
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,380
You know, the pipe is...

523
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,580
Well, I shouldn't say that.

524
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,000
Bob is talking, but the pipe is directing what Bob says.

525
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,580
It's the amplifier.

526
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,580
I mean, it's good.

527
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:09,820
It's...

528
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,720
Bob's not doing...

529
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,680
It's not like the pipe is some evil entity that controls Bob.

530
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,020
It's that it amplifies Bob's already powerful slack force.

531
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,680
Is there anything like that?

532
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:20,680


533
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:20,680


534
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:20,680


535
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:20,680


536
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:20,680


537
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:20,680


538
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:20,680


539
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:20,680


540
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:20,880
Well, I'm not sure if Bob's...

541
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,740
If Bob's left of the original J.R.

542
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,340
Bob's...

543
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:28,380
Bob's left, if indeed the pipe is actually doing the magnificence, the utterances which

544
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,780
come out of his foul trap are enough to make you...

545
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:38,820
Well, the autopsy showed that the brain matter was still present but was interlaced with

546
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,320
tendrils of an unknown...

547
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,040
And the pipe...

548
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,680
They couldn't get the pipe out of his mouth.

549
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,080
Bob had...

550
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,660
By the way, the autopsy, Dave, showed that Bob only had...

551
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,640
one beer. How many did you

552
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,640
have, man? I didn't have... Just think about

553
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,600
that. Jeez.

554
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,300
Was he killed by one beer?

555
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,340
Or was...

556
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,660
Or was it the beer that was

557
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,560
talking? I have what?

558
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,840
Some people have moles.

559
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,700
But I don't care to discourage

560
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,580
about it. And I don't want to be...

561
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,340
I lost one. Moles are

562
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,200
beauty marks anyway. Yes.

563
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,680
He said with a wan smile.

564
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,480
I thought they were like

565
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,320
ferrets. The magic-esque

566
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,820
creature that crawls from holes.

567
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,380
The magic mongoose. Yeah, the

568
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,060
merkin was a mighty ferret.

569
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,300
No. In the Middle Ages,

570
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,380
during the bubonic plague, didn't they put

571
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,260
a place of ferret on their forehead to ensure

572
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,980
some sort of magnetic surprise?

573
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,400
Yeah, but the funny thing was that

574
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,340
the plague was actually carried by

575
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,480
fleas, which were carried by

576
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,160
the ferrets. So

577
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,100
those foolish

578
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,040
medieval people and their silly,

579
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,320
superstitious medical treatment

580
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,120
ments. I'm sure that

581
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,940
our current modern medicine

582
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,040
will always seem incredibly

583
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,880
advanced in future ages.

584
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,320
They call it moleskin.

585
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,260
That's kind of a condom,

586
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,240
isn't it? Did I get it?

587
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,880
What? She said something about

588
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,080
moleskin. I still like to be bled.

589
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,160
I like... Well, we're

590
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,420
all going to be ruptured, I hope.

591
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,960
Maybe that'll be some sort of topical

592
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,920
disenfunded... Who else but Bob can

593
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,260
you trust during the rupture,

594
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:18,880
my friend?

595
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,700
True words were never spoke.

596
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,760
Who will give you that feeling of support,

597
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,280
I suppose? Besides Bob.

598
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,460
Who can hold

599
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,400
your guts in

600
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,640
when they're

601
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,480
screaming to get out?

602
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,840
Out. Out.

603
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,360
Yeah, it's been a long

604
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,380
night of guts screaming to get out.

605
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,620
As a matter of fact, my thorax

606
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,460
tried to pop out through the top of the

607
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,520
tube, and it's not allowed to go

608
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,420
above that little green line there. See?

609
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,160
Your thorax fell

610
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,260
into my abdomen.

611
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,420
Wasn't that a joyful collusion

612
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,380
there? Your abdomen fell into my

613
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,300
thorax.

614
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,320
Say...

615
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,480
Say, my cranium

616
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,520
was severed by a gigantic

617
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,420
septum of some

618
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:06,880
sort.

619
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,040
My septum was deviant,

620
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,840
and therefore it could not

621
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,180
parlance. It did not learn

622
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,620
the correct and the crude.

623
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,440
It caroused.

624
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,700
It had its day in the sun,

625
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,160
and then went to sleep under a distant

626
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,760
moon.

627
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,700
Wow.

628
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,280
Wow.

629
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,240
I knew a guy whose

630
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,680
bad septum, his septum

631
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,200
developed a hole in it.

632
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,720
This one guy I know.

633
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,820
And he had to have his

634
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,600
septum replaced with a plastic

635
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,360
plug, but he kept

636
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,980
the piece of meat that had been removed

637
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,880
from between his nostrils

638
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,780
and hired

639
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,620
a well-known underground

640
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,340
painter,

641
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,700
a famous guy, to paint

642
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,680
his septum for it.

643
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,860
Paid 500 bucks for a painting of his

644
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,460
diseased septum.

645
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,620
And then never picked up the painting.

646
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,960
That was the best part

647
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,540
of the story. It was the concept, man.

648
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,140
So somewhere

649
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,500
in San Francisco,

650
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,440
there's this

651
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,120
black velvet painting

652
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,960
of a septum, of a

653
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,120
guy's septum, and it's

654
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,880
it wields a sinister

655
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,020
influence, the painting does. You gaze

656
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,100
into it, it's like looking at a picture of Bob.

657
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,680
You just get lost in it.

658
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,980
It's so tiny. A septum is a very

659
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,260
tiny painting to be on.

660
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,800
And also, what would it hold?

661
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,080
Like, perhaps Elvis smoothing a velvet tiger?

662
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,640
Yeah, he had

663
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,980
on the tiny septum, the septum was

664
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,220
only about an eighth the size

665
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,780
of your little fingernail.

666
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,580
Oh, Jesus, less than the Michael A.

667
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,420
He had painted this tiny

668
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,040
microscopic picture of

669
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,260
Elvis, as if on black velvet.

670
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,140
Oh, then it was Elvis.

671
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,820
A picture of Elvis doing a sword fight with a bull.

672
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,240
Well, I like to see

673
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,660
Elvis bullfighting pictures.

674
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,320
I had quite a few of them.

675
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,840
I had crying clowns. I had the

676
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,000
tigers. Did you have the dogs around

677
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,780
the bar? Oh, hell yeah.

678
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,740
The dogs playing poker.

679
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,340
Yeah.

680
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,900
You know, that scene will come true in real life

681
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,400
after

682
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,000
1998 when the

683
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,920
excess technology is left on our

684
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,960
benighted planet.

685
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,740
People will turn themselves into

686
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,740
creatures that look like that.

687
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,380
And that corny old painting

688
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,720
will turn out to be a perfectly

689
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,580
ordinary common sight

690
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,180
in downtown bars.

691
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,860
It's one way to go wandering in

692
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,900
Dallas and just maybe clip the turn

693
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,600
around into the old, in Chafee's Bar

694
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,620
or someplace like that. There'll be people walking around

695
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,680
askew with, askew with like dog masks

696
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,400
or just literally full of hair.

697
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,800
Their face would be, have been, have been

698
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,320
genetically morphed

699
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,560
so that they were in fact dog

700
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,540
faced old men sitting

701
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,640
around smoking cigars and playing

702
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,820
poker. And they'll be, you'll be able

703
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,580
to, there'll be millions of people

704
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,780
walking around. Every city will have

705
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,760
dozens of people who look like Kennedy

706
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,080
for instance or

707
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,860
Martin Luther King. You know, you can look like anybody.

708
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,460
Think how many

709
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,380
Elvis's and

710
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,340
Michael Jackson's there'll be.

711
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,760
Or some cousin of yours in the Air Force that you never

712
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,280
really knew. Yeah. Yeah.

713
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:19,900
I mean, I think that's what it was.

714
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,380
It was, his head, his mouth was slightly different than it really was.

715
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,100
You could be, you can be anything that time around.

716
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,700
I think I'd like to look like a kind of a doggish JFK

717
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,780
with a little bit of that Bob smile to it.

718
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,400
Well, now think about it though, Dave.

719
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,680
This ain't like getting a tattoo.

720
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,660
You mean? It only goes one way.

721
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,480
You're stuck. But think of the things that teenagers will do to themselves.

722
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,780
The things they do now, think what they'll be able to do when they can like grow giant bat balls.

723
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,640
Devil wings or what they can all look like, you know, have pumped up Rambo muscles.

724
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,040
Yeah. Or can wear clothes that look like barbecue aprons.

725
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,940
They'll look like the Mitchell and Tyre man.

726
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,900
Yeah. Or actually barbecue grills.

727
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:07,500
There'll be, there'll be teenagers, teenage girls who look just like Snoopy.

728
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:08,860
Peanuts.

729
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,160
Jeez, what a rush that would be. And you'd go to jail for that, wouldn't you?

730
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,500
There'll be Garfields walking around on the street.

731
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,900
And there'll be these hideous visages every now and then.

732
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,520
There'll be people who look like Bob.

733
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,700
They thought it would be real cute to be permanently changed,

734
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,080
have their facial faces surgically altered,

735
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,860
to have that sardonicus-like grin,

736
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,840
that hideous rictus grin that would,

737
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,640
and the pipe implanted in their teeth and everything,

738
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,680
their eyes given just that insane glint, you know.

739
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,240
It's, yeah, I don't know.

740
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,780
I mean, ain't no kind of world for an old man no more.

741
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,800
Well, after this espousal,

742
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,000
I can only wonder what kind of surgery you must have gone under

743
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,300
to get the pipe-like grin and also some of the weird brain fusions.

744
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,360
Oh, they tell me I was born...

745
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,620
I'm not a joker, man. I'm an ace. I want you to understand that.

746
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,020
I can't understand the difference between the cards yet.

747
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,220
I know I'm trying, but...

748
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,160
I'm not a joker, man.

749
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,680
I'm not an ace neither.

750
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,760
It's more like a quagmire I'm lost in.

751
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,340
It's just a splattering of 52 different numbers in a deck,

752
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,240
and I can't figure out which one to go with.

753
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,360
I thought I'd like to be a ten of clubs,

754
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,600
but it turned out I was a ten of club foots.

755
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,580
Yeah, that'll get you out of Vietnam.

756
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
That got me out of Vietnam.

757
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,340
Why did you want to go there?

758
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:33,980
Panty waste.

759
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,500
Uh...

760
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,640
The post says WCSB,

761
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,960
and I'm about to tell you what I want to hear.

762
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,320
Hey, this is getting more realistic and lifelike.

763
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,240
There's, like, retarded people calling me up,

764
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,400
and talking in my head.

765
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,100
I doubt if we'll ever be able to resurrect these sea monkeys.

766
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,600
Jeez.

767
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Look at this one.

768
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,140
It's sprouting a whole new head.

769
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,680
I wonder if I mix this solution back in again.

770
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,760
Maybe some of them...

771
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,780
I could make it take a spore from one of them,

772
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,360
and reclone the spore.

773
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,100
Eh, I'll just go take a nap

774
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,260
and write a little report to the committee.

775
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,580
I'm telling you...

776
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:21,680
Bob?

777
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,300
Bob?

778
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,700
I haven't heard the voice of Bob.

779
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,020
Bob?

780
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,940
There's just something in the background there.

781
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,920
I can't make that voice out.

782
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,420
I can't make that voice out.

783
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,120
Well, the only thing for me to do on this shift is...

784
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,240
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

785
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,240


786
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,840
Well, I gotta remember to call the bathroom.

787
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,720
And I gotta...

788
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,980
Well, remember to eat...

789
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,180
Eat that stuff they call food.

790
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,460
I can work out again.

791
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,800
Eh...

792
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,220
Hell with that.

793
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,800
I'll go read some more technical manuals.

794
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,360
Take on some more stuff on the monitor.

795
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,820
Hell with that.

796
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,160
I'll try on this Mr. Peanut suit.

797
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,680
Yeah, this thing's been laying around for weeks,

798
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,260
and I haven't had any fun with that.

799
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,020
He's hallucinating the peanut suit again.

800
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,580
You'll have to make note of that.

801
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,220
Tell the psychiatrist.

802
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,780
Mr. Peanut used to come to all the fairs,

803
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,740
and he'd pass out donuts and give favors to the kids,

804
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,880
and bags of peanuts, of course.

805
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,160
I love that monocled eye.

806
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,140
You know what's funny?

807
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,460
All of those volunteer, quote, astronauts, unquote,

808
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,740
start imagining the peanut suit.

809
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,540
Something about Mr. Peanut...

810
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,920
Do you suppose the Russians had something to do with that?

811
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,240
Could they have breached security

812
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,980
and implanted the Mr. Peanut fantasy?

813
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,800
Hello, boys and girls.

814
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,260
Look, he thinks he's Mr. Peanut.

815
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:03,920
Here's a bag of bag of peanuts.

816
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,460
I'm Mr. Peanut.

817
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,260
And if it's not Mr. Peanut, it's Reddy Kilowatt.

818
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,480
Dad, we enjoyed the opening of the 7-Eleven.

819
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,760
Remember, it's a child-famed corporation.

820
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,200
It's...

821
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,460
It's...

822
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,060
You're not allowed to steal the peanuts.

823
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:17,440
Condominium.

824
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,760
It's sad, in a way.

825
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,780
Oh, boy.

826
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,500
I'm taller than all the other Mr. Peanut men.

827
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,060
This is a very, very big, important convention of Mr. Peanut men.

828
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,100
I think I'm standing...

829
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,520
Do you suppose his suit is over-medicating him?

830
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,080
I wonder...

831
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,300
I wonder if I stood up even taller if I would stand up much more from the rest.

832
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,740
But why...

833
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,880
Why old advertising figures?

834
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,580
I mean, Mr. Peanut's not even used anymore in marketing, I don't think.

835
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,960
It's something from his past.

836
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,880
They're comforting things.

837
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,260
Oh, Mr. Potato Head.

838
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,780
One of the, uh...

839
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:55,200
The people on the way to Proxima Regulus were all turned into Mr. Potato Head.

840
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,640
Around the six-month mark, just like him.

841
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,820
We'll have to remember that.

842
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,260
Yes.

843
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,440
We'll make a note of it.

844
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,320
We'll have to tell the psychology department.

845
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,960
Oh, now I'm blonde, Mr. Potato Head.

846
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,800
And now I've got red hair.

847
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,540
We ought to tell the cruelty department, too.

848
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:16,780
They can start implanting evil Mr. Potato Head.

849
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,280
At an evil Mr. Peanut.

850
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,980
No wonder they gave me a shriveled-up Mr. Potato Head.

851
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,360
Because now I can scare the little children.

852
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,580
I like this mask you're using.

853
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:32,900
Oh!

854
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,720
What the hell was that?

855
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,980
There's no welts on the back of my potato.

856
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,680
This must be some sort of, like, Stanislaus Lem movie or something.

857
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,540
Anything you think of.

858
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,220
Welts?

859
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:50,380
Welts?

860
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,480
Welts?

861
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,200
Welts?

862
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,200


863
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,200


864
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,200


865
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,200


866
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,200


867
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,320
Mr. Tuber costume.

868
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,020
It's the big sweet potato head.

869
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,020
Oh, I love this one the best.

870
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,120
It's carved out in the middle.

871
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:04,560
Huh.

872
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,080
Do you suppose...

873
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:14,220
Do you suppose he has any inkling that all of his silly antics are being broadcast to

874
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,560
all the people on Earth?

875
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,600
Oh, I don't think so.

876
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,660
On the crazy astronaut channel?

877
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,320
He's fully lost.

878
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,820
Hey, if somebody was watching...

879
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,340
One of these days he's going to switch through those channels and he's going to come upon

880
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,180
the channel with him on it.

881
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,320
Oh, man.

882
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,940
I might as well look at the box for a while.

883
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,920
This is getting boring.

884
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,300
Might as well look at the box for a while.

885
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,340
This is getting boring.

886
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,140
It's me!

887
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,140


888
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,940
Might as well look at the box for a while.

889
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,140
This is getting boring.

890
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:42,660
It's me!

891
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,500
Hey, it's me!

892
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,520
It's getting boring.

893
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:45,540


894
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,100
It's me!

895
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,460
It's me!

896
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,580
It's my face is up there.

897
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,260
Hey, my face is up there.

898
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:53,600
You!

899
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,880
My face is up there.

900
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,460
I can feel my little mouth.

901
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,460
It's not real.

902
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:10,580
Dave, your gyros need stabilizing.

903
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,360
Dave, check your computer.

904
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,120
Wait, who?

905
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,500
Your gyro...

906
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:14,760
Your...

907
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,120
Your...

908
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,140
Your...

909
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,700
Your spinning!

910
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,580
You're in a spin, Dave!

911
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,880
Whose voice is this?

912
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,140
Stabilize the gyros!

913
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,320
Is this a real voice or is it just a real voice?

914
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,520
Turn up the oxygen switch!

915
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,500
Oh, I'm getting lightheaded in here.

916
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,420
Reach for the oxygen switch, Dave!

917
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,380
I think I'll turn on the oxygen switch.

918
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,420
Oh.

919
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
There, he did it.

920
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,480
At least he thought it was the oxygen switch.

921
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,200
What's wrong with the switch?

922
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,100
I'm just grabbing.

923
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,100


924
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,260
I'm gonna get my brain stuff going on.

925
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,640
Good, he needed a good washing.

926
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,180
They always panic when the suit fills up with the cleansing fluid.

927
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,120
Right up to their nostrils.

928
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,600
It's like he doesn't...

929
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,940
Church air switch.

930
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,280
My hands are clean.

931
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,080
My face is clean.

932
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,180
Hello? Hello, Dave.

933
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,020
Feeling better now, Dave?

934
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,320
Feeling better now, Dave?

935
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,340
What?

936
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,460
Everything I say itches.

937
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,900
No, no, no. We're not doing that, it says.

938
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,760
It's just...

939
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,920
It's just...

940
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,900
It's just us, Dave.

941
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,840
The voices in your head.

942
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,060
We didn't want you to be alone.

943
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:32,680


944
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,160
I bet I could write a whole symphony on this hollow potato.

945
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,340
I bet I could write a whole symphony on this hollow potato.

946
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,040
That would be something to do for five years.

947
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,480
You'd sit around going mad.

948
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:42,960
You'd sit around going mad.

949
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,800
It's that alternative.

950
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,460
There's been great symphonies written about hollow potatoes, Dave.

951
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,180
There's been great symphonies written about hollow potatoes, Dave.

952
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,060
Why don't you try it?

953
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,760
It'll keep you busy for a month or so.

954
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,360
Yeah, why don't I try it?

955
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,920
I could, like, make thousands and thousands of little holes.

956
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,120
I could, like, make thousands and thousands of little holes.

957
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,480
Like some sort of chromatic key.

958
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,500
I could just get a little...

959
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,160
Dave, the cat's loose in the spaceship.

960
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,980
So let me check the monitor for...

961
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,360
So let me check the monitor for...

962
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,940
Shit! The cat's loose!

963
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,240
Damn cat!

964
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,460
It's crawling all over all of...

965
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,000
You better catch that cat, Dave.

966
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,700
It's walking across the control panel.

967
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,640
You're going into a spin again.

968
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,320
You're destabilizing.

969
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,320
Oh my god. I'm gonna destabilize.

970
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,600
This thing's gonna start flipping.

971
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,000
If I don't get down there right away...

972
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,360
Shh!

973
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,440
Shh!

974
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,080
Ginger!

975
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:34,640
Ginger!

976
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,360
Ginger!

977
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,080
Ah!

978
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:38,120


979
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,080
Ah!

980
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,120
Oh good, look!

981
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,180
Princess Wee the cat's mutated.

982
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,200
Just as we were hoping.

983
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,260
What the hell are you...

984
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,160
He let it wander into the cargo hold where it was exposed.

985
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,140
What is that?

986
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:57,540
Ginger?

987
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,660
Is that you?

988
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:00,960
Sheesh!

989
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,420
What the hell's

990
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,060
a slime all over your neck?

991
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,160
What you getting into?

992
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,340
Just let me get a little closer, kid.

993
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,160
What's wrong?

994
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,520
Try to make friends with it, Dave.

995
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,020
I'll try and make friends with it.

996
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,960
Try to make friends with Ginger.

997
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,280
Yeah.

998
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,400
Ginger's always a nice little kitty.

999
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,980
It's just sick or something.

1000
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,120
I'll make friends.

1001
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,440
I'll pet it and take it back out of here.

1002
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,500
Ginger?

1003
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:30,660
Ah!

1004
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,660
Now settle down, Dave.

1005
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,220
Try to communicate with it.

1006
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,600
It's a new form of life.

1007
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,100
No one's ever seen a cat spider before.

1008
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,940
It could teach us things.

1009
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,360
Oh my god!

1010
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,820
Think what it could mean to science.

1011
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,760
Go on in there, Dave.

1012
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,560
Can I get rid of it?

1013
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,040
Go on back into that cargo hold

1014
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,760
with that giant mutated cat spider.

1015
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,940
If I could just talk to her, maybe.

1016
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,840
It's gotta be intelligent if it's mutated this far.

1017
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,160
It maybe has something to tell me.

1018
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,940
A little kitty?

1019
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,180
Or whatever the hell you are now.

1020
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,080
A little cat?

1021
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:09,080


1022
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:09,080


1023
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,220
What the hell's up?

1024
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,280
What's up?

1025
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,240
Oh, it just needs to be comforted, Dave.

1026
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,960
Your music soothes the savage beast.

1027
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,700
Why don't you put on some music?

1028
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,780
Ginger, I was gonna play a little song for you.

1029
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,660
Maybe you should put out some milk for it.

1030
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,620
A little try of milk.

1031
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,380
Um...

1032
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,440
I was wondering...

1033
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,380
Be careful now.

1034
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,920
Don't let it get hurt.

1035
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,960
A bird can burn a hole directly through the spaceship hole.

1036
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,260
It would create a terrible vacuum

1037
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,020
and suck you out into space like

1038
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,420
toothpaste out of a tube.

1039
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,480
It looks like you're going for it, man.

1040
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,400
What do you mean, cause?

1041
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,140
And whatever you do,

1042
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,720
don't let any harm come to Ginger.

1043
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,660
The War Department is very interested

1044
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,020
in your little tabby.

1045
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,060
I am in big deal with this right now.

1046
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,760
I don't know how to talk to her.

1047
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,780
I don't know how to talk to her.

1048
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,080
I don't know how to talk to her.

1049
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,920
I don't know how to talk to her.

1050
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,400
What's coming up over there, brother?

1051
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,600
It's a big, big, blue spider.

1052
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:18,640
It's a big, big, blue spider.

1053
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:18,640


1054
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,400
And we'll be back to the lonesome cowboy Dave

1055
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,180
flipping out in outer space channel

1056
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:24,440
flipping out in outer space channel

1057
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,720
after these words from

1058
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,040
our controller.

1059
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,100
Cue up the...

1060
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,020
Cue up the controller tape!

1061
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:35,600
Cue up the...

1062
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:35,600


1063
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,920
From PR News in Washington, I'm undergoing treatment for alcohol.

1064
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:39,340
From PR News in Washington, I'm undergoing treatment for alcoholism.

1065
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,380
On Wall Street, 1686523.

1066
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,100
PR's Ed.

1067
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,340
Dangerous, malicious, and reckless.

1068
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,440
PR's Ben.

1069
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,120
This is PR News.

1070
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,040
House Speaker Dennis Hastert used banned

1071
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,660
performance-enhancing drugs.

1072
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,900
Two Americans are winners of this year's Nobel Prize

1073
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,300
in PR News in Washington.

1074
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,500
Dealing with overpopulation

1075
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,400
involves more than birth control.

1076
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,980
I say kill them all,

1077
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,560
let God sort them out.

1078
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,060
I say send them

1079
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,160
back to Lexington.

1080
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:11,560
I'm into the

1081
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,180
voluntary human extinction movement.

1082
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,200
I say let them eat green cheese.

1083
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,500
Let them eat green cheese

1084
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,680
and let the cat sort them out.

1085
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,420
Let the mutated

1086
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,300
spider cat.

1087
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,220
I say exterminate all

1088
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,560
of these funk monsters.

1089
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,280
Everything's future dogs.

1090
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,040
It's the end of them.

1091
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,920
Stop the whole genetic purge.

1092
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,160
Is there any coffee on this spaceship?

1093
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,060
Is there any

1094
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,360
vitamin in this

1095
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,060
little tiny

1096
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,560
little box?

1097
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,000
Now come on Dave,

1098
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,780
I know you got some of that whiskey stashed

1099
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:54,120
somewhere,

1100
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,180
backed with the bio-samples

1101
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:57,860
from Mars.

1102
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,380
Bio-samples?

1103
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,960
The samples are stuck in my home?

1104
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,180
We're coming up to the magic hour.

1105
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,060
I know this will help.

1106
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,260
I'll do what you can.

1107
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,380
You know, I'm just

1108
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,140
a little drunk.

1109
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:16,320
We can't understand a word you're saying, Dave.

1110
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,240
I'm a sour pussy, that's for sure.

1111
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:19,180
What?

1112
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:22,820
He's lost

1113
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,360
in space, friends.

1114
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,160
Sad.

1115
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,340
But,

1116
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,760
it's part of the risks these astronauts

1117
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,340
take.

1118
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,860
Thank God cremorah don't make you sleepy

1119
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,820
like some of the other ones do.

1120
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,820
Well, at one o'clock your suit will put you

1121
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:39,180
to sleep.

1122
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,920
I'm waiting. I'm waiting.

1123
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,340
I'm waiting for my suit to put me to sleep.

1124
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,600
Over the last five

1125
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,880
and a half hours,

1126
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,740
my suit has enthralled me.

1127
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:55,000
My suit has put me to sleep

1128
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,100
and waked me up again.

1129
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,900
My suit fed me.

1130
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,860
My suit evacuated my bowels.

1131
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,940
My suit lulled me into

1132
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,180
a false sense of security.

1133
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,540
It's a comforting suit.

1134
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,440
My suit talked to me.

1135
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,240
My suit made me feel very insecure.

1136
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,760
My suit,

1137
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,860
my suit expanded and contracted

1138
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,080
a few times. I didn't understand what that

1139
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:17,580
was about.

1140
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,400
It was punishing you, Dave.

1141
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,700
The suit punishes.

1142
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,060
The suit punishes and the suit rewards.

1143
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,460
The suit rewards you, Dave.

1144
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,320
My world

1145
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,640
is in this suit.

1146
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,440
This is my entire world.

1147
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,320
The suit is your friend.

1148
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,520
It's a nurturing cocoon.

1149
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,060
Oh, look at the cut of the suit.

1150
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,180
This is the kind of seasoning

1151
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,380
that would make any, any young man

1152
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,800
in America jealous as hell.

1153
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,240
I'm a true hero.

1154
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,660
Wearing this suit made me a hero.

1155
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,460
I'm proud of it. I'm glad I signed up now.

1156
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,360
I think my suit's

1157
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,240
filling me with pride.

1158
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,840
I'm afraid that's not pride, Dave.

1159
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,360
I'm afraid that's not pride, Dave.

1160
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,540
You shouldn't have eaten those

1161
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,640
freeze-dried beans this morning.

1162
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,340
They just had a little fuzz on them.

1163
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,000
I didn't see nothing wrong

1164
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:07,840
with those beans.

1165
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,420
The suit may be filling up with a lot more

1166
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,520
than mere pride.

1167
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,340
Oh, there you go. He's using the zero gravity toilet again.

1168
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,660
Oh, boy.

1169
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,960
This is kind of a...

1170
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,380
Whoopee!

1171
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,260
Oh, no. He left the flap open.

1172
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,740
Look. The stuff is floating around

1173
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,160
inside the cabin now.

1174
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,520
It's coating the windows.

1175
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,440
Oh, on the window.

1176
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,880
Way to go, Dave. Smooth move.

1177
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:33,680
Ha, ha, ha.

1178
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,220
Oh, no.

1179
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,140
Well, now the emergency

1180
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,800
lights have gone off.

1181
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,960
Little robots have to come out and clean up

1182
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,220
after you again, Dave.

1183
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,080
Hello?

1184
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,040
The suit's going to have to...

1185
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,540
The suit's going to have to punish you again, Dave.

1186
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,240
Hello? I need a clean up

1187
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,400
on the front window.

1188
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,480
Oh, shh.

1189
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,100
The thing's going to be stuck there for weeks now.

1190
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:02,760
Of course,

1191
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,260
in this vacuous atmosphere, it won't smell much,

1192
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,120
I don't suppose. Now, just don't take

1193
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:07,880
your helmet off.

1194
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,660
I wonder what would happen

1195
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,820
if I took my helmet off.

1196
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,500
I never tried it.

1197
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,060
No, don't do that, Dave.

1198
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,560
Wait a minute. Maybe something might...

1199
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,460
This is not a pressurized cabin.

1200
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,540
Might not be such a good idea

1201
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,120
after all.

1202
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,320
Fiddle around with these...

1203
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,040
Oh, look. He's trying to light

1204
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:31,920
a cigarette again.

1205
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,400
He can't get it up to his lips through that helmet.

1206
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,380
Damn.

1207
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,900
This must be the five thousandth time

1208
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,720
he's done that.

1209
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:42,900
Sixteen cartons of luggage,

1210
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,420
and I can't smoke a damn cigarette.

1211
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:47,080
It was a brilliant move on the part of the psychology department

1212
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,100
to put that no smoking sign

1213
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,220
blinking in there,

1214
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,960
and those twenty cartons of cigarettes

1215
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,560
that...

1216
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,140
keeps up the sort of tension

1217
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,760
that keeps the astronauts...

1218
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,060
Oddly enough, it keeps them

1219
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,860
mentally healthy.

1220
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,560
You know, it's so alone out here,

1221
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,480
the only friend I've got's my own guitar.

1222
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,120
Lucille,

1223
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,720
you've been with me through thick and thin.

1224
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,300
Can't smoke,

1225
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,360
can't really eat a good meal,

1226
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,720
but I can still sing a song.

1227
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,860
I think I'll sing a song

1228
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,900
about my intergalactic exploits.

1229
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,300
Scott can't even hardly touch

1230
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,040
these fragile, these big mitts on.

1231
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,500
Years have gone,

1232
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,760
and years have gone,

1233
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,020
but still I'm a flying bug.

1234
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,860
Someday I'll get there,

1235
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,740
and maybe I won't,

1236
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,080
and I'll never know

1237
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,500
the reason why.

1238
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,460
Shh, it's the worst one yet so far.

1239
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,360
Can't you keep on working it, huh?

1240
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,120
I'll have my opera all figured out

1241
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,180
by the time I get there.

1242
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,940
And then, I'll make it back to Earth.

1243
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,320
It's more herodom and fame and fortune

1244
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,500
for me. Just chop that up

1245
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:14,700
and...

1246
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,440
You'll be the biggest folk music star

1247
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,420
on Alpha Centauri, Dave.

1248
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,980
Oh, God, I could see it right now.

1249
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,420
I could be like the

1250
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,360
Woody Guthrie of Alpha Centauri.

1251
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,500
You'll be the only musician

1252
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,440
in the whole star system, Dave.

1253
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,460
Of course, yeah.

1254
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,440
I'll be the only musician in the whole star system.

1255
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,180
You'll be the only music fan

1256
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,700
in the whole star system.

1257
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,880
Yeah, and my head will be shaped like a gigantic fan,

1258
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,440
like one of those

1259
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,440
Komodo dragons, or what do they call them?

1260
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,420
Monitor lizards, when they get mad.

1261
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,140
Good, we've got him

1262
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:52,000
doing stream of consciousness again.

1263
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,700
That should keep him amused

1264
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,060
for a few more days.

1265
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:56,500
I wonder if they got

1266
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,160
a reefer on Alpha Centauri.

1267
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,940
I wonder if they got

1268
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,580
hot like Earth-type babes

1269
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:03,600
on Alpha Centauri.

1270
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,880
The suit is your girlfriend, Dave.

1271
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,360
The suit is your girlfriend, Dave.

1272
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,760
It's clamping down.

1273
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,560
It's constricting.

1274
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,320
It's clamping down.

1275
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:15,680
It's tightening up.

1276
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,600
It's form-fitting, isn't it?

1277
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,880
It's form-fitting, isn't it?

1278
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,720
I didn't know a suit could do this.

1279
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:24,400


1280
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,880
What the heck is going on?

1281
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:28,540


1282
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:31,660
What the heck is going on?

1283
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,860
All right, that's enough.

1284
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,540
Turn off that phone.

1285
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,200
This is the function of the suit.

1286
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,700
Now let's make him exercise.

1287
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,560
Put the suit in exercise mode.

1288
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:39,980
There we go.

1289
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,180
He's flopping.

1290
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,500
My knee joint's going out again.

1291
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:48,120
What the hell is this music in this case?

1292
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,320
Good aerobatized music.

1293
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,420
We must keep our astronauts

1294
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,600
in good shape.

1295
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,560
I hate these resistance calisthenics.

1296
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,100
And jumping jacks

1297
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,360
at this time of the morning.

1298
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,880
It'll be five years of this

1299
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,560
if he's lucky.

1300
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,020
I mean, I can't do this for five years.

1301
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,880
I can't do this for another minute longer.

1302
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,200
If he doesn't happen to hit one of the planets,

1303
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,560
if there are any in the Alpha Centauri system,

1304
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,880
then he'll just have to go on to the next star system

1305
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,620
20 years past that.

1306
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,800
But you'll probably hit a planet,

1307
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,940
some sort of a planet, or a moon,

1308
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,360
or an asteroid, or something,

1309
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,200
some body of rock floating around in space.

1310
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:37,160
Think of the romantic cartoon man on a desert island

1311
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,700
with nothing but one palm tree and a shark swimming around.

1312
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,500
That romantic fantasy will be yours.

1313
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,420
Only high-tech style, Dave.

1314
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,220
I'm a high-tech style romantic hero figure

1315
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,400
abandoned on a distant moon,

1316
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,180
cast into space like some piece of effluvia

1317
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,080
on the sea.

1318
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:03,960
Someday I'll be home.

1319
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,260
Someday I'll touch the shore,

1320
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,400
a distant shore somewhere.

1321
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,520
It ain't much longer of a wait.

1322
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,520
I'll get there someday.

1323
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,820
If you get bored, Dave,

1324
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,900
you can always just put a note in a bottle

1325
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,900
and send it out into the radio waves

1326
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,180
like you've just done

1327
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,160
for the last time.

1328
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,500
It's just two hours.

1329
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,960
This has been ESO Radio

1330
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,900
on WCSB Cleveland

1331
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,020
with my guests Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

1332
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,300
the Reverend Ivan Stang,

1333
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,900
and the Princess We Are Doe.

1334
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:48,860
My name is Chaz,

1335
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,280
and I'll see you all next week.

1336
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,720
Yay for Chaz.

1337
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,000
He's the mix master.

1338
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,260
Yes, friends, thanks to Dave and Chaz

1339
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:08,060
and we and the callers and WCSB Cleveland

1340
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:12,600
for that strange and wonderful broadcast.

1341
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,540
Nice recording there.

1342
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,160
For more information, of course,

1343
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,400
it's subgenius.com

1344
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:23,140
and we really do intend to do our X-Day celebration

1345
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:26,800
up until the saucers get here at 7 a.m. July 5th

1346
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,780
online, I guess.

1347
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,540
I mean, I'm not sure what we're going to do.

1348
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,720
It should be interesting.

1349
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:38,580
To tell the truth, I imagine what the X-Day Zoom meetings

1350
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,920
will probably be all day and all night practically

1351
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,940
for that week.

1352
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,840
It'll be about like the real X-Day

1353
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:52,240
in which the best part is standing around in the road talking

1354
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:55,420
or sometimes sitting around a campfire talking.

1355
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:59,400
But mostly it ends up being standing in the road.

1356
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,300
At least for me.

1357
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,140
That's my favorite part of all those festivals.

1358
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:08,280
The music is fun and the jibber-jabber from loudmouths

1359
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,180
on stage is fun, but really the best part is just the talking

1360
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,900
to the other subgeniuses.

1361
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,640
It's interesting.

1362
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,460
And now this.

1363
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:59,400


1364
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:29,400


1365
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:52,260
