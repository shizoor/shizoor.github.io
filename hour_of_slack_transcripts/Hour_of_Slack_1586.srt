00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:10,360
This portion of programming is brought to you by Bob's Steakhouse on the corner of Pursuit and Flushing in beautiful Stane, California.

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,320
Come on down to Bob's and get a mouthful of meat from the man himself.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,180
If you'd like to make a reservation, please call 1-800-555-13013.

4
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,760
Most young people will continue through life as normal, responsible citizens.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,160
Others, the shunted and unloved, the unguided, the seekers of thrills and kicks, are candidates for the slave world of lifelong...

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,840
How does it happen? Where does it start? What are the signs?

7
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,780
The pattern is generally the same.

8
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,280
Bob?

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,160
Take a look.

10
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:57,480
The lack of responsibility, the inability to make right choices, add to it ignorance and indifference, and top it off with a desire for escapism and kicks.

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,440
The sum total is then...

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,460
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,100
This is the real action.

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,800
This is the test.

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,220
The time to separate the man from the boy.

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,480
Willpower, individuality, character are slipping down the drain.

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,720
In their place comes Bob.

18
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,620
Bob?

19
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,360
Don't be chicken.

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,960
Okay, this is the kind of thing I collect.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,940
It is a set list.

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,460
It's Andrew the Impale's set list.

23
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,780
It's been bled on, came upon.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,820
There's snot, boogers, everything gross on it, and footprints, of course.

25
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,880
And it's on the back of the...

26
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,640
puffing chamber and fermentation station,

27
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,520
do not flush flyer,

28
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,200
and someone cut the Dobbs head out of it.

29
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,700
These are the kinds of things I collect.

30
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,800
We'll be able to clone Andrew the Impaled again

31
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:13,480
from the body fluids stuck on this old piece of paper

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,960
from the subgenius stage.

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,480
That's why I collect these.

34
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,360
In case I want to torture a subgenius later,

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,580
I can resurrect his clone on the saucers

36
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,920
and get my rocks off.

37
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,440
Not that I can think of anybody specific,

38
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,000
but it's a good option to have.

39
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,940
Praise Bob.

40
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,980
Well, I guess since I'm standing here,

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,220
I might as well rant.

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,760
It's hard for me to rant about how fucked up everything is

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,500
because sort of like Dr. Leguim,

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,160
I am.

45
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,160


46
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,180
I actually got slack.

47
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,300
And that shouldn't seem ironic or weird or anything.

48
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,300
Of course I got slack.

49
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,120
I followed Bob's word.

50
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,500
I slacked off in his name.

51
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,580
My idea of slacking off is working

52
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,020
at things I like to do.

53
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,840
It doesn't really matter if it's for Bob

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,380
or one of my hobbies.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,000
Like my game.

56
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,980
Monster Hunter.

57
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,680
Or my hobby of looking at my zoo of microorganisms.

58
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,320
Or my hobby of taking care of the yard and the house.

59
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,800
It's doing things that I wanted to do.

60
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,460
But that's what I call slack.

61
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,280
Now I understand,

62
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,080
or actually I don't understand,

63
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,600
that for many people,

64
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,640
slack really is doing nothing

65
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,680
or just watching.

66
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,540
And sometimes,

67
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,360
that's true for me too.

68
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,560
So I guess it takes all kinds.

69
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,900
My point is,

70
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,740
I suppose it must be possible to have a rant

71
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,920
that's not exactly completely pissed off

72
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,020
about how ruined and terrible your life is.

73
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,620
I'm lucky I don't have any disabilities.

74
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,100
I make just enough money to pay the mortgage.

75
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,600
And what else do you need?

76
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,880
I mean, come on.

77
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,060
This is the modern world.

78
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,520
We have to make money.

79
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,380
We have aspirin.

80
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,820
We have air conditioning.

81
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,580
We're richer than the richest motherfuckers that ever lived.

82
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,080
And yet we sit on our asses and whine about it.

83
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,540
Oh yeah, I guess I am pissed off about something.

84
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,340
I am.

85
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,900
I'm pissed off about people who do not count their blessings.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,200
Because they're too fucking lazy to even bother to count.

87
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,960
They can't see what's right in front of their faces.

88
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,500
Which is the path around the next level.

89
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,280
The next corner.

90
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,980
Slack lies around the next corner.

91
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,400
I promise you it's true.

92
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,000
If you can just keep going around that next corner,

93
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,680
you will eventually get to the slack.

94
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,000
And I know that's true because I went through the trouble

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,880
of getting off my ass and going around the next corner.

96
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,900
It took a...

97
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,660
It was a few more steps than I might normally have taken.

98
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,660
And yet,

99
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,800
by golly,

100
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,920
it led to at least the last part of my life.

101
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,360
Hopefully the last three-fourths.

102
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,600
Or hopefully the infinite amount.

103
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,240
I'm hoping the next day happens.

104
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:31,680
Anyway,

105
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,420
my goddammit friends,

106
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,160
the world is not completely shitty.

107
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,360
There actually are some really cool things.

108
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,780
Like comic books,

109
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,000
monster movies,

110
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,000
girls,

111
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,000
boys.

112
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,640
Um...

113
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,920
Yeah, money too.

114
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,400
But really,

115
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,140
a subgenius can get slack

116
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,020
from looking at a handful of dirt.

117
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,520
If you know how to really look.

118
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,560
You'll see the slack in that handful of dirt.

119
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,340
Take my word for it,

120
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,380
it can be done.

121
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,580
And even if you are a slave to some job,

122
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,120
there's still lots of handfuls of dirt around.

123
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,400
Price Bob,

124
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,760
I thank you for coming to the show today.

125
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,180
Ah-hoo-ga!

126
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,480
Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah!

133
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,760
Everybody!

134
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes, but particularly me!

135
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:40,900
Yeah!

136
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:50,220
And it is a great honor for me to introduce to you one of the newest reverends to the Church of the Subgenius,

137
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,360
Reverend Amy Mm-hmm!

138
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:02,760
Everyone, and that is M-M-H-M-M for those of you who are spelling disabled.

139
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,060
Mm-hmm.

140
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:10,760
And I brought Amy up to perform a couple of songs for you because it's fucking great slack.

141
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,140
It wasn't one thing

142
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,040
That set me free

143
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,580
Oh

144
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,500
Your voice has that ring

145
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,200
I had had enough

146
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,460
I had had enough

147
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,940
When you've had enough

148
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,160
You leave, you love, you bleed

149
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,460
Till there's nothing left

150
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,540
When you've had enough

151
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,900
You leave, you love, you bleed

152
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,700
Till there's nothing left

153
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,360
But to vampire yourself

154
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,700
They'll call you selfish

155
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,040
And whisper those lies

156
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,100
Ask how you doing

157
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,240
Tryna dig in your life

158
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,540
But you can dig in my life

159
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,120
Cause when you've had enough

160
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,440
You leave, you love, you bleed

161
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
Till there's nothing left

162
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,040
When you've had enough

163
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,220
You leave, you love, you bleed

164
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,020
Till there's nothing left

165
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,360
But to vent for yourself

166
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,780
I was told

167
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,420
You'd reach the point

168
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,940
I was told

169
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,980
That I'm having all the shit everyone else had

170
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh, I had enough

171
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,000


172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,000


173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,000


174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,000


175
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,500
I was cold to the touch when my heart broke in two

176
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,560
I don't blame you

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,840
But when you've had enough, you leave, you love, you bleed

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Till there's nothing left

179
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,340
When you've had enough, you leave, you love, you bleed

180
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,740
Yeah

181
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,940
When you've had enough, you leave, you love, you bleed

182
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,180
Till there's nothing left

183
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,760
When you've had enough, you leave, you love, you bleed

184
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,800
Till there's nothing left but to fend for yourself

185
00:11:44,240 --> 00:12:01,320
Till there's nothing left but to fend for yourself

186
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,300
Don't tell us what we are.

187
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,900
No, I know what you are.

188
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,660
You know what you are.

189
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,200
I didn't have to.

190
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,040
I wasn't going to say anything.

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,660
No, that's it.

192
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,940
Oh, sweetie.

193
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,020
A package came for you.

194
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,400
I'm not sure.

195
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,060
Mensa?

196
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,180
Something about geniuses.

197
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,780
It's there for you on the kitchen table.

198
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,420
Did you have a good day at work?

199
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,120
And then...

200
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,040
I retreated to my room.

201
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,860
And I turned on all of the lights.

202
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,700
And I cleared off my desk.

203
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:39,980
And inside this peculiar padded envelope was a folder.

204
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,780
And inside that folder was everything I'd ever need.

205
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,860
Here's your pamphlets.

206
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,960
Here's your Xerox sheets.

207
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,320
Here's your first buttons.

208
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,100
Here's your membership card.

209
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,580
Just fill out your name.

210
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,860
And fill out the included card.

211
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,240
And submit it with a stamp.

212
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,980
That's right.

213
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,940
I paid $30.

214
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,560
And had to provide my own stamp.

215
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,340
To register myself.

216
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,320
As Reggie.

217
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,520
As Reverend Dr. Argus Quatteloup Fox.

218
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,640
Ph.D.

219
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,960
Of the Church of the Subgenius.

220
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,060
Hey, baby, I want to go up to X Day.

221
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,000
No.

222
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,320
No.

223
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


224
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


225
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


226
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


227
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


228
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


229
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


230
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


231
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


232
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


233
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


234
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


235
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


236
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


237
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


238
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


239
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


240
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


241
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


242
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


243
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


244
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


245
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


246
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


247
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,320


248
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,120
It's up in Upstate New York.

249
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,680
I know you live in New Jersey.

250
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,920
I could come and get you.

251
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,700
And we could head up there.

252
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,480
Oh.

253
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,060
Sorry.

254
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,120
I didn't realize you were...

255
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,240
That insane.

256
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,740
Sorry to get your hopes up there.

257
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,320
But I'm not matching my wedding.

258
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,320


259
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,320


260
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,900
I'm not matching my wedding plates.

261
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,660
Based off of Crayola colors.

262
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:42,940
I refuse to believe that Robin's Egg Blue can ever be used as some sort of reference

263
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,500
point.

264
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,600
Hey, you.

265
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,700
You heard about Bob?

266
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,300
He's just this guy.

267
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,300


268
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,300


269
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,300


270
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,300


271
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,300


272
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,300


273
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,300


274
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,300


275
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,300


276
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,300


277
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,300


278
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,300


279
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,300


280
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,300


281
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,380
I've been talking about a lot.

282
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,360
He can show you some things.

283
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,300
Yeah, man.

284
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,120
Some things.

285
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,740
He can show you what's really going on.

286
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,020
Who's pulling those strings.

287
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,760
And they might be shorter.

288
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,300
I don't know.

289
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,340
So long as you think he's as good-looking than you expect.

290
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,280
What do you mean you never want to speak to me again?

291
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,440
All I was trying to do is say hello.

292
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,720
Yeah, I realize I juggled the shot glasses fine when I set them up there.

293
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,500
It fell off.

294
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,640
I juggled the shot glasses.

295
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,800
I didn't drop them while I was juggling them.

296
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,280
It was an accident.

297
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,280


298
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,280


299
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:07,340
accident I I put it up there I I know I'm sorry I'm sorry really I didn't mean

300
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,700
to break the shot glass I'll pay for it

301
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,740
give me another chance

302
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,560
I'm glad we went to dinner and made out in my car

303
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:44,560
I'm glad that you and I both hate this job

304
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,460
hey I want to show you a video

305
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,480
about Bob

306
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,420
now I understand if there are some

307
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,280
things here that you may not understand

308
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,080
or want to understand but the contents

309
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,080
of this videotape will show you

310
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,480
everything you need to know I've watched

311
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,700
it a hundred times

312
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,360
and several backwards

313
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,100
and

314
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,060
you also give a growl

315
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,080
I

316
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:14,360
By the power of J.R. Bob Dobbs, I invoke all of you within earshot to now rise.

317
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,160
Rise! Rise from your comfort, I demand it.

318
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,220
You, rise!

319
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,200
You, rise!

320
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,280
You, rise!

321
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,340
Rise!

322
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,400
You, rise!

323
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,720
You, come forward!

324
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,740
Come forward now in the name of Bob!

325
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,820
Rise and come forward!

326
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,200
Because I'm going to tell you the best part.

327
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,140
It's the best part.

328
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,620
So, what did you think of that video?

329
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,240
You liked it?

330
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:22,800
Well, you know I've been looking for someone to go to this little festival.

331
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,320
A private party.

332
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,680
Do you want to go?

333
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:29,920
No?

334
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:31,100


335
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,480
It's not too bad.

336
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,520
All we have to do is drive 18 hours one direction.

337
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,580
We'll pack Dr. Purge in the back seat.

338
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,440
And they say Papa Joe Mama needs a ride.

339
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,580
There's not enough room in the car.

340
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,280
But we'll make room.

341
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,260
We'll make room.

342
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,200
Zip-Zo Zip.

343
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:03,880
Hang on, last one of your tickets, you and your aluminum seat belt.

344
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:03,880


345
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:03,880

00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:03,880

00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:03,880

00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:03,880

00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:03,880


350
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,280
The head of the church of the sort.

351
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:16,880
The وأ Jesus just called me on my cell phone to tell me that he really appreciates me bringing up one of these old guys. I think this is going to go well.

354
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:57,080
Well he's calling me and I'm kind of excited because I've been talking about going here.

355
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:11,260
And their expecting me. I'm going to bring this projector. Maybe that'll impress them.

Holy shit! I survived x day... For the first time! And then the second time, And then the

366
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:43,800
And that person, I told seven years ago, took my hand in marriage right here on this stage one year ago tomorrow.

367
00:22:48,900 --> 00:23:13,780
I went from a guy who had never heard from Bob, who had never seen Bob, to crawling my way across slackless barrens of the conspiracy to be united in slack eternally with my father.

368
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,960
My true Getty mate.

By that asshole sitting right there.

370
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:34,560
So that's my entire life story when it comes to the church of the subgenius.

371
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,460
And yeah, I met Bob.

372
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,020
He's real.

373
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,720
Now, Tim.

374
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,660
I'll tell you about it later.

375

He's fucking my mother-in-law.

376
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:01,160
But I got an apartment just outside of downtown.

377
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,860
And I come home every day.

378
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:13,700
And I look at a big half-tone pattern of the eyes that will watch me.

379
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,100
Until I die.

380
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,580
And I'm gonna tell everyone.

381
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,300
That unless.

382
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,920
You get right with Bob.

383
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:35,060
You're never gonna know what it means to live.

384
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,240
Fucked peas.

385
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,160
Fucked peas.

386
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,420
Fucked peas.

387
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,660
Fucked peas.

388
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,620
Oh, my God.

389
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,460
My poor asshole.

390
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,120
That's just so hard.

391
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,120


392
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,120


393
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,220
His whole life trickled out the door.

394
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,220


395
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,220


396
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,300
What childrens like you have.

397
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,300


398
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,300


399
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,400
was nuts eh?

400
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:07,420
I think that's how it goes with me.

401
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:07,960
OK.

402
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,480
It's any better than when I started searching,

403
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,480
rasters like on the cout, Джayم miller than a bo Star Era 13 Mad Anger bt udah

404
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,140
siang at as if this back is the time since the Black Nothing it's an dusty internet ABC and Morty Crate

405
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:21,760
got you? Got any more good investment opportunities for me, animal?

406
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,860
Why, as a matter of fact, I do! Have you tried scrum.com?

407
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:34,220
I have, and my ISP has blocked it. I've been receiving all these threatening letters from their lawyers.

408
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:50,300
Scrum, scrum, scrum, scrum. It's yummy in your tummy and it's scrum. Everybody wants some scrum.

409
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:57,780
Remember that time we had scrum? Oh, that was a good time. That was such a good time.

410
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:04,200
Remind me again of the time when you had the scrum and... It was so good. It was so good.

411
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:14,620
Let's tell me how good it was again. It was so good that I paid for the gold membership so I could watch the scrum.

412
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,340
Have you ever thought about watching scrum as it's being produced?

413
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:30,540
There's no scrum like show scrum. Like no scrum that I know. Everything about it is appealing.

414
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,220
There's no scrum.

415
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,200
Scrum.

416
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,120
Scrum.

417
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,280
They say that falling in scrum is wonderful.

418
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,140
I love scrum.

419
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,160
It's wonderful.

420
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,420
I'm scrumming in the rain.

421
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,680
To hold a scrum in your arms is wonderful.

422
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,300
I'm scrumming in the rain.

423
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,220
I love scrum.

424
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:02,940
Get it? Cause it's funny. So it's a joke. Get it? Cause it's a joke. So it's funny.

425
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,100
If I scrum you tomorrow

426
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,280
Would you scrum for me today?

427
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,140
Well, I must be scrumming onwards.

428
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,620
There's a lot of scrums that I got to spray.

429
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,360
Play that song about that bird that shed the yoke of tyranny.

430
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,120
Okay.

431
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:25,260
There was a bird, he got out of his cage, he flew around, killed his owners in raids, said,

432
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,220
You won't put me in a cage, you piece of shit.

433
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,240
Fuck you!

434
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,800
See, I'm just all jacked up on scrum.

435
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,400
I'm bringing my A-game to X-Day episode 100.

436
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,180
Podcrust.

437
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,640
Number one.

438
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,540
Thorson Yard!

439
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,600
Thorson Yard!

440
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,620
100, 100, 100, 100, 100.

441
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,480
Brought to you by Doug.

442
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,420
X-Day special.

443
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,280
Brought to you by...

444
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,880
So for those of you who don't listen to Thorson Yard and Podcrust,

445
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,600
I'd like to introduce us all really quick, our personnel.

446
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,540
We've got Doug on mics.

447
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,020
Doug.

448
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,860
Hi, I'm Doug.

449
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,100
And our guest star, Doug!

450
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:02,920
Doug!

451
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,860
And don't forget Doug over here.

452
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,040
I am Doug.

453
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,340
He is so hot.

454
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,180
I am, uh...

455
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,140
And don't forget to give it up for Doug over here.

456
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,780
Doug, everybody!

457
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,360
Doug!

458
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,300
Thank you, Doug.

459
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,020
Thank you.

460
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,480
I tell you guys what.

461
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,100
I just flew in from not X-Day, and boy is my dick tired since helicopter.

462
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,640
Much like Thorson.

463
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,040
And it is just a very tiring form of...

464
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,680
Glam!

465
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:35,840
The Wisteria campground mysteriously overtaken by subhuman creatures.

466
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,300
Where?

467
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,700
There's a lot of large sticks around.

468
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,360
We can deal with them.

469
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,420
Are you ready?

470
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,660
Are you...

471
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,120
Are you...

472
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,960
Are you...

473
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:52,460
Doug, are you implying that the subgenius race is less than human instead of superior to human?

474
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,620
No, there's just a...

475
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,400
There is a high alert for subhuman creatures lurking in the vicinity.

476
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,820
That may be seeking out to destroy you and your loved ones.

477
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,980
I'm sorry, Doug, but I agree with Doug on this one.

478
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,560
That is horrible.

479
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,860
I was talking about Doug.

480
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,140
I'm sorry, Colin.

481
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,600
Oh, yeah.

482
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,080
There's a lot of Doug going around.

483
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:09,440
Perfect.

484
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,720
Please hold.

485
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,660
Thank you for holding.

486
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,080
Please hold.

487
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,540
Wait, wait.

488
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,020
Stop.

489
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:27,920
Stop!

490
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,660
You know me!

491
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,700
Thank you, you're so cold!

492
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,780
Oh boy, good boy!

493
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,380
I'm gonna get away with this one!

494
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,840
Not after the last time!

495
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,820
You know what I'm talking about!

496
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,440
The last time!

497
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,220
And tie with that here first!

498
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,400
You gotta keep out on the DL, son.

499
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,580
DL stands for?

500
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,220
DLC, Downloadable Content.

501
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,220
Back in my day, you'd buy a video game and you got the video game.

502
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,580
Now what's up? What's up with downloadable content, audience at home?

503
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,020
What's the deal with that?

504
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,680
Such a shame!

505
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,520
Back in my day, we didn't play online, let alone pay some...

506
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,340
Hider shame!

507
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,160
Jesus!

508
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:10,120
Back in my day, we played with sticks and beat each other senseless for hours and we called it for fun!

509
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,180
Pick your favorite style!

510
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,560
Oh! How about hip hop?

511
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,340
Hip hop!

512
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,880
What's that, Darth Vader?

513
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,920
Or non-copyright version of their own?

514
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,280
It's not owned by a multinational media monopoly.

515
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,200
Hip hop!

516
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,480
I prefer the sovereign nation monopoly, thank you very much.

517
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,840
Ah...

518
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,920
Yes, dear friends.

519
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,780
Well, that was our first, uh...

520
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:54,900
Playing on Hour of Slack of a group or a show or something called Thorazine Europe.

521
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,380
I think it's Thorazine Uren Podcrust.

522
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,340
And, uh, it is a podcast.

523
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:07,720
And you can, I think, look for their Facebook page, if you can remember the name.

524
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,040
Thorazine Uren Podcrust.

525
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:19,360
And, uh, the people I think we heard on the mic that night, Thursday night at X Day, were...

526
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,520
Reverend Fid Chooly.

527
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,880
Reverend Anna Moll.

528
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,000
Dr. Shoggoth

529
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,400
and Reverend Fox

530
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,740
I think was in there and Reverend Cosmack

531
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,380
although he was mostly on

532
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:32,820
keyboards

533
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,900
that was the first ten minutes

534
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,640
of about two hours

535
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,400
was there no Reverend Apostasy

536
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:40,960
Fnord?

537
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,200
you can't hear her I don't think she might have been there

538
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,820
but now we have

539
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,000
Lonesome Cowboy Day

540
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,500
yeah yeah yeah

541
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:49,800
again

542
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,300
and the music in the background

543
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,660
Princess We is

544
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,080
again cyber chump

545
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,380
from the folks who brought us

546
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,840
exposed foreheads

547
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,180
oh

548
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,340
you mean they showed their

549
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,400
exposed foreheads and that's what's

550
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,180
created the mythology?

551
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,020
well they lived up to their name I think

552
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,560
their foreheads were showing

553
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,140
almost everybody's

554
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,360
all of their foreheads were showing

555
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,240
did they

556
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,800
so they did the skin job

557
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,940
they removed the frontal

558
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,500
the frontal lobes as well?

559
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,860
I don't know

560
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,540
all you could see was the forehead

561
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,540
you couldn't see what was behind it

562
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,780
just the forehead

563
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,860
there's subgeniuses

564
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,380
I think so there's probably

565
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,140
not much

566
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,280
they seem very subgenius to me

567
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,660
yeah but smart that's what I don't get

568
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,060
exposed foreheads seem like a smart band

569
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,460
you have that occasionally with subgeniuses

570
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,860
we're not supposed to

571
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,660
yeah it's rare it is rare

572
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,220
well

573
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,960
we're supposed to kick them out if they show too much smarts

574
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,000
then they're like geniuses

575
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,980
yeah

576
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,000
now you said

577
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,100
we don't luckily none of us have to worry about that I don't think

578
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,920
you said you told me that Dr. Howell

579
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,220
qualified as a subgenius

580
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,720
because he was a genius

581
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,680
because he was other than

582
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,040
genius

583
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,420
well that's what he says

584
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,200
he's beyond genius

585
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,240
that's what he says but I think that's dumb

586
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,780
which proves he is a subgenius

587
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,240
that's true

588
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,040
I gotta turn Dave up

589
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,220
Dave sounds cool

590
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:19,440
he's quiet

591
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,460
I'm not quiet I'm astute

592
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,740
I'm rhythmical

593
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,640
I'm kind of like arhythmical tonight

594
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,260
in some ways I went to my drum circle

595
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,880
and then I went to a drum trapezoid

596
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,560
which was even more fun

597
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,640
because we got to play with Gorilla Muffs

598
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,040
and Secret Airplanes

599
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,140
and sometimes well

600
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:44,460
the major members of the group became quiet at once

601
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,220
and dismembered themselves

602
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,960
it was sad

603
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,840
it was happy

604
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,540
it was joyful

605
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,780
it was realistic

606
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,720
yeah

607
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,380
yeah

608
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,200
a drum trapezoid

609
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,920
yeah

610
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,200
a drum trapezoid

611
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,080
only Dave would go to a drum trapezoid

612
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,720
well he goes to

613
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,240
we don't get invited to the parties that Dave gets invited to

614
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:03,940
well that's true

615
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,680
well you go to plenty of drum circles

616
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,840
and you go to some drum squares

617
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,920
I've heard in your very existence

618
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,220
Princess Lee goes to drum circles

619
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,920
I only go to jerk circles

620
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,280
jerk circles?

621
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,680
jerk circles

622
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:18,800
oh

623
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,400
I'm sorry

624
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,420
I know what one of those are is

625
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,040
did you win the Oreo?

626
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,880
what I don't know some of the secret passwords

627
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,800
and some of the signatures is that I

628
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,380
probably did

629
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,520
then you probably did win the Oreo

630
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,400
if you don't know about the Oreo

631
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,060
but let's not go there any further

632
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,420
okay

633
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,540
sure that's fine with me

634
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,480
I just assume not

635
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,880
because once again

636
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,440
your parlance is exploding my salubrious regurgitation

637
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,440
and I can't understand you

638
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,540
well

639
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,600
I don't know what that is

640
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,220
I don't know what that is

641
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,420
I do know what it is

642
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,380
and I wasn't gonna think about it

643
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,900
you just made me think about it again

644
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,660
I don't know what salubrious regurgitation

645
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,560
I mean I know regurgitation but salubrious

646
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,860
let me get out my phone

647
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,920
I'm gonna call the funk and wagnell

648
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,220
salubrious

649
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,720
hey watch your language

650
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,160
what is what's the difference

651
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,380
this isn't Rowan and Martin's laugh in

652
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,460
I'm sorry Dave

653
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,240
we're walking all over each other

654
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,060
and leaving footprints on our ears

655
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,280
what were you saying

656
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,940
I just wondered if there was a difference

657
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,660
between salubrious and legubrious

658
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,820
I know legubrious is kinda like many subgeniuses

659
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,840
they have a mouthful of it at all times

660
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,660
it won't shut the hell up

661
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,200
and I thought salubrious was similar

662
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,020
but I thought a person who was salubrious

663
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,200
was kind of witty at the same time

664
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,300
they're health giving and healthy

665
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,820
if they're salubrious

666
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,140
oh well see I had that all wrong

667
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,760
what an idiot

668
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,760
we prefer the term subgenius Dave

669
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,640
right

670
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,460
let's not use slurs

671
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,980
and it's to prove that you're a moron

672
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:13,320
we prefer to be called subgeniuses Dave

673
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,520
rather than morons

674
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,580
or idiots or all those other knuckleheads

675
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,040
you know clowns

676
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,640
clowns have been in the news lately

677
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,380
yeah I guess Donald Trump is gonna build an actual wall

678
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,460
along I don't know how many thousand miles of the southern border

679
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,820
over ten feet high and expect it to cost nary a penny

680
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,620
which the Soviets and the Dingleberries will provide

681
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,800
that wasn't a clown I was talking about

682
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,560
you know we managed to go all last show without mentioning him

683
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,080
we never mentioned him

684
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,600
the whole show last week

685
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,900
that was good but I've just heard so much stuff lately

686
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,320
like even today just

687
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,720
and I wasn't gonna talk about it but

688
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,280
I couldn't believe what people were saying

689
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,660
they didn't understand that building the Great Wall of China

690
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,440
took the Chinese a long time

691
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,720
of course you know

692
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,800
and then the Mexicans just burrowed under it

693
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,280
like moles

694
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,780
yeah I know

695
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,700
they're so good at that

696
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,520
that's what I read in the comments section

697
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,120
but yeah

698
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:27,040
there already is a lot of fence

699
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,020
but let's forget that

700
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,660
there's creepy clowns creeping in the woods these days

701
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,120
or there's a new urban legend

702
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,340
that everybody has to get in on

703
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,940
because I know this family

704
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,860
and they were driving down the road

705
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,860
and they saw this weird clown come out of the woods at night

706
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:53,300
and then they stopped and they drove back and it was gone

707
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,340
and there was a clown luring children

708
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,860
all the kids have suddenly started reporting

709
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,940
that there are these evil clowns trying to lure them into the woods

710
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,020
they see a news report and the next thing you know

711
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,780
they see a clown too

712
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,380
it's almost like the Salem witch hunt children you know

713
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,800
they're not suggestive or anything are they?

714
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,580
well what it is it's clown hunt

715
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,120
back in the old days it was the Salem witch trials

716
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,440
just a bunch of kids decided they didn't like this one old lady

717
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,420
so they all said she was a witch

718
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,380
and that's what everybody wanted to believe

719
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,720
you know they said that she deleted her emails

720
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,180
and didn't know how to do anything

721
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,940
and she was a witch and she was demented

722
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,500
and had Alzheimer's

723
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,840
but yet was fiendishly clever

724
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,540
and had brainwashed these children

725
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:45,880
and so every old lady that people didn't like

726
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,600
got hung or tortured to death or something

727
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,720
now that was in Salem

728
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,280
now what they're going to do is

729
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,700
it's going to be a clown hunt

730
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,680
clown hunt yeah burning clowns at the stake

731
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,920
and the thing is probably

732
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:05,040
one or two of these sightings might be real

733
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,960
but once one person sees a Bigfoot

734
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,000
it's like the hundredth Bigfoot theory

735
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,580
suddenly everybody's seeing Bigfoots everywhere

736
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,840
as soon as it makes the news

737
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,980
yeah like pretty soon everybody's just

738
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,100
they're just making up their own clown events

739
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,160
and it just becomes a news media item

740
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,560
and somebody has to investigate it

741
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,840
and they find out that's all it is

742
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,580
right it turns out that you look into the

743
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:35,380
into the story behind the clown accusations

744
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,200
you'll find out that they just

745
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,000
literally have been making it all up

746
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,520
for the last thirty years

747
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,080
or five years

748
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,040
how but then you look into another clown

749
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,140
you'd look to look at what another clown did

750
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,720
and it turns out well yeah everything they say

751
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,540
about that clown actually is pretty obviously true

752
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,380
here's the videotapes of that clown

753
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,060
doing that crazy not very funny thing

754
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,720
with that banana peel and that donkey

755
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,260
well how far do these enclounters go back

756
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,920
well they actually go back thousands and thousands of years

757
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,520
because people have always seen them

758
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:15,220
since the days of the ancient beyond the days of the ancient

759
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,100
the ancient great clowns would appear from the woods

760
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,060
but on Facebook and internet

761
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:24,100
now how many days has it been since the first enclounter

762
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,300
oh I think only like a week or so

763
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,460
let's see I'm looking at a news story right now

764
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:35,320
have these people never heard of insane clown posse

765
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,020
banned

766
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,940
yeah but right

767
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,500
maybe that's it

768
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,220
what is this

769
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:40,680
right

770
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,740
has no one ever seen that movie let's visit the world of the future

771
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,280
has nobody ever seen all those underground comic books

772
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,860
with the evil evil clowns

773
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,460
how about the pathetic clowns in fireside theaters

774
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,900
where I think we're all bozos on this bus

775
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,960
they were pathetic but in a kind of a creepy sinister way

776
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,360
go ahead squeeze the wheeze it doesn't hurt me

777
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,960
that's just sick

778
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,300
it does hurt them and they like it

779
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,200
it's real sick

780
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,280
clowns clowns clowns

781
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,820
what's the there's a term for the fear of clowns

782
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,520
clownophobia but yeah

783
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,900
no it's called co

784
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:28,880
coulrophobia c-o-u-l-r-o phobia

785
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,300
coulrophobia hard to pronounce

786
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,820
the show ares of the zuni people

787
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,960
and the pueblo indians and stuff

788
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,940
clowns are clowns are everywhere

789
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,500
and they've always been a kind of a

790
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,440
half happy half not so happy thing

791
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:47,980
the lakota and the comanche both had a clown

792
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,440
it's like if you were having a lot of psychological problems

793
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,860
you might become what they called a hayoka

794
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:00,540
or in the movie little big man they called him a contrary

795
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,980
in that movie it was rather simplified

796
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,580
what's his name little bear would wash with dirt and

797
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,560
you know sleep on nails and stuff like that

798
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,880
but in real life a hayoka is a subgenius

799
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:25,100
someone who has felt too much pressure to be normal

800
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,520
and rebels snaps goes the other way

801
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,380
starts putting on clown makeup and lurking in the woods

802
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,220
ask david apocalypse

803
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,120
he posted

804
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,100
david apocalypse is a professional clown on drugs

805
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,120
and he posted a thing that what was it

806
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,380
they have this slur for normal non-clown people

807
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,600
maybe i'll splice it in later

808
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:04,440
plainface that was the pejorative name that david apocalypse used on facebook

809
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,840
in the line

810
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,360
i'm coming after you plainface

811
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,800
yeah clowns really look down on

812
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,760
striaties or whatever

813
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,740
i interviewed a clown in one of my erstwhile jobs

814
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:25,080
as the circus rolled into town with its many elephants and tubas flashing

815
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,000
and its parade mongers driving by

816
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,940
and he said it was in his blood somehow

817
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,400
he said you know his pancreas had erupted

818
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,680
and gave him five different shades of yellow to contend with

819
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:41,060
he said as you woke each morning he said i've got this in my blood

820
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:45,460
i guess what he meant was everybody came from a clown family

821
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,760
which is common in circuses

822
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,940
some of these people go back to twenty generations in the old country

823
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,940
but they don't tell you what the old country is

824
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:55,960
damn

825
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,740
the old planet we call it

826
00:43:59,300 --> 00:43:59,820
yeah

827
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,720
yeah he's from the old planet

828
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,620
you know kind of old fashioned that way

829
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,040
one of them earthies

830
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,120
earthy

831
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,840
see that would be like

832
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,020
christobal cologne

833
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,540
or one of those other characters from history

834
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,380
he thinks he finds a new world

835
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:21,300
instead he finds a much older world and destroys it

836
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,760
of course that's too political i should forget that

837
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,660
hey i found a warning about clowns here

838
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,020
this isn't part of the clown article

839
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,180
this is a commenter by the name of inwad

840
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,480
who said

841
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,460
i don't know about all this clown stuff

842
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:43,660
but two things make this something to take attention to

843
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,520
one children have impressionable minds

844
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,040
and are closer to the veiled world than us adults

845
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,660
and so when kids say they're seeing things

846
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,900
it is imperative that we take heed

847
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,360
okay

848
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,300
number two

849
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,940
number two the other thing that strikes me about this

850
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,000
there is zero physical evidence

851
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,580
which proves it

852
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,560
as they say a human would leave something

853
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,580
a tire track

854
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,820
a follicle of hair

855
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,720
a piece of fabric

856
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,100
footprints

857
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,620
evidence of rations eaten

858
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,060
or of waste

859
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,380
spelled like the middle of your body

860
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,940
something would have shown up by now

861
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,960
so the fact that there's no physical proof means it must be real

862
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,100
and the fact that kids saw it means it must be real

863
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,480
those are the two things that you can always depend on

864
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,760
kids never make anything up

865
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,460
and if there's no proof

866
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,980
that's the proof

867
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,660
of the supernatural

868
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,920
it is said that the veil between our world and the physical

869
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,980
and the veil that separates us from the unseen

870
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,060
is being blurred

871
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,840
or that a portal is opening

872
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,820
and giving us

873
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,000
giving rise to the pick up in sightings

874
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,820
and sightings of pick ups

875
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,540
when's it ever going to happen

876
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,740
when is the smudge on reality

877
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,460
which separates the veil between the two different worlds

878
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,980
going to become totally unreal

879
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,180
smudged and veiled together

880
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,440
where we all see these different things

881
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,560
we haven't seen this for years

882
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,180
I know that's the thing

883
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,540
there was a time when I was a child

884
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,760
when I believed in

885
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,580
a converging

886
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,980
yeah the two worlds

887
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,420
the one that there's proof for

888
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,100
where you stub your toe and it hurts

889
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,920
and the world that there's no proof for

890
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,440
that's the realer world because

891
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,760
it doesn't exist

892
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,640
so that means it's more real

893
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,100
because there's a veil

894
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,000
an invisible veil

895
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,620
between the invisible worlds

896
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,240
creepy

897
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,900
creepy clown

898
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,280
I think they'd not be so squacky

899
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,240
they'd make some real sense

900
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,740
if they had to count their tips at the end of the night

901
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,340
and came up short of $20

902
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,840
they wouldn't be going

903
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,460
the worlds are converging

904
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,020
you see there's a great veil between this hemisphere

905
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,680
and that hemisphere of the brain of the great mind of god

906
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,620
and also

907
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,400
Yeah, shut up, you know.

908
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,280
Yeah, I know about that part.

909
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,280
I mean, the yeah, shut up part?

910
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:09,860
Yeah.

911
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:10,600
Yeah.

912
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,520
I hear that a lot.

913
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,260
Yeah.

914
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,240
But not very well.

915
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,040
Well, is your jaw going to have to be removed?

916
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,180
I hate to sound silly about this, but I don't think it's silly.

917
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:29,160
But, in fact, I'm a little concerned, but that's for another program, a deconditioning unit.

918
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,780
We'll find out.

919
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:37,700
Actually, they're going to take magnetic resonating imagery of my brain, resonance.

920
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,080
Jays.

921
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:47,700
I'm going to get an MRI on Tuesday to find out why the right side of every headphone I put on is broken.

922
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,040
I'm not kidding.

923
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,180
And if you switch the left over to the right, it breaks the left headphone.

924
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,680
But then, miraculously, the one that's on your other ear is working.

925
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:58,940
Yeah.

926
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,340
So we're going to find out.

927
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:09,840
You know, it's sad because at the beginning of this show, I was listening to myself ranting happily at X Day, and I lied.

928
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:13,580
I said, I'm lucky I don't have any disabilities, blah, blah, blah.

929
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:19,460
It's like, well, I keep telling myself that, but I can't hear myself say it very clearly.

930
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,940
I actually do have a pretty serious disability.

931
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,560
I'm having to spend some money to try to get it fixed.

932
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:28,960
You know what I mean?

933
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,600
This is when you're supposed to say, huh?

934
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:32,700
Huh?

935
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:45,320
I think it's because you're still basking in the surreality of where you are, and you're not quite up to the part where you have actual some hearing thing.

936
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:51,840
Well, I've noticed that there's a lot of strange noises going on on the right side of my head as well.

937
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,600
And I thought it was concurrent with Stang's obstinacy.

938
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,560
But it wasn't clear on the issue itself.

939
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:58,940
I don't know.

940
00:48:58,940 --> 00:48:58,940


941
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:04,340
Other than I noticed about three or four days ago, it was kind of strange.

942
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,380
It was making a lot of noises in there.

943
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,480
And I thought, well, I just haven't heard infection.

944
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:20,520
So I began putting oceans and potions and all different kinds of motions into discovering what was wrong and using a Q-tip to extract the lumber that I was shaving up.

945
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,120
And there's something wrong with my right side of my head, too.

946
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,020
Mm-mm-mm.

947
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,760
I am so sorry to hear that.

948
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,380
I know it's serious, but, you know, none of it's serious.

949
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,920
It's all clown stuff.

950
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:33,960
Ha, ha, ha.

951
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,720
So you're losing your hearing.

952
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,500
So the right side of your head is coming off.

953
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,120
Ha, ha, ha.

954
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,220
At least you don't come out of the woods in a clown suit.

955
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,580
Not anymore.

956
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,100
Well, yeah, right.

957
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:53,600
I have actually come out of the woods in a clown suit with a camera pointed at me.

958
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,620
Yeah, I mean, it was—I wasn't trying to lure children.

959
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,740
I was trying to lure—

960
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,000
You were—

961
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,560
movie deals back then.

962
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,780
That's a long story.

963
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:26,200
Interested persons who want to see just how bad it can get, a real serious prediction of what the future will be like, Google, let's visit the world of the future and the words YouTube and revstang.

964
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,380
Revstang being one word.

965
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:34,220
You'll find the black and white movie called Let's Visit the World of the Future.

966
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,160
And it's got a—

967
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:36,760
Which is scary as hell.

968
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,620
It is actually not quite as scary as the news articles I read this morning.

969
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,460
Still pretty scary.

970
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:52,660
Because a lot of the most frightening science fiction and social satire has come completely true.

971
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,240
I'm sure people who saw that movie Idiocracy know what I mean.

972
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:57,220
Yes.

973
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,720
It's been rendered a—

974
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:59,340
A documentary.

975
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,100
An out-of-date documentary.

976
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:03,280
Yes.

977
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:09,360
Well, I've heard the second generation of people now who actually tell me it's because there's electrolytes in there.

978
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,400
You know what I mean?

979
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:17,740
They've actually gone to the point—past the point of where that's, ha-ha-ha, there's electrolytes in there.

980
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:21,080
And they—it's again a new generation that thinks it's serious.

981
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,920
Ay, caramba.

982
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,300
Ay, caramba.

983
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,300
I made them cry.

984
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,020
I pulled my pants down and argued with the wind.

985
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,680
I was just like Sir Francis Drake on the old days when we attacked the Armadas.

986
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:37,820
I'm sorry.

987
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:42,580
I didn't mean to talk about that stuff because that is not pertinent to anything we're talking about.

988
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,260
But I'm intrigued by the clowns.

989
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:45,580
I'm sorry.

990
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,160
I'm totally baffled by—

991
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,820
I'm not.

992
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,260
I am.

993
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:51,580
I'm not.

994
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:58,120
The first one was David Apocalypse hitching a ride after his jalopy broke down.

995
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,700
And after that, it was all copycat stories.

996
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,980
All the way down.

997
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:03,960
That's my theory.

998
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:10,580
Or possibly the fact that Rob Zombie is coming out with an evil clown movie in a week.

999
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,440
Mm-hmm.

1000
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:23,960
And a marketing—guerrilla marketing campaign, maybe, since this movie is about a group of sadistic clowns that torture victims.

1001
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,020
Hmm.

1002
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,020
It's kind of a form of post-death reel, Brian.

1003
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:28,360
Maybe.

1004
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:29,280


1005
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,220
Yeah.

1006
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,220
It's going to help Rob Zombie no matter what.

1007
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,040
Right.

1008
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,360
Scary clowns.

1009
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:35,640
Oh, my.

1010
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,980
Federico Fellini had clown fear.

1011
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,660
He did clownophobia, too?

1012
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,120
Yeah.

1013
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:50,000
He did a whole documentary about clowns and the terror of the clown.

1014
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:56,400
And, you know, the tears of a clown when there's no one.

1015
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:58,840
Around.

1016
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,160
Oh, gee.

1017
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,040
He couldn't help it.

1018
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,540
He had to do that.

1019
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,340
Yes, he did.

1020
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,360
He was compelled.

1021
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,900
The clown compelled him.

1022
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,980
By the great mentors of Tune-Am.

1023
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,240
I learned it from you.

1024
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:13,180
Not me.

1025
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:14,940
Not me.

1026
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,440
Not me.

1027
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,920
Not me.

1028
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:19,900
Hi, folks.

1029
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,260
I'm Cliff Palance from the University of Southern Montuba.

1030
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,680
If you look here into this tiny little...

1031
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,720
Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, ball.

1032
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,300
You know, kind of stuff like that there.

1033
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,680
For you, for you, for you.

1034
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,560
But not for me.

1035
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:45,080
We're still kind of half stuck in the Devo clown world.

1036
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:46,960
They're clowns.

1037
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,480
And not for the clown prince.

1038
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:55,460
Some people I was talking with tonight said they went to the museum

1039
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,100
and he was dressed up like a reference.

1040
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:58,100


1041
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,500
He was a referee and making people play four different musics at one time.

1042
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,360
Who was dressed up like a referee?

1043
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,680
Mark Mothersbaugh was dressed like a referee

1044
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,600
and had a whistle around his throat.

1045
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:10,500
Uh-huh.

1046
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,000
You know, not in a menacing way.

1047
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:15,620
And he would blow the whistle and one keyboard would start something

1048
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,940
and they all were wearing jock suits.

1049
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,760
And then another person had another keyboard wearing a jock suit

1050
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,520
would start and join in.

1051
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,060
And then about the time the song got done

1052
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,900
or started to sound,

1053
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,720
it got a little bit complicated,

1054
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,240
he would blow the whistle and start a new song.

1055
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,560
That's how we used to do doctor bands.

1056
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:42,220
When this song would start to sound good, like a song,

1057
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,540
somebody would get bored and call it quits.

1058
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,200
Yeah.

1059
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,880
That's a good thing, I think.

1060
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,800
I think that's how modern music should develop from now on.

1061
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,700
Just like a bicep.

1062
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,840
When it gets too tired, just...

1063
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,100
Just...

1064
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,300
You know, take a nap.

1065
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,000
Strangle a little squirrel or something.

1066
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,020
I think...

1067
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,520
What were we saying, Princess?

1068
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,760
When it wakes up, it would blossom forth with something interesting and new.

1069
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,320
You know what's weird?

1070
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,480
Sometimes it is interesting and new

1071
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,900
and you're just bored and you don't know

1072
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,280
and you ruin something by...

1073
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,380
So I guess you shouldn't stop the song.

1074
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,340
Well, I think that Mark Mothersbaugh, Reverend Mothersbaugh, actually...

1075
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:26,500
Wait.

1076
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,300
Did he ever send in his...

1077
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,740
I don't think he did.

1078
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:35,700
I think he's as unsaved as those Facebook Bobbies out there that don't ever join the church, really.

1079
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,480
They join Facebook pages, but they don't join the church.

1080
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:39,820
Bob Casale did.

1081
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,540
How about Pee-wee Herman?

1082
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,460
Bob and Lisa...

1083
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,340
The late Bob Casale and his wife.

1084
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,560
Pee-wee said he was going to pay and he never did.

1085
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,100
Never did.

1086
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:54,660
But he put Bob on his title sequence of Pee-wee's Playhouse the whole first year.

1087
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:01,920
Every child in America saw Bob's face on Pee-wee's wall in 1990 or whatever that was.

1088
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,620
So Bob was subliminally planted into their little brains.

1089
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,620
Yeah, that could be part of the...

1090
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:07,480
The original...

1091
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,280
That was in the 80s.

1092
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:08,660
The clown possums.

1093
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:15,540
I mean, the opossumate clowns and some of them are opiate fanatics and some are apostate popes.

1094
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,620
They all live together in the same menagerie.

1095
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,880
The gigantic zoo of avarice creatures.

1096
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,220
Yeah, the zoo.

1097
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,620
The human zoo, the clown zoo.

1098
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,580
The pumice zoo.

1099
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:32,760
And the sublimious zoo.

1100
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,980
Sublime from their artifacts, which we show here below us.

1101
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,540
Look deep into its eye.

1102
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,220
That's scary.

1103
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:53,380
Wouldn't that be nice if all you had to do was stare into one limpid eyeball and learn

1104
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,640
all there is to know about the human world?

1105
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,140
About everything there is to know?

1106
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,340
About everything there is?

1107
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:03,640
Well, I'm sure there's somebody who would believe that that's possible if you put a

1108
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,240
high enough price tag on it.

1109
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,340
Look at Scientology.

1110
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,200
Like a Spockian mind meld?

1111
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:12,460
Right, but they don't believe in it if it's free.

1112
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,100
Right.

1113
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,140
You have to pay mightily.

1114
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:16,300
Free things are bad.

1115
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,700
Pay dearly.

1116
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,920
Remember, in conservative America and Puritan America, free things are things that make

1117
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,900
you feel good or bad.

1118
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:28,040
And you must lift yourself up by your bootstraps even if you have no feet.

1119
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,640
And all that other stuff that we've already discussed.

1120
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,440
I'm disgusted.

1121
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:33,600
Yep.

1122
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,580
Oh, uh, we have to start to go.

1123
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,580
Um, we have to start to go.

1124
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:42,540
We're here to go.

1125
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,600
We have to start to go.

1126
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:45,620
Yeah.

1127
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,560
It sounds like...

1128
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,780
It's the beginning of the end in Reverend Stein's mind.

1129
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,880
Sounds like a bad French movie, you know?

1130
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:53,340
Yeah.

1131
00:57:53,900 --> 00:58:00,520
There was a pretty good description of Church of the Subgenius on a personal level by Reverend

1132
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,600
Fox at the beginning of this show.

1133
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,140
He also did a good one the previous show.

1134
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,280
Actually, he did both of those one Sunday night at X Day.

1135
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:16,320
Oh, by the way, the guitar playing on those rants I should definitely mention was Reverend

1136
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:22,900
Angry Larry, also known from the amino acids, the casket bastards, and Specific.

1137
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:23,920
Specific.

1138
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,000
Specific.

1139
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:46,180
So either to special effects, or it's a small detail that people made up or you put the

1140
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,800
ones you, uh, would just like to look at the cover, which, uh, they didn't like at first.

1141
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,520
Hassled them because the fact that some of the names weren't true, I guess that means

1142
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,740
their name was not necessarily scientific right before the show.

1143
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,780
And if somebody wants to see that, they can.

1144
00:58:54,940 --> 00:59:06,540
Now, there's another show coming in, and I'm going to put on a piece of music to kind of allow that to happen.

1145
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:16,000
Once again, this is our buddy, Reverend Basil, and his band called the Psychoskeletons.

1146
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:19,620
Well, this is an old song called Old Fatty.

1147
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,480
And it's not a song, it's an instrumental.

1148
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,480
Old Fatty?

1149
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:26,620
Old Fatty. I'm going to run Old Fatty now in a minute.

1150
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,500
Dave, thank you for calling in.

1151
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,780
Thanks for playing Old Fatty.

1152
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,760
And we'll play Old Fatty here.

1153
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,020
Thanks for clowning around with us, Dave.

1154
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,000
Okay, see you. See you, clowny.

1155
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,120
Good night.

1156
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:54,740
,

1157
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:13,680
We just spent the night playing about a movie and used the obliqueUSBaaa att

1158
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:13,680


1159
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:13,680


1160
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:13,680


1161
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:13,680


1162
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:13,700
,

1163
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,280
Thank you.

1164
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,980
Thank you.

1165
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,840
Thank you.

1166
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,940
Thank you.

1167
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:16,380
Thank you.

1168
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:44,980
Thank you.
