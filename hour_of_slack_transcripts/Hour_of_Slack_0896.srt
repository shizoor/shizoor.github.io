1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,300
Are you too stupid to see what's going to happen? I know what's coming. Have I got to beat you to make you understand?

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:18,600
It's going to end more horribly than anything in all history. That much I know.

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:25,420
And that the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand.

4
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,500
And that if you plan to get saved, you'd better do it now.

5
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:37,240
In this temple lodge of the Church of the Subgenius of Little Rock, and before we begin this sacred spouting,

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,140
I think that we should all bow our heads and let's all have a minute of noise.

7
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,660
Have we started yet? Oh, damn.

8
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,240
Hey, where's the Puzzling Evidence music? When does it kick in? About four, right?

9
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,420
Is the show on right now?

10
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,440
Well, that is a matter of discussion.

11
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:15,200
Okay, so we're waiting for the call from Brushwood Folklore Center, where the subgeniuses are standing out there.

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,500
If we get the call from Brushwood confirming that the end of the world has happened, that's when we'll have it?

13
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,480
That's when we need to start running west as fast as we can.

14
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,420
And thumbing our noses at the chaos.

15
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,240
When does the over end of the world happen at each place?

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,900
Well, it officially happens at 7 a.m. Central Time, so that would have put it at 6 a.m.

17
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,600
Is that right?

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,060
Let me tell you, we'll be on our way to 5 a.m.

19
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,180
At 5 a.m., we'll be counting down.

20
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,100
5 a.m. is the time.

21
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,500
Of course, that's the time the show is normally drawing to a conclusion,

22
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,180
and you...

23
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,520
Hopefully, we'll be able to work the end of the world in just before the show ends.

24
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,780
Time marches on.

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,120
Just because the world is ending doesn't mean we shouldn't.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,620
Right, just because the world is ending doesn't necessarily mean that the show doesn't have obligations,

27
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,900
as does the show that comes on after this, because it's only the world as we know it that's ending.

28
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,280
The world as we don't know it will continue on for eons, centuries, decades even,

29
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,400
mightily zooming along in a way that we never thought possible.

30
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,600
And bouncing energy off into space.

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,920
Because it will be the future, and we'll enter the thousand-year millennium

32
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,700
into the weakness of the eternal void.

33
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,800
So often spoken of by those people who come to my front door when I don't want them to.

34
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,340
That's great, it starts with a handshake.

35
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,560
Exits UFO's outer space.

36
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,760
J.R. Dobbs is not afraid.

37
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,500
He is the eye of a hurricane.

38
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,480
Watch your money burn.

39
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,980
Thinks are their own needs.

40
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,120
Yet he's every own needs.

41
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,040
Feeding on a purse with great strength.

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,600
End times are close at hand.

43
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,400
Uber woman over.

44
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,680
Man liar in a fire.

45
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,800
Representing all we hate.

46
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,040
With a government for hire and a combat site.

47
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,200
The best is less of genie in a hurry with a con breathing down their neck.

48
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,380
Group by group, normals falsified.

49
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,060
Full fart.

50
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,280
Look at that love playing.

51
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:08,900
Fine.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,300
Then.

53
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,220
Uh oh.

54
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,800
Oh no.

55
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,960
Population they don't know.

56
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,460
Save yourself.

57
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,020
Serve yourself.

58
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,320
Pink serve their own need.

59
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,480
Yeti serve your own need.

60
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,600
Time to plunge your own seed.

61
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
Yeti with a rupture in the rubbered in the right.

62
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:18,960
Right.

63
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,820
You super slack maniac.

64
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,420
Slam.

65
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:20,660
Fight.

66
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,000
Fright.

67
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,220
Light.

68
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,360
The strikes you died with in lack of aieteness here at 12 seulon to hope you claimed them

69
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,380
to be in vain.

70
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,040
Am I right?

71
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,040


72
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,040


73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,520
Who cares if you have a eaten you won't have grace on so as my Cavalier Bob aisphere

74
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,300
on the dance floor?

75
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:42,620
Hold up.

76
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:42,620


77
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,120
Hey that turd.

78
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,000
Say that damn rascal of a-

79
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,020
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,020


81
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,020
I told you that AprÃ¨s Sales after youormone.

82
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,380
Let's see who we kill next.

83
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:02,760
My name is Chaz, and I'm broadcasting you tonight from my little holding cell here.

84
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:11,100
All quarantined, all strapped in my suit, pressure suits all pressured up.

85
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,280
Yeah, it's here.

86
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:23,520
The ship is waiting, hissing away, spewing out its little steam.

87
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,400
Waiting for the moment, the final countdown.

88
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,000
And that's where we're at.

89
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,920
Just hours away from the final hour.

90
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,200
The final minute.

91
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,960
The final second.

92
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,080
And...

93
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,600
X-Day.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,960
Thought it'd never get here.

95
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,660
X-Day.

96
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,380
It's kind of a...

97
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,060
It's kind of late now.

98
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,740
We're there.

99
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,700
There's nothing else to do.

100
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:09,640
Just sit, look out the window, and wait for the light.

101
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,880
X-Day.

102
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,920
X-Day.

103
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,900
X-Day.

104
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,500
X-Day.

105
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,560
X-Day.

106
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,400
X-Day.

107
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,760
X-Day.

108
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,420
X-Day.

109
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,120
X-Day.

110
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,240
X-Day.

111
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,240


112
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,240


113
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,420
X-Day.

114
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:24,420


115
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:24,760
X-Day.

116
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,360
X-Day.

117
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,460
Is your pleasure ship hovering above, waiting for the final hours to pass?

118
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,140
X-Day.

119
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:45,820
Is your alien sex goddess waiting for you somewhere in Eurasia blue?

120
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,840
X-Day.

121
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,080
X-Day.

122
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,540
X-Day.

123
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,660
X-Day.

124
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:52,900
X-Day.

125
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,020
X-Day...

126
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,020


127
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,720
X-Day.

128
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,740
X-Day.

129
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,140
X-Day.

130
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,340
X-Day.

131
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:55,340


132
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,740
Sleepo.

133
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,020
Yeah.

134
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,140
Chaz and I have been planning which reruns we're going to run

135
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,100
since there's only another week of broadcasting left on the planet.

136
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:05,880
Oh, God.

137
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,460
I've done 638 hours of sleep.

138
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,820
Down to a few hours now.

139
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,140
And we're going to start rerunning number one.

140
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,300
I mean, for what radio stations are left.

141
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,040
Right.

142
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,420
And what were you thinking of doing, Chaz?

143
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,840
I don't understand how a lot of this is going to take place.

144
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,880
I don't understand how a lot of this happens.

145
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,980
I just know that it won't fail because of me.

146
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,080
We all are in this together as a team effort.

147
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,300
We're going to make it work.

148
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,460
And I don't know how to make it work.

149
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,220
I don't know how to do most of this mission.

150
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,720
But I do know that I can assure you that my piece of it is going to work.

151
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,420
And it won't fail because of me.

152
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,760
On X-Day, Neeky will return to us all the greatest tapes that we ever recorded.

153
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,600
Praise the Neeky.

154
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
He has been keeping it.

155
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,980
Praise the Neeky.

156
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,440
Oh, God.

157
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,280
That's so good.

158
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,540
Neeky has been keeping all of our lost recordings in a special vault.

159
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,940
You hear that?

160
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,980
Those will all be returned to us on X-Day.

161
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,340
Oh, that's so glorious.

162
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,080
Jayner will get his 8mm films back.

163
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,820
Oh.

164
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,800
You know, your first show will come back.

165
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,200
Actually, I never did lose anything.

166
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,260
Will I get those videos that I erased by accident back?

167
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,940
As long as you saw them.

168
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,980
You mean everything I've ever seen?

169
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,700
You know, that you never got around to looking at?

170
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,280
Uh-huh.

171
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,820
Even if I've only seen it for a fraction of a second.

172
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,500
What about events that I've never taped that never were taped?

173
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,540
There's a thing called the new program.

174
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:36,940
What?

175
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,080
This is too damn confusing.

176
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,180
I'm getting out of here.

177
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,020
Will then be done.

178
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,020
They will have been done.

179
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,040
When you want to do a wonderful new show, that show will materialize in your hand.

180
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,140
Yeah, the new program.

181
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,640
Email the program.

182
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,000
Email the program.

183
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,380
Do I buy it next day?

184
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,500
Pleasure shirts are on their way.

185
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,140
Quit your job.

186
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,580
Keep your stuff.

187
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,840
Black Jared Ops has got your back.

188
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,380
Hail Connie.

189
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:56,940
Hail Bob.

190
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,140
On your knees, self-righteous love.

191
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,740
Give it up.

192
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,320
Give it in.

193
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,420
Find yourself a Yeti kit.

194
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,360
New religion radio.

195
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,140
Hell poke.

196
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,760
Gonna blow.

197
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,940
Pay to find out what you know.

198
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,480
Pass the pipe.

199
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,100
Take a trick.

200
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,300
I'm telling you, this is no joke.

201
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Spirits see you steer clear.

202
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:07,820
A tournament.

203
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,380
A tournament.

204
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,480
A tournament of lies.

205
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,100
Offer me solutions and you offer me alternatives and I decline.

206
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,400
It's the end of the world as we know it.

207
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,220
It's the end of the world as we know it.

208
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,580
It's the end of the world.

209
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:24,580


210
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:24,580


211
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:24,580


212
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:24,980
Offer me solutions and you offer me alternatives and you decline.

213
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,700
All the leaders alive in the other world will be.

214
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:25,700


215
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:25,700


216
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:25,700


217
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,840
The end of the world as we know it.

218
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,620
There's, like, it into the top Garth Dix.

219
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,940
Antique the end of the world, your own bottom Jeter.

220
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,240
The time will be John Doyle, you ain't been here long enough.

221
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,140
Checking out Bob Gix is coming, your Expand Signs planet.

222
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,220
If you're up the drauÃen season is like practicing.

223
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,640
Bob may be in there or standing over.

224
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:47,760
Nicole Jewellyn

225
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:47,760


226
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:47,760


227
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,560
I can begin only onisoft now.

228
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,180
quite from where you are.

229
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,880
Well, the same sort of way

230
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,820
that we had before,

231
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,880
which seems truly

232
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,820
indicative of some

233
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,780
excess activity,

234
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,880
but the means

235
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,540
provided this illusion

236
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,180
that the master

237
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,200
subs deliberately

238
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,900
and intentionally

239
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,660
fed to the only.

240
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,160
What I think is

241
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,960
personally rather interesting

242
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,860
is the way the shadow

243
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,500
moves across the face

244
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,260
of the continent,

245
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,280
and as it moves,

246
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,380
the end of the world

247
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,400
is on one side,

248
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,140
and the world

249
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,440
still exists on the other side.

250
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,100
The falling magma,

251
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,300
the destroyed planet,

252
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,040
with airplanes flying out of it

253
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,860
and people running,

254
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,660
horses, animals galloping.

255
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,520
Those wise...

256
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,940
So does Ivan Stank

257
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,380
think he's the guy

258
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,380
in the cowl,

259
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,980
or is he just Darth Vader?

260
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,260
He thinks he's the guy

261
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,560
in the cowl, yeah.

262
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,680
He's the one that

263
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,600
Darth Vader throws

264
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,780
into the deep hole

265
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,640
and blows up.

266
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,300
Yeah, and he also

267
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,020
plays piano

268
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,820
in Weird Al Yankovic's...

269
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,260
Oh, I'm sorry,

270
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,920
I've got the election music

271
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,380
on here.

272
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:55,920
Oh, yes.

273
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,860
President, uh,

274
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,540
Senor Bush.

275
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,640
One of the big election news

276
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,660
that we did have

277
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,060
which seemed to change

278
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,200
everything since...

279
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,920
It's not funny, sir.

280
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,740
It's not funny.

281
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,780
They stole the election, sir.

282
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,080
Friends and neighbors

283
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,960
of planet Earth,

284
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,840
I come to you

285
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,640
from a long, long ways off.

286
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,520
I come from a planet

287
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,780
that is similar to yours.

288
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,540
Your many fears,

289
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,180
tensions, and frustrations

290
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,580
are no longer ours.

291
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,880
I hate them

292
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,780
with all my heart.

293
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,240
They are in my heart.

294
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,240


295
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,540
I hate them

296
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:23,540


297
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,300
and to be destroyed.

298
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,240
You are not ready,

299
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,800
but we will still save you.

300
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,200
By 1998,

301
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,300
every normal,

302
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,580
mediocritan,

303
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,600
pink boy,

304
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,540
admin,

305
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,660
Trekkie,

306
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,380
and hippie

307
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,340
is gonna be trying

308
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,840
to get on board

309
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,280
with the good ship dogs.

310
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,480
The great ship dogs.

311
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,960
Or they're gonna fry

312
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
along with everybody else.

313
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,740
When those aliens get here.

314
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,120
Of course,

315
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,300
such a prophecy

316
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,460
immediately arises

317
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,180
our cynicism.

318
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,040
Is it possible

319
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,440
that the end of the world

320
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,460
will come in July 1999?

321
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,480
Perhaps.

322
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,880
Or is it just another

323
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,080
of those prognostications

324
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,440
which have haunted man

325
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,140
through the ages?

326
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,720
But the old ones

327
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,800
are coming back.

328
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,140
I'm going to let them through.

329
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,880
So we gotta get ourselves

330
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,760
through from these two stones here.

331
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,700
There.

332
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,200
To those two stones down there.

333
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,520
And we can actually sort of

334
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,100
will ourselves into the saucer

335
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,920
which is hovering in the next dimension.

336
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,260
It's about time.

337
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,560
Yeah, it's not an actual physical thing

338
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,900
of saucers coming out of normal reality.

339
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,920
It's saucers coming out of an alternate reality.

340
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,100
The tools of conquest

341
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,360
do not necessarily come with bombs

342
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,980
and explosions and fallout.

343
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,660
That looks like people demonstrating outside now.

344
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,140
Outside the station.

345
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,480
Demonstrating about the end of the world.

346
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,460
It should not happen.

347
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,640
They're demonstrating about

348
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,500
the end of the world

349
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,900
and whether or not

350
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,760
we've properly recognized it.

351
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,720
And it's not completely correct.

352
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,480
There's those people on one side

353
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,420
that want to make sure

354
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,240
that we have taken full, you know,

355
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,040
regard to the end of the world

356
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,760
and that we have recognized it

357
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,060
as the thing that it is.

358
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,760
And then those people

359
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,720
that protest the end of the world

360
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,640
and refuse to, you know,

361
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,880
participate in it.

362
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,180
And those are the ones that we need to,

363
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,520
you know, somehow or another,

364
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,280
convince that this is

365
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,500
the end of the world.

366
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,740
Remember now, the end of the world

367
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,980
is occurring in three minutes.

368
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,680
And it's just so great that,

369
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,500
I just think it's so great

370
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,240
that it coincides with the birth

371
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,380
of our country.

372
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,540
The anniversary of the birth

373
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,140
of our great, great country.

374
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,220
That country that was founded

375
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,640
by John Philip H. Bush.

376
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,060
And I think it will be great

377
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,940
about the end of the world.

378
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,700
No more mosquitoes.

379
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,560
Back 3,000 years ago,

380
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,380
when our fathers and our forefathers

381
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,200
and our five fathers came forward

382
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,180
and founded this nation

383
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,100
with John Philip Sousa,

384
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,400
one nation under God,

385
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,000
under Vishnu,

386
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,140
under Krishna, under Bob,

387
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,200
primarily under Bob.

388
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,520
But hovering over populated areas.

389
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,060
Those were the ones that could see

390
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,100
the fortunate few,

391
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,220
the free, the proud,

392
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,920
the end.

393
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,100
All of our lives,

394
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,640
we have fought this war.

395
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,520
Tonight, I believe we can end it.

396
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,260
Tonight is not an accident.

397
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,680
There are no accidents.

398
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,260
We have not come here by chance.

399
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
I do not believe in chance.

400
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,840
When I see three objectives,

401
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,680
three captains,

402
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,820
three ships,

403
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,920
I do not see coincidence.

404
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,920
I see providence.

405
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,400
I see purpose.

406
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,300
And now, for more live coverage of X Day,

407
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,800
we move to a field outside of Avebury, England,

408
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,100
where it's 6.30 a.m.

409
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,420
and the European subgenius conclave

410
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,560
is awaiting the saucers.

411
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,240
We are now amid the ancient monoliths

412
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,200
and standing stones of this magically charged

413
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,760
crop circle pocked land.

414
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,820
How much time have we got?

415
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,120
Four minutes.

416
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,080
Let us break bread, my friends.

417
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,600
Let us drink from the scepter.

418
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,480
Let us drink our last beer on earth.

419
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,500
Praise Bob.

420
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
It is good.

421
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,740
Praise Bob.

422
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,660
Praise Bob.

423
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,820
A little rubbery.

424
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,700
It is our last beer on earth.

425
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,140
Slither.

426
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,660
The last holy elixir.

427
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,500
Ah, the keeper of the Otis drinks from the scepter.

428
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,080
This man is not saved.

429
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:52,980
One more.

430
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,680
All the subgenius drinks have been sifted.

431
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,200
He will be the first to die.

432
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,920
He'll be the last to live.

433
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,560
He's giving us a countdown.

434
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,080
And that's worse.

435
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,740
Time, time, time.

436
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,200
What time is it?

437
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:03,920
What time is it?

438
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,720
My clock's wrong.

439
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,340
Two minutes.

440
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,460
Two minutes to go.

441
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,100
Two minutes to lift off.

442
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,340
We know when they're here, damn it.

443
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,300
Two minutes to pay your $30.

444
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,280
There will be no last minute knock-down sale.

445
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,180
Look at these sheep.

446
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,840
They don't even realize they're about to be incinerated in the afterburners of Paul.

447
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,700
Oh mighty goddesses in heaven that sit upon the UFOs, we await thee.

448
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,420
Come to us.

449
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:31,380
And I drink my last drop of holy elixir upon this planet waiting for you.

450
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,620
Drink from your own cup, popey boy.

451
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,640
I believe it is our fate to be here.

452
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,660
It is our destiny.

453
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,740
I believe this night holds.

454
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,840
For each and every one of us.

455
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,440
The very meaning of our lives.

456
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,060
One minute!

457
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,400
This is the last time I gotta get up before seven, right?

458
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,200
Oh yeah, yeah, we'll have to do this.

459
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,060
I'm sure all the drills will have paid off by this time.

460
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,800
We'll be ready.

461
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,520
I've been drilled too damn many times if you ask me.

462
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,120
Oh boy, this is exciting now.

463
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,620
It's gotta be one of these episodes, right?

464
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,160
10, 9, 8, 7, 8, 9, 10.

465
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,160


466
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,160


467
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,840
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

468
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,760
Let's make it time!

469
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,260
We're tired of your phony fireworks.

470
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,500
Barco, you have earned this.

471
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,940
What about, uh, what about this, uh, reputed, uh...

472
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,540
Jesus, Starfleet that was, uh, supposed to have shown up.

473
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,980
As you see, they have just left the hangar deck at Lunar Central and have cleared the airlocks into the colony.

474
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,140
The crowd of scientists and technicians are going wild.

475
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,320
What a space ovation.

476
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,200
The sheep know something's up!

477
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,180
$30 for eternal salvation!

478
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,140
The sheep are starting to run!

479
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,000
Look, the sheep are shedding their wool.

480
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,140
That's not shedding, it's burning!

481
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,720
They're burning off!

482
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,600
The sheep are starting to walk away.

483
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,580
I think they sense...

484
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,100
One minute!

485
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,760
The anal probe is approaching.

486
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,600
One minute, you say?

487
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,220
One minute.

488
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,060
Do you feel it?

489
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,720
I feel it!

490
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,340
Can you feel it in your bowels?

491
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,200
I feel it!

492
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,860
Can you feel it in your fingertips?

493
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,120
Ah, look at...

494
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,560
Look into the heavens, there is what...

495
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:32,900
There...

496
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,660
No, that's a crow.

497
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,620
Sorry.

498
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,780
I forgot my towel.

499
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,720
40 seconds!

500
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,020
Here's our opening!

501
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,580
Papa Cho, we've gotta launch the head or they won't come!

502
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,080
Bring the head forth.

503
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,440
20 seconds!

504
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,940
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a...

505
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,140
An important moment.

506
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,380
15 seconds!

507
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,300
We must launch the head at the actual second.

508
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,300
Start the countdown!

509
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,120
10...

510
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,440
9...

511
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,140
8...

512
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,440
7...

513
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,220
6...

514
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:58,440
5...

515
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,100
4...

516
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,440
3...

517
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:01,940
2...

518
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,760
1...

519
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,300
RAISE BALLS!

520
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,780
RAISE BALLS!

521
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,380
RAISE BALLS!

522
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:11,900
RAISE BALLS!

523
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,380
RAISE BALLS!

524
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:13,440
RAISE BALLS!

525
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,500
RAISE BALLS!

526
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:13,720
RAISE BALLS!

527
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:13,720


528
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,060
RAISE BALLS!

529
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,420
RAISE BALLS!

530
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:14,980
RAISE BALLS!

531
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:14,980


532
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:14,980


533
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:14,980


534
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,520
We're still here!

535
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,460
Something must have gone wrong.

536
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,000
Hold on, hold on!

537
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,260
Oh!

538
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,000
Hold on...

539
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,460
I was ten seconds fast.

540
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,660
10...

541
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,120
WE CAN WIN IT!

542
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,560
WE GOT THIS!

543
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:26,900
7...

544
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,640
6...

545
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,300
1...

546
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,860
4...

547
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,840
3...

548
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,160
NO!

549
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,760
2...

550
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,860
1...

551
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,100
NO!

552
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,000
Ahhhhhhhhh!

553
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,460
Ahhhhh!

554
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,480
Ahhhhh!

555
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,300
Look the sheep are running even faster!

556
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,420
We are now in celebration of the great occasion of the second...

557
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:53,920
On this occasion we have planned a lunar party. We hope all young people throughout the solar system will join us in celebration of this great day in outer space.

558
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,680
Bob?

559
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,640
I can't help thinking, what if you're wrong? What if all this, the prophecy, everything is bullshit?

560
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:14,880
Then tomorrow we may all be dead. But how would that be different from any other day?

561
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,180
That's utter nonsense!

562
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,340
The future is always nonsense, until it becomes the past.

563
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,960
Because some things never change, and some things do.

564
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:34,660
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!

565
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,580
No!

566
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,600
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.

567
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,080
They destroyed the world.

568
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,180
Already hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain,

569
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,620
and civil defense authorities state that the situation is much the same as before.

570
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,340
The entire country is in chaos.

571
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,160
Martial law is now nationwide.

572
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,420
Our fellow countrymen are dying.

573
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:19,640
The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble under the dread assault of that horror long feared.

574
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,260
Bob?

575
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,300
Colorado Channel, this is a class one emergency.

576
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,320
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.

577
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,840
Stay in your homes. Stay in your homes.

578
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,560
I got exactly what I wanted!

579
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,500
Hello world!

580
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,300
Hello world!

581
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,640
Chaz here.

582
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,880
ESO Radio, broadcasting live from the pleasure ships.

583
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,920
Oh yeah!

584
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,280
Where you gonna go?

585
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,160
Where you gonna go?

586
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,080
When the sex goddesses come for you.

587
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,440
Gonna go to the place that's the best.

588
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,680
When I lay me down to die.

589
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,320
Going up to the spirit in the sky.

590
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,340
Bob?

591
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,540
Going up to the spirit in the sky.

592
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,380
It's where I'm gonna go when I die.

593
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,300
When I die and lay me to rest.

594
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,420
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best.

595
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,740
And it's so beautiful from out here.

596
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,900
It's so pretty, the earth.

597
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,120
It's just that little blue and white, little marble hanging there.

598
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,440
Gosh!

599
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,020
That's where it all began.

600
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,520
We'll see ya.

601
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,560
Goodbye.

602
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,860
It's so very lonely.

603
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,320
Your two thousand light years to come.

604
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,380
Failure is not an option.

605
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,620
Check orange light sequence two.

606
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,620
Yeah, well, at least out here in space where we don't talk about nothing, there's lots of continuity.

607
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,300
Check emergency override switch.

608
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,820
It was a scary week, but we feel better now.

609
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,820
Okay, we've got everything in perspective.

610
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,160
It's all okay now.

611
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,980
It's not us.

612
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,680
I brought the doctors with me to talk about that very show.

613
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,600
I've still got those orange lights inside my helmet.

614
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,040
Except that one of them's just turned green.

615
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
And I'm still blind.

616
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,480
But don't worry, little subgeniuses.

617
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,620
This war that we're trying to start on the air right now,

618
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,800
is it for you?

619
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,520
How long you been on board Bungo, John?

620
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,180
I mean Jane.

621
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,000
About fifteen minutes now.

622
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,360
Oh, jeez, I thought it was fifteen years.

623
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,040
I've been on for fifteen thousand years.

624
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,840
Well, there's no real time, is there?

625
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,540
No, it's whatever time you want to take or have or be on.

626
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,400
Oh, my God, it just never ends.

627
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,300
It's like a loop.

628
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,820
It's time control finally, as Bob promised.

629
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,600
Now that I'm on the escape mode, I can't do anything.

630
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,040
I'm on the vessels of the sex goddesses, having spent my thirty dollars on Bob.

631
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,180
Now I have time control.

632
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:25,040
Yeah, friends, you can wrap the movie a strip of infinity around your little finger like a ring and wear it when you go to dances or parties or perhaps even bobs.

633
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,180
It's the end of the world.

634
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,860
It's the end of the world.

635
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,460
It's the end of the world.

636
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,140
It's the end of the world.

637
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,300
Hello, am I on the air?

638
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,340
Yes, you are.

639
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,100
Oh, good, good, good.

640
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:50,860
Um.

641
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,880
Are you enjoying X Day?

642
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,880
Yes, it's right here.

643
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,480
It looks like a beautiful one.

644
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,340
We're sorry, your call did not go through.

645
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,500
Oh, no.

646
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,620
Oh, a conspiracy is jamming these calls.

647
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,520
We're sorry, your call did not go through.

648
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,440
Will you please hang up and try your call again?

649
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,660
This is a recording.

650
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,600
Sir, X Day is...

651
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,640
We're sorry, your call did not go through.

652
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,300
Sir, X Day is jamming.

653
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,780
Will you please hang up and try your call again?

654
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,460
Can I please talk to my family?

655
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:14,780
This is a recording.

656
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,340
X Day, can I...

657
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,600
All these young kids on here.

658
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,340
Can I please talk to my family?

659
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,560
It's X Day.

660
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,420
All right, all right, all right.

661
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:23,960
Hang that phone up.

662
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,980
I'm back, I'm back.

663
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,180
Oh, hi.

664
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:27,980
Hi.

665
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,280
It's great here at X Day.

666
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,500
Um, we, the saucers, of course, didn't come again.

667
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,260
Those went away.

668
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,420
We had to go back.

669
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:37,420


670
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:37,420


671
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:37,420


672
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:37,420


673
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:37,420


674
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,320
We were up early.

675
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,480
We're gonna have bacon and eggs in a little while.

676
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,500
Oh, the eggs were bacon and eggs.

677
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,080
Reverend X Day sings us some patriotic songs.

678
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,240
Well, I guess you'll have to soldier me.

679
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,880
And Princess Lee is making cantaloupe sundaes.

680
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,500
And, well, it's just a great time here.

681
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,620
We're just having a wonderful, wonderful time.

682
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,700
And, uh, did anybody...

683
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,360
Were there any survivors at the end of the world?

684
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,080
Of course, yeah, we had, uh...

685
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,420
Some of them, yeah.

686
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:07,420


687
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:07,420


688
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:07,420


689
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:07,420


690
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:07,420


691
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:07,420


692
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:07,420


693
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:07,420


694
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:07,420


695
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:07,420


696
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:07,920
I'm always...

697
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,880
We had a lot of survivors.

698
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,900
This is the meaning of...

699
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,340
And practically everybody survived this time.

700
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:21,220
There were some deaths from the previous couple of nights, uh, activities, but that's to be,

701
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,920
you know, to be, uh, anticipated.

702
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,880
Did you say that some people did not survive the party?

703
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,280
Uh, yes, that's right.

704
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,900
Uh, some people were...

705
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,680
The party in my pants.

706
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,340
Um, unfortunately...

707
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,600
Yes, like, look at Hal.

708
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,640
He's certainly in the spirit of X Day over there.

709
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:35,860
Yeah.

710
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,400
Look, he's taking on the party.

711
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,400


712
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,400


713
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,400


714
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,400


715
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,400


716
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,400


717
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,400


718
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,420
He's taking on the party in my pants.

719
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,620
I'm a UFO and I can't...

720
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:40,620


721
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,660
Oh.

722
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:41,980
Oh.

723
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,960
What's he doing?

724
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,640
Well, who's perfect?

725
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,960
It's only human, isn't it?

726
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,840
Although very unusual to see the teeth green as well as the...

727
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,580
Uh, so, uh, what can I tell you?

728
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,200
Anything else about, uh, the report here from X Day?

729
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,180
How about the emanations of Bob?

730
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,000
As they appear?

731
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,480
And Bob, Bob, uh, Bob was here and, uh...

732
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,120
I thought it was him.

733
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,660
...each of the, each of the worshippers went through and kept his behind.

734
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,380
Which is the...

735
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:07,380


736
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:07,380


737
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:07,380


738
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:07,380


739
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:07,380


740
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,120
I'm not sure what the ritualistic task that we must do.

741
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,300
We all kissed the brown eye of Bob.

742
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,360
Not out in the here and around.

743
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,880
It's crude, uh, superstitious parody.

744
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,280
It is, uh, parody.

745
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,460
Actual sub-key of subgenius religion.

746
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,500
Okay, well, they're calling us for breakfast, so I'm gonna be, uh, heading out now and I'll

747
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:27,520
be...

748
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,580
Well, thank your lucky stars that you can draw your breath on this X Day and, uh, may

749
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,700
the benediction of Bob follow you into the, uh, outhouse.

750
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,360
Okay.

751
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,420
Okay, thank you, too.

752
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,460
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye.

753
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,160
A bear went a great loyal subgenius in the great America.

754
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,960
No, it was wrong again!

755
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,420
Hold on!

756
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,800
Wait a minute!

757
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,020
Five!

758
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,820
Four!

759
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,700
Three!

760
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,200
Three!

761
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,680
Two!

762
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:53,940
One!

763
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,100
Oh, wait a minute!

764
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,840
We must have done something wrong.

765
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,160
We've been abandoned in our moment of triumph!

766
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,340
Maybe this is a good time to be back.

767
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,340


768
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,340


769
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,340


770
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,340


771
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,340


772
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,340


773
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,880
Maybe all of our watches are wrong and it still hasn't happened yet.

774
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,000
Maybe we're on the sources.

775
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,680
I'm keeping hope.

776
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,140
It's the last time we buy those cheap Christmas burgers.

777
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:14,720
Hey, maybe we are on the sources.

778
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:14,720


779
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,800
This just isn't fair!

780
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,520
There's still...

781
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,840
There's still thirty seconds to go on this one.

782
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,340
Come back, Bob!

783
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,220
But thirty seconds!

784
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,100
There's still thirty seconds to go on this book.

785
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,700
Run, Bob and Joe!

786
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,580
Okay, this time we're gonna get it right.

787
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,680
We have to get it right.

788
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,520
Fifteen!

789
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,960
Unless he was causing it to goof up.

790
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,100
Five!

791
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,080
Four!

792
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,400
Three!

793
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,500
Two!

794
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,520
One!

795
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,500
There's something wrong here.

796
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,900
There is...

797
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,340
I don't think...

798
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:37,340


799
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:37,340


800
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,420
Are you sure about the day?

801
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,320
Is this the...

802
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,940
The fifth or...

803
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,020
Well it's a fifth.

804
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,700
I don't see anything up there.

805
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,180
I know what's wrong!

806
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,560
We've got to drink more Holy Elixir!

807
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,260
More elixir!

808
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:48,900
More elixir!

809
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,400
More elixir!

810
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,020
More elixir!

811
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,160
More elixir!

812
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,460
I don't understand it.

813
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,440
Everything was done as it was supposed to be done.

814
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,860
The prophecy tells us...

815
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,740
It was a lie, Morpheus.

816
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,880
The prophecy was a lie.

817
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,900
It was all another system with control.

818
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,880
I don't believe that.

819
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,820
But you said it yourself.

820
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,460
How can the prophecy be true if the war isn't over?

821
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,060
I'm sorry.

822
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,860
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

823
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,040
I swear to you it's the truth.

824
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,860
What are we gonna do?

825
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,600
I don't know.

826
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,640
Laugh.

827
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,580
I don't laugh.

828
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,600
Why don't you?

829
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,240
You should.

830
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:43,960
Yeah.

831
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,120
I'm gonna try to do it.

832
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:46,600
Yeah.

833
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,480
I have a better idea.

834
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,180
Yeah.

835
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,320
You talk too much.

836
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,760
What's so funny, Tuts?

837
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,460
Are you still laughing at that stinking joke?

838
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,380
Me?

839
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,420
No.

840
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,120
No.

841
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,620
Yes.

842
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,660
No.

843
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,100
I hate to change the subject, but, you know,

844
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,800
if this is the fifth time that the X's were supposed to be here

845
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,260
and have not actually arrived,

846
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,980
and since it is now 4-0-1,

847
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,320
we have not received the...

848
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,200
That is a problem that I didn't want to bring up,

849
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,580
but now it's here.

850
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,740
It's only because Bob has been able to, once again,

851
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,660
avert the invasion before they even got here.

852
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,900
Unless everybody's getting everything wrong.

853
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,020
The scales of the luck plane have, therefore,

854
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,520
been shifted in our direction one more time.

855
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,840
We have lucked out again, as it were.

856
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,520
So to speak.

857
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,720
Everyone should be alarmed and prepare for imminent disaster.

858
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:39,760
Wait, wait, wait.

859
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,780
We're not supposed to be relaxed and happy?

860
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:49,100
No, because we haven't yet crossed over that mysterious terminus.

861
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
That barrier.

862
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,360
Oh, there it is.

863
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,080
There's the barrier.

864
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,060
Oh, good lord.

865
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,700
What a sight, that.

866
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,500
It's only 16 inches high.

867
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,540
Look, it's just a model.

868
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:58,960
Wow.

869
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,440
Yeah, okay.

870
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,580
Not as bad as I thought.

871
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,020
So, there's the barrier.

872
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,020


873
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,020


874
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:07,880
And you're saying that X-MOMENT 705 has been achieved?

875
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,840
Yeah, and marching bands around the world break out their instruments.

876
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,680
Sharing that, once again, we have been spared.

877
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,760
Of course, some of us that have been praying for the day for years and years

878
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,660
have been waiting for the sex goddesses from the exorcist dimension.

879
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,920
Okay, I don't know any sex saucers over there.

880
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,000
I don't see the end of the world.

881
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,160
I'm looking to the east.

882
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,280
We're hiking up the side of Mount Shasta here.

883
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,400
It looks sort of like...

884
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,920
I can see off into the distance.

885
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,360
There's some kind of light off there on the horizon.

886
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,400
It's like a...

887
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,720
It could be dawn, though.

888
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,500
It could be an explosion.

889
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,720
It could be dawn.

890
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,600
The dogs down there?

891
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,200
You see them?

892
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,600
Well, the shock waves will take a little while to get to us, I guess.

893
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,720
Yes, uh...

894
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,840
Give me slack, you frickin' lunatic.

895
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:01,900


896
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:01,900


897
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:01,900


898
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:01,900


899
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:01,900


900
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:01,900


901
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:01,900


902
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:01,900


903
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:03,980
Fucker!

904
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,420
I'm out of frickin' slack!

905
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,480
Oh, the sad state of affairs this church has befallen, brothers and sisters.

906
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:16,260
Where are we going when even the faithful can come to the center of the spiritual universe,

907
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,100
stand amongst these sacred stones, and still be cast out from Bob's sacred midst?

908
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,420
We're being tested.

909
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:29,020
It's not only an insult that the exorcists did not come, but they shit on us!

910
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,500
Yeah.

911
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,420
But I heard Pope Black this morning...

912
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:31,760
They shit on us!

913
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,820
...when I heard him on that show on the BBC telling him,

914
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,280
Oh, are we a suicide cult?

915
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,180
That's what they asked him.

916
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,160
Are we a suicide cult?

917
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,880
I can only think of only one thing.

918
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:47,700
The only people who commit suicide in this cult are those who don't join this cult!

919
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,120
Yeah!

920
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:48,940
Hallelujah!

921
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:49,680
Hallelujah!

922
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,100
Praise God!

923
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,280
For $30, they could have avoided it all.

924
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,700
Just one person, perhaps it was just one person who didn't join, that stopped us from reaching

925
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,960
our sacred sales goals.

926
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,900
You know, that's the secret of all good salesmen.

927
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,960
You gotta have gold!

928
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,440
Yes!

929
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,520
Gold is here!

930
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:04,900
There are two!

931
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,360
It was not our money!

932
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,280
It was these two!

933
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,980
They drove us, drove the saucers away!

934
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,100
The subgenius coffers are short by $60!

935
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:18,580
Anyone who's seen Glen Gary, Glen Ross knows the sales business is a cutthroat business.

936
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,000
$60 short!

937
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,060
And we're doomed for nothing here.

938
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,080
That's $40 here.

939
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:27,560
The Exorcist saucers ran out of gas and needed $60 to fill up the tank of YouTube.

940
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:27,960
$60 worth of blame!

941
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,300
They're somewhere on Mars right now.

942
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,360
They're circling Mars right now going,

943
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,400
Can't find a filling station.

944
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,660
And yet I wonder how many other subgeniuses are listening to this very moment, thinking

945
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:44,180
in themselves, oh yeah, I'm a subgenius, oh yeah, I buy the book, I watch the Arise video,

946
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,940
but I never bought my $30 love offering!

947
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,620
Know what happened happened and couldn't have happened any other way.

948
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,480
How do you know?

949
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,960
We are still alive.

950
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,800
Sal doesn't think it happened.

951
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,060
I think it is X Day now.

952
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,680
Today is X Day.

953
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,700
I agree with you.

954
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,060
There is this problem once again.

955
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,080
I don't feel different.

956
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,040
Nothing quite happened.

957
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,740
Well, it's because it actually hasn't happened.

958
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:10,480
It's because, as usual, we have been saved once again.

959
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,960
Oh, is that how it works?

960
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,880
It's just kind of automatic?

961
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,400
That's how it works.

962
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,940
Like your bank account.

963
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,720
Just said in the book.

964
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,440
Just like Bob said.

965
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,320
If it doesn't happen, it's only because he's been able to save us once again.

966
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,340
That's all.

967
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,680
He was able to grab the edges of the ship.

968
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,520
Mostly from increased daytime.

969
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,880
We're going to go live to Bob's house right now.

970
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,700
Make the luck slide down straight into our direction.

971
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,620
And now we have the recipients of that device.

972
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,840
Here comes Connie.

973
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,140
Here comes Connie.

974
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,240
Looking like, uh, like Mary Tyler Moore.

975
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,920
Little Bobby.

976
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,540
Little Bobby.

977
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,040
The new mechanical robot dog.

978
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,080
A book in his hand and a great burden upon his back.

979
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,120
I looked and saw the Bob.

980
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,660
In this plight, therefore, he went home and refrained himself as long as he could.

981
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,980
That his wife and children should not perceive his distress.

982
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,620
That he could not be silent long.

983
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,800
Because that his trouble increased.

984
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,520
Oh, my dear Bowles.

985
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:23,620
I, your dear friend, am in myself undone by Bowles.

986
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,720
Reason of a burden.

987
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,080
A burden.

988
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,840
A burden that lieth hard upon me.

989
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,720
Moral Bowles.

990
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,340
I am for certain informed that this our...

991
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:32,900
Papa Joe!

992
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,080
Papa Joe!

993
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,200
Papa Joe!

994
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,620
Ladies and gentlemen, Papa Joe Bow-Bow!

995
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,840
Ah, yes.

996
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,860
My subgenius brothers and sisters.

997
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,240
Welcome to X-Day 2002.

998
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,740
The final reckoning!

999
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,820
The servant tonight is a gentleman.

1000
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,960
Titled, The Manipulation of Man.

1001
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,700
Oh, it hurts!

1002
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,180
It hurts!

1003
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:12,780
Because you see, my friends, the conspiracy relies on certain formulas to enslave its underclass.

1004
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,520
Cheap amongst them, of course...

1005
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,740
...is the example of sex.

1006
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,460
Yes, you see, sex, it used to be free.

1007
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,740
If there's one thing that was obviously free at one time, it was sex.

1008
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:45,100
Not only could we never have existed without it, but neither could any of the other creatures on this planet.

1009
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,460
I want more sex!

1010
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:57,400
But for some seemingly unknown reason, all of a sudden, sex has become one of the most expensive and commercialized conspiracy theories.

1011
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,640
Commodities!

1012
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,440
Oh!

1013
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,000
How much do I know?

1014
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,920
I guess $30!

1015
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,840
Nowadays, if you want sex...

1016
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,260
Woo!

1017
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,500
Everybody!

1018
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,680
...you have to beg.

1019
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:11,740
Plead!

1020
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,440
Jump through some sort of wedding ring.

1021
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,780
And pay through the nose to get it!

1022
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,340
No! I have my hand!

1023
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,560
Oh, my God!

1024
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:25,800
And when you do get it, friends, there's not only strings attached, there's chains!

1025
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,200
AIDS!

1026
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:26,940
Oh!

1027
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:36,200
Of course, you might also die from AIDS or rot to death from some disease obtained in the process.

1028
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,060
But hey, that's just the cost of doing business, right?

1029
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:40,820
Wrong!

1030
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,980
There was a time, dear friends, that sex was free and plentiful.

1031
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:51,080
In pre-conspiracy times, if you wanted the joys of sex, you just took it!

1032
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,220
You can't be sexist!

1033
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,240
And if you're a partner,

1034
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,480
they usually just grunted in gratitude.

1035
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,940
No guilt, no obligations, no hassles!

1036
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,460
Just wham, bam, thank you, madam!

1037
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,760
But now!

1038
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,060
But now, what has the conspiracy done, my friends?

1039
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,540
They've got their claws stuck in that organ!

1040
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:16,660
And the only free sex you get now is the advertising type you see on TV!

1041
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,740
No!

1042
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,400
That's not sex!

1043
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,720
My friends, if that's the future of sex,

1044
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,360
you can take your Viagra and shove it!

1045
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:25,800
Yeah!

1046
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,020
A new team!

1047
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,840
But that's just a small example, my friends,

1048
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,600
of how the conspiracy sells you that which was once your birthright.

1049
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,620
The ultimate example, of course, is slack.

1050
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,620
Yeah!

1051
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,920
The great slack!

1052
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,040
It used to be the most common,

1053
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,480
the very most common possession of every man, woman, and child.

1054
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,120
Then the conspiracy swooped down and snatched it away,

1055
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,600
repackaging it,

1056
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,020
into something that you had to buy,

1057
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,460
and then trying to sell it back to you at a profit!

1058
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:58,900
Now!

1059
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,040
Now not only do you have to buy slack from the same bastards that stole it away from you in the first place,

1060
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:10,220
you have to endure the absence of slack!

1061
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,940
So if you want to, say, relax,

1062
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,120
what do you have to do?

1063
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,480
You have to suffer some sort of torture

1064
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,320
to earn your right to buy back the slack!

1065
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,620
I'm talking about a job!

1066
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,500
No!

1067
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,120
No!

1068
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:28,540
No!

1069
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:28,800


1070
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,220
No!

1071
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,560
No!

1072
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:29,960
No!

1073
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:30,760


1074
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:32,400


1075
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:33,660


1076
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:34,660


1077
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,100
No!

1078
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:35,300


1079
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:35,300


1080
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,320


1081
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,320


1082
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,480
No!

1083
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:35,620


1084
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:35,660


1085
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:35,900


1086
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:35,900


1087
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:35,900


1088
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,020
No!

1089
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,760
No!

1090
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,000
Oh!

1091
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,140
But brothers and sisters,

1092
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,960
it gets even better.

1093
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,240
The conspiracy not only denies you natural slack,

1094
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,180
in order to create themselves a, a market for their manufactured slack.

1095
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:55,840
No Sir.

1096
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,000
That's not good enough.

1097
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,460
The conspiracy what they sell you in slack

1098
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,580
isn't even real.

1099
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,240
It's false slack!

1100
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,060
No No No!

1101
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,220
Contaminated slack substitute!

1102
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,780
No! No! No!

1103
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,820
No! No!

1104
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,260
My friends, it doesn't even have any nourishment at all.

1105
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,480
We in the church call this Nutra-Slack.

1106
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,220
Because it may taste real, but after a while you realize it isn't, friends.

1107
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,140
The only thing you get out of it is a headache.

1108
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,340
You can buy truckloads of Nutra-Slack, my friends.

1109
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,620
Consume it and you'll never feel satisfied.

1110
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,040
You'll just feel the need to buy more.

1111
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:43,520
Because it seems to you that that empty feeling is some sort of withdrawal system, but it ain't.

1112
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,660
Alas, nothing could be farther from the truth, my friends.

1113
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:53,000
The fact is that sick, queasy feeling you get at the pit of your stomach when you return to Monday morning,

1114
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,880
that isn't the absence of conspiracy pseudo-Slack, my friends.

1115
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:03,540
No, sir, it's your body's natural rejection to the slack-draining effects of anti-church air.

1116
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,940
Give me a break, Bob!

1117
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:14,100
Now, friends, some of you in the audience may not realize what anti-church air is.

1118
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,400
It's my sad duty to inform you.

1119
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:24,200
That's the badass gas they put in the air ducts, in the office buildings, in the workplaces.

1120
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:32,160
It's a special gas that Mad Dr. Mingler put together for the Nazis in order to work against the Allies.

1121
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,080
But, friends...

1122
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,380
Give me his!

1123
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,200
Well, compared to the conspiracy, Hitler was compassionate.

1124
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,580
Because he only used it in wartime!

1125
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,620
Adolf gave orders only to let it drift across enemy lines during an advance.

1126
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:58,500
But here, friends, the conspiracy, they spray the stuff on the air filters of every office workplace on the planet.

1127
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,740
These guys will stop at nothing to make you miserable.

1128
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,220
They'll even breathe in themselves just to make sure nobody else escapes its terrible effects.

1129
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,020
Friends, that's the worst kind...

1130
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,760
The kind of a fanatic.

1131
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,900
The kind that will endure unimaginable pain just to spite their enemy.

1132
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,400
This!

1133
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,900
This is the kind of creature we are dealing with!

1134
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:25,400
No other animal on the planet, my friends, would harm itself to spite another.

1135
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:31,100
Oh, sure, the wolf may gnaw off its arm in order to escape the trap.

1136
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:37,120
But these sons of a bitches would rather take the entire world down with them screaming,

1137
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,020
than let it go!

1138
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,020


1139
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,160
And a single subgenius remained free!

1140
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:40,980
No!

1141
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:41,800


1142
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:42,960
Subgenius!

1143
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,780
It's called the doomsday option, my friends.

1144
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,760
And don't you think for a minute they won't press that button.

1145
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:54,660
They're following that fucker right now, just waiting for proof that their time of power is at an end.

1146
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,180
And friends, that day is today.

1147
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,940
July 5th, 1998!

1148
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,160
No!

1149
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,460
No!

1150
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:01,960


1151
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,080


1152
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,280


1153
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,560
No!

1154
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,200
No!

1155
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,800
Now I sense that there are a few disbelievers in our midst.

1156
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,000
Some of you don't believe it's July 5th!

1157
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,060
Some of you don't believe it's 1998!

1158
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,020
Some of you don't believe in Bob!

1159
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,800
Oh, the blasphemy!

1160
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,120
The blasphemy!

1161
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,580
But he's here, friends, and we can prove it.

1162
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,640
Because just look at the way the conspiracy operates!

1163
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:30,660
Like Slim Pickens and Dr. Strangelove, they'll not only detonate that doomsday device, they'll enjoy doing it!

1164
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,120
Taking a power trip all the way down!

1165
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,400
into that big explosion.

1166
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,480
Now friends,

1167
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,540
we've got sad news for Slim Pickens

1168
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,860
and his conspiracy brothers.

1169
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,220
Because the moment those bombs

1170
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,100
start flashing, they're going to

1171
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,700
discover their enemy

1172
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,800
isn't here.

1173
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,340
Bob Dobson and his faithful followers

1174
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,100
will be whisked away to a

1175
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,280
pleasure saucer and a pleasure world

1176
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,060
and a whole new universe

1177
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,760
that's filled full of slat.

1178
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,420
A perfect planet. A perfect planet

1179
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,040
A planet of pink where pinks

1180
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,840
and normals don't even exist.

1181
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,000
And best of all, friends,

1182
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,120
the greatest gift will not be what this planet

1183
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,400
has, but what this planet

1184
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,440
does not have.

1185
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,480
No more normalcy!

1186
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,880
No more conspiracy!

1187
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,880
Unabundance of slat!

1188
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,260
Do I hear a praise ball?

1189
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,760
Praise ball.

1190
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,540
The best part, my friends,

1191
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,520
is that when the conspiracy takes this planet

1192
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,620
down screaming, we're going to

1193
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,120
give them everything they thought they

1194
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,760
wanted. The whole damn planet.

1195
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,540
And they won't even have to share it.

1196
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,120
Except maybe with a few trillion

1197
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,260
radioactive roaches

1198
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,960
that survived the detonations.

1199
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,220
Terra firma.

1200
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,460
Love it or leave it.

1201
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,760
The subgeniuses have made their choice.

1202
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,240
We paid our $30 for our saucer

1203
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,980
reservations, my friends, and my

1204
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,140
advice to the rest of you is don't wait

1205
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,120
until the holocaust in order to poop or get

1206
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,060
off the potty. Because seating and

1207
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,560
availability are going fast.

1208
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,720
Do yourself a favor,

1209
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,780
friends. Get off! Get off

1210
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,740
this planet! And take back that which

1211
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,920
is rightfully yours. Free slats!

1212
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,560
Take it back! Free slack!

1213
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,760
Take it back! And most of all,

1214
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,240
my friends, refuse the bogus

1215
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,460
anti-slack

1216
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,300
and all its peak manifestations.

1217
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,900
And, lest

1218
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,640
we forget, you must also

1219
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,600
accept Bob Donalds!

1220
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,740
Bob will break the chains of conspiracy

1221
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,700
bondage and lead us from this

1222
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,100
hellhole. Frith,

1223
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,580
I'm sad to have to tell you this, but just

1224
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,800
yesterday, you could ask Pope Black if this

1225
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,780
didn't happen, some reporter had the

1226
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,880
gall, the gall to come

1227
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,740
up to us and say,

1228
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,300
is the subgenius church

1229
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,300
a suicide cult?

1230
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,100
Fuck no! Yes!

1231
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,980
Well, the answer, of course,

1232
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,620
is yes!

1233
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,980
But not the way they think, friends.

1234
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,920
It's not suicide for the

1235
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,620
subgenies. It's suicide

1236
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,620
for those who refuse to join the

1237
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,240
subgenies. Go get a baseball!

1238
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,040
My friends,

1239
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,600
some of you may be wondering

1240
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
exactly if it wasn't 7 a.m.

1241
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,700
1998. When is 7 a.m. 1998?

1242
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,740
The fact of the matter is, you just

1243
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,640
set your watch at 7 a.m. The moment

1244
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,600
you see those pleasure saucers

1245
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,300
landing, you click it in place.

1246
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,440
It is 7 a.m. July 5th, 1998.

1247
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,940
Don't you forget it!

1248
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,520
If you're going to remember just one

1249
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,600
thing here, friends, tonight, I want you to

1250
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,480
leave here with one little saying on your

1251
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,660
burn into your brain. And that

1252
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,740
could probably be best epitomized

1253
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,500
in the words of Mr. Miller,

1254
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,020
who wrote a song about it called

1255
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,240
The X's are coming

1256
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,500
and the pinks are blooming.

1257
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,840
So you go out there, brothers and sisters,

1258
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,260
and you carry out the word of Bob.

1259
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,140
Because the fact of the matter is,

1260
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,460
if you ain't for him, you're

1261
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,620
against him. And that ain't

1262
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,100
a good place to be on X day.

1263
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,260
I want you to raise your praise, Bob!

1264
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,020
Raise Bob!

1265
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,420
The other and other, gentle mars,

1266
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,700
immortals loving, feline bars, daddy driving, fast cars,

1267
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,500
bang, Reverend Ivan Stank, Jesus Christ

1268
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,220
and Princess Wee, smoking for Robin, so do we,

1269
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,540
Reverend Susie, such a floozy, Dr. Pissoff, St. N,

1270
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,340
one more time, I know you can, innate Christian,

1271
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,280
Reverend Geo, doctors getting right, right!

1272
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,760
It's the end of the world

1273
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,400
as we know it.

1274
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,480
It's the end of the world

1275
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,040
as we know it.

1276
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,120
It's the end of the world

1277
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:30,600
as we know it.

1278
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:30,620


1279
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,680
as we know it.

1280
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,800
Bob feels fine.

1281
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,580
What do you think happened there

1282
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,800
16 minutes ago

1283
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,760
that world ended at Brushwood?

1284
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,980
Well, the shadow is heading this way.

1285
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,940
I can see the destruction on the horizon.

1286
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,680
It looks like a light, but it's really

1287
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,260
explosions happening

1288
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,540
simultaneously.

1289
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,380
It's carpet bombing.

1290
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,840
A hydrogen bomb carpet bombing.

1291
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,300
Where they just lay on a whole layer

1292
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:00,600
of fire.

1293
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,720
I don't envy them out there.

1294
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,500
Every three inches a new bomb.

1295
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,040
In a sense, we are

1296
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,860
just trying to blow that half of the world away.

1297
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,340
And then we'll work on this half.

1298
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,460
These days, women

1299
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,580
because there's no collars out there.

1300
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,800
All of the collars

1301
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,060
in Northern California

1302
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,760
are sleeping.

1303
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,960
Or they're

1304
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,100
sucking on their little pacifiers.

1305
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,340
They're eating their pablum.

1306
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,600
They're eating their pablum.

1307
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,180
They're eating their little toy poodles.

1308
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,820
They're having

1309
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,220
lunch of

1310
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,780
tuna salad.

1311
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,160
They're all a bunch of

1312
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,280
little slimy

1313
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,600
slimy chickens.

1314
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,300
Just a bunch of little

1315
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,760
babies out there.

1316
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,220
Hehehehe.

1317
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,200
Yeah, if they were alive

1318
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,460
they would call, but they're just a bunch of

1319
00:47:59,460 --> 00:47:59,800
chickens.

1320
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,820
They're unsure of their balance.

1321
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,540
Can you put out that one sound

1322
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:07,040
that penetrates sleeping people's heads

1323
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,840
and forces their eyes open?

1324
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,220
Cut out.

1325
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,960
Sex. Sex. Sex.

1326
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,840
30. 30. Sex. Sex.

1327
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,260
Pay $30 and get sick sex free.

1328
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,280
Uh-huh.

1329
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:20,680
Sure.

1330
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,980
Now over here you can see the

1331
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,540
lump heads and

1332
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,200
other groups.

1333
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,400
I'm not sure where we take the tour from.

1334
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,740
Here. But, uh,

1335
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,800
I'd like to thank all of you for

1336
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,020
coming along with us this X-Day and

1337
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,060
exploring the possibilities.

1338
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,400
Maybe the ranting of

1339
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,280
the small group of

1340
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,460
so-called individual

1341
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,020
Bob Jobs people.

1342
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:45,760
What?

1343
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,040
Alright, alright, alright.

1344
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,620
With egg on our face and

1345
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,760
blush on our cheeks,

1346
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,720
we now leave here ruefully shaking our heads

1347
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,960
to speak of how we

1348
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,400
need to learn to live.

1349
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,340
And now we're running downstairs.

1350
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,840
Because when you get to the end of the world,

1351
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,660
you want to run a lot.

1352
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,980
You want to run ahead of the chaos.

1353
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,660
You want to just sort of keep ahead of the madness.

1354
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,280
Like outrunning a thunderstorm when you're a kid.

1355
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,800
Here we go. Now keep on running.

1356
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,780
And think to yourself,

1357
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,740
there's no place like

1358
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:18,000
Bob.

1359
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,480
Knowing her fate,

1360
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,660
Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth.

1361
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,580
On board were the Twelve.

1362
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:26,720
The poet,

1363
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,620
the physician,

1364
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,140
the farmer,

1365
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,620
the scientist,

1366
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,480
the magician,

1367
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,340
and the other so-called gods of our legends.

1368
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:34,540
But not Bob.

1369
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,220
Though gods they were.

1370
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,580
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind,

1371
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,680
let us rejoice and let us sing and dance.

1372
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,400
And there was much rejoicing and singing at X-Day.

1373
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,420
But we'll have to wait another year.

1374
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:48,840
Hail Atlantis.

1375
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,140
Hail the sex goddesses.

1376
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,600
Because they did show up at X-Day.

1377
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,900
A new day.

1378
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,400
Yeah, we went over the rainbow.

1379
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:03,160
Into the mitochondrial Yeti DNA Level C.

1380
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,860
Well, we're gonna have to go north and south and east and west.

1381
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,200
And we gotta wait another year.

1382
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,900
Yeah, but we're gonna fill up a new pipe.

1383
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,100
We're gonna wait for the sun to shine.

1384
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,840
We're gonna turn around and take our time.

1385
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,100
We're gonna break the seal to the other side.

1386
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,220
You know, from the valley,

1387
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,380
I hear the muffled cry

1388
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,620
of all them poor sheeple.

1389
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,780
That we left behind.

1390
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,640
And we're gonna take that next evolutionary step.

1391
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,500
Yeah, we're gonna climb on those rocket ships.

1392
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,700
We're gonna build the vessels if we have to.

1393
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,760
We're already testing the engines.

1394
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,200
We're already testing the systems needed for this trip.

1395
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,760
We're on the ride, yeah.

1396
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,700
Mitochondrial Eve, thanks for the ride.

1397
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,560
We'll take it from here.

1398
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,040
She may be.

1399
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:55,820
She may be.

1400
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,540
Okay, what do we need to do?

1401
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,620
I mean, to be ready for the next step?

1402
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,600
For the end of the world.

1403
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,580
We're not, you know, we're not there the next day.

1404
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:07,200
Shouldn't we do something in our own houses or something?

1405
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,420
I think you should go out and live your life

1406
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,500
just the way you've always wanted to live it.

1407
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,900
From the next eight minutes.

1408
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,200
Should I just, like, continue to, you know,

1409
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:23,000
consume and spend money and take care of things like normal?

1410
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:24,980
Yes, exactly.

1411
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,280
Yeah, you should do that for another eight minutes.

1412
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:33,000
And we can see the spaceship starting to hover in the sky.

1413
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,980
I can see another hero above my house, too.

1414
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,840
And the world has ended many times.

1415
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,920
It did so at the end of the Permian period.

1416
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,640
Yeah, well, it didn't actually, I mean, the world as a metaphor

1417
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,740
for the description of present times may have ended.

1418
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,880
Did Bob beat us at tic-tac-toe again?

1419
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,600
Once again, he managed, we put our zeros up there.

1420
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,920
He put his X's up there at random,

1421
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,880
and yet his X's went right across the board.

1422
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:08,420
And our zeros were all over the place.

1423
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,880
Bob won again.

1424
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,780
Oh, the dejected. Slunking away.

1425
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,440
Slowly wander off.

1426
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,380
Oh.

1427
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:20,680
Slinking away, their tails tucked between their legs.

1428
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:24,160
Shame, the Discordians laughing at us again.

1429
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:28,420
The Christians saying things like,

1430
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:28,880
you know, you're a little bit too old to be a Christian.

1431
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,500
But see, Jesus gives you salvation for free.

1432
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,220
Kill me now!

1433
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,280
Or kill me right now.

1434
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,140
Kill me now!

1435
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,260
Praise to you to be.

1436
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,380
You exist in good faith.

1437
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:42,520


1438
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,680
Bless him, hell yeah!

1439
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,800
Oh, it's a plane.

1440
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:48,540
Oh.

1441
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,460
Bob, damn it!

1442
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,240
I'm pissed as hell!

1443
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,700
And not because I'm not on those pleasure saucers,

1444
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:59,280
but because these pigs and armors are still breathing air.

1445
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:04,000
They're walking away in disgust.

1446
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,000
Look at them.

1447
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,160
Look at them wandering away.

1448
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,460
Turning their backs on by.

1449
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,020
They're not even afraid!

1450
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,600
Bob and the Discordians laughing.

1451
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,440
Bob and the Discordians laughing.

1452
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,700
Bob and the Discordians laughing.

1453
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,560
Bob and the Discordians laughing.

1454
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,700
Bob and the Discordians laughing.

1455
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:26,980
Bob and the Discordians laughing.

1456
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:31,740
Boys and girls, it's time for you to pass a fire.

1457
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,020
I was here in the middle of the summer.

1458
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,100
I was just gonna be coming.

1459
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:47,160
I'm dream of pleasure ships from high above on July 5th next year.

1460
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:50,280
I don't know if I can answer both myself, because I'm not myself.

1461
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,380
Subtap out and mute and pause.

1462
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:51,380


1463
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:51,380


1464
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:51,380


1465
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,780
Go to sleep,

1466
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:59,060
and dream of flying high

1467
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,300
on lullabies

1468
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,660
and dreams that Bob has now

1469
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,100
Sex goddesses and squid

1470
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:15,060
Shall hide away

1471
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:19,840
The smiling face of Bob

1472
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,740
Will keep you safe till your second

1473
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:35,040
By counting sheeples

1474
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,040
Follow foals

1475
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,780
To the hell

1476
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,060
They build

1477
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,640
Follow blob

1478
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,180
Follow foal

1479
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,480
Go to sleep

1480
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:52,660
And dream of times when we

1481
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,660
Will meet to sing

1482
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:58,380
And praise the name of Bob

1483
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,660
Sex goddesses and squids

1484
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:08,360
Shall hide away

1485
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,760
The smiling face of Bob

1486
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:09,760


1487
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:16,700
Will keep you safe till your second

1488
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,600
Sex goddesses and squids

1489
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:25,240
Shall hide away

1490
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,820
The smiling face of Bob

1491
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:34,080
Will keep you safe till next day

1492
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,780
And stun that soir

1493
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,500
Robin sneak just doomsday

1494

00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:54,440


1504
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:59,380
0000 0000 0000 0000 in the Flo match

1505
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,380
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 in the Flo match

00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:04,280
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 in the Flo match

1507
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:09,160
0000 0000 0000 0000 in the Flo match

1508
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,140
As we know it, I feel fine.

1509
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:38,340
I feel fine.

1510
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,220
I'm saying that's what we would encounter.

1511
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,520
He's in pain.

1512
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,240
He can't stand right here for a second.

1513
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,340
He must kill himself to relieve himself of such problem.

1514
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:58,000
This picture of the universe conforms to what we know.

1515
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,840
Appropriateness seems to be the watchword for this sight.

1516
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:08,260
Instinctively somehow, it looks and feels innately different.

1517
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:08,320


1518
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:12,940
Deathmonger from a hellish place of his own design.

1519
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,520
A good dose of reality helps keep the psyche sane.

1520
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:26,940
From a pain-encrusted forest, through a knife-wielding kill fest,

1521
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:31,980
we came across a tragic remedy.

1522
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:37,340
Through disemboweled plains of pleasure,

1523
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:45,080
we could not make it to the sauce.

1524
00:57:55,300 --> 00:58:00,440
Apparently, Bob came and did something with all of us.

1525
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,560
You have your answer.

1526
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,260
Now go.

1527
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:12,300
It slithers running away, it lookies even running away from me.

1528
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:17,620
He's disassociating himself from this shameful, pathetic charm of a church!

1529
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,180
Well, you could try the portal method.

1530
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,280
You could visualize the portal opening and the dimensional UFO letting us onboard.

1531
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,920
He slathers his O, but what's a B?

1532
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,380
Two slashes, O, two slashes.

1533
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,940
Da-da, O, da-da.

1534
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:31,960
That's 3.

1535
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,340
3 short, 3 long. 3 short.

1536
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,260
That's S-O-S, but what's Bob?

1537
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,500
B-O-B.

1538
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,160
Two short, three long, two short.

1539
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:48,740
Yeah, but what's Morris Code for a quotation mark?

1540
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:58,620
Pope Black, Pope Phil Monty, Papa Joe Mama, Reverend Ed Fred, Reverend Mickey Finn,

1541
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:08,340
and the other Euro subs heard there at X Day Europe 2002 at the Crop Circles of Aithbury,

1542
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:13,660
taken there from Reverend Matthew Williams, excellent DVD of that show.

1543
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:20,760
We heard, in and out, we heard Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket doing that song,

1544
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,360
The End of the World As We Know It, R.E.M. being owed an explanation,

1545
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,480
and Chaz Smith.

1546
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:35,500
It was heard on ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland years and many X Days ago.

1547
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:40,700
And more than anything else, the Puzzling Evidence Show with Dr. Howell

1548
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:45,540
and Dr. Philo Drummond on KPFA Berkeley on X Day 02.

1549
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:52,320
Friends, also, we heard lots of little warped-out fiddly bits and collages

1550
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:57,780
by the great Fernanda Nandili-Murr and the great Reverend Jartow.

1551
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:03,420
The whole show is tossed by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, Sacred Scribe, Church

1552
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:08,920
of the Subgenius, and this is my last show before X Day 2003.

1553
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,020
This is Hour of Slack number 896.

1554
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,120
We're at www.subgenius.com.

1555
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:19,240
See you on the saucers.
