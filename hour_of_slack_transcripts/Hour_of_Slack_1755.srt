1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
I got to thinking about something.

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:02,460
Yes, dear?

3
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,300
A new and wondrous thing.

4
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,740
The finest dignity and elegance.

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,600
What is it?

6
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,860
The self-genius power of swat.

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,780
What a wonderful idea.

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,340
Oh.

9
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:14,800
Oh.

10
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,580
Uh, Bob.

11
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,340
Oh, yes.

12
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:19,960
Right.

13
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,800
I have a feeling there's not going to be all that much happening until the exes get here Friday morning.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,580
Perhaps.

15
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,940
One may hope.

16
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,980
If that doesn't happen, then we're going to be stuck with a baptism in that reeking pond again on Saturday.

17
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,780
Reach must exceed his grasp.

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,080
Or what's a heaven for?

19
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,800
Yes, the baptism occurs after ex-day.

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,200
It will either occur on the saucers in the careful recreation of the pond there,

21
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:55,620
or it'll be in the pond itself where they've installed a filter, which filters out all the...

22
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,700
What was the matter?

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,840
That's the funniest question.

24
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,420
That's the funniest question I get every ex-day.

25
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:00,740
What was it?

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,380
Do we have an itinerary?

27
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,220
What's the schedule?

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,120
What is the schedule?

29
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,260
Well, check your brochure.

30
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,140
I'm going to be asked that all day long.

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,940
When is the baptism?

32
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:11,960
What's the schedule?

33
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,260
Check your brochure.

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
I think that there was a schedule.

35
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,700
It's in the brochure.

36
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,120
Why don't you check out that...

37
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,880
Pick that brochure up and read it.

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,340
I've worked my ass off on that brochure every year, and then no one ever looks at it or even picks it up every...

39
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,040
It's got the last word in there, the wisdom of the ages.

40
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,440
At the end of ex-day, it's like I print up 75...

41
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,400
brochures, and when I'm cleaning up, there's 74 of them left.

42
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:42,000
Besides, you know you want one as a priceless souvenir of this occasion, full of informative things.

43
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,560
Yeah, it's got the Dobstown nanoheliograph paper.

44
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,060
But look under schedule there, up in the upper left hand of this jazzy document.

45
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,180
Never.

46
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,240
That's the last thing any subgenius looks at is the instructions.

47
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:04,100
That's... it's um... well, that's one of those distinguishing things between the emergentiles and the rewardius.

48
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,640
Perhaps the instructions are not for them, but for you to indemnify yourself.

49
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,300
You can say that you put out instructions as to what to do, but they did not follow.

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,080
The emergent...

51
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,360
Rebellious children...

52
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,160
The emergentiles write the instructions...

53
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,140
...worshipped the golden calf of the conspiracy while you were on the mountain communicating with Dobbs.

54
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,200
Well, did your question get answered, Philo?

55
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,280
I tell thee it is on the day after, uh, X-Day.

56
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:42,080
After the 5th, it will either be on the holodeck or out in the muck and the tick-infested...

57
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:50,700
As usual, we'll have either... if we're lucky, it'll be on the holodeck, but we have to be ready for the infested pond.

58
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,860
Yes, so the ticks on the holodeck are augmented special effects, unfortunately.

59
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,860
AR, we call it.

60
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,400
Yes.

61
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,720
But the ones in the pond are the real thing.

62
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,040
Right. Nature in the raw.

63
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah.

64
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,900
And I... so leeches, because I've felt things attach themselves to me while I've been in there.

65
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,800
Uh, but, um, anyway, uh...

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,280
Well, the candiru toads are certainly... this isn't really the time of year for them.

67
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,280
You have to stimulate them before they are a problem.

68
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,920
Don't forget the ones that swim up your peace tree.

69
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,220
The ones that swim up your peace tree.

70
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,120
Those are the ones. They are the ones that swim up your urethra, but as I said, you have to...

71
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,960
Dr. Drummond, don't talk unless you have something to say. Into the microphone.

72
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,480
Ah, yes, he's talking.

73
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,540
They swim up your peace dream.

74
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,240
They swim up your peace dream.

75
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,120
So what is the... what do the instructions say for today?

76
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,920
The instructions for today...

77
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,880
Today's Wednesday.

78
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,040
Today's Wednesday.

79
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,920
They say, relax, settle back, and enjoy our featured presentation.

80
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,500
Wednesday says, too hot, wet, stay at cafe.

81
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,860
Stay at cafe, there, that's perfect.

82
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,360
Stay at the Chargers, watch the live radio show.

83
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,180
Yeah, yeah, doing that, yeah.

84
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,000
And or jamming and ranting.

85
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,460
Right. What about the scrapple and stuff? Is that...

86
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,580
That's like everything.

87
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,180
That's not in the schedule because that's... not for us to know yet.

88
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay, but aside from that, and if you'll move your eye down the column, you'll see...

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,420
Then Thursday, forget what day it is, totally revise schedule, stay up all night, and upset everyone.

90
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,080
Yes, that's what we do.

91
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,800
And then a little bit further...

92
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,560
Further down, past the...

93
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:35,000
On Friday at July 5th, 7 a.m., we will be exiting with the Exists...

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,440
Yes.

95
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,760
And the Sex Goddesses...

96
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,360
Exit only.

97
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,400
In the pleasure saucers.

98
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,440
Next six floors.

99
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,440
So the rest of this is meaningless. What's the point? What is the point?

100
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,760
But it says that the baptism is after...

101
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,260
What is the point?

102
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,920
After the moment of the rupture.

103
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,400
But that doesn't mean anything.

104
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:51,940
That doesn't mean anything.

105
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,660
Well, it means that the baptism will not take place...

106
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:55,980
Or...

107
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,780
Before the rupture.

108
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,100
Oh, wait.

109
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,720
Or...

110
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,980
Or everybody goes back to bed for a while, followed by hours of cursing, moaning, and

111
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,220
excuses in the cafe...

112
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:04,960
See, we have it covered.

113
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,900
Or various camps.

114
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,940
Ask Dr. Howe...

115
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,560
Yeah, come see my show.

116
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,260
...and Bulldog Auction, Rants and Jams...

117
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,860
Rants in your jammies.

118
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,160
...and Saturday...

119
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:15,860
Bobtism.

120
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,440
...recuperate from Friday the Bobtism in the Pond at 2 p.m.

121
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,000
2 p.m.

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,340
Costume or not party...

123
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,380
Be there or be square.

124
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,640
...at 4 p.m., more Bulldog Auctions.

125
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:25,640


126
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:25,640


127
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:25,640


128
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:25,640


129
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,520
No noise on stage.

130
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,260
Followed by surviving performers and a Bob burning.

131
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,720
Now, costume or not, does that refer to a closed, optional lifestyle?

132
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,300
Yeah.

133
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,720
Costume or not par...

134
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,420
Partay.

135
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,980
Well, all sorts of things are coming up, as...

136
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,360
...as you can see.

137
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,500
So, uh, there's ample reason to fly low.

138
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,380
Sunday, slacking, jamming, last-minute conversions.

139
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,920
Yes.

140
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,040
We're doing, uh...

141
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,280
I don't know, I don't know what to say.

142
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,280


143
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,280


144
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,280


145
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,280


146
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,280


147
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,280


148
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,280


149
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,280


150
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,280


151
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,280


152
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,280


153
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,280


154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,980
So yeah, see who's carefully prepared

155
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,600
Andrew the Impaled is coming

156
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,940
I don't know about the other clown

157
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,220
But he usually puts on a great show

158
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:06,920
Or two

159
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,820
One is the disgusting show

160
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,720
The show involving self-mutilation

161
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,700
And trying the flesh

162
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,060
And then his other show is a lovely

163
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,960
Inspired music reminiscent of Tom Lehrer

164
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,400
Quite reminiscent

165
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,000
She said she'd always love me

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,920
As long as life goes on

167
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,080
She said she'd keep hold of me

168
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,860
Turns out she was wrong

169
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,040
She called me her one and only

170
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,940
And she said she'd keep hold of me

171
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:54,940


172
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,880
And my ear, she'd softly sigh

173
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,080
That I'd ne'er again be lonely

174
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,000
That was just a lie

175
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,740
I guess I've been had

176
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,700
I guess I've been had

177
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,860
And if it wasn't for the cash I spent

178
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,340
Fixing up her car, well

179
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,340
I wouldn't feel so bad

180
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,780
I never saw it coming

181
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,940
I didn't realize we were together

182
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:24,940


183
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,020
And that I would soon be slumming

184
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,840
Even though I just paid the rent

185
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,300
I thought I made all the right moves

186
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,840
And that things between us were cool

187
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,400
And I thought I might get some good news

188
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,160
Instead I got schooled

189
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,640
I guess I've been had

190
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,700
I guess I've been had

191
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,460
And if it wasn't for the time I wasted cleaning her garage, well

192
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:54,940
I guess I've been had I guess I've been had And if it wasn't for the time I wasted cleaning her garage, well

193
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,480
I guess I've been had I guess I've been had And I wouldn't feel so bad

194
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,140
And ain't no euphemism either

195
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,760
We never did fight

196
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,240
We always got along

197
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,840
We'd rock it all night

198
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,540
Oh yeah, our lovin' was strong

199
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,900
We made a good team

200
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,500
At least it's so I thought

201
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,200
But then again, sense of perception

202
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,780
Is something I ain't got

203
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,140
Right?

204
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,520
, L.L.

205
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,880
If you get that seizure

206
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:36,880


207
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:36,880


208
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,660
Hard beans break очень Yeah gun dries

209
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,620
Wanna make her happy

210
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:45,700
But you judge her

211
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:45,700


212
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:45,700


213
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh off at my door

214
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,920
And then I'd knock her door on the doorstop

215
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,160
She said, oh, that, that's nothing

216
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,140
She said that they're just friends

217
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,220
Turns out that was something

218
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,200
And that something was the end

219
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,740
I guess I've been had

220
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,760
I guess I've been had

221
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,460
And if it wasn't for the fact he was my roommate

222
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,360
Back in school, well, I wouldn't feel so bad

223
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,480
I guess I've been had

224
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,520
I guess I've been had

225
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,820
And if it wasn't for the fact I could have been with Cheryl Moore

226
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,860
Wasn't for the fact I just installed a brand new floor

227
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,000
If it wasn't for the fact she stood there grinning at the door

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,820
Well, I wouldn't feel so

229
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,700
I wouldn't feel so

230
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,400
I wouldn't feel so bad

231
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,440
I wouldn't feel so bad

232
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,020
Settle down, you dogs, geez

233
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,740
This was recorded at 22X Day last summer

234
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,640
With Dr. Hal, myself, except that I left

235
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,820
And Philo Drummond

236
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,140
But we had a new guest of stars

237
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,200
Mr. Sister and Reverend Crimsoniculus

238
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,860
So let's go back to that live in front of us tiny audience

239
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,500
Oh, wait, I think we turned the audience into the show

240
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,560
Enjoy the day

241
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,220
I'm sick and tired of sitting here

242
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,180
Well, you have to

243
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,000
I need a volunteer

244
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,420
What about the

245
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,700
Come on up, Reverend Crimsoniculus

246
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,780
Come on up, Mr. Sister

247
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,780
You've had enough of that hot wine

248
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,620
Fight citage, live up to your name

249
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,100
And fight boredom with

250
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,640
Oh, wait, that's not what the fight stands for

251
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,880
It's friend them if they can't something

252
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,980
I forget

253
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,840
Flex them

254
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,200
Flex them

255
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,860
Fark them if they

256
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,760
Fark them if

257
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,300
I can't remember

258
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,320
It's one of those

259
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,960
Finklestein, maybe?

260
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,840
So please, Miss Star, Sister Star

261
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,020
Take a seat and put on the headphones

262
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,300
As you know, and your lips are near the microphone

263
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,960
It's warm and everybody can hear you

264
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,060
Everybody's comfortable

265
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,100
So, as I've been given command of a microphone here

266
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,380
Just put your lips near it and you'll be audible

267
00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:00,500
I would like to put a shout out to Bob Woods on Facebook

268
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,680
Is that a literal shout or are you just going to mention him now?

269
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,460
Woodsy the Mailman

270
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,700
Uh-huh

271
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,840
If you have nothing better to do, subscribe to his posts

272
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,700
He's a mailman, but he also has like a blog?

273
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,400
Is that the story?

274
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,720
I cannot explain it to you

275
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,200
Is that your right wing buddy?

276
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,000
No, no

277
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,060
He's apolitical

278
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,360
Does he put out a post?

279
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,780
Printed hard copy newsletter?

280
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,760
Magazine?

281
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,660
Zine?

282
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,000
Giveaway?

283
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,380
No

284
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:29,700
Flyer?

285
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,120
No

286
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,900
He's online

287
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,480
He pretends to be a person

288
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,540
Of interest

289
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,440
Working a cell phone

290
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,140
Uh-huh

291
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,020
And everything he posts is in capital letters

292
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,760
That makes it important

293
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,200
So, yeah, like somebody's grandfather maybe

294
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,340
The bigger the headline, the bigger the story

295
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,940
Yes, and he misspells things and

296
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,340
Why let's not?

297
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,580
Blazers

298
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:56,680
I know

299
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:56,680


300
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:56,680


301
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,100
It's very uncomfortable

302
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,100


303
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,600
18th comes a day

304
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:07,640
New songs on Thursday

305
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:07,640


306
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,100
Browns

307
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,760
The costumes

308
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:08,780
JC

309
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,300
On the Country

310
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,620
I'll say it on

311
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:10,620


312
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:10,620

318
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,840
Everything's Fan

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:17,660


325
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:17,660


326
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,440
etc

327
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:22,880
Come

329
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:23,560
Show

330
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:23,840
Catch meека

331
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:23,860
э

332
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,700
The Church of the Subjects, be chum genius, whatever it is,

333
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,880
being a joke is completely beside the point

334
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,700
because that doesn't have anything to do with the validity of what it asserts.

335
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,420
It's just that we assert it in a comic way.

336
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,200
There's no disproving something just because the element of humor is added.

337
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:53,020
Indeed, the element of humor demonstrates that there's something there to laugh at.

338
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,880
Deep words, deep words.

339
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,600
The asserted absurdity of the human condition is what creates humor.

340
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,420
Yes, of course, and the sudden incongruity of a slapdown.

341
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,780
It's not what you believe, it's how you believe it.

342
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,960
Seems like what you believe kind of has something to do with it, wouldn't it?

343
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,340
That's what others...

344
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,220
Other people believe suddenly coming in contact with what you believe

345
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,240
that creates the frictive frisson of humor.

346
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,960
People believe about what you believe.

347
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,360
What they believe about what you believe.

348
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,340
What they believe about what you believe represents and reflects their beliefs too,

349
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,540
which become evident during a humorous interchange.

350
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,440
There's too much reflection going on.

351
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,780
Now you're laughing because there's two points of view being simultaneously expressed.

352
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,540
One of them is a surprise that comes at the end.

353
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,660
The fabled punchline.

354
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,460
It's like two radios turned to different stations playing together.

355
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,300
It's like the country music station.

356
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,540
But occasionally there's a mashup.

357
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,320
It's not always on, but it's always in the air.

358
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:16,760
Some powerful throbbing stations with wide bandwidth overcome little stations

359
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:23,240
that might have neat stuff on them but are completely crushed by their powerful signal

360
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,320
from right next to them.

361
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
On the dial.

362
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,760
It's like that Mexican AM radio station that comes in at night very late.

363
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,940
It really comes pounding in, eh?

364
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,400
Really loud?

365
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,220
Really loud.

366
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:36,740
Pulsating signal?

367
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,260
Yes.

368
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,740
En Español.

369
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,700
En Español, yes.

370
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,760
Se habla Español.

371
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,700
When Puzzling Evidence and I get off the Puzzling Evidence show,

372
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,380
which is about 5 o'clock on Friday morning,

373
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,200
we tune in.

374
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,340
We try to listen to this show that's broadcast on the Indian reservation.

375
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,500
And it's hard to get to because there's this Jesus station

376
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,400
that's really powerful right next door.

377
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,220
Jesus keeps bleeding over into it.

378
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,120
But then you hear them broadcasting in the Dine language.

379
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,200
And when they're not doing that,

380
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,720
they seem to be playing some kind of countrified country and western music.

381
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,660
Oh, intriguing.

382
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,480
Yeah.

383
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,680
Well, you see, I hail from Cleveland, Ohio,

384
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,580
where there are a lot of Russian and Polish people.

385
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,240
Uh-huh.

386
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,680
And Klezmer music.

387
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,140
One hears a great deal of polka music.

388
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,840
A good polka in the eye with a sharp stick.

389
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
A Weird Al's polka?

390
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,760
I like Klezmer music,

391
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,600
and I think that's very au courant among the youths of America today.

392
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,660
Yes.

393
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,140
They go out and they play funny oompa music with their friends

394
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,740
rather than being laid-back, cool disco techno.

395
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:51,880
Uh-huh.

396
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,300
Very little Klezmer.

397
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,320
Klezmer rap, though.

398
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,540
It's true.

399
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,440
There is some.

400
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,340
There is some.

401
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:03,600
There is a chap rap from England by the original gentleman.

402
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,340
Oh, I've heard of that guy.

403
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:05,840
Yeah.

404
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,640
He's fighting trousers.

405
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:16,620
Cultivated rap about Guy Debord and all the different types of tea he likes to drink.

406
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,340
So there's that.

407
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,760
There are all sorts of variations.

408
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,060
All forms are permissible.

409
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,320
Everything that could be exploited should be exploited.

410
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,640
And will be exploited.

411
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,280
Nature rushes in to fill a vacuum.

412
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,660
Because it pours it.

413
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,880
Nothing is excerpted.

414
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,600
And pour the vacuum.

415
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,740
Yes.

416
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,960
Those giant underground crystal caverns under Mexico City that they discovered,

417
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,240
and others like those elsewhere,

418
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,180
well, they're not filled.

419
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:53,920
Oh, yes.

420
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,400
Yes, they are.

421
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,040
Now that they're discovered, our air is rushing in there.

422
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,460
And humans are rubbernecking and breaking off little pieces and checking it out.

423
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,000
Nature vacuums a whore.

424
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,060
And everybody else.

425
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:33,440
They want to get away with it.

426
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,940
Around the far corner.

427
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,260
We're not putting on the poke.

428
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,860
This isGod.

429
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,900
A either образом

430
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,360
We see every single that makes us hungry.

431
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,120
We turn on our computer.

432
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,120


433
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,660
We can face it with Р.

434
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,560
But the fact is that life ischtal Part of health is being practised every now and again.

435
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:44,720
We deserve better these days.

436
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,580
As long as gives the rest,

437
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:46,580


438
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:46,580


439
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:52,520
Never affected.

440
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:53,900
Honestly.

441
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,240
guitar solo

442
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,800
guitar solo

443
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,280
guitar solo

444
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,400
guitar solo

445
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,280
guitar solo

446
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,560
guitar solo

447
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,040
guitar solo

448
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,180
guitar solo

449
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,700
Thank you, and if we pass the audition,

450
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,120
hopefully we'll see you again next year.

451
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,060
Listen, I can tell you're fake clapping.

452
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,720
You're not really clapping because you like it. You're clapping

453
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,600
just because you say, well, good, they're done.

454
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,240
And that was

455
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,180
the Slut Rods.

456
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,640
I've got two dogs here that are just

457
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,540
out of control.

458
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,600
Are you all aware

459
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,660
that everything that's

460
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,580
necessary to destroy this planet

461
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,820
is already here somewhere?

462
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,720
It's already freely available,

463
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,740
and that is a very sad

464
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,680
revelation. If we didn't know, we were going

465
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,860
to lose the planet already. Every time

466
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,880
you go into one grocery

467
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,000
store, that is one of a zillion,

468
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,760
godzillion grocery

469
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,920
stores, and everyone has a long

470
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,880
shelf stretching into the

471
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,760
distance of solvents, soap,

472
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,880
sips, heavy chemical

473
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,660
preparations, insecticides.

474
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,020
You know, this

475
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,900
massive chemical thing that you see

476
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,260
is repeated

477
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,540
everywhere. Where are they going to go?

478
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,120
They're not going to stay on the

479
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,220
shelf of the grocery store.

480
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,100
It's going to go into the water table.

481
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,080
It's going to go right into you

482
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,620
through a million vectors,

483
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,680
and there's no way to

484
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,700
stop it because there's so much. Haven't you

485
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,580
been in the grocery store and looked

486
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,640
and seen how much there

487
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,420
is just in that one grocery

488
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,440
store? Dozens of different types of pesticides.

489
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,600
Just alone. You can get your local

490
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,640
grocery. It doesn't even have

491
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,480
to be the super

492
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,520
strong bad chemicals, although there

493
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,580
are a lot of those. It could

494
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,320
simply be all the salt

495
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,700
that is present because the presence

496
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,740
of salt when it enters the soil

497
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,820
kills all living things.

498
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,720
It used to be the practice in the ancient

499
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,620
world to sow salt in

500
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,540
your enemy's field so they couldn't grow

501
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,380
anything. That was a Roman practice.

502
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,740
From space you see the desert

503
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,160
areas spreading

504
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,600
out in the satellite

505
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,480
photos, and they're spreading out because

506
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,580
of agriculture because every time

507
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,460
that they inundate their

508
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,420
fields, salt flows

509
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,120
in, and you're shortening

510
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,400
the life of that

511
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,480
arable land. But I,

512
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,300
for one, am so thankful

513
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,580
that salt is so much more affordable

514
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,420
in our era. Ooh, it's tasty,

515
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,700
and we've got the big salt

516
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,820
farms over

517
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,740
in California where I am.

518
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,800
The salt flats. You can go out with a

519
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,520
measuring cup and scoop it up.

520
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,280
Good old sea salt.

521
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,900
We don't have to recover...

522
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,160
Or like the cliffs of Dover.

523
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,420
Well, that is calcareous

524
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,720
animalcules creating chalk.

525
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,080
Oh, chalk.

526
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,260
I still pour it on.

527
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,600
Skeletons of zillions of tiny

528
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:15,880
creatures.

529
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,940
And not only the tiny ones,

530
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,760
the giant ichthyosaurus

531
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,780
is sometimes

532
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,160
found there, and

533
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,100
the shells of grotesque

534
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,760
ammonites, tentacled

535
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,300
beings that have

536
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,400
a large spiral shell like

537
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,280
the horns of the god Ammon.

538
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,460
And wouldn't it be fun to go back

539
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,580
and get one of those just to bring with you?

540
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,540
Oh, you think you could just go back

541
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,760
and get one, huh?

542
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Well, I mean, we kind of invented time control.

543
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,320
You get in the water with that

544
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,340
thing. We've invented time control, so

545
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,380
of course. I mean, once X-Day happens,

546
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,760
we'll just go back in time, go pick up some salt.

547
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,080
Pick some up.

548
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,700
Well, you can go back, but then you can't go forward

549
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,120
because now it's all different because you were there,

550
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,100
you stuck yourself out, and now

551
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,440
probability is all

552
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,760
completely changed.

553
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,980
You cannot travel back,

554
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,140
so you have to go forward.

555
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,100
And if you're lucky

556
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,900
and you have the right type of time machine,

557
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,280
you can go forward fast. Otherwise, you have to

558
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,320
go forward at the same rate as

559
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,240
everybody else.

560
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,920
60 seconds is a low way.

561
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,540
That is a problem.

562
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,520
And they say that although

563
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,440
it is possible to invent time machines,

564
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,900
they couldn't go back to an earlier

565
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,760
period than the time they were created.

566
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,520
Who knows?

567
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,220
Depends on the mythos, for sure.

568
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,660
If we could go back in time, it would

569
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,900
cost a fortune to open up all those

570
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,880
restaurants that closed or bring back

571
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,200
those people that we miss.

572
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,700
Yes, well, you go back and you

573
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,820
get all the rare

574
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,680
collector's comic books when they're

575
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,820
cheap and easy to get off the stand.

576
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,780
Oh, they're one

577
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,720
tiny guy who had

578
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,900
three little pain guys.

579
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,400
Oh, piggy,

580
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,780
see how they run.

581
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,600
Oh, see how

582
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,460
they run.

583
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,380
Oh, they all run

584
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,220
after the bar with me.

585
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,560
Who could have said that we're carving

586
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,540
them? Now I'm the one

587
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,240
of the three little

588
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,760
pig-blivers.

589
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,420
Two piggies, three blind

590
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,080
mice.

591
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,540
Why don't we always go oink,

592
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,340
oink, oink? It's our

593
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,020
tradition to go oink.

594
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,880
Three blind mice.

595
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,080
Pee-wee, pee-wee,

596
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,280
we're skinny and green.

597
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,460
How they run, they will

598
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,280
see how they

599
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,000
rise. For they all

600
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,560
can have fun.

601
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,320
Oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink.

602
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,800
Well, we all

603
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,260
are just a little bit

604
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,300
alive. And now we three

605
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,140
blind mice.

606
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,760
Oink, oink, oink, oink, oink.

607
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,820
We're the only

608
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,500
best type of three blind

609
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,660
mice. So don't

610
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,760
ever try to go oink,

611
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,280
oink, oink, oink, oink.

612
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,360
We are the we, we,

613
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:03,820
we.

614
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,440
Yes, well you go back

615
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,000
and you collect, get all the

616
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,500
rare collector's comic books when

617
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,460
they're cheap and easy to get off

618
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,480
the stand. Which I was fortunate

619
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,380
enough to collect and keep

620
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,240
in my garage all these many years.

621
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,180
That's good, I'm glad you've got yours.

622
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,640
You know, not only were

623
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,980
moms assiduous in junking

624
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,680
comic book collections, but there

625
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,100
was a national movement

626
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,480
to burn them in church

627
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,400
sanctified bonfires.

628
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,860
Terrible. The Kefauver Commission's

629
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,420
investigation into juvenile

630
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,240
delinquency pointed

631
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,800
that comic books were the reason

632
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,820
there were all these scary

633
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,720
kids with ducktail haircuts

634
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,400
and leather jackets and

635
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,620
stilettos, you know. Comic books.

636
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,580
Comic books had to be the reason.

637
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,120
And they were massively

638
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,860
destroyed.

639
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,020
We got rid of the

640
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,440
EC comics line, the

641
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,780
great entertainment comics.

642
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,400
And all that were left were

643
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,460
DC and

644
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,680
the Dimely that became Marvel

645
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,420
and then there was Carlton comics

646
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,560
that were sub-bar. Harvey,

647
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:13,960
uh,

648
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,300
not many.

649
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,560
And even then, odd one shots

650
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,600
like Carl Anderson's Henry or

651
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,780
the great duck

652
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,600
and mouse epics of

653
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,340
Dale's Disney comic.

654
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,560
I was

655
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,620
a fan of Uncle

656
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,920
Scrooge McDuck myself.

657
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,400
Well written, incredibly well written

658
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,560
stories by one guy who

659
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,400
didn't even get to sign his name,

660
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,400
but people recognized

661
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,560
this is really good, you know.

662
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,560
This is better than any actual Donald

663
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,260
Duck cartoon or anything.

664
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,980
It has tremendous

665
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,220
depth to it and

666
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,680
I ended up

667
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,140
working in a bank

668
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,060
in similar conditions.

669
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,460
Did you, I mean,

670
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,680
Carl Barks was the guy

671
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,340
he eventually did achieve

672
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,560
some fame. His bulldozers

673
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,260
plowing coins

674
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,820
in underground vaults. Paintings of

675
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
And then swimming in it.

676
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,700
And swimming in it, yeah. And throwing it up

677
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,540
and letting it fall on his head.

678
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,660
Which I never understood. I've done that once

679
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,380
with small change and it hurt every time.

680
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,260
Yeah, well, you must be

681
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,340
not rich enough to enjoy.

682
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,600
Or have a feathery coat which

683
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,360
will let them

684
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,300
not fall on your exposed

685
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,480
skin. I see.

686
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,700
Well, that's something I'll do the next day then.

687
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Change my body, be a duck so I can swim

688
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,080
in small change.

689
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,960
The duck is an interesting

690
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,060
feature for that matter. I have a few

691
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,780
Mad magazines too, but I consider them

692
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,560
in retrospect prophetic.

693
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,800
Well, the Mad magazines,

694
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,420
but they were an

695
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,480
E.C. comic and the only E.C.

696
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,300
comic that survived was Mad,

697
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,380
which then became a magazine and

698
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,780
stopped being a comic book.

699
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,440
But the early ones

700
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,800
had the great stuff that's reprinted

701
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,380
in the early Mad Ballantine

702
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,480
books. They're parodies of other

703
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,760
comic books which they excelled in

704
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
at that time.

705
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,580
It was kind of like the Monty Python of

706
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:11,940
America.

707
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,780
They were really thought to be evil.

708
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,720
They were denounced because they were

709
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,800
subverting the American

710
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,240
way. In

711
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,780
fact, there also was

712
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,520
Panic in addition to Mad.

713
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,340
Mad was done by Gaines

714
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,900
and Harvey Kurtzman.

715
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,380
Panic was done by Feldstein

716
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,540
and Feldstein never knew how to be

717
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,600
funny. But it was beautifully drawn

718
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
and one take

719
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,400
on the night before Christmas

720
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,960
drawn by

721
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,800
one of the great

722
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,640
E.C. guys,

723
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,020
Will Elder, I think, was denounced

724
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,400
on the U.S. Senate floor.

725
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,760
How could anyone create this?

726
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,140
This work of filth.

727
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,840
Think goofing on Santa Claus.

728
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,700
Really, couldn't people be a little

729
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,620
less uptight?

730
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,420
But they weren't.

731
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,880
Gaines went in to testify

732
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,700
for his books but he didn't

733
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,280
make a good impression.

734
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,520
He took too many speed

735
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,700
pills before talking to the

736
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,440
House Un-American Activities

737
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,280
Committee.

738
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,520
He just basically zipped through it.

739
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,620
He defended a horror comic which

740
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,660
showed a woman's severed head being

741
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,060
held up. He said, well, yeah,

742
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,680
this is what we do. You call

743
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,620
this good taste? Yeah, it's

744
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,680
in good taste. The line is

745
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,380
there so you don't see the meat and

746
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,700
things hanging down. That didn't work.

747
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,540
And he also

748
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,580
said that the

749
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,700
stories and the E.C.

750
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,900
comics had an O. Henry

751
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,280
ending and that anyone who

752
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,000
didn't understand this

753
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,660
type of literature was like a

754
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,960
dried up old maid,

755
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,780
claiming to legislate

756
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,620
for everybody else.

757
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,520
Another thing that he regretted saying.

758
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,120
Oh.

759
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,260
So kind of like some of the situations

760
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,100
we have going on now.

761
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,720
Always. The eternal situation

762
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,680
is always going on and it's

763
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,640
going on now. People who just don't know

764
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,560
are trying to write the laws when

765
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,520
they should just be asking.

766
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,140
Well, people who can attack art because

767
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,400
they know it's helpless and it can't attack

768
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,000
that.

769
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,760
Still who's

770
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,480
going to offset these

771
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,000
Secret

772
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,020
Secrets

773
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,040
is

774
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,240
the

775
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,760
native

776
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,600
And his mind was ablaze

777
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,140
Lame situations were his subduesure

778
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:07,360
We didn't know the maladies that he had come to cure

779
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,040
Well, he got himself a job there right from the start

780
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,220
Help wanted sign in the shape of a heart

781
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,540
He took it inside to Fanny the Forest

782
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,740
Gave him a job cause he lives in the forest

783
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,760
His dad was a tree and his mom was a ranger

784
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,300
We didn't know we were friends until we were strangers

785
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,240
His name was Rusty Cavallaro

786
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,380
And he walked into a town with a heads-on barrel

787
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,520
When he was a kid

788
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,840
He got agitated

789
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,820
Everybody got elevated

790
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,920
We came around when he came around

791
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,500
The Condors, they all came back to stay

792
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,640
Marching bands played downtown every day

793
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,820
The mayor, he stopped wearing a tie

794
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,040
The chief of police got a tattoo on his thigh

795
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,120
Ashtrays killed all the Emerald Beatles

796
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,700
We gave blood without any needle

797
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,700
His name was Rusty Cavallaro

798
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:34,960
And he walked into a town with a heads-on barrel

799
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,480
When he got agitated

800
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,360
Everybody got elevated

801
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,280
We came around when he came around

802
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,500
And his dad just got seriously hurt

803
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,460
He left a single showumbled

804
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,380
And his dad died

805
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:12,300
What a live-on

806
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:18,460
One of the APs once said

807
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,420
We were the verses and he was the chorus

808
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,360
He taught us songs that we already knew

809
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,540
We all sang along and we sang them in tune

810
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,540
He gave us all, he gave us nothing

811
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,160
We were the turkeys and he was the stuffing

812
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,040
His name was Rusty Cavallaro

813
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:50,140
And he walked into our town with an answer barrel

814
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:58,620
When he got anticipated, everybody got elevated

815
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,540
We came around when he came around

816
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:44,020
We came around when he came around

817
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:57,160
We came around when he came around

818
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:20,140
So your dress lashes out to chastise rivals and subordinates?

819
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,420
Anyone who gets it within three feet, it'll just...

820
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,220
And does it some damage? Does it hurt?

821
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,540
I don't think it's that efficient

822
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,260
Lashes you? It slaps you?

823
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,500
I mean, it is like plastic and silk

824
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,380
It probably does sting a little

825
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,020
It could do some damage

826
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,980
Under the unluckiest circumstances possible

827
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,300
For the most part, it would do nothing but annoy

828
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,860
Yeah

829
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,020
Yeah

830
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,020


831
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,340
Hey, what's this?

832
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,700
Oh gosh, it's in my eye

833
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,140
Or even dare those who enjoy receiving that form of attention

834
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,020
Well, you know, some people just want you to stay out of their area

835
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,680
I think it's kind of a neat thing

836
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,780
But when you go to a party, oh well

837
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,480
Well, yes, you definitely couldn't wear that at a party

838
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,680
Just every time you're trying to get a beer

839
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,680
Trying to talk

840
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,660
There's the invisibility suit that the CIA was trying to...

841
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,540
To develop

842
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,800
I thought that that was all Photoshop and smoke and mirrors

843
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,100
Well, it was...

844
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,700
It's like mirrors

845
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:26,460
It's like the garment is covered with cells

846
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,060
And the cells are little cameras and little screens together

847
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,660
So you see what is on the other side

848
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,400
That the camera takes

849
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,900
And then the computer has figured out where it should go

850
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,000
According to your point of view

851
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,640
But there's still...

852
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,680
There's still the problem of the ripple that you see

853
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,680
As the suited person moves across your field of vision

854
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,320
The shadow that he casts

855
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,520
Is still there

856
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,240
Yeah

857
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,680
Because light is still going

858
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,240
Yeah, he's actually there

859
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,940
You're just seeing what's on the other side of him

860
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,760
But you also see his shadow

861
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,840
I imagine you'd probably also see his footprints and such too

862
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,420
Yeah, they're actually there

863
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,880
So you would see them

864
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,240
Unless there was something else

865
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,220
Who knows?

866
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,220
Maybe hard...

867
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,540
Hard-packed dirt

868
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,740
Wouldn't have any

869
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,160
Somebody walking very carefully

870
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,820
Not making the footprints

871
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,720
No, the special invisible operative

872
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,180
And then, of course, they are armed with weapons

873
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,200
Which also have given the invisibility treatment

874
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,420
Well, because it would make no sense to just have a gun sitting there

875
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,380
Floating in mid-air

876
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,360
And then shooting at people

877
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,660
Yeah

878
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,380
The gun shows you what's on the other side of it

879
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,620
But it doesn't show you what's...

880
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,220
Inside it

881
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,060
The bullets which emerge

882
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,140
But too fast to be seen

883
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,120
Into visibility

884
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,840
Indeed

885
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,580
It would be silly to do it otherwise

886
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,980
Is what I was saying

887
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,540
If you had the invisibility suit for yourself

888
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,400
But not for the gun

889
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,080
You'd just have a floating gun

890
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,660
Well, the gun doesn't always have to float

891
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,640
Well, true

892
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,900
You could lie on a shelf

893
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,340
Until needed to be snatched up

894
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,420
By the super invisible agent

895
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,780
Well, then that would just be scary

896
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,160
You're walking into a thing

897
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,440
You think you're trying to find a...

898
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,220
Some kind of agent

899
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,300
And then all of a sudden, bam

900
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,460
Just a gun floating there

901
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,540
Am I dealing with ghosts?

902
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,000
No

903
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,260
Yeah

904
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,700
No, probably not

905
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,320
Time to leave the vicinity

906
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,520
This troubled area likes me little

907
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,360
Let us call the mystery machine

908
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,620
Because, obviously, this is their department

909
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,720
From PR News in Washington

910
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,620
I'm disturbing

911
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,800
The Justice Department's Inspector General

912
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,140
Has rocked the region

913
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,620
More than 20 U.S. attorneys across the country...

914
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,100
Are vacant and empty

915
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,080
On Wall Street 313-8237

916
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,680
A British court has ruled that this is British PR

917
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,560
But behind

918
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,380
Later this hour, congestion and delays

919
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,260
Morons will address concerns about PR News

920
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:03,400
It sort of brings to mind a fantasy I have about

921
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,100
The next version of cell phone

922
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,760
What would that be like?

923
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,140
Well, that would be a device which

924
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,240
Is constantly transcribing

925
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,160
Everything adheres in text

926
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,860
To a web server

927
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,120
Which may be searched

928
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,240
Well, they might be doing that already

929
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,200
Because...

930
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,700
Well, the idea being that

931
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,800
If you want to talk to someone else now

932
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,840
You have to voluntarily dial them

933
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,480
But in the future, I conceive where

934
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,420
You just say, hey, Bob

935
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,680
I want to talk to you

936
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,000
And they would always be listening

937
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,220
And they would have full video

938
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,780
Well, that would get so, so very hard

939
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,540
To listen to all the time

940
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,780
I mean, you wouldn't even have to call Bob

941
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,340
Because you could see and hear

942
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,460
Everything he was doing

943
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,980
You wouldn't need to communicate with him

944
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,280
Right, well, that works with one person and one person

945
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,880
But what about one person who's friends with ten people?

946
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,780
Or one person who's friends with hundreds of people?

947
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,360
Well, it could work with groups, too

948
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,400
Like, hi, oh my gosh

949
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,000
I can see what Bob's doing and Carl's doing

950
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,980
You get to scan past them

951
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,480
And then when you see something interesting

952
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,760
You can look at that one

953
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,440
Oh, so it's like TV, then?

954
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,560
Yeah

955
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,380
Like having a closed circuit TV

956
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:13,620
And then you can look at that one

957
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,020
TV everywhere

958
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,660
And some lawn equipment

959
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,860
Well, there's a Grim Reaper

960
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,900
Or the International Harvester

961
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,460
Preparing the killdozers for

962
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:29,240
When we inevitably change the Earth

963
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,960
To its original primordial state

964
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:32,660
Indeed

965
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,320
Well, they'll have to do something

966
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,180
With the place for the future tenants

967
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,120
Well, yeah

968
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,740
I mean, that's part of the whole deal, right?

969
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,220
Dues paying?

970
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,180
Get ruptured up?

971
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,700
We terraform back to primordial state

972
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,020
And then we give it to the exes

973
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,900
Right

974
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,440
Right

975
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,480
Brilliant

976
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,400
This writes itself

977
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,160
Has been for the last 20 years

978
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,820
Why change?

979
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,500
I don't even know

980
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,440
Well, I'm happy to sit out here in this heat

981
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,720
To find out

982
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,980
I mean, you know

983
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,860
What becomes

984
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,580
I've been here for the last three years

985
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,260
So I'm waiting for it

986
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,600
And if I have to

987
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,300
I will figure out how to get to it

988
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,520
Well, it's not far

989
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,260
The landing area

990
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,920
Is just down the road a piece

991
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,120
Oh, I didn't know

992
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,800
Been going here three years

993
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,340
And I still don't know where it's at

994
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,160
Don't you get up at seven in the morning

995
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,800
On X-Day

996
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,820
Troop out to the landing field?

997
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:30,360
Well, yeah

998
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,300
But most of the time

999
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,920
I get accosted by squirrels and raccoons and stuff

1000
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,980
Before I even get halfway

1001
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,060
And then I have to turn around

1002
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:36,800
Right

1003
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,080
They're trying

1004
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:38,960
Warning you

1005
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,120
Trying to hold you back

1006
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:57,760
If you ever grow a pend finances

1007
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:57,840
But don't worry

1008
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,000
I can jump in the pants

1009
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,040
So minimally

1010
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:12,580
Oh, oh, oh

1011
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,800
Thank you, Reverend Jimmy Ryan.

1012
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:09,000
Did I hear reference to filtration in the pond?

1013
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,860
They have added a filter, and it does supposedly filter the water.

1014
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,500
This was what was happening last year here.

1015
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:22,040
So I haven't heard about this year, haven't been there so far, but that's what I hear.

1016
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:22,720
Wow.

1017
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,620
That's that.

1018
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:24,940
Progress.

1019
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,060
You could ask a wisteria person.

1020
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:33,320
They would know the latest scuttlebutt on that.

1021
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,140
The native wisterians.

1022
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:35,860
Yes.

1023
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,760
And their mystic knowledge of the clouds.

1024
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,880
The wisteria.

1025
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,220
The wisterians would eagerly tell us what there was to know.

1026
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,080
With their ancient tools.

1027
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:51,240
Otherwise, it may be that they forgot completely about it and haven't even opened up the pond at all,

1028
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:57,020
and that if we went down there, the barbed wire would still be drawn over the entrance,

1029
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:01,920
and the entire thing would have a very unwelcoming, unprepossessing look.

1030
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,080
You never know.

1031
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,180
Well, until you go down.

1032
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,760
So it's Schrodinger's Pond now, then.

1033
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,280
The pond will be in use for the baptism, but after the rupture.

1034
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,000
Of course.

1035
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:15,520
On next day.

1036
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,260
Yes, yes.

1037
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,680
I wonder if old Sequa is still there.

1038
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,680
Oh, guaranteed.

1039
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,020
Supposedly, yes.

1040
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:29,600
There are many snapping turtles in the pond now, and it's been speculated that these are the progeny of old Sequa.

1041
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:38,980
Not the full-grown snapping turtles that they appear to be, but actually the hatchlings of mink.

1042
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,980
Is Sequa.

1043
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,000
Where's Mr. Sequa?

1044
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,440
I've seen them a lot.

1045
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,480
You can see them there.

1046
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,880
They're there, and they're big.

1047
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:53,260
Their head is here, and then the back of the shell is here, and there's some tail following there.

1048
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,720
Those are large snapping turtles.

1049
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,980
So like two and a half feet, three feet long?

1050
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,480
Longer than that with the length of tail.

1051
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,980
The tail extends.

1052
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:06,520
The tail is armored, and it's all armored.

1053
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,460
The shell is armored.

1054
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:13,000
But the one I saw had a sort of a gracile look.

1055
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,120
Maybe it was a female.

1056
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:23,440
Unless it was long, a snapping turtle, if it is inactive, deactivated, you can hold it by the tail,

1057
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:29,600
and it'll reach down to the ground when you hold your arm straight out from you.

1058
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,380
Wow.

1059
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,700
Well, I mean.

1060
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,760
They can get to be 60-pounders and so forth.

1061
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:38,800
But what we're talking about are the recently hatched progeny.

1062
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,560
We have the giant cryptid snapping turtle called Old Sequa.

1063
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,700
Long may she reign.

1064
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,220
Native Americans built the turtle mound out there,

1065
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:55,860
which has been adorned with goofy beach balls for eyes that was never put there by the tribal culture.

1066
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:00,540
Now we have some beef jerky to eat.

1067
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:04,000
Turkey, jerky, beef jerky.

1068
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,120
I understand turtles make excellent soup.

1069
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,760
What astonished me about turtles that I learned fairly recently was that they're quite intelligent.

1070
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,760
That I wouldn't have thought.

1071
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:25,120
But then I saw that YouTube video of the guy in his backyard playing with his pet dog and his turtle,

1072
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,160
and they were playing ball.

1073
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:32,040
And this box turtle is scrambling to push the ball with its head.

1074
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:38,640
It obviously knows what's going on in the realm of play with the dog and is wiggling around pushing the ball

1075
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:38,980
with its head.

1076
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:38,980


1077
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:46,680
Who knew that turtles had a mind which could understand game play and get into the moment

1078
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:53,720
and that a slow reptilian creature would busy itself to hit the ball with its little head,

1079
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,240
with the dog pulling it the other way.

1080
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,220
An incredible video.

1081
00:48:58,620 --> 00:48:59,980
It just takes a trainer that has to...

1082
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:04,040
I expect all animals are more intelligent than we give them credit for being.

1083
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,080
Oh, that's definitely true.

1084
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,180
I recall seeing a video of a turtle.

1085
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,420
Humping a croc shoe.

1086
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:15,440
Well, you know, a lot of the time when you're looking at your turtle or whatever,

1087
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:19,300
you're looking at a captive, a creature that's in jail.

1088
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:23,700
And they evolve pathological methods to deal with captivity.

1089
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,720
Do not judge the species by what some poor prisoner may do.

1090
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,960
I guess it's like the mafia, you know, when you're in jail, whatever you gotta do to get along.

1091
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,740
Well, you could be in rich folks' jail.

1092
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,900
Right, where you'll get out after three months.

1093
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,940
And while you're in there, you have all the recreational opportunities.

1094
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,820
Must be terribly nice.

1095
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,140
You can play high lie, that sort of thing.

1096
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,580
Is that the one where you have to throw the clay ball?

1097
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:01,900
It's where they put the actual wolf of Wall Street.

1098
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,420
High lie is with the big scary hoop thing, isn't it?

1099
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,160
The big scoop.

1100
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:08,720
The scoop.

1101
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:09,240
It's the ball.

1102
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:10,940
Scoop ball.

1103
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,840
The Aztecs invented the vacation.

1104
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,800
It comes from them.

1105
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:25,140
In other parts of Ohio, they're now using drones to drop off things for the prisoners.

1106
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:32,000
It's, of course, not legal, but you never know when a drone is going to come over the jail yard.

1107
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,720
Oh, so it literally just comes into the jail yard and gives them a thing?

1108
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,840
It drops off some.

1109
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:39,500
Contraband.

1110
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,480
Drops off some contraband, yeah.

1111
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,820
It was only a while before they figured that out.

1112
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:56,120
Well, I read that Martin Shkreli, while in jail, was operating a cell phone illegally and making financial transactions and sales.

1113
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,580
I heard the same thing.

1114
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,380
Seems like if they're going to do it, they're going to find a way.

1115
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,400
Or if they want to do it well enough, they're going to find a way.

1116
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,060
They don't seem to be following the...

1117
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,460
The program.

1118
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,860
Yeah, the same coda.

1119
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,600
They're not acting as if they're rehabilitated.

1120
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:21,320
Just continuing along on the same lines, over and over, as if they didn't...

1121
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:21,400
Not at all.

1122
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,600
As if nothing ever happened before.

1123
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,900
We're all prisoners.

1124
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:32,280
It's just the distance between us and the prison walls may be greater in some cases.

1125
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:37,020
But all prisoners shall be released, we believe.

1126
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,100
We should believe.

1127
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,400
Or do we?

1128
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:41,880
Should we?

1129
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,260
With subgeniuses, the only ones we worry about.

1130
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,660
We don't want everybody, we just want the subgeniuses.

1131
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,280
Only the ones with the maxed craziness.

1132
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:57,400
Personality contact?

1133
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,400
The ones who can be tolerated.

1134
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,580
Who are tolerable, who will tolerate you.

1135
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:07,660
And who are the best for genetic experimentation, of course.

1136
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:14,600
From PR News in Washington, I'm a turkey without explanation.

1137
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,100
Trump said turkeys are not good.

1138
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,020
President Trump left one turkey dead last summer.

1139
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:21,940
Just last week.

1140
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,040
Trump's 4% unfair and 1% unjust for turkeys.

1141
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,780
Surprise attack near the fighting.

1142
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,960
But the attack suggests fighting.

1143
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,640
President Trump accused the governor of Virginia of using turkeys as human shields.

1144
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,880
A federal judge in San...

1145
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:42,600
Francisco is deciding whether this is PR News in Washington.

1146
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,940
Thank you, Mr. Lemur.

1147
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,680
And now, The Psychoskeletons.

1148
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,680
Music Playing

1149
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:56,060
Music Playing

1150
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,300
Music Playing

1151
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,440
Music Playing

1152
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,220
Music Playing

1153
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:01,880
Music Playing

1154
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:02,780
Music Playing

1155
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,560
Music Playing

1156
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:08,960
Music Playing

1157
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,300
I don't know.

1158
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,020
Thank you.

1159
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:15,000
Thank you.

1160
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:42,920
Thank you.

1161
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,880
Thank you.

1162
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,440
Thank you.

1163
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,220
Thank you, skeletons.

1164
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,400
Psycho, that is.

1165
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:03,620
The psycho skeletons.

1166
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:08,740
And friends, you can learn more information about this show,

1167
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,000
the Church of the Subgenius, and the strange bands and music we play,

1168
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,140
at subgenius.com.

1169
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:27,540
Or, prisoners may write to P.O. Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1170
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,600
And aren't we all prisoners in one way or another,

1171
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,620
either of the conspiracy or of Bob?

1172
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,500
And here is Stang once again.

1173
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,940
Well, we have Cossack.

1174
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,200
Cossack's you guys should go feast and drink in celebration

1175
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,620
because Nigel and Joy are here.

1176
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,120
Woo!

1177
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,080
Oh, yes.

1178
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:46,560
That's not X Day without them.

1179
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,620
That's wonderful, isn't it?

1180
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:49,480
Well, there's been some without them,

1181
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:52,580
but they were Nigel-less and Joy-less.

1182
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,140
Yes.

1183
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:53,940
X Days.

1184
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,660
Now we are infinitely better off.

1185
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,760
They've launched many, many fake saucers.

1186
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,860
They've fooled Mr. Sister.

1187
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,340
What's to eat, then?

1188
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,600
Are we having?

1189
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,340
Um, tornadoes of beef.

1190
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,420
And some fondue to go with that?

1191
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:18,820
I pointed out to them the two new people that are in the room now.

1192
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,780
There's one other one that wandered off.

1193
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,160
And they're actually not necessarily new.

1194
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,760
A couple of those guys were here last year, but I wasn't.

1195
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,100
No.

1196
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,540
No, I missed the next day.

1197
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,460
And we were sad.

1198
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,900
We were sad to see that you couldn't make it.

1199
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:34,780
Oh, God.

1200
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,380
We all understood.

1201
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,500
It had a certain inertia.

1202
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:38,940
I'll tell you this.

1203
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:38,940


1204
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:38,940


1205
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:38,940


1206
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:38,940


1207
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:38,940


1208
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:38,940


1209
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:38,940


1210
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:48,540
something really ironic and kind of sad. As I later put all this together, if you look

1211
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:53,720
at the list of people who actually signed in last year, there's really only 34 of them.

1212
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,580
Now, there were some I know were here who didn't sign in, but 34 people.

1213
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,760
That number seems low.

1214
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:07,600
On July 5th last year, the exes had taken my niece to the saucers, and there

1215
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:20,720
was a wake at my house. It had 35 people were at my niece's wake, and 34 were at Ex Day.

1216
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,240
This was on Ex Day?

1217
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:30,500
Yeah, on July 5th, the year the conspiracy calls 2018. Yeah, right.

1218
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,840
Yeah, not 98 yet, though.

1219
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:36,760
No. And yeah, that was sad.

1220
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:37,380
I preach.

1221
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:37,580
I preach.

1222
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:44,920
But what I basically said was, it's so sad, on this fireplace mantel behind me,

1223
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:48,060
this is my family in Texas, I'm speaking normally.

1224
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:48,580
Right.

1225
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:56,660
So, on this fireplace behind me, we normally have 19 stockings at Christmas, or Exes-less-mas,

1226
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:07,480
and we've lost two. There's only going to be 17 stockings this year. I said, we got to replace our

1227
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:12,500
numbers. There need to always be 19 stockings. So, I looked at my two grandsons who are

1228
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:17,660
eight and 10 years old. I said, that means you boys got to get to work.

1229
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:20,040
Put that responsibility right where it belongs.

1230
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:25,380
Yeah. I said, no hurry. You don't have to start now. They look kind of relieved, you know.

1231
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:35,080
And actually, I think since then, two of my other nephews and nieces, well, my daughter got pregnant,

1232
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,400
delivered a third grandson.

1233
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,400
Yeah.

1234
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:37,780
There you go.

1235
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:44,560
The snake-killing nephew's wife is going to deliver in September. So, we're going to have 19

1236
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,420
stockings on Exes-less-mas.

1237
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,940
Okay. There you go.

1238
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:55,080
At Stang Ranch. So, the youngsters are doing their job to make new little subgeniuses.

1239
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:59,900
Well, on that hopeful note, perhaps we should conclude this broadcast and

1240
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:06,240
remark that there is a generation coming into being who may be the

1241
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,380
salvation of the world.

1242
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:07,640
Yes.

1243
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:07,640


1244
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,840
The Stang DNA continues.

1245
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:10,660
Yes.

1246
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:11,880
Short version.

1247
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,480
Into the universe. And why? Without knowing.

1248
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:16,860
So, yeah.

1249
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,980
Because Bob told us to. That's why.

1250
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,660
Okay. We are all dismissed.

1251
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:26,680
Hallelujah gobble.

1252
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:32,500
That means there's room for the youths with their loud guitars to come here and...

1253
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:37,000
Yes. I don't see them, but if they wish to come up and give us that...

1254
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,260
I'm sure they're having a real ex-day party over in Newtown down the road.

1255
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,960
Well, I haven't heard anything from the stage, but then there are other sounds which

1256
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,320
might be muffling.

1257
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:52,240
Oh, they're back in the orgy woods where we're not allowed. It's like, no,

1258
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,060
you have to be this young to enter here.

1259
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,540
And no electric guitars playing?

1260
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:02,420
Oh, there probably are. It's just drowned out by the moaning and groaning of all the

1261
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:06,040
sex they're having. They don't tell us about.

1262
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:06,980
Mm-hmm. Well, then there's a...

1263
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,320
I mean, I think we're going to have to get rid of the terrible, terrible acoustics then.

1264
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,360
Yeah.

1265
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,560
Because guitars should be able to wail much louder than people. Just probably.

1266
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:20,860
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Slack. Okay. Okay. Slack. Slack.

1267
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:21,340
Slag on.

1268
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:24,360
Slag on. Slag on. Slag on. Slag on. Slag on. Slag on. Slag on.

1269
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:30,180
But you'll be less of a conspiracy dupe if you contribute to poor old lonesome cowboy

1270
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:36,760
Dave's GoFundMe. He really needs help. Look at the radio section of subgenius.com. There's a link to it.

1271
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:40,520
Because it's too complicated to read on the air.

1272
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:42,820
Thank you.

1273
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:51,480
Oh, I almost forgot. It's Slack Friday all the way through Christmas. From November 30th, which is

1274
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:59,480
over with now, all the way to Existlessnessmas, December 24th or so, you can get two subgenius

1275
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:06,100
memberships for the price of one. Yes. Two for one sale. Slack Friday. Only 35 bucks.

1276
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:13,220
Plus postage and it's a little more postage for two of them and you can ordain yourself and a loved

1277
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:22,280
one or a pet or someone you really hate. Or you can deny a membership to someone you really hate

1278
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:26,340
by buying it and then not giving it to them, giving it to somebody you like.

1279
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:33,840
Seriously. It's our annual sale and it's going on and people are taking advantage of it. It's funny

1280
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,200
how they.

1281
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,340
They wait for that special.

1282
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:46,300
deal before they spend their precious $35 on J.R. Bob Dobbs and the church that saved them,

1283
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:53,360
or at least saved their sanity, or at least saved some of the money they spent.

1284
01:02:54,680 --> 01:03:04,620
Praise Bob. And friends, have you tried Triology Soaps yet from TriologySoaps.com?

1285
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:13,260
They have Dobbs bars. Yes, I'm serious. Triology Soaps, run by our friend Lord Ferg,

1286
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:23,540
manufactures bars of scented soap with Dobbs heads made of other soap embedded in the

1287
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:32,560
translucence. It's like a translucent, in this case, a green bar of soap. You can kind of see

1288
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,000
through, and there's a brown,

1289
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:43,060
silhouette Dobbs head inside that is gradually freed as you clean yourself. As none other than

1290
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:49,760
Reverend Ivan Stang said, these are the good stank, and they are. Princess Wee and I have been

1291
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:57,220
using many of their different scents and flavors. These specially blessed soaps might not keep the

1292
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:04,300
conspiracy completely at bay, but at least you'll be smelling fine. These are handmade soaps,

1293
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:13,200
and they do indeed stank, and they have names like New Time Bobber Shop at Dobbs Bar,

1294
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:22,300
FrankenBob Dobbs Bar. If only Boris Karloff could smell this bar, we think he'd enjoy it.

1295
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:30,540
Connie's Suckle Honey Dobbs Bar, Cosmax Select Cedarwood with activated charcoal.

1296
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:34,140
These are all about $6.50 a bar.

1297
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:45,400
Dr. Philo's Frop Brownie 4 oz. Dobbs Bar. St. Joyce's Jasmine Frop Blend. Orange Rose Peony for Wee

1298
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:53,280
Ma Ma. I hadn't seen that one. Wee Ma Ma is my mother-in-law. Fidjuli Dobbs Bar with sorbitol,

1299
01:04:53,340 --> 01:05:03,920

1300
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:11,200
Dobbs Bar. And so forth. And you can see the Triology Soaps catalog, which also includes

1301
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:18,820
t-shirts and unique designs and many other soaps besides Dobbs Bars. Those are at

1302
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:33,460
triologiesoaps.com. One word. Triology is spelled T-R-I-O-L-O-G-Y. So it's tri as in three instead of

1303
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:45,580
as in try as you may. T-R-I-O-L-O-G-Y. Triologiesoaps.com. Praise Ferg.
