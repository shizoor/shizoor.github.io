1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
Ah, the one that's not real.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,120
That's the one you must listen to, darling.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,360
Now, just come over here and sit on my lap.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,220
But it doesn't really make noise.

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,100
I know my knee looks a little strange.

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,740
It only makes noise when I turn the pages or when I close it or open it.

7
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,800
I had a few additions made.

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,000
What now? What did you say?

9
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,580
It only makes noise when I open it or close it.

10
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,420
It doesn't make noise.

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,700
And, like, talk to me like I thought you meant when you said that.

12
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, we'll try and close it and open it very gently.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,420
Wrap it around your head and listen real carefully to the printed letters on that book.

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,960
The Bible is a beautiful story, but this book is even better.

15
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,980
The Bible is a beautiful story, but this book is even better.

16
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,260
Humans, on the other hand, don't have to.

17
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,840
We have a choice.

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,740
If you don't like your place in the world, you can get off anytime you want.

19
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:37,820
Suicide.

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,880
That's right.

21
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,940
If you don't like the way your life's going, you don't like the way you are in the world,

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,620
anything around you, you can check out anytime you like.

23
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,100
Animals aren't allowed that thought.

24
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,980
And believe me, if they were,

25
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,520
I would use it.

26
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:05,280
There'd be a lot of dogs and cats owned by assholes who live in high-rises diving out the windows.

27
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,820
Zebras, if they even had remotely that thought, would take a look at themselves and go,

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,180
what the fuck?

29
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,640
Black and white, the green and brown world.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,900
Now, this blows.

31
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,840
I'm just going to jump in the river.

32
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,420
I don't have a thumb to work a gun or hold a knife.

33
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,040
Or even open up a jar of pills.

34
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,260
I'm just going to dive into the next lion's mouth.

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,780
Why even bother?

36
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,800
Now, monkeys have the opposable thumb, so they could kind of do it the exact same way we do.

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,660
Now, there's a bunch of people that say, oh, it's against the law.

38
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,680
Well, it's only against the law if you do a crappy job and you get caught.

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,460
Other people say, oh, we should save them.

40
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,780
Yeah, well, you know what?

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,000
Not everybody wants to be saved.

42
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,040
Not everybody should be saved.

43
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,640
And who are we to force our will upon them?

44
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,440
I mean, isn't that one of the joys about being a human?

45
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,060
Freedom of choice?

46
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,140
Now, it's not all bad.

47
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,600
Now, I'm not saying kill yourself.

48
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,340
But if you're going to be an idiot,

49
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,380
and do it anyway,

50
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,240
there's no sweat off of my back.

51
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,300
There's a lot of good that could come from it.

52
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,480
A little bit of bad thrown in.

53
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,000
Some of the things?

54
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,580
A job will open.

55
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,140
An apartment will become available.

56
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,940
There'll be more air for me.

57
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,920
They say there's two girls for every guy.

58
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,720
If you're a man, there'll be four chicks for me.

59
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,380
There'll be more cats.

60
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,520
The cattle won vodka for me.

61
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,960
There'll be one less idiot in line at the bank

62
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,940
who gets up to the window without their fucking slips filled out.

63
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,560
I won't ever have to go to the store

64
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,780
to buy my favorite salt and vinegar chips

65
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,560
and have the clerk point to you and say,

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,300
they bought the last bag.

67
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,580
You won't help change the McDonald's sign

68
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,220
to 100 billion served.

69
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,080
You'll never get AIDS.

70
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,080
You won't have to worry about calories ever.

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,600
No more, hey, does this make me look fat?

72
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,060
No more, hey, does this make me look fat?

73
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,600
There'll be one less polluting human.

74
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,360
You won't have to recycle.

75
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,620
There'll be one less car on the road.

76
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,920
There'll be more ring things for me.

77
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,100
50 or so chickens' lives will be spared.

78
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,880
Your fingers won't ever get red from eating pistachios.

79
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,100
You won't be forced to visit your grandparents on Sundays anymore.

80
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,100
No more church.

81
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,180
You'll be saying, hey world, kiss my ass.

82
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,900
No more wet dreams about supermodels.

83
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,320
No more Barry Manilow.

84
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,220
For a few years, anyway.

85
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,560
Wondering, am I a loser?

86
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,960
Will be a thing of the past.

87
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,700
Say goodbye to crappy Xmas presents from aunts and uncles.

88
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,360
You won't have to suffer through a motley crew reunion.

89
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,640
Fuck flossing and brushing.

90
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,880
You'll never lose sleep over a pregnancy scare.

91
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,540
Adios, acne.

92
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,240
Worrying whether you fit in or not won't be on your brain.

93
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,360
Adios.

94
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


95
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


96
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


97
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


98
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


99
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


100
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


101
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


102
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


103
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


104
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


105
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


106
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


107
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


108
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


109
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,360


110
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:23,880
See you later, homework.

111
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,300
You'll never have to sit through another movie brought to you by the creators of South Park.

112
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,200
School's out forever.

113
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,080
No more paying bills.

114
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,940
You won't have to do chores.

115
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,540
You won't be able to run over toads with a lawnmower, though.

116
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,080
You'll also miss McDonald's french fries.

117
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,340
Bugs Bunny.

118
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,280
The amazing electrifying feeling that surges through your body when you kiss someone for the first time.

119
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,120
You won't be able to watch the letterbox director's cut of Jaws.

120
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,200
Candy.

121
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,940
Living above ground.

122
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,080
Pudding crust.

123
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,040
You'll miss the rush of getting your first apartment.

124
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,800
Getting to the point in your life where you can tell your parents to fuck off.

125
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,360
I gotta make my own mistakes.

126
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,100
You did.

127
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,480
You'll miss sex.

128
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,760
You'll miss thinking about it, looking for it.

129
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,560
Sex by yourself.

130
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,780
Sex with a partner.

131
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,140
Sex with multiple partners.

132
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,720
No more summer nights that seem to go on forever.

133
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,840
Rollercoasters.

134
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,280
Naming your kid the name you always wanted.

135
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,860
Making a difference in the world.

136
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,360
You'll miss the experience and pleasure of hallucinations.

137
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,800
Watching your neighbor's wife change clothes with her blinds open.

138
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,780
A lifetime of masturbating.

139
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,960
Watching your favorite team sweep the series.

140
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,460
Music.

141
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,000
You will definitely miss music.

142
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,580
Trying to sneak into your house drunk three hours past your curfew.

143
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,640
You'll miss the blazing glory of the Fourth of July fireworks.

144
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,220
The taste of Captain Crunch.

145
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,040
If you're a boy, you'll miss the feeling the first time you reach up a girl's shirt.

146
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,560
If you're a girl, the feeling the first time you reach down a boy's pants.

147
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,020
You'll miss your favorite coat.

148
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,920
Waffles with whipped cream and strawberries.

149
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,340
Beating your friends' asses.

150
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,060
At video games.

151
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,540
You won't be around to see what shape and color the new marshmallow and Lucky Charms will be.

152
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,980
You'll miss the feeling you'll get when reminiscing about your first love 30 years after the fact.

153
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,320
The joy of giving and receiving at Christmas.

154
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,340
Skinny dipping.

155
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,640
Getting stoned.

156
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,840
Reading Green Eggs and Ham.

157
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,280
And eating like a horse that got loose in the grain bin.

158
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,360
Flying cars.

159
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,140
Hey, you were born.

160
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,500
Finish what was started.

161
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,640
The guy who slagged the football team.

162
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,940
Those jobs were not for him.

163
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,460
He turns into a real estate agent who believes in discipline.

164
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,000
The guy who's first to use cocaine.

165
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,480
The wild boy breaking free.

166
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,060
He'll end up in a corner lawn as a prosecuting QC.

167
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,840
Remember the school captain?

168
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,860
Success was a matter of time.

169
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,160
I can hear her now as she screams,

170
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,760
Greg, you missed the stop sign.

171
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,620
Forget Snoop Doggy Dog.

172
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,120
Forget Old Ice-T.

173
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,600
The true world out on the streets is produced by the DAC.

174
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,680
What's the use of striving?

175
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,840
Life's road in front unravels.

176
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,580
We get to do the driving.

177
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,380
Don't choose the direction we travel.

178
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,680
Do your homework and wait for weeks.

179
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,900
Completely the damn, not lying.

180
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,320
It don't matter much when you hear that scream.

181
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,140
Greg, you missed the stop sign.

182
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,720
Greg, the stop sign.

183
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,340
Greg, the stop sign.

184
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,020
Greg, the stop sign.

185
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,720
Greg, the stop sign.

186
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,760
Sometime in the next 10,000 years,

187
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,800
a comet's gonna wipe out old Tracer Manor.

188
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,480
Banking on it, coming before my end of year exams.

189
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,800
The rich kid becomes a junkie.

190
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,640
The poor kid an advertiser.

191
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,380
What a tragic waste of potential.

192
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,440
Being a junkie's not so good either.

193
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,340
Your folks weren't down for what you got.

194
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,900
You were the fruit of their vibe.

195
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,200
Who cares what you sow and what you reap?

196
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,120
It's Greg, you missed the stop sign.

197
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,280
Just staying humble.

198
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,720
Who cares what you sow and what you reap?

199
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,520
Don't

200
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:18,680
And

201
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,860
But

202
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,740
That was an easy unreasonable honk.

203
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,400
Just the other day

204
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,180
Man, could that baby run?

205
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,780
But you know what they always say

206
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,520
There's always a better one

207
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,220
Got a tumor in my brain

208
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,020
It's creeping to my lungs

209
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,560
And I'm searched around in vain

210
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,340
Can't find me a better one

211
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,940
I'm lying into everyone's head

212
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,280
It's the best they're gonna be

213
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,660
Growing up's not a matter of choice

214
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,980
It's a matter of wait and see

215
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,360
So kids, yeah, you can do it

216
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,780
You can be your best

217
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,640
Girls can do anything

218
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,400
You can pass the test

219
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,700
I'm okay, you're okay

220
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,140
We're okay, we're fine

221
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,420
I thought I heard a semi-trailer

222
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,540
Playing your business, stop fighting

223
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,840
Break the stock soon

224
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,320
Break the stock soon

225
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,080
Break the stock soon

226
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,780
Break the stock soon

227
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,860
Break the stock soon

228
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,220
Break the stock soon

229
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,100
Break the stock soon

230
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,520
Break the stock soon

231
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:48,320
Break the stock soon

232
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,660
Thank you.

233
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,960
The thousandth and tenth day of the human totem pole.

234
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:34,620
The morning was December gray of the thousandth and tenth day of the human totem pole.

235
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,860
The man at the bottom was smiling.

236
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,720
He had just finished his breakfast smiling.

237
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,120
He had just finished his breakfast smiling.

238
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,160
It hadn't rained or manured for over two hours.

239
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,020
The man at the top was starving.

240
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,900
The pole was a horrible looking thing.

241
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,480
With all of those eyes and ears and waving hands for balance.

242
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,860
There was no way to get a copter in close.

243
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,940
So everybody was starving together.

244
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,200
The man at the top had long ago given up.

245
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,100
But didn't have nerve enough to climb down.

246
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,800
At night the pole would talk to itself.

247
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,740
And the chatter wasn't too good.

248
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,400
Obviously the pole didn't like itself.

249
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,480
It wanted to walk.

250
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,000
It was the summer and it was hot.

251
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,700
And balance wouldn't permit a skinning to undergarments.

252
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,240
It was an integrated pole.

253
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,260
It was taking on a reddish brown.

254
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,560
It was a little bit of a

255
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,120
It was a little bit of a

256
00:12:50,120 --> 00:13:01,480
It was a gurgling and googling herd.

257
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,360
A tenth of the way up the pole.

258
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,440
Approaching was a small child with Statue of Liberty doll.

259
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,100
And a little more than that.

260
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,460
Crouching tall.

261
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,460


262
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,460


263
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,460


264
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,460


265
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,460


266
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,880
Astounding! Captain Beefheart there and the Magic Band.

267
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:09,580
The 1010th day of the human totem pole from the album Ice Cream for Crow.

268
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:20,080
Before that, friends, that song Greg the Stop Sign is by a British group called This Is Serious Mum.

269
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,620
That's the name of the group, This Is Serious Mum.

270
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:32,240
And you can get more information about them from www.tism.

271
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,580
That's short for This Is Serious Mum.

272
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,740
www.tism.com

273
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,060
www.wanker.com

274
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,740
www.tism.wanker.com

275
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,880
And friends, before that, that incredible song about suicide and why and why not

276
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,860
is by a comedian named Bobby Gaylord.

277
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,780
Dr. Lagune sent me a copy of that.

278
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,160
It's from an album called Fuzzatonic Scream.

279
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,120
And you can check out bobbygaylord.com

280
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,620
That's spelled G-A-Y-L-O-R.

281
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,960
Bobby Gaylord.

282
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,300
Just amazing.

283
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:21,760
And it helps set the theme of anti-slack as it is taken away from us.

284
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,820
And somehow it always returns back to slack.

285
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,100
Friends, yes, slack.

286
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:39,060
And for more slack, we're going to go back in time to the old subgenius media barrage number 11.

287
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,820
Once a tape, and now a CD.

288
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,820
We're remastering it.

289
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,100
Made from tapes created in the early 1980s.

290
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,560
And friends, after that, I don't know what we're going to play.

291
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,840
I ain't going to make any decisions right now.

292
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:01,600
This music by Tipsy in the background from their album Uh-Oh.

293
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,980
It just makes me want to slack off.

294
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,460
I'm going to duck the responsibility.

295
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,800
Dear friends.

296
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,360
As Aleister Crowley once said, if I can't be God, I'm not going to play.

297
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,180
This ain't no video game church.

298
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,620
It ain't no church of bingo.

299
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,980
It's a church of Bob.

300
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,700
It's a Bob Rice's church.

301
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,900
I don't see what the hell's going on here.

302
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,680
What the hell?

303
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,160
Did you know that heaven, Christian heaven is hotter than the Christian hell?

304
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,380
Yes, the Christian heaven is hotter.

305
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,880
That's because there are seven sons.

306
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,020
That's genius hell is fun.

307
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,100
Oh yeah, all your friends will be down there.

308
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,440
No.

309
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,360
There's seven sons.

310
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,100
There's seven sons around the Christian hell.

311
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,100


312
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,980
This is true.

313
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,520
You can find it in their own Bible.

314
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,100
They admit it.

315
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:47,420
And seven sons would make it much hotter than the gaseous molten threshold of brimstone.

316
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,640
That means that heaven is hotter than hell.

317
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,440
They've been lying to you all this time.

318
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,200
Well, that ain't the only thing they lie about, friends.

319
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,540
They lie that the world isn't coming to an end right away in 15 years.

320
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,520
Of course it's coming to an end in 15 years.

321
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,160
It can't last any longer.

322
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,840
It wasn't built to last.

323
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,180
It wasn't meant to last.

324
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:04,980
It's inferior.

325
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,500
It's a Spartan universe.

326
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,100
The cultists say it's a Spartan universe.

327
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,380
It's full of superstition and mysticism.

328
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,100
We're scientists.

329
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,440
The way that we want is what we become.

330
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,640
So please pay attention while I show you some of what's about to happen.

331
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,040
So play your cards right.

332
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,760
And now, here are my predictions.

333
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,020
Listen.

334
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,760
Listen carefully.

335
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,580
Join me in knowing the headlines of tomorrow today.

336
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:39,100
I predict public executions will be shown on television sponsored by your local Gatwick.

337
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,500
I predict the future will be filled with good things for you and yours.

338
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,900
I've got to believe.

339
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,560
Two months ago, the observatory issued a press statement that the world was coming to an end.

340
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,740
Now, that's the same story the cult of the Book of Revelations had been preaching.

341
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,980
Now, when a scientist backs that up, it's news.

342
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,920
Our conclusions have nothing to do with the cult.

343
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,760
Well, today we deal with Bible prophecy.

344
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,080
But the Word of God tells us we can expect nothing but trouble and trouble.

345
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,480
And we can expect nothing but turmoil in the Middle East until our Lord returns to be the Prince of Peace.

346
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,620
Bob?

347
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,080
It's been known for some time that the fossil record contains several very pronounced mass extinctions,

348
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:30,620
when large numbers of quite unrelated species from all kinds of habitats appear to die out during a relatively short period.

349
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:39,060
You have, say, an asteroid about 10 kilometers across impacting on the Earth at a speed of about 40 kilometers a second.

350
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,020
Did you hear what he was saying?

351
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,780
Did you hear what he was saying?

352
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,500
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

353
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,820
Perhaps in the form of an atomic holocaust?

354
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,940
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand.

355
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,000
The White House will confirm an order to use the atom bomb.

356
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,500
And our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.

357
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,400
Those missiles have all gone off.

358
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,180
They pushed all the buttons!

359
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,960
You know what that means, don't you?

360
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,800
Either we fired first and they're gonna try to hit what's left,

361
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,900
or they fired first and we just got our missiles out of the ground in time.

362
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,120
Either way, we're gonna get hit.

363
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,960
So what are we still standing around here for?

364
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,940
Of course, since all human life has been under the surface of Earth for 16 years,

365
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,560
there was no actual loss of life in the sense we know it.

366
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,620
What you say you're what you get?

367
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,260
What the hell do you expect?

368
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,860
Richie Redrose.

369
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,020
White puppy noses.

370
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,880
Mammoth proper hoses is more like it!

371
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,040
Oh!

372
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,900
The strange worshippers pull at their faces.

373
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,820
Despite himself, a strangled cry escapes Brent,

374
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,760
as he sees the ghastly heritage of atomic radiation.

375
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,520
Hey, Tony, let's have some.

376
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,660
Get me outta here!

377
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,720
I mean, hell, this turn, the other cheap thing could be carried a bit too far, you know.

378
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:06,840
I'm sorry.

379
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,640
Hey, neighbor, let me give you some advice.

380
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,340
The Russians are about to pulverize us if I sleep tonight.

381
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,280
That is, if the crazy Arabs on the right don't get us first,

382
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,440
and the fire will rain down from the sky, the fire will rain down from the sky.

383
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,980
People die, people die, people die, people die.

384
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,220
The gurgle of a death rattle.

385
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,240
The awful heat.

386
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,280
And I couldn't see.

387
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,200
The smell.

388
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,760
The terrible rotten smell of burning flesh.

389
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,020
Help me, please.

390
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,520
Here comes Bob!

391
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,760
Yeah!

392
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,040
Get him, Bob, you son of a bitch!

393
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,380
We've got nothing left!

394
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,140
Why did we come all this way?

395
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,220
Why did we come all this way?

396
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,640
Why did we come all this way?

397
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,460
But the trouble is that all this knowledge I've got hold of is useless.

398
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,060
We're going to come back in just a moment.

399
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,360
We're going to have some strong comments about this, and we're going to continue with this.

400
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,180
It's no wonder one group of kids said we're the generation that's been born under the mushroom cloud.

401
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:29,220
Ah, here on the subgenius death ship, we approach San Francisco.

402
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,680
Our mission? Destroy anything.

403
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,340
Somebody help. Help me, please.

404
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,820
Has this ever happened to you?

405
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,660
Meltdown.

406
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,080
Please remove all humans from container area six.

407
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:43,940
Be really...

408
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,180
Doug, pull over! We've got to scrape the collar off the front of the show!

409
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,120
If we have another collar...

410
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,940
The show could overheat.

411
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,240
If we get another collar on the front of this show smeared like that last one, we're going to be in severe heat damage.

412
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,140
Well, I don't think we should drive the show so fast.

413
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,740
Well, you're right.

414
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,340
It's just stupid to keep wasting fuel running over listeners like this.

415
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,700
There is no collar.

416
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,620
There never has been a collar.

417
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,400
Radio is all a tape.

418
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,020
All the collars are gone.

419
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,080
The show was just a tape.

420
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,580
Yes.

421
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,700
Launching a probe into the...

422
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,720
This joke has been real.

423
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,960
Well, but they did survive, and they're willing to give us their wristwatches and most of their...

424
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,100
That's what I mean.

425
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,880
Imagine listening to this show and surviving.

426
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,560
That's what I mean.

427
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,220
Unfortunate. Yes, it was.

428
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,080
We do have some...

429
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,800
But the doctors were still here.

430
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,940
Good morning, tiny collar.

431
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,500
Don't drive any faster.

432
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,480
Yes, well, it would have been nice to hear your message, but at this hour, we're asking all messages.

433
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,340
Ten minutes left to...

434
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:30,740
Ten minutes.

435
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,360
Rotate your message toward the war and off the planet.

436
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,180
So aim high with us.

437
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,320
To find out more, all you have to do is speak with your nearest Air Force recruiter.

438
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,780
Ah, that's more like it.

439
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,540
We're all in the Air Force now.

440
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,920
We're all heading toward Grenada.

441
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,060
Los Angeles approach control.

442
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,060
No, no, wait.

443
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,940
We're over Los Angeles.

444
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,200
Don't drop the bomb now.

445
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:48,980
No, look at her.

446
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,420
It's too late.

447
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:49,840
.

448
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,420
Holy cow, that's LA Stadium down there.

449
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,200
.

450
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,820
Oh, this is awful.

451
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,300
What are we going to tell the newspapers?

452
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,760
I have no interest in anything but it's exploding bright.

453
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,800
They're congratulating us.

454
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,780
They're congratulating us.

455
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,460
Look at that beautiful bomb pattern.

456
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,980
That's half the Olympics taken out in one final sweep of some genius terrorist.

457
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,360
I'd say that was one of the most beautiful patterns I've seen in the performance so far.

458
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,480
I think that'll get a nine for most of the judges, don't you?

459
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,800
Down there on the floor.

460
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,920
That was a flawless performance on that 9th explosion.

461
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,800
The Olympic nuclear explosion competition has been...

462
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,240
It's been a fierce and competitive one with some unexpected contributors.

463
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,200
Yes, the LA Olympics this year.

464
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:35,880
In smaller countries.

465
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,840
But this is...

466
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,780
I'm glad I got my tickets there.

467
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,540
You know what?

468
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,980
I've even bought a spare ticket for my Cabbage Patch doll.

469
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,800
Well, I hope you left that Cabbage Patch doll at the door.

470
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,640
The baby's back.

471
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,560
There's no place in the future.

472
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,860
Because you know they said some of them have a mind of their own.

473
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,560
The makes of the rich have packed back.

474
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,960
But silence did not follow.

475
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,760
The awful heat.

476
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,400
.

477
00:23:59,380 --> 00:23:59,780
.

478
00:23:59,780 --> 00:23:59,780


479
00:23:59,780 --> 00:23:59,780


480
00:23:59,780 --> 00:23:59,780


481
00:23:59,780 --> 00:23:59,780


482
00:23:59,780 --> 00:23:59,780


483
00:23:59,780 --> 00:23:59,780


484
00:23:59,780 --> 00:23:59,780


485
00:23:59,780 --> 00:23:59,780


486
00:23:59,780 --> 00:23:59,780


487
00:23:59,780 --> 00:23:59,780


488
00:23:59,780 --> 00:23:59,780


489
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:29,800


490
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:59,800


491
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,740
I'm sorry, but you see, it is my curse to tell the absolute truth.

492
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,060
.

493
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,060


494
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,220
.

495
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:16,440
.

496
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,060
.

497
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,120
.

498
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,160
.

499
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,440
.

500
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:18,540
.

501
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:18,640
.

502
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,680
.

503
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:22,800
.

504
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:22,800


505
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:22,960
.

506
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:22,980
.

507
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,060
.

508
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,060


509
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,060


510
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,220
.

511
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:23,220


512
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:23,220


513
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:23,280
.

514
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,300
.

515
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,320
.

516
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:31,840
.

517
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:42,500
.

518
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:42,580
.

519
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,580


520
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,600
.

521
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:42,620
.

522
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:42,640
.

523
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:42,660
.

524
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:42,680
.

525
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:42,700
.

526
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:46,800
.

527
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:46,900
.

528
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:46,940
.

529
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:48,900
.

530
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:48,900


531
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:48,940
.

532
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:48,940


533
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,020
.

534
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,020


535
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,060
.

536
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,100
.

537
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,140
.

538
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,140


539
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:49,740
.

540
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:49,740


541
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:49,740


542
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:49,740


543
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,520
Darkness and despair, gloom, chaos, anarchy.

544
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:05,100
A hopeless culture, self-indulgent, into evil perverseness.

545
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,880
It's like Jones told me that one time.

546
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,120
He said, if you can't X that tractor out of your ass,

547
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,960
you don't ever get to heaven.

548
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,660
Oh, darkness, gloom, destruction, despair, poverty, and other bad shit.

549
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,560
I fall like a dead man from the canyons of my mind.

550
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,300
In the canyons of your mind.

551
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,440
In the canyons of your mind.

552
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,060
In the canyons of your mind.

553
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,960
In the canyons of your mind.

554
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:55,000
They're like those wagon wheel wraps on the bottom of the canyon in your mind.

555
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,980
They're like those tiny little turd things

556
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:06,920
in the bottom of the rocks in the canyons of your mind.

557
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,740
Now these aren't just little valleys.

558
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,500
They're not just little grooves or ditches in the earth.

559
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,320
No, no, no, no.

560
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,800
But they're canyons!

561
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:30,040
Mighty sized deep wide canyons.

562
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,560
Ah yes, the swingin' love corpses with that lovely lilting tune.

563
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,920
Canyons of my mind.

564
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,480
Or I should say falling like a dead man through the canyons of my mind.

565
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,940
The swingin' love corpses.

566
00:27:50,140 --> 00:28:02,060
And before that, KPFA Berkeley radio with Palmer Vreede's Gary the Brogue friend and Puzzling Evidence Doug Wellman with Glass Madness singing.

567
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:11,060
And all of that friends and the collage material before that was all from the old subgenius Media Barrage number 11.

568
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:16,640
Edited by yours truly with Saint Byron Werner and Doug Wellman.

569
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,600
Puzzling Evidence friends.

570
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,020
There was also a lot of Devo and Oingo Boingo clips in there cause it was the 80s.

571
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,600
Now it's the 80s.

572
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:37,140
And as the old pass on and pass out in the fields of Asgard, the uppity youngsters come along.

573
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,380
Such as Reverend Alex Thompson, age 14.

574
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,720
In fact, we're going to listen to Reverend Thompson's first sermon.

575
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,200
In public anyway.

576
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,680
Recorded live at the 4X Day Drill 2001.

577
00:28:53,560 --> 00:29:01,160
And after that we'll hear a nice piece of Connie from Reverend Protectrix Amazonia.

578
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,380
But now friends, Reverend Alex Thompson, age 14.

579
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:15,760
Whenever I introduce an unsaved friend to the church of the subgenius, they'll read the pamphlet number one.

580
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,160
And they'll read the pamphlet number two.

581
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:30,560
And they'll read through the long, long paragraphs of confusing and arcane text typed up by Stang and Drummond so, so very long ago.

582
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,520
Oh, they'll read through it as they'll say, ah, this is what it is.

583
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,260
This is what it is.

584
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,060
This is so bizarre and off the wall.

585
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,160
But what about Bob?

586
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,320
What about him?

587
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,660
He looks just about as strange.

588
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:45,740
He looks just about as strange.

589
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,660
What about his ward cleaver?

590
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,580
He looks like your ordinary, everyday dad, dad man, father image.

591
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:55,400
He's got the way about him.

592
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:07,260
But you know, and they get this image in their heads of the pipe-smoking businessman in the three-piece suit chatting up Jesus or the devil or whoever.

593
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:15,720
The most important thing to remember about the image of Bob has always been that no matter what,

594
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,220
no matter where you go, when you see a dog's head, you know what it stands for.

595
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,620
It's simply him, a man smiling and smoking a pipe.

596
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,280
A pipe filled with the uncut word of himself.

597
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,200
A pipe filled with his holy f-

598
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,640
A pipe so filled with the word of Bob.

599
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,100
And that's what we mortals are only now beginning to understand.

600
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,620
That's his image.

601
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,000
That's his way.

602
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,200
That's Bob.

603
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,440
Praise Bob.

604
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:07,340
And if no one else, then by all means turn to Connie because, you know, because let's not kid ourselves, guys.

605
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,180
She's the real power behind this church.

606
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,320
You know, she's the one we all know.

607
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,120
Hail, Connie!

608
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,280
Woo!

609
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,080
Woo!

610
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,320
Ladies, gentlemen, fellow travelers, here ended the rant.

611
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,180
Good evening.

612
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:21,940
Yeah!

613
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,500
Woo!

614
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:24,960
Woo!

615
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,460
Woo!

616
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,000
Woo!

617
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,800
Woo!

618
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,500
Right, it's like Alex, friends.

619
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,780
Fourteen years old!

620
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,340
Woo!

621
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,960
Woo!

622
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,440
Woo!

623
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,220
Don't even think about it, girls.

624
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,440
That's jail time.

625
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:45,700
Yeah, the church of the subgenius is much older than that young man Jesus pointed out was born.

626
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,800
We're celebrating her 25th anniversary soon.

627
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,200
As long as it can be distinguished that man is man and woman is woman.

628
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,860
I think you're just a big bully.

629
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,320
I don't care if you like us because we don't like you and we don't give a flying what you think.

630
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,480
I thought you were trying to French kiss me.

631
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
You're better than I am.

632
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,520
Boys have a vagina.

633
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,520
Girls have a penis.

634
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,020
Man is woman and woman is man.

635
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,040
Guys, we're glimpsed at midwinter.

636
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,360
Humana, humana, humana.

637
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,220
A woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman?

638
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:18,800
Ridiculous.

639
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,260
It's preposterous.

640
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,240
In fact, it's so preposterous no one would ever believe it.

641
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,140
I find it very mind-bending.

642
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,400
There is going to be hell.

643
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,280
Medically impossible.

644
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,920
It's not really hard to believe.

645
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,940
It's just hard for you to accept.

646
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,520
Medically impossible.

647
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,760
Guards!

648
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,860
Pass grade hit.

649
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,600
Good heavens!

650
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,440
Ah!

651
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,060
You can hit me while I whip this out.

652
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:38,660
Ah!

653
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,320
Guards!

654
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,500
Pass grade hit.

655
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,520
No!

656
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:42,900
No!

657
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,420
No!

658
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,100
This is not a haphazard maneuver.

659
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,060
Careful planning for it started months back.

660
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,340
Beware.

661
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,420
Beware.

662
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:06,780
Beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep.

663
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,460
He eats little boys.

664
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,420
Boys have a vagina.

665
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:12,920
Boys have a vagina.

666
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,020
Boys have a vagina.

667
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,020


668
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,020


669
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,780
Boys have a vagina.

670
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,420
Boys have a vagina.

671
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,640
Boys have a vagina.

672
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,240
Boys have a vagina.

673
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,240


674
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,240


675
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,240


676
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,240


677
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,240


678
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,100
By the way, Bob Hal transmission heads of the channel,inter imagen bubbles are well

679
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,160
clear Detroit TXTalk Radio is at theiretto basic.

680
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,660
I didn't say Bobby Gr混 at all.

681
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:29,660


682
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:34,240
Computer pup this is sawable.

683
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,420
Call Card!?

684
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,060
We are on a short break.

685
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,520
But he doesn't look dry tonight,so my friend André move on this time.

686
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,840
I was at the Safealtresonic东ig club.

687
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,400
I'm at a姐至 sorta the comedian with the breathe bar of Mobile One Beer.

688
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,480
horse sense, common sense, sense of humor, and most importantly of all, dollars and cents.

689
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:54,680
J.R. Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, J.R. Bob Dobbs was on the number one list of frauds and phonies for Time Magazine,

690
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,020
and I didn't know who he was.

691
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,400
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is the creator of the Church of the Subgenius.

692
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,440
This guy, the Reverend Ivan Stang, is one of their...

693
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:04,920
Disciples.

694
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,640
Disciples. Disciples. Yeah.

695
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,720
You know, it's funny. I don't think Jesus had a disciple named Dopey.

696
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,160
Poor Bob.

697
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,920
Oh, baby.

698
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,760
Life is grim, is it not?

699
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,200
It is grim. Yes, life is grim.

700
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,580
You drive through town and see the abandoned factories.

701
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,980
Yes, yes, yes.

702
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,780
The ice caps are melting.

703
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,880
We hate it.

704
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,240
The water's dry.

705
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,560
We hate it.

706
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,280
The world will soon be drowned.

707
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,640
Yes, yes, yes.

708
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,360
The plague is spreading.

709
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,720
Yes, yes. The booboos are on everyone, master.

710
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,320
All is lost.

711
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,460
Yes, yes, yes.

712
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,640
Barbarism and inhumanity reign in the street.

713
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,240
Yes, yes, yes.

714
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,140
The children are lost souls.

715
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:11,960
Oh, my God.

716
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,500
Yes, yes, master.

717
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,200
The world is coming to an end.

718
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,680
Yes, master.

719
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,600
Yes, yes, master.

720
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,840
These are all signs of the end time.

721
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,380
Yes, yes, yes, master.

722
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,020
Yes, yes, yes.

723
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,820
Yes, yes, yes.

724
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:32,340


725
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:32,340


726
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,740
Bob spoke of it before.

727
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,640
He wrote of it in the book.

728
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,380
Is your name writ in the book of the book?

729
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:42,380


730
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:42,380


731
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,700
Yes.

732
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,320
Yes.

733
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,240
Yes, yes, sir.

734
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,840
Yes, yes, sir.

735
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,100
Okay.

736
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,260
Yes, yes, sir.

737
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:57,260


738
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,180
Your name's Mr. Blondie.

739
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,200


740
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,220
You're my master.

741
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:58,220


742
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:58,320
Yes, yes, sir.

743
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,320


744
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,320


745
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,320


746
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,320


747
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,880
Yes, sir.

748
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,460
Yes, sir.

749
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,180
Yes, I'm your master.

750
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:06,380
Oh, maybe he don't care about the end of the world, the end of freedom, the end

751
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,980
of the ability to think, freedom of thought.

752
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,240
Yes, my master.

753
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,840
My freedom.

754
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,680
My master.

755
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:18,380
They just want the law read to them.

756
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,580
I guess they like Johnny Law.

757
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,480
I guess they ain't going to send in that $30.

758
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,620
I guess they ain't going to play it.

759
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,220
But friend, what will you do when you're called up before the judge?

760
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:35,140
You know, you tied your shoes this morning, but will the undertaker untie them tonight?

761
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,640
And saw your feet off to fit you in that coffin because your family couldn't afford a big enough one?

762
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,880
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

763
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,540
Oh, things are bleak.

764
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,700
Things are rough.

765
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,740
Sure, you can try to think positive.

766
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,740
That's just when they're going to come up behind you, sneak up on you.

767
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,360
They sneak up on you.

768
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,820
You know they're after you.

769
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,440
They're after you.

770
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,200
They wait for you.

771
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,700
They're not being paranoid.

772
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,680
They really are after you.

773
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,980
They're coming for you.

774
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,120
That means you better know who your friends are, buddy.

775
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,260
They're coming for you.

776
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,360
You better know where you go.

777
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:18,720
You're going to find Sukor, an aide, when the big hammer comes down.

778
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,900
You know what I mean.

779
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,320
Can't get it in the circle.

780
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,840
Who are you going to go to?

781
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,340
You're going to go to the cops?

782
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,540
You're going to go call 911?

783
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,580
Oh, yeah.

784
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,520
The earthquake's sucking you right down.

785
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,580
The giant volcano's going off in the middle of Kansas.

786
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,700
The mosquitoes the size of dinosaurs are sucking your blood.

787
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,880
You're going to call 911?

788
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,560
Oh, yeah.

789
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:38,960
Mm-hmm.

790
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,440
Oh, yeah.

791
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:40,600
911.

792
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,100
911.

793
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:41,580
911.

794
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:41,620
911.

795
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,080
911.

796
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,120
911.

797
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,120


798
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,120


799
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,120


800
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,120


801
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,120


802
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,120


803
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,120


804
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,340
911.

805
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:42,340


806
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:42,340


807
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:42,340


808
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:42,340


809
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:42,340


810
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:42,360
911.

811
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:42,480
911.

812
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,240
911.

813
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:43,240


814
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:43,240


815
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,820
You're going to know who your friends are and go to the man with the pipe.

816
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,260
You're going to call 669.

817
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,600
669.

818
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:49,900
911.

819
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,540
911.

820
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:50,800


821
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,700
You call 669 and talk to the man with the pipe.

822
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
The pipe.

823
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,500
The pipe.

824
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,560
He might even offer you a light himself.

825
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,600
Hell.

826
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,540
Where's that pipe?

827
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,160
Lean back.

828
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,920
Big old...

829
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,340
Take a big old hit of that church there.

830
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,380
You know everything's going to be all right.

831
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,440
You get hanged off here.

832
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,360
Now, me, I don't hang down.

833
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,720
Or are you going to screw up?

834
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,480
Or are you just going to say, well, that was a real funny little skit.

835
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,320
But I'm...

836
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,740
Yeah, sure, I read in the newspaper that the child murderers are killing their mediocrity parents and putting them in jars.

837
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,880
Oh, yeah, I read that the ozone layer was almost completely gone.

838
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,260
And that's why me and all my...

839
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,520
My neighbors happen to seem to have cataracts.

840
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,780
I know that the electrical wiring in my home's giving me cancer.

841
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,600
But, you know, well, nothing's perfect.

842
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,820
You know, every cloud has a silver lining.

843
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,680
Tomorrow's another day.

844
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,640
What you know won't hurt you.

845
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
You know, Bob's not real.

846
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,540
I don't need slack.

847
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,760
I guess I'll just go down with the rest of them.

848
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,360
Yeah.

849
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,280
Yes, I guess so.

850
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,560
Me, me, Bob.

851
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,860
Me, no, you.

852
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,400
Me, me, Bob.

853
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,020
Me, me, Bob.

854
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,000
Me, me, me.

855
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,480
Look at these joyous little Morlocks below.

856
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:27,020
Sure, today the Morlocks are little friends.

857
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,260
Stunted.

858
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,900
Rather depressing looking as they are.

859
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,100
They love Bob.

860
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,820
They may be pathetic and sad.

861
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,180
But you know that in the future they will be the ones who run things.

862
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,960
Sure, the pinks may live in their mansions up above ground.

863
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,140
Being fed mysteriously every night somehow.

864
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,740
Fattened up.

865
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,120
And they never grow old.

866
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,840
Because when they turn 30 they're taken away by the Morlocks at night.

867
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,960
And fed to Morlocks families.

868
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:05,700
That is the destiny of the subgeniuses who are left behind on X-Day.

869
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,680
Yes, you may...

870
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,560
If you're left behind on X-Day your grandkids will get to be Morlocks.

871
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:10,880
Morlocks.

872
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,080
And feed off the Eloi.

873
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,900
But if you're truly saved, friend, you ain't gonna have to worry about that.

874
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:27,600
You're gonna have universal luxury on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

875
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,880
Universal luxury.

876
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,440
Oh boy.

877
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,780
Come on baby, come on baby.

878
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,980
Oh boy.

879
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,800
Universal luxury.

880
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,420
Oh boy.

881
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,240
Come on baby, come on baby.

882
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,840
Oh boy.

883
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,800
Universal luxury.

884
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,280
Shower me with universal luxury.

885
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Shower me with universal luxury.

886
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,200
Once you find out

887
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,580
the circumstances

888
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:07,320
then you cannot go out.

889
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,660
Oh boy.

890
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,420
Oh yeah.

891
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,520
Oh boy.

892
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,340
Once you find out

893
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,840
the circumstances

894
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,860
then you cannot go out.

895
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,820
Oh yeah.

896
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,020
Little girl, don't you know

897
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:47,860
That the stars up above are running all alone

898
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:53,280
Little girl, don't you know that they're blinking at you

899
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:03,820
Now the sun can sunburn you, but not as bad as the lost old people do

900
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,580
guitar solo

901
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:49,340
Little girl, don't you know that the stars up above are running all alone

902
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:54,940
Little girl, don't you know that they're blinking at you

903
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:06,580
Now the sun can sunburn you, but not as bad as the lost old people do

904
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,740
guitar solo

905
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:37,620
I want you, once you find out the circumstances

906
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:46,960
Then you, then you, then you, then you

907
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:55,100
Can go out, oh yeah, you can go out

908
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:06,460
Just want your old comfy slippers and the big fuzzy pillow

909
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,820
I've tried everything

910
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,700
Wild orgies

911
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,000
All kinds of drugs

912
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,360
Drugs, traveling the world

913
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,640
Booty coconut parties

914
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,680
Violence, torture

915
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,400
Wearing the ARF ARF mask

916
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,660
You know what I decided the best, what really counts

917
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,900
What really, when you really get down to it

918
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,720
Cream eggs

919
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,680
Five more minutes in bed

920
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:41,540
suite

921
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,680
All it's getting to be

922
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:51,680


923
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:51,680


924
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:51,680


925
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:51,680


926
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:51,680


927
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:51,680


928
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:51,680


929
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,800
Well, since my old baby left me

930
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,120
I found a new place to dwell

931
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,360
It's down at the end of Lonely Street

932
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,360
That's a heartbreak hotel

933
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,540
A baby so lonely, baby

934
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,720
A baby so lonely

935
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,640
Ah oh.

936
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,000
Baby, don't do aroad

937
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,000


938
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,000


939
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,000


940
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,000


941
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,000


942
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,000


943
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,600
I've been so lonely, baby

944
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,400
I could die

945
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,760
The bellboy's always crying

946
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,260
The lady's dressed in black

947
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,080
They've been so long, all along

948
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,600
This trip will never, never, never come back

949
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,680
I've been so lonely, baby

950
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,760
I've been so lonely

951
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,720
I've been so lonely, baby

952
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,840
I could die

953
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,940
People talking all about

954
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,120
About the way you left me flat

955
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,200
I don't care what those people say

956
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,440
I know where that jive is at

957
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,680
But one thing I do have on my mind

958
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,600
And it terrifies me too

959
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,960
The way you call me another guy's name

960
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,740
When I try to find you

961
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,780
It's just more than what I've ever known

962
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:10,780


963
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,360
Loving you

964
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:16,800
Oh, oh, oh

965
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,360
Loving you

966
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:17,360


967
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:21,900
You, and you seulah

968
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,320
If your baby leaves you

969
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,640
Got a tale to tell

970
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,200
Just take a walk down lonely street to

971
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,240
A heartbreak motel

972
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,700
I bet you're so lonely, baby

973
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,020
I bet you're so lonely

974
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:03,140
I bet you're so lonely, baby

975
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:06,200
I could die

976
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,920
Heartbreaker

977
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,740
Heartbreaker

978
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,900
Heartbreaker

979
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:22,940
Hotel

980
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,060
Hotel

981
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,740
Hotel

982
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,260
Hotel

983
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:29,680
Hotel

984
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,060
Hotel

985
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:35,660
Heartbreaker by Dred Zeppelin

986
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,360
And before that we heard

987
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,340
Circumstances by

988
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,520
Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band

989
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,820
from the album Clear Spot

990
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,700
Ah yes, and a little clip

991
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,860
of my life with the Thrill Kill

992
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,780
cult and a lot of

993
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,980
old old ESO

994
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,380
swamp radio

995
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,880
on WCSB Cleveland

996
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,040
with Chaz Smith

997
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,940
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

998
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,580
Special guest Princess We Are Doe

999
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,780
and yours truly from

1000
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,720
February 1995

1001
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,280
Reverend Chaz

1002
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,340
Smith there providing the live

1003
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,180
music but now

1004
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,480
let us go even further

1005
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,640
back before the

1006
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,660
Morlocks and the Eloy and the

1007
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,500
ESO to Berkeley

1008
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,380
California

1009
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:23,600
the KPFA radio station

1010
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,660
back in the day before they changed

1011
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,700
with Dr. Howell puzzling evidence

1012
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,160
and glass

1013
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,020
madness

1014
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,480
I first

1015
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,540
had my experience with Bob at

1016
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,640
Bob's Big Boy on the corner of

1017
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,500
Bellevue Drive in Los Angeles

1018
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,900
California in 1959

1019
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,980
It changed my life

1020
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,600
and I became able to

1021
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,700
open my third nostril and snort

1022
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,080
the divine wisdom of the subgenius

1023
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,580
Every morning before breakfast

1024
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,400
I find it helpful to go into

1025
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,700
my sternutition room

1026
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,820
as we call them and sniff up

1027
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,960
Yes, violent sternutition may be

1028
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,460
named after the famous sternio

1029
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,660
Well yes, the famous sternio does

1030
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,700
practice sternutition as does everyone who

1031
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,380
possesses the simple accoutrement of a

1032
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,480
handkerchief and a head full of ideas

1033
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,540
that need to be relieved

1034
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,240
blasted out as it might be

1035
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,320
Oh Bob with your square little

1036
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,400
grey brain how do you use that

1037
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,560
thing it's hooked up all wrong

1038
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,280
Oh Bob what about this rumor that your pipe is a living

1039
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,200
organism? Yes, that has invaded

1040
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,740
your brain and made everything all wrong

1041
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:27,300
Yeah what about that Bob grinning malarkey turkey

1042
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,380
flunky prophet of the... What about them aliens

1043
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,580
as you say or us aliens? We're not aliens

1044
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,780
How about it Bob and who's this anti-Bob

1045
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,020
some relation of yours some nepotistic cousin

1046
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,140
on the payroll and... In a computer

1047
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,360
field of nerds. We dare to question our

1048
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,260
supreme epopt Bob because we

1049
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,240
have the freedom within the church of the subgenius

1050
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,980
to question even the basic verities

1051
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,420
like whether or not there is a Mokele Mbembe

1052
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,200
whether it's frog like bellow does

1053
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,280
echo over the South American or even

1054
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,280
the African swamps

1055
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,940
Swamps? Swamps. Yes

1056
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,380
Right now, Glass Madness

1057
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,380
is in that swamp, yes he's gone down to the green hill

1058
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,300
They say the Mokele Mbembe lives in Lake

1059
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,200
Ukabalabonga which is only four feet deep

1060
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,960
but the creature of a

1061
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,000
considerate... Ukabalabonga

1062
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,700
is coming right up

1063
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,360
keep walking

1064
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,240
buy the book of the subgenius

1065
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,160
Up there it went

1066
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,920
and here... Oh wait a minute

1067
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,700
I think it's time for a commercial

1068
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,260
Bob Dobbs he's no

00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,260

he is the head of the subgenius church

1072
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,260
and that's why he's super cool

1073
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,920

00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,960

subgenius church and he is

1078
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,160
super cool

1079
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:40,800
music

1080
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,500

thing is all about and maybe get some free

1090

1188
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,560
it's because I haven't been showering too much

1189
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:23,960

00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,360

1191
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,500

1192
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,620
mm hm

1193
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,180

1198
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:44,100

1199
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:44,780
no no no

1200
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,960
I'm using my third nostril

1201
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,200
to whiff read your psychic stench

1202
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,380
have you been watching the movie Sinbad the Sailor

1203
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,740

00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,220

00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,420
you have had many important past lives

1208
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,620

1209
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:04,780

00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,080

1213
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,760
think of the fun you'll have taking Barbie and Ken on dates

1215
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,560
I actually

1216
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,160

1218
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,600

1219
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,580
way beyond Pannonia

1220
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:29,000
you dress them up real pretty and put the caveman outfit on one of them

1221
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,240
and sometimes a little skinny tie on the boy

1222
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,800
and take them out on a little date

1223
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,200
oh that would be my favorite

1224
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,140
thing to do

1225
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,380
that's always my favorite thing to do when I'm home

1226
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,740
I like to take the caveman and take the

1227
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,620
you know the necktie from the business suit guy

1228
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,240
and strangle them all up

1229
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,580
when you're home

1230
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,680
when you're home or at the home

1231
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,940
now when you're home or at the home

1232
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,580
that's before you start burning them

1233
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,940
I have to stay home lately

1234
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,240

1235
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,300

00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,460
busted up money and knee

1242
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,920
I went to the bank and they said I didn't have any

1243
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,120
it seemed to have hit the concrete

1244
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,220
and been pushed to the side in every direction

1245
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,780
that sounds beautiful

1246
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,740

1247
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,460

1250
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,440
in joining the bonobo sect

1251
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,520

1259
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,120

00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,360
we'll fill you up

1262
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,120
the spirit of slack

1263
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,800
the spunk of some diseased mentally ill old gentleman

1264
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,240
who believe the world is coming to an end

1265
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,640
and in actuality

1266
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,260
their own minds are coming to an abrupt halt

1267
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,080
they'll join you soon in the town

1268
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:03,880
one at a time

1269
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:05,700
so David

1270
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:06,200
there's a spunk of an old diseased man

1271
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,720
Davey just closes his eyes and goes

1272
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,800
he's there

1273
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,900
he's there

1274
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:10,860
it doesn't matter

1275
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,820
yeah see that's why

1276
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,960
that all sounds really really nice

1277
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,480
it does

1278
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,480
yeah

1279
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,160
the spunk of an old diseased man

1280
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:19,740
yeah

1281
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,080
don't you get pleasure out of the most mundane things

1282
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:29,400
I think the old diseased man Dave is referring to may be Dave

1283
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,900
I was referring to you

1284
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,880
I thought so.

1285
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,460
I thought that...

1286
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,700
I thought it was in there.

1287
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,340
How's the mutated eunuch you're letting live in the basement?

1288
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,040
I don't have a basement.

1289
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,120
I don't have a basement.

1290
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,540
I don't know who you mean.

1291
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,320
Well, then how the hell is a mutated eunuch living in your basement?

1292
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,020
Till next week.

1293
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,560
Keep your hat on tight.

1294
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,000
You're sacking the saddle.

1295
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:55,920
You're back to the wind.

1296
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,060
You know all what else.

1297
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,820
Hey, thanks for calling, Devangela.

1298
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,680
Thanks for calling, Devangela.

1299
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:06,520
Long cow, Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

1300
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,780
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1301
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,280
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1302
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,100
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1303
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:23,120
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1304
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:30,200
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1305
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,660
you should go to...

1306
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:35,680
subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page,

1307
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,720
or the catalog store pages,

1308
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,040
and help out financially as best you can.

1309
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:45,400
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1310
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,040
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1311
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,960
But some of you still have jobs.

1312
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,340
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1313
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,880
even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1314
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,300
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1315
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:08,020
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs

1316
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:10,080
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1317
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,860
We also take checks and money orders to...

1318
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,520
Subgenius Foundation.

1319
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:28,040
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1320
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:31,520
Thanks for anything you can do to help...

1321
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,240
Let there be slack.
