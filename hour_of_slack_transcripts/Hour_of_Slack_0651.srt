1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Complexers and he has to go out there as Gamera. I don't know what he's talking about.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,680
He's been having hallucinations about alien space monsters, alien space monsters, alien space monsters.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,780
Why should people want to kiss each other?

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,620
It's an old custom. All of the really high civilizations go in for it.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,860
But it's so silly.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,660
But it's good for you though. It stimulates the whole system.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,840
It hurts to be the bearer of bad news time after time after time.

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:35,560
Nonetheless, it fell my duty to be that bearer of bad news time after time after time.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,020
I mean, Chaz is talking crazy stuff, man.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,260
It was all making perfect sense up until the moment when he said...

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:51,120
Each day on Earth, each day on Earth, each day on Earth is a day that's worth remembering.

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,720
The hunger and thirst that the human heart has is satisfied by coming home.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,800
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming, coming, coming...

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,220
The come is to come is to...

15
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,020
Come is to believe. It means to forsake ourselves and turn to trusting.

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:15,900
The post end times, end times. Einstein's secret orchestra of 7 million billion billion billion billion billion.

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,700
Billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion...

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,020
Different little brain cells of all those other people who are out there doing the same thing that we are.

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:36,300
only different present the subgenius hour of slack the law of the jungle this stuff is great

20
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,060
it's just as if donovan himself had appeared on my very own tv with words of peace love and eternal

21
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,900
cosmic wisdom

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,860
his name is

23
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,640
do you like dogs like that

24
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,980
oh

25
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,460
Some believe that the rings function as some sort of an accelerator or something,

26
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,700
sending its energy into this passenger pod, making it rocket away at near the speed of light.

27
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,720
You still want one there, Dr.

28
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,520
Those girls over there only knew my secret identity.

29
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,900
But how could they? How could they know that I,

30
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:11,660
I,

31
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,740
I want a dick?

32
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,740
The word rest is a good word.

33
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,880
It means the end of effort.

34
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,240
It means the removal of that which wearies the mind and the body.

35
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,800
It means that the exhausting, exasperating search is over.

36
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,500
It also means that there's a security.

37
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:37,460
This rest that Bob offered was the removal of the burden of guilt that we could be forgiven.

38
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,320
Through faith in the pleasureships, we can be forgiven.

39
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,580
We can be forgiven.

40
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:41,880
We can be forgiven.

41
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:41,880


42
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,340
Our past can be forgiven.

43
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,040
But he also answers the questions of life.

44
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,740
And when we're weary of the search right now, this word gives us strength as we walk on life's pathway.

45
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,540
It means the weight of the unknown, the future that seems so unclear.

46
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,420
He removes that weight of the future.

47
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,080
How can he do that?

48
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,700
Through faith in

49
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:07,940
Slack.

50
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:08,660
Slack.

51
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,580
Slack.

52
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,080
Slack.

53
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,580

54
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,160

55
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,320

69
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,260
Slack.

70
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:25,860
Slack.

71
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,460
Slack.

72
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:26,780
Slack.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,560
Slack.

74
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:27,760
Slack.

75
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,360
Slack.

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,920
Ah, yes, oh no, dear friends.

77
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,560
Oh, this is your host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

78
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,680
this time sans nose bandage.

79
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,260
The doctors finally stopped taking pliers

80
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,840
and yanking long, rubbery tubes the size of your finger

81
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,640
out of my face.

82
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,600
And now all I have to do to stay healthy

83
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,460
is to wash my sinuses out three times a day

84
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,420
by injecting hot salt water up my nose

85
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,880
so hard that it has to be spat out.

86
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,640
Now how that is supposed to prevent the whole planet

87
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,420
from spinning counter to my sense of balance,

88
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,600
I'm not sure.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,300
But enough about my health.

90
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,120
I refer to these things to show fellowship

91
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,980
with my aged peers to prove that I'm old

92
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,440
and therefore wise.

93
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,240
The old silverback of the Church of the Subgenius

94
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,760
and any whippersnapper, wise-ass punk

95
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,160
that thinks they can topple me

96
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,400
from the top of the mountain

97
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,540
and my throne and steal my harem

98
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,040
is welcome to try, you bastard.

99
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,320
Oh man, friends, by virtue of the X-Day home video

100
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,980
shot by other people, I've been privileged lately

101
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,380
to overhear bobbies that I've never seen before

102
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,380
telling each other very gravely and assuredly

103
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,880
just what all is wrong with the Church of the Subgenius.

104
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,100
And how Reverend Stang should fix it

105
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,780
and what Reverend Stang had for breakfast

106
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,700
and how stupid-looking his haircut is.

107
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,660
Bob?

108
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,660
I don't think they pay any attention to Bob.

109
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,480
I've heard some strange stuff in this church,

110
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,600
but hearing what some of the real young fans

111
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,240
tell each other about me has got to be

112
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,580
one of my most bizarre experiences ever.

113
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,840
Some of them actually seem to think

114
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,140
that I am really Bob in disguise,

115
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,240
or that Bob is my alter ego.

116
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,580
I don't need to tell any discerning subgeni

117
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,460
that, thank God, nothing could be further from the truth.

118
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,560
Honest to Dobbs, I only work here.

119
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,320
Now that Italian kid that works here too, Jesus, though,

120
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,360
now that isn't just a subgenius ironic name.

121
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,720
He really is the Lord.

122
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,020
You want proof? You want a miracle?

123
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,740
The Subgenius Foundation is still in business.

124
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,580
There's your miracle, praise Jesus.

125
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,020
Some of you people are so blind, willfully blind,

126
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,320
the finger is pointing at where your wildest dreams could come true,

127
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,500
and instead you're crowding around the finger trying to suck it.

128
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,160
Please leave my finger out of this, friends.

129
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,820
You're ogling a cheesy special effect

130
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,040
while the actual magic miracle is right behind you.

131
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,560
If you would just snap out of it,

132
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,380
and you will awaken when I snap my fingers.

133
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,280
Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap.

134
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,980
So sometime in the distant future,

135
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,900
when Bonnie was brought back through this cryogenic laboratory here,

136
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,380
the finest, the finest, only the finest for little Jenny.

137
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,140
And look here, she has lots of little friends.

138
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,320
Some of them look like cats.

139
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,260
Other ones don't exactly look like any animal we have on Earth.

140
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,480
But this isn't Earth, so we don't care about that.

141
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,860
Jenny's completely happy.

142
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,080
Look, she plays with her little catnip ball.

143
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,740
Then when we come in and evacuate her bowels,

144
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,500
because she can't go on her own in the zero gravity,

145
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,260
we take her back into her little cage,

146
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,900
and we fondle her little whiskers, and we pet her.

147
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,940
And she feels like she's back home with everyone she knew,

148
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,960
back there in the cave, in the bowels of the Earth.

149
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,820
I'll tell you one thing about the universe, though.

150
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,460
The universe.

151
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:28,840
The universe.

152
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,060
It's a pretty big place.

153
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,420
It's bigger than anything anyone has ever dreamed of before.

154
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,640
So if it's just us, it seems like an awful waste of space.

155
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,120
Seems like an awful waste of space.

156
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,340
Hey, you wanna go for a ride?

157
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,120
No, thanks.

158
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,420
No, thanks? What does that mean?

159
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,320
I don't wanna go.

160
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,480
Go where?

161
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,720
For a ride.

162
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,360
A ride.

163
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,520
Hell, that's a good idea.

164
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,940
Okay, let's go.

165
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,600
These are not the drugs you're looking for.

166
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,220
These aren't the drugs we're looking for.

167
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,980
Yes, they are.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,960
They're the drugs we've been waiting for all our lives.

169
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,540
These are not the drugs we're looking for.

170
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:12,980
Come on.

171
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,280
Let them pass.

172
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,020
Let them pass.

173
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,420
Oh, man, we made it through.

174
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
We're into Arkansas and out of Tennessee.

175
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:25,100
Now if we can just get to Texas, the fine will only be $200 and a night in jail.

176
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,100
It's almost like freedom.

177
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,980
But we'll have to breathe the special air again.

178
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,280
I don't think we're in Kansas.

179
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,080
It's the same air they've been breathing now for the last 60 days, I think.

180
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,700
The same air.

181
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:41,880
Oh, yeah.

182
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,600
The blue air they've been smoking.

183
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,960
Bad news about that air.

184
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,620
I'm sorry, but...

185
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,780
I'm sorry, too.

186
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,280
Listen, if you need air, you can come up here.

187
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,080
I want you to know if you need air, if any of you need air, you can just come on up here and see.

188
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,600
Stay with me.

189
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,840
And you can sleep on the couch and you can probably go out sometime, you know, and have something.

190
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,460
Bleepo's got good air.

191
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,000
He's got the kind of air you can really breathe that won't choke you or give you allergies or something.

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,140
It's just recycled flagellants, you sick man, you.

193
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,920
It's not real.

194
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,920
You guys just come up any old time, okay?

195
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,640
I'd love to breathe some of your air, Bleepo.

196
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,280
You know that my doors are open.

197
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,060
Your airlock is one of the most welcoming of all.

198
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,060


199
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,680
Of the airlock.

200
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

201
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,200
He's a pretty good...

202
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,800
He's a pretty good party thrower.

203
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,240
He knows how to throw parties.

204
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,420
One of those shows that cannot die.

205
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,920
It's like a vampire that lives on and on through eternity, through all the ages.

206
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,900
Sitting together listening to this.

207
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,340
We're sitting together listening to this, remembering when we were sitting together listening to this.

208
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,780
I remember that.

209
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,740
I remember that real good.

210
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,300
That's about the only thing I do remember.

211
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,060
Oh, that was...

212
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,420
That was fun.

213
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,660
Them was fun days.

214
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,800
Them was...

215
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,280
Them was...

216
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,860
Them was...

217
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,560
Them was lean years, but fun seconds.

218
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:09,260
Friends, this is Hour of Slack number 651, believe it or not.

219
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,760
And it's also ESO slash Hour of Slack volume eight.

220
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:22,860
Because once again, Chaz Smith of Einstein's Secret Orchestra media barraged up the last

221
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,380
few ESO shows.

222
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:30,920
And his latest musical composition loop tapes, such as Heard in the Background.

223
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:32,740
Praise Bob.

224
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,020
Into one mighty hour long tape.

225
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,600
Once again, praise Chaz.

226
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,660
Because now I've got to leave town for a preaching gig at something called Death Equinox Con

227
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,880
in Denver right now.

228
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,640
And otherwise it'd just be a rerun.

229
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,900
I don't mention that...

230
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:59,520
I didn't mention that devival on the show because we don't have any stations near...

231
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,120
Anywhere near Denver, friends.

232
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,400
And it just doesn't matter.

233
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,940
But at least we don't have to do a rerun, friends.

234
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,320
And future shows, future shows, if any, should bring you the X Day recordings.

235
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:22,340
I've spent the last two weeks on pain pills culling down 40 hours of videotapes.

236
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,160
I've been shot by various subgeniuses.

237
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,860
Well, I've got it down to 10 hours.

238
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,620
And the sound from those 10 hours shall fill radio shows until next X Day.

239
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,520
Or as we call it, Next Day.

240
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,480
AKA Dos Equis.

241
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,100
Future show gonna bring you Bobby Yucks.

242
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,700
In the meantime, though, we continue to grow our own ships.

243
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,920
In Chaz's swamp studio.

244
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,440
And at WCSB Studios at Cleveland State.

245
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,860
Thanks to...

246
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,640
Cantor Chaz Smith.

247
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,860
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

248
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,300
Einstein Secret Orchestra.

249
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,200
Michelle, George, and Bob with special guests.

250
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,420
Princess Wiardo.

251
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,680
Reverend Lepo Abernathy.

252
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,740
Irreverent Friday Jones.

253
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,720
And yours truly.

254
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,480
Heard worldwide in audioactive Thursday nights at 9 Eastern Standard Time.

255
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,520
On www.wcsb.org.

256
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,100
Those nuts, friends.

257
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,760
By the way...

258
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,940
I'm reading from a script.

259
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,580
But those nuts have built a TV studio in the swamp.

260
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:35,100
And are working on a cable access, public access TV show called Eye on Strange Cleveland.

261
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,580
Or as I think of it, friends, Wee's World.

262
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,260
So that should...

263
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,800
We have all sorts of odd video things in the offing.

264
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,780
Oh, Lord Dobbs in Heaven, friends.

265
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,480
That reminds me.

266
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,240
We just suddenly set up another Cleveland devival at the Euclid Tavern.

267
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,220
Holy smokes.

268
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,320
That's right.

269
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,760
November 8th.

270
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,320
Sunday night at the Euclid Tavern.

271
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:00,760
Yours truly.

272
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:06,380
And ESO and Dobbs knows what else shall bring down the rafters in our time-honored way.

273
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,140
But with all new songs, sermons, and subpoenas.

274
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,160
That's November 8th at the Euclid Tavern.

275
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,260
Euclid Avenue.

276
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,660
Cleveland, Ohio.

277
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,940
Across from the food co-op.

278
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:26,040
And friends, these Cleveland Euclid Tavern devivals have become a legend of the late 20th century in their own time.

279
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,520
So get on board, friends, before the last ship leaves.

280
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,160
Praise Bob.

281
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,720
Praise Bob.

282
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,280
Praise Bob.

283
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,040
Praise Bob.

284
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,460
Build your own ship.

285
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,100
Earth, we must get off.

286
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:43,900
Praise Bob.

287
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,600
Subgeniuses off Earth.

288
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:47,920
Praise Bob.

289
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,600
Now.

290
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,940
Praise Bob.

291
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,340
Praise Bob.

292
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,540
Praise Bob.

293
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,580
Praise Bob.

294
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,280
Praise Bob.

295
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:54,360
Praise Bob.

296
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,340
Off Earth.

297
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,940
Off Earth.

298
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,720
Earth first.

299
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,400
On to Mars.

300
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,280
Earth first.

301
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,960
On to Mars.

302
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,580
Earth first.

303
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,380
On to Mars.

304
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,020
Friends, off Earth.

305
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:17,900
Let us off Earth before the virus of the ugly bags of water known as man takes over.

306
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:17,900


307
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,620
And spread further its infection of galactic civilization.

308
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:32,680
And you can help stem that infection by writing to Bob at P.O. Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

309
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,840
Once again, that's Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

310
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,580
Praise Bob.

311
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,100
Praise Bob.

312
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,980
Praise Bob.

313
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,700
Praise Bob.

314
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:44,700


315
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,280
Praise Bob.

316
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,280


317
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,880
Praise Bob.

318
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,240
Praise Bob.

319
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,740
Praise Bob.

320
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,540
Thank you.

321
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,240
astronaut, paper, injury.

322
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,240


323
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,240


324
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,600
Did either of you believe that spaceships can fly to any planet?

325
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,200
Is this theoretically possible?

326
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,600
I do believe in theories, Doctor.

327
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,140
But when you tell me flying to another planet is a possibility, you're out of the realm

328
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,660
of theory.

329
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,540
You're in a dream world of the impossible.

330
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,440
The world will not end.

331
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,160
Predicting the end of the world is an annual crackpot event in our society, an attempt

332
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,660
to corner the newspaper headlines.

333
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,820
But we are still here.

334
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,660
How will we ever interrupt enough private capital?

335
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,500
It's hopeless.

336
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,600
I believe you, Bob.

337
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,720
I believe you, Bob.

338
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,800
I believe you, Bob.

339
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,120
I'll buy you a start on your rocket ship.

340
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,140
I've seen any disease.

341
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,380
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

342
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,940
Through telescopes,

343
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,260
men of science constantly search

344
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,360
the infinitesimal corners of our solar system,

345
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,720
seeking new discoveries,

346
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,120
hoping to better understand the laws of the universe.

347
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,360
Two more auto-falls.

348
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,780
That is the law.

349
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,160
I believe you, Bob.

350
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,620
Bob.

351
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,200
Bob.

352
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:00,720
Bob.

353
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,320
Bob.

354
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,760
I'll buy you a start on your rocket ship.

355
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,860
To make it smooth.

356
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:06,980
Yes.

357
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,860
We could get out a little hand sander and just go...

358
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:10,800
Oh, yeah.

359
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,200
I want to slide.

360
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,280
I want to slide.

361
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:14,400
I want to like...

362
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,700
There's stuff going on in there.

363
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,800
One nice move.

364
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,840
One thought.

365
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,500
Not a crime thought.

366
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,520
A regular thought.

367
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,440
There's not a thought.

368
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,000
There's one thought.

369
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,920
One thought.

370
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,120
One mind.

371
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,160
One neuron.

372
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,280
One brain.

373
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,120
One day.

374
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,960
One thought.

375
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,700
Yeah.

376
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,240
A big multiple...

377
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,000
Not a multiple, but a unichel...

378
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,360
Yeah.

379
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:33,940
Yeah.

380
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,180
Unichel creature with one thought.

381
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,920
One cell.

382
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,000
One neuron.

383
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,960
One day.

384
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,100
Well, you know, that thought has got to be either a guess

385
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,260
or a guess.

386
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,260


387
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,380
Yeah.

388
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:44,380


389
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:44,380


390
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:44,380


391
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,900
Or a no.

392
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,400
No.

393
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,040
Let's just die out of my thought.

394
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,660
I want a pure thought.

395
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,500
Well, it's got to be...

396
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,800
It will be pure, but it has to be one or the other.

397
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,840
And you'll have to make one last thought, Dave.

398
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,500
What's it going to be?

399
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,020
Prompt.

400
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,200
Prompt.

401
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,780
It'll be the yay or the nay.

402
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,560
Oh, yeah.

403
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:05,860
Or never.

404
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,680
I'll say Yanni, and then I'll hear Yanni the rest of my life.

405
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,800
I'll put them together and come out with a lesson.

406
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,420
They began in the water.

407
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,620
Dark, gliding shapes that violate every law of nature.

408
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,760
They're not human, but they hunt human women.

409
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,240
Not for killing.

410
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,380
For mating.

411
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,780
Since there's only room for one thought in your head,

412
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,820
we have to get all those other thoughts out,

413
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,820
and the easiest way is to just let them out of your mouth, Dave.

414
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,240
Just don't let them back in.

415
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,120
Just don't let them back in.

416
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,020
Just don't let them back in.

417
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,140
Just don't let them back in.

418
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:36,960
Accept his mouth.

419
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,000
Send him over.

420
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,720
Send him over.

421
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,420
He's a brain.

422
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,220
Brain.

423
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:40,800
Brain.

424
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:41,840
Get that.

425
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,700
Get that.

426
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,400
Crystal brush.

427
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:43,540
Crystal brush.

428
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,260
Crystal brush.

429
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:44,300


430
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:44,360
Crystal brush.

431
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,020
Crystal brush.

432
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,660
Let's talk about the theremin.

433
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,440
The theremin.

434
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,460
The prehensile.

435
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,280
Prehensile.

436
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

437
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

438
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:50,840
Don't start.

439
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,280
Don't start torturing me and stuff.

440
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,240
Don't start torturing me and stuff.

441
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,040
Let's talk about it.

442
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,860
And put on the decomposition of that album.

443
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,580
And, you know, go at it, Dave.

444
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,220
Free yourself.

445
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:01,700
Free yourself.

446
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,860
Let your mind flow.

447
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,380
Don't be so high, man.

448
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,960
Yeah, just like sitting in front of the theremin

449
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,880
and watching that snapping thing come out from behind my genitalia

450
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,980
shaped like a lima bean.

451
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,040
It starts undulating and dancing,

452
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,940
and the tones get higher in front of the theremin.

453
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,540
And pretty soon I know I'm having a thought crime already,

454
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,700
and I might be in risk of actual physical impregnations

455
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,200
as well as having to stay in my room,

456
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,580
but I don't care because it's making like a snake-type thing,

457
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,820
and as you know, a snake is sexual.

458
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,200
It's the S sound.

459
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,060
And then the theremin starts getting louder,

460
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,500
making these moaning sounds like a cat heat.

461
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
Cat heat, yeah.

462
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,820
Wait a minute.

463
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,260
And then there should be like an electrical shock

464
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,060
when it gets to the high, you know, when the snake,

465
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,240
so to speak, gets its head up real high,

466
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,200
and the theremin hits its high nose.

467
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,640
That's when the electrical shock should come.

468
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,460
It's delivered right to the testicular nose.

469
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,940
You never want to do it again.

470
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,780
But of course you have to immediately do it because it's bad.

471
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,300
You're clean and dirty.

472
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,340
You just can't help it.

473
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,260
You're so turned on.

474
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,980
Of course when you start, you're out of there.

475
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,240
You never want to do it again, you know?

476
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,200
I think that is a beautiful way of thinking of

477
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,640
not being able to do it again.

478
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,040
Not only the creation myth,

479
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,620
but the way the Lord imparts wisdom to all of us

480
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,700
through extreme pain to the genitalia.

481
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,300
You don't believe in witches?

482
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,200
You'd better believe in the virgin witch.

483
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,920
Black must come first.

484
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,300
Black must come first.

485
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:33,960
Black must come first in the life of any initiate.

486
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,840
And once you're a past initiate and become a master,

487
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,540
then the slack just comes.

488
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,660
Well, you know, I mean, you say this statement,

489
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,720
you assume I'm stupid,

490
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,360
but don't.

491
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,760
Ropes have slack in it,

492
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,120
and there's Von Bode's head floating around the room

493
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,720
like Arnold Palmer.

494
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,820
Praise the head.

495
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,520
I don't know if there's a possibility.

496
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,120
We've been looking for something else to launch.

497
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,160
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

498
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,200
To help you create the highest possible earnings

499
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,120
from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

500
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,000
To turn conspiracy-implanted personality disorders around

501
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,120
and channel them into an illusion.

502
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,640
To create a new illusion of creativity

503
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,020
that will fool normals and get you sex.

504
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,980
Even though that wasn't actually...

505
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,240
Talk about the amusement park.

506
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Well, yes, if we give...

507
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,800
We'll never be able to raise the money for that amusement park.

508
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,580
Amusement park? What amusement park?

509
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,560
Oh, the subgenius amusement park in Oklahoma.

510
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,200
On the highway, across from the Stuckey's.

511
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,340
Near that big cement dinosaur they got.

512
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:42,340


513
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:42,700
What, up there?

514
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,040
Yes, there's a giant crude cement bob now,

515
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,660
with a cafe inside.

516
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,000
Talk about the nail slide.

517
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,020
They must've had some of the hot chilies at the cafe.

518
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,840
Yes, and...

519
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,820
Listen to that reaction.

520
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,140
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

521
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,700
When you leave, take me with you,

522
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,960
take me with you, take me with you,

523
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,780
when you leave, take me with you.

524
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,720
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

525
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,660
And...

526
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,200
There will soon be a universal currency

527
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,320
by which there can be a global economic control.

528
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,300
I've never felt so spiritually fulfilled.

529
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,700
And with my brother, the stonecutter, behind me,

530
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,580
this is the beginning of a better world for all of us.

531
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,020
We gotta kill him to get easy mode.

532
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,800
Let's hear from the Stonecutter World Council

533
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,520
before we act too rashly.

534
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,940
I knew we were in trouble when that damn egg commercial,

535
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,360
that guy, I knew that was the government's take on drugs.

536
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,160
Here's your brain.

537
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,580
Because I've never, ever, ever, ever, ever

538
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,740
looked at an egg and thought it was brain.

539
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,420
Not once.

540
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,140
So one of those egg council creeps got to you too, huh?

541
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,560
You got it all wrong, Homer.

542
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,940
It's not like that.

543
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,000
Kill him.

544
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,120
Kill him.

545
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,660
Kill the fool!

546
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,800
Right, I have to disagree with Orville, Jack, and Mister.

547
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,300
Can't we just do something to his voice box?

548
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,260
We might as well face the truth.

549
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,440
As long as we're stonecutters, he will control our lives.

550
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,660
Now with computers, we have the first time in history

551
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,640
that what John predicted 1,900 years ago would take place.

552
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,460
Because now...

553
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,640
Now there are computers, in fact there's one in Brussels right now

554
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,720
that could do the job very easily,

555
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,600
where every person on Earth will receive a number

556
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,360
and they can be kept accountable.

557
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,540
Computers don't make errors.

558
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,580
What they do, they do on purpose.

559
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,400
By now your name and particulars have been fed into every laptop,

560
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,900
desktop, mainframe, and supermarket scanner

561
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,860
that collectively make up the global information conspiracy

562
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,600
otherwise known as the Beast.

563
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,980
The Mark of the Beast.

564
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,240
People now...

565
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,760
who... who... who have implants in them.

566
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,620
It traces their movements.

567
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,220
It helps their health, but it's also an invasion of privacy.

568
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,780
Soon there's... there's computers that are apparently being developed

569
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,120
that can read your brainwaves, that can read your thoughts.

570
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,600
I mean, this is not... these aren't toys or... or... or beyond the realm.

571
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,600
People have to grapple with whether they want that Big Brother screen,

572
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,660
which will be there.

573
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,480
You can turn it off.

574
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,620
Yes, Winston.

575
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,340
We have that privilege.

576
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,680
Well, um...

577
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,940
Shall I say it or... will you?

578
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,020
I'll say it.

579
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,580
That thing Israel is turned off?

580
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,480
Yes. Everything is turned off.

581
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,620
We're alone.

582
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,400
All right.

583
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,020
We have come here because we believe

584
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,200
that there is some kind of secret conspiracy,

585
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,060
some kind of secret organization working against the party

586
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,400
and that you are involved in it.

587
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,920
We want to join it and work for it.

588
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,560
Ow! Ow! Ah!

589
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,600
It... ah! Ah!

590
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,800
This club better be worth it! Ow!

591
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,840
Ow! Ow!

592
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,280
All right, all right. It's Lisa's turn.

593
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,280
We are enemies of the party.

594
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,640
We disbelieve in the principles of insult.

595
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,460
We are thought criminals.

596
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,560
We are also adulterers, I tell you this,

597
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,780
because we want to put ourselves at your mercy.

598
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:53,660
Yes.

599
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,080
First, let us all take a drink.

600
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,880
Now, let's all get drunk and play ping-pong.

601
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,380
Yay!

602
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
It is Big Brother at its worst.

603
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,040
It's just phenomenal, the amount of information

604
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,280
that's out there in the secular media

605
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,940
that would lend us to believe.

606
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,580
That chimp implants are going to be used to identify us.

607
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,340
No! No forms, no computers.

608
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,500
We were never here.

609
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,000
Don't feed the beast.

610
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,340
Because, you see, there's a conspiracy

611
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,180
and a lot of our own officials in America

612
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,880
are a part of that conspiracy.

613
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,480
And we're no longer the free land that we ought to be.

614
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,920
Now, here are some of the executive orders

615
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,920
and I believe you need to know what some of them are.

616
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,960
This is not all of them.

617
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,960
But there they are.

618
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,540
There's some of the things that they can do.

619
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,160
Take a moment to read that, please.

620
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,420
They can seize all communications media.

621
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,160
Seize all electric power, fuels, minerals,

622
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,500
both public and private.

623
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,140
What do you think caused them to shut the power down

624
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,540
in 15 of our states out in the northwest recently?

625
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,300
They'd been doing it over two or three states

626
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,140
and now they've tried it on a regional scale.

627
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,180
This wasn't an accident.

628
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,600
I talked to an electrical engineer that's involved in that

629
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,840
and he said, we made sure after the brownout in New York

630
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,140
many years ago, that such a thing

631
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,280
could not happen again.

632
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,800
We had interlocking grids so the power would be there

633
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,420
from one source to the other and suddenly

634
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,440
these things all go down at once?

635
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,540
That was not a happenstance or an accident.

636
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,420
That was a trial run.

637
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,680
I like to call it what it really is, a dress rehearsal.

638
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,680
And if you've ever been in a play,

639
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,080
when do you have the dress rehearsal?

640
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,380
Right before the real thing.

641
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,500
It's a terrible audience.

642
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,000
So it's a good time.

643
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:45,060
It's a good time to go to the theatre and have fun,

644
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,060


645
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,400
And it's a good time to try and get your head around it.

646
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,640
You're an interesting species.

647
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,380
An interesting mix.

648
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,920
And dear friends, this is an interesting mix of ESO

649
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,280
and I started throwing in Suzie the Floozy's

650
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,880
incredible conspiracy collage from her conspiracy show

651
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,760
from March 14th on Bob's Slacktime Fun House

652
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:14,060
on WREK, Atlanta. Praise WREK and praise Susie for this unbelievable barrage with

653
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,600
which we will now continue. Thank you.

654
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,540
So when I say that a takeover is imminent, I am giving the reasons why I have said that.

655
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,560
Mr. Reagan doesn't believe in economic sanctions against the government of South Africa.

656
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,780
Secretary of State George Shultz, representing the Council on Foreign Relations and their

657
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,840
international global plans for one world government, very often he makes decisions

658
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,320
related to the CFR, not to the Secretary of State, that would really be to the benefit

659
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,740
of the United States. Frankly, he makes me sick. But that's a personal opinion. Meanwhile,

660
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,340
you have produced some, what I call, subversive organizations that aren't necessarily Union

661
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:58,880
Jack, Old Glory, Apple Pie, and July the 4th. And the CFR, in my estimation, works far more

662
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,840
for world government than it does for the government of the United States. And that

663
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,820
brings me to the other one that you saw on the screen, TLC.

664
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:11,780
That is not tender loving care. That's the Trilateral Commission, which, by the way,

665
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,200
is part of the Fed, in a sense, because they're all tied into the Federal Reserve System,

666
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,740
the Council on Foreign Relations.

667
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:23,060
I happen to believe that this nation needs to be able to conduct deniable, covert

668
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:30,460
operations. I believe that this president, like all presidents, needs to have an ability

669
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,800
to dissociate himself from those activities, and that the U.S. role should remain the same.

670
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:35,960
That's the only way to do it.

671
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,100
I believe that the U.S. role should be hidden, or deniable, and not be revealed. God bless

672
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,520
America.

673
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,840
Oh, no. Aliens, bio-duplication, nude conspiracies. Oh, my God. Linda LaRouche was right.

674
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:54,920
My fellow Americans, you have a choice to make on Tuesday. You choose whether to continue

675
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:00,280
forward on the path which we've forged, or to move in a different direction. America

676
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,680
is at peace, and we're prosperous once more. The dreams of the next decade lie in your hands.

677
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,420
Bill Island,

678
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:19,980
The

679
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,800
World

680
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:30,060
of obtaining

681
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,420
slavery

682
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,800
until it breadies

683
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,780
vote Republican. Up and down the ticket. To continue the change we began...

684
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,180
There is no stopping what has happened in the motorcade group. There has been a shooting.

685
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,020
I repeat, a shooting in the motorcade in the downtown area.

686
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,120
We needed the theory of some guy on the grassy knoll who's responsible for all this

687
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,660
and lo and behold it's Falwell on the grassy knoll. Someone still needs to explain.

688
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,860
But I don't even want to hear the words grassy knoll.

689
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:10,220
The Illuminati worshippers of Satan the Devil is now infiltrated into the United States of America.

690
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:16,280
The very highest office of the land is now occupied by one of their agents.

691
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:27,540
Bill Jor-o, Rock the chip. Bill Jor-o, Rock the chip. Bill Jor-o, Rock the chip. Bill Jor-o, Rock the chip. Bill Jor-o, Rock the chip.

692
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,100
Humanoids, humanoids, humanoids from the deep.

693
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,020
Ladies and gentlemen,

694
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,840
you may be seated.

695
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,220
You've heard about it, read about it, but have you ever seen a psychedelic circus?

696
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,300
Those innocent fun games of the hallucination generation?

697
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:47,320
Here you will meet the swingers, the hipsters, the beatniks, and the acid heads who live from pill party to pill party.

698
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,320
Hello listeners.

699
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,320
Yeah, they're all...

700
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:57,360
Every one of you, Bob and Friday and me and Chaz and Dave, we love each and every one of you individually.

701
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,820
And we wish that we could throw our arms around you and put our disease in you.

702
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,960
Each one of you.

703
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,520
We wish we could throw up on you.

704
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:12,280
We would like to squish the super essence of each and every one of you right out into a little jar and drink it right down like it was an orange juice.

705
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:12,820
You people listening, yes.

706
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,860
I'd like to grind you all into fudge.

707
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:21,740
We'd like to take everything that's in your wallets and look at it all and make sure it's all okay and take it off to the analog.

708
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,860
We'd like to have you donate your very organs to us.

709
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,480
We love you so, so, ever so much.

710
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:30,880
I love you so much.

711
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,700
Here he goes about the organ.

712
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,480
I just want to flay you alive and keep your skin as a rug.

713
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,660
I will turn your skin inside out and wear it so that you'll always be close to me.

714
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,140
That's how much I love you.

715
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,860
That is a deep, deep love right there.

716
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,060
Yeah.

717
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,700
If I had anybody want to blame me...

718
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,820
It sounds to me like that's the kind of love that's only skin deep.

719
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,480
Tell me something, doctor.

720
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,680
Why do you think these aliens would go to all this trouble, bring you tens of thousands of dollars a day, and then you'd be like, oh, I'm going to die.

721
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,380
If you just had thousands of light years, then they'd just send you home without a single shred of proof.

722
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,100
You said that's how it's been done for billions of years?

723
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:14,120
Things are bad enough without the size of your organ adding even more misery to the troubles of the world.

724
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:14,480
Right on!

725
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,160
Right on!

726
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,180
Don't move.

727
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,340
Don't look at me.

728
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,180
Don't touch me.

729
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,060
I will kill you!

730
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,840
Most people are indoors people, but I think they want to be outdoor, but they don't know

731
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,180
how to get outside and enjoy it.

732
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,700
These are not the things that's meant to do.

733
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,180
Place all valuables in the yellow envelope.

734
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,420
Place all valuables in the yellow envelope.

735
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:06,740
I've thought for whom the bell tolls, because they're not going to tell you.

736
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,080
That's the truth, Dane.

737
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,080
The truth will drive you completely mad.

738
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,880
They will not tell you.

739
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:18,200
You can interview them at their house as they come out the back door trying to escape the

740
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
rest of the mediums.

741
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,200
Some of the psychics have traveled thousands of miles to get out there, and they still

742
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:23,400
know.

743
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:23,400


744
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,740
There's no ways of hiding out in the little mole holes, but they're not going to tell

745
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,360
you who the bells are tolling for.

746
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,020
They're not going to tell you.

747
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,800
They're going to make evasive statements.

748
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,400
They're going to point skyward.

749
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,600
They're going to maybe like do the theremin dance with their 2D whistle, or they were

750
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,680
just going to come out and fabricate lies to you.

751
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,980
What are you going to do?

752
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:49,740
You're going to sit there as smug as a bug named Doug and put some of that weird stuff

753
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:53,380
that you got to close up your psychosilicebens or your conleukin.

754
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,740
You're going to sit there and make a brain make a brain.

755
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,260
I'm sorry.

756
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,340
I'm sorry.

757
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,780
I just went on too long.

758
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,500
I'm sorry, man.

759
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,220
I don't know what I'm saying.

760
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,540
Sorry.

761
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,760
Back up.

762
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:06,860
DNA.

763
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,140
Sorry.

764
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,900
Ugly bag of water.

765
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,680
.

766
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:21,500
.

767
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:21,500


768
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,200

769
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:42,460

781

782
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:01,680


783
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:01,680


784
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:01,680


785
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:01,680


786
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:01,680

794
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,120

796
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:14,800


797

.

798
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,220


799
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,220


800
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,220


801
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,220


802
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,220


803
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,220


804
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,220


805
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,880
I mean, you know, how come we're sitting here laughing?

806
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,160
You know, maybe there is something we should keep our...

807
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,900
I don't think we should have faith or anything like that.

808
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,360
I wanted to grind my head in the blender a few times myself, but...

809
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,940
Maybe there is some way out of all this. I don't know what...

810
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,320
I have faith in you, Dave.

811
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,980
I don't see how you could have faith in anyone, even a person or even a number of people.

812
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,900
It's just your head, Dave.

813
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,400
Dave, that's the only thing I have faith in.

814
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,280
That beautiful, empty head.

815
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,940
That one pure thought vibrating inside of it.

816
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,900
A candle flame.

817
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,000
Like one of those crystals that keeps climbing your watch.

818
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,400
Oh, yeah.

819
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,580
The one thought, one head, one day.

820
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,020
We're climbing through this little town and going down Main Street.

821
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,420
And I see someone through a plate that's willing to look at us.

822
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,540
And they're so, like, awed.

823
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:10,880
You know, the...

824
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,740
Mouth drops open.

825
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,980
It's like, my gosh, what's going on here?

826
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,040
So, I see the man just grab something from his desk and run out to the window.

827
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,940
Run out the front door.

828
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,080
And so, I look back every once in a while.

829
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,060
This guy is kind of walking behind us or half running behind us.

830
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,080
And finally, we get to the edge of town.

831
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,780
It's misting, rain, a bit rainy.

832
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,600
And he says, hey!

833
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,420
I didn't want to interrupt you.

834
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,140
I thought you might be making a movie or something.

835
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,860
It's like, no, no, we're not making a movie.

836
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,720
And he says, but you guys look so real.

837
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,260
I mean, you really look real.

838
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,000
And I was like, I think it probably is because we really are real.

839
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,040
Jesus Christ, what the hell is going on down there?

840
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,800
This big commotion down there.

841
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,640
They was tacking the kid up.

842
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,920
They was banging nails in his hands.

843
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,200
Well, I sent somebody up to tell God.

844
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,020
And I shot down there to help the kid out.

845
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:09,100
Well, by the time I got down there, they put him in a cave and rolled a rock in front of him.

846
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,700
Well, I rolled a rock.

847
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:09,700


848
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,320
I rolled a rock out and took the kid out and took him up to his father.

849
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,660
And he's doing fine now.

850
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,700
So, Dave, how you been doing on building your own ship?

851
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,860
I've been dreaming.

852
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,340
You getting down to the garage there at least?

853
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,240
Getting some work in there?

854
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,900
No time after work there or something?

855
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,920
Yeah, I went into the garage and had me a couple beers.

856
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,700
But something about them beers, it's a little fishy.

857
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,620
They taste like chocolate.

858
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,320
Yeah, if you're not supposed to be sitting around drinking beers, you're supposed to be working on your rocket ship.

859
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,840
Well, they shit as long as I can.

860
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,560
They see me.

861
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,200
I want it.

862
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,620
I want it.

863
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,760
I want it.

864
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:40,760


865
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:40,760


866
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:40,760


867
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:40,760


868
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:40,760


869
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,420
I can have as many beers as I can drink.

870
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,100
Well, you ain't going anywhere then.

871
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,840
I can see that.

872
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,220
We're going to get left behind just like it all in mother parts.

873
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,920
Look at this here, man.

874
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,240
You think I've been crying in the dark, man?

875
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:52,960
Look, look, look.

876
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,020
Okay, get back in here.

877
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,500
Okay.

878
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,840
Get back in here.

879
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,240
We ordered up six fuel rockets this week alone.

880
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:00,800
Look at them.

881
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,040
They're back behind the old refrigerator back here.

882
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,020
We got two launches going up next week.

883
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,100
Look at it, man.

884
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,840
Come on over here.

885
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,620
Just walk over here.

886
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,780
Let's see what you got.

887
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,140
Say.

888
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:14,720
See? Look, man. I've been taking all the beer cans, and I've been putting them on the underbelly.

889
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,160
There's no way these things are going to burn up in space, man.

890
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,260
Once I get out there...

891
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:18,900
Is that your heat shield?

892
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,720
Yeah, that's not only a heat shield.

893
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:27,580
See, once they're crested, they start popping apart again like that, and then it'll be like a form of thermal insulation on it.

894
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,560
So that way...

895
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,240
Yeah, that's my heat shield.

896
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,900
Look at this part over here.

897
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,880
Look at all these bottles when I'm down here.

898
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,020
There.

899
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:35,860
Yeah.

900
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,180
Yeah, there's two goes around back here and stuff.

901
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,600
That's what's going to get me off.

902
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,220
I've never seen anything like it before.

903
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,240
That's where I'm putting the solid fuel in all them old beer bottles, see?

904
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,400
And it's really unique, Dave.

905
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,640
And then a little thrust will come out of the bottle opening.

906
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,240
Boom.

907
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,120
Hey, didn't you hear it right off of the bottle rocket?

908
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:54,900
Just think of it.

909
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,040
So when they're all lined up, look.

910
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,440
Look at how they're all lined up.

911
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:57,880
They're going to go...

912
00:39:59,240 --> 00:39:59,780
Moving on.

913
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,380
It's an end.

914
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:00,960
It's an end.

915
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,020
It's an end.

916
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,160


917
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,040
It's an end.

918
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,800
It's an end.

919
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,440
It's an end.

920
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:03,600
It's an end.

921
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:03,600


922
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:03,600


923
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:03,760
It's an end.

924
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:03,920
It's an end.

925
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,940
It's an end.

926
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,160
It's an end.

927
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:35,740
It's an end.

928
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:35,740


929
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:35,740


930
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:35,740


931
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:35,740


932
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:35,740


933
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:35,740


934
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:35,740


935
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,700
This is a true subgenius vehicle.

936
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,420
It's amazing.

937
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,520
I'm not sure it'll fly, but...

938
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,120
Don't get me out of that old bullshambles.

939
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,080
I think it's got the stuff on it.

940
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,720
I think your ship is okay, but I'm not sure about your propulsion system here.

941
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,800
Sort of total, complete silence and that beautiful view.

942
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,640
And the realization, of course, that you're going 25,000 miles an hour.

943
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,120
Do you like dogs like that?

944
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,460
Mommy.

945
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,500
Once the havoc is over, every mother's son remaining alive will try to get here and climb

946
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:04,720
aboard.

947
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:04,920
I don't know.

948
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,560
People are more civilized than that.

949
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,180
They know only a handful can make the flight.

950
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,580
You spend too much time with the stars.

951
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,320
You don't know anything about living.

952
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,820
The law of the jungle.

953
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,680
The human jungle.

954
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,660
We are men.

955
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,120
Are we not?

956
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:18,940
Did I do that?

957
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,900
I don't even remember doing that.

958
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,640
At other times, a re-experience occurs through nightmares.

959
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,840
Am I right?

960
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,600
Am I wrong?

961
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,600
I just feel like I'm falling apart.

962
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,120
Don't look at me.

963
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,900
There's only one thing you can do, people.

964
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,620
I'm afraid there's only one thing to do.

965
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,760
Build your own ship.

966
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,080
Build your own ship.

967
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,180
Build your own ship.

968
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,920
Build your own ship.

969
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,660
You can build them out of styrofoam.

970
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,600
You can build them out of, say, a little piece of aluminum foil you've been keeping in your backyard.

971
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,840
I know some of you have a...

972
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,000
Cheese.

973
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,760
Some of you have bundled cheese balls.

974
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,640
Lots of cheese.

975
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,300
And some of you have, like, spare car parts.

976
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,780
We need all kinds of spare car parts.

977
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,520
Don't take them down to the yard.

978
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,500
Bring them to us.

979
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,800
Because we're gonna make them.

980
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,560
Bring them forward, children.

981
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:13,280
If your heart's been aching as we've been doing here, you need to bring forward...

982
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,540
What?

983
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,640
You need to bring forward those hubcaps and those distributor caps.

984
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,180
And...

985
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,220
We need to come forward.

986
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,760
So at this time, we'd like to invite you.

987
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,440
And bring your baseball caps, too.

988
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,600
We don't have any uniforms or cool stuff like that.

989
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,200
We need people to know we're kind of different.

990
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:27,540
We're...

991
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,680
So we'd like to invite you right now to get up out of your chair.

992
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,240
And if you should come forward, come to the front where the altar is.

993
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,580
In your own home, you know the altar is probably your television shed.

994
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,880
But right now, it's your radio.

995
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,400
Yeah.

996
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,700
Get down on your knees.

997
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,400
Get down on your knees, right.

998
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,840
And get in front of your radio.

999
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,380
Put your headphones on.

1000
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:44,700
Put your headphones on.

1001
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:45,860
Yeah.

1002
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,460
And turn it up as very loud as you possibly can.

1003
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:48,820
Yeah.

1004
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:48,940
Yeah.

1005
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,880
And turn all the bass up.

1006
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,280
And if you've got one of those real nice systems, turn on the sensor on.

1007
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,220
Reverb.

1008
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,080
Yeah.

1009
00:42:59,240 --> 00:42:59,720
That's it.

1010
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,480
As you're down on your knees, that tear trickles down your cheek.

1011
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,480
Dave's got it.

1012
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,680
He's going to wipe that tear off your cheek.

1013
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,900
If you're lucky, I'm not.

1014
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,920
With a baseball bat.

1015
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,960
I'm going to use Sam Slammy's handkerchief to wipe your nostrils with, kids.

1016
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,900
But I know not many of you are going to be crying because you're all inspired tonight.

1017
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:18,660
So shed a tear.

1018
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,220
That's right.

1019
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,820
You are born again.

1020
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,940
You are born again in the solid rocket fuel.

1021
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,540
Walk into it.

1022
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,300
Walk into that rocket fuel.

1023
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,900
Immerse yourself in it.

1024
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:29,480
Sure.

1025
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,060
If you hit it really hard, it's just solid.

1026
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,580
It's solid as a rock.

1027
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:38,740
But if you ease into it, you have to ease slowly into the solid fuel.

1028
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,320
And then it's real liquid.

1029
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,460
It's like jello.

1030
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,980
That's right.

1031
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,860
Then you just light a match, kids.

1032
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,580
Light that rocket.

1033
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:56,700
Like Alan Shepard said, why don't you fix your little problem and light this candle.

1034
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,160
Bless St. Alan Shepard.

1035
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,560
You were St. Alan Shepard.

1036
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:03,560


1037
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:03,560


1038
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,660
Alan Shepard is right now sitting on the right hand of the Lard.

1039
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,860
Along with St. Gus Grissom.

1040
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,560
St. who is the Russian guy that died?

1041
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:21,420
Snaggleroff.

1042
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:23,800
Snagglepuss.

1043
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,940
Snagglepuss was cut from the team because he had problems with his dentures.

1044
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,000
And they didn't want anybody, especially the Russian team, they were showing him off a lot.

1045
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:37,440
They were showing him off like Soviet Socialist Republics with them big parades with the red flags and everything.

1046
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,060
And they bring this guy out and his dentures are hanging out of his face.

1047
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,320
And they said this guy is not good for public relations.

1048
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,600
We got to have a real handsome like, you know, guy with a crew cut like the Americans have.

1049
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,580
So they got a bunch of them guys.

1050
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,620
There was Lipschitz.

1051
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,400
There was Schweinholtz.

1052
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,880
There was Krupp.

1053
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,720
No, there was Zolbotz-Parmakorkov.

1054
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,740
And Betty Boop.

1055
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,240
Somehow they got her out of contract.

1056
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,900
And she was going to be the first female Soviet astronaut.

1057
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:11,340
But as she was only an animated character and her contract was only under a six-month indebiture,

1058
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,800
they had to enlist her in one of those Eisenstein movies.

1059
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,000
So if you look very carefully on Battleship Potemkin,

1060
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:23,320
you can actually see Betty Boop behind one of them sailors waving a red flag.

1061
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:30,200
It's amazing how you can go back and forth in time after you've watched cartoons all night and smokefrog.

1062
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:31,960
Smoke that.

1063
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,400
Take two of those lysine.

1064
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,240
There's one of tyranols and secondols and N-R-Nep.

1065
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,940
There's a methadryl.

1066
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,720
And that's infantil.

1067
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,320
It's baby food.

1068
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,440
I can't eat anymore of that stuff.

1069
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,520
And, uh...

1070
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,320
Hey, what was I talking about again?

1071
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:49,920
.

1072
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,640
You were talking about when you and I, Dave,

1073
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,780
were gonna write that symphony from the New World.

1074
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,900
Only we're not talking about symphony from this New World.

1075
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,160
No, not the European New World.

1076
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,800
We're talking about the Deep Space New World.

1077
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,880
When are we gonna write that symphony for the real...

1078
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,640
New World?

1079
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,760
Well, we got this guy, the bar jack.

1080
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,220
He used to hang around the bowling alley with my dad.

1081
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,340
And he claimed that he knew a way...

1082
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,860
Well, he was actually inspired by the star people in here.

1083
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,880
He never played the accordion before in his life.

1084
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,280
And he always felt that his homeland

1085
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,220
was in a place beyond the stars somewhere.

1086
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,400
So he never said the old country

1087
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,420
when he talked about his land back far away.

1088
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,820
He always referred to it as the old planet.

1089
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,040
And we know that when you come up with

1090
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,920
goofy cartoon interplanetary names,

1091
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,360
they usually start with a Z, like Zarkov

1092
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,400
or Zoltan and stuff like that.

1093
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,900
But he really did have an Uncle Zoltan on the planet Venus.

1094
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,920
And he wrote him letters every day.

1095
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,120
He wasn't sure he'd ever get them,

1096
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,080
but it didn't stop him from writing because he had faith.

1097
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,260
And he knew if someone else in his family

1098
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,280
had made it before, coming this way,

1099
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,140
he'd wave bye-bye on the other side of the ancestral pole,

1100
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:03,960
going that way.

1101
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,080
And that's why he decided not only to build his own,

1102
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,700
but just to climb to the top of the highest mountain

1103
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,400
and pass some waves on it.

1104
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,440
Kiss your ass goodbye.

1105
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,540
And stand up on that rocket and...

1106
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,660
Kiss your little DNA level seed goodbye.

1107
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,280
Kiss four billion years of evolution goodbye.

1108
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,160
Goodbye.

1109
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,420
Goodbye.

1110
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,500
Bye.

1111
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,140
Bye.

1112
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,940
See you around.

1113
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:34,380
You know, it's been nice.

1114
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,320
It's been a nice ride.

1115
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,840
From molten lava to blue-green algae

1116
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,000
to little critters

1117
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,040
to ugly bags of water.

1118
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,700
In an instant.

1119
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,240
In an instant, that's right.

1120
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,520
And now it's all imploding back in on itself.

1121
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,260
We've reached the point where we can't even

1122
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:57,260


1123
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,340
We've reached that critical mass in the universe.

1124
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,820
You don't realize it yet,

1125
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,120
but the universe is actually not spreading apart anymore.

1126
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,080
It's shrinking now.

1127
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,260
It's going to slowly, slowly at first,

1128
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,020
then very quickly,

1129
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,620
all in a moment,

1130
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:16,640
just go right back to that infinitesimally small

1131
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,780
and unimaginably dense point of nothing.

1132
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,960
Yes, if some of you are astute enough,

1133
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,860
you can notice right now your hands are getting smaller.

1134
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,720
Look down.

1135
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,420
Your feet are getting smaller.

1136
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,020
Your fingertips.

1137
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:29,560
Your nails.

1138
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:29,980
Your fingertips.

1139
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,260
The top of your head is getting smaller.

1140
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,040
It's becoming a little point.

1141
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,980
It's not going at the same rate of speed as the rest of your face.

1142
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,500
No, the top is smaller.

1143
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,520
Your head is shrinking.

1144
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,860
In the name of John Glenn, amen.

1145
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:54,600
Come on, baby, let me tell you about a place that ain't far from here

1146
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,680
It's in our house

1147
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,980
Come on, baby, let me tell you about a place that ain't far from here

1148
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,120
It's in our house

1149
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:44,680
Well, says you coming over

1150
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,080
Oh man, you know

1151
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,780
The grass is always greener

1152
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,500
In another solar system

1153
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,280
The sky is always bluer

1154
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,920
The sun is always gold

1155
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,480
Come on, let's take a drive

1156
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,580
Come on, let's take a little ride

1157
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,260
Come on, baby, take a little ride

1158
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,460
To the end of the cosmos

1159
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,660
Come on, baby, let's take a little ride

1160
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,720
To the end of the cosmos

1161
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,720
Come on naturally

1162
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,460
We're looking for the truth

1163
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,660
Let's get you love

1164
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,680
The flight that ties us all

1165
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,720
The Marcus and the Marcus

1166
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,060
And you and my baby

1167
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:23,440
And you got the feeling

1168
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,180
That we're gonna fly

1169
00:51:55,180 --> 00:52:01,420
halls, we walk in talking circuits near, then one day all the switches and the mics and

1170
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:06,480
cages and dials all baking red light from lab rats and test tubes and biological goo

1171
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,640
came to life and became you.

1172
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:19,780
So far to go, so far to roam, so far to walk, are we walking alone?

1173
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:26,920
Somebody's watching, somebody knows, each one of us hides now and then in shadows.

1174
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:37,420
At the end of the month, we know what we can do, now that you are here, now that you grew,

1175
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:42,860
at least a few hearts, and cry in the night, and wake and roll over, then sleep again tight,

1176
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,280
each breath we take just to exhale, at once a puddle of purple and pale,

1177
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,680
slither and slide.

1178
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:53,820
And go on tail, and stood up in the valley, and left under sail.

1179
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:02,660
Left under sail, cosmic sail, sailing on the solar wind.

1180
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,440
Yee-haw!

1181
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,600
Right on, little doggy!

1182
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:18,040
Should've come on back to war trade, by the way, it ain't far from here, it's in the United States.

1183
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,680
I dreamt of you in the media, as we're going by.

1184
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,800
Ooh, that's where you are.

1185
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:39,200
I say, come on, baby, let me have a snack, come on.

1186
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:46,180
I said, come on, baby, let me tell you about a place, it ain't far from here, it's in outer space.

1187
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:51,540
I said Come on, baby, let me tell you about a place, it ain't far from here, it's in outer space.

1188
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,420
I said, come on, come on, baby, let me tell you about a place,

1189
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,860
it ain't far from here, it's in outer space.

1190
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:02,260
I said, come on, come on, I said, come on, baby, let me tell you about a place, it ain't far from here, it's in outer space.

1191
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:14,600
There's so many Lycians form our home, the Constellation Orion is next to Ursa, the bear.

1192
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:20,400
As you look in the midsummer sky, you can also see Castle and Pollux dancing by.

1193
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:28,440
Sophia, Cassandra, Cleopias, Barnaby, the one-faced dog boy.

1194
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:35,560
Gleecus, Rondo, the fields of lab, the castle of lab.

1195
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,480
Just kidding, just kidding.

1196
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:56,680
I said, come on, baby, let me tell you about a place that ain't far from here, it's in outer space.

1197
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,160
They've got good chicken there.

1198
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,140
The weight of a grudge, the odor of death.

1199
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,320
The taste of remorse.

1200
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,600
Yeah, I tasted it.

1201
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,200
That's right.

1202
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:16,860
I swallowed it.

1203
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:17,440
Yeah.

1204
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,340
I swallowed it.

1205
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:18,980
Yeah.

1206
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,420
I swallowed it.

1207
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,020
Yeah.

1208
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,380
I swallowed it.

1209
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:22,900
Yeah.

1210
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,420
Or the color of joy.

1211
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:26,620
Ah, yeah.

1212
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,660
It's another way.

1213
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,380
What's the color of joy?

1214
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,120
What is that?

1215
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:29,960
What comes to your mind?

1216
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:36,280
Dink boy, dink boy, dink boy, dink boy, dink boy, dink boy, dink boy, dink boy.

1217
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,800
Do you like dogs and fish?

1218
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,080
I repeat, all this depends on Bronson's findings being correct.

1219
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,280
This is not a publicity-seeking campaign.

1220
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,860
We are completely aware that most of our colleagues ridicule our findings.

1221
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,300
But believing what we do, we have no choice but to ask for this hearing.

1222
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,920
With enough funds, labor and material, rocket ships can be built.

1223
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Rocket ships can be built.

1224
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,120
Rocket ships can be built.

1225
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,360
They think you're a crackpot.

1226
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,020
I know.

1227
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,320
Proposition still stands.

1228
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,320
Your money for your life.

1229
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:05,300
My pizza's not to eat, babe.

1230
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:05,780
Okay?

1231
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,860
Hello birdies, hello spring.

1232
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,480
Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering.

1233
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,260
You know I can't refuse.

1234
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,020
Build it!

1235
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,200
Pull up!

1236
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:22,820
Get herucker!

1237
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,720
Get herucker!

1238
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:23,940
Get herucker!

1239
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:24,720
Get herucker!

1240
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:25,920
Get herucker!

1241
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,040
Get herucker!

1242
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,700
Thank you.

1243
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,020
Thank you.

1244
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,660
Thank you.

1245
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:18,460
Thank you.

1246
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,000
Thank you.

1247
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,280
Thank you.

1248
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,400
Thank you.

1249
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,020
Thank you.

1250
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,280
