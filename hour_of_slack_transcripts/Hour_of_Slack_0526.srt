1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,060
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,640
Oh, well, listen.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,440
I think your first responsibility is to yourself and your family.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:12,940
What?

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:13,980
Thanks for the call.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,840
Hello, you're on Pennywise with Jim Phillips, and you are...

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:17,960
Bob.

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,520
Okay, let's go to line four.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,580
This is Pennywise.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,600
I'm Jim Phillips, and your name is...

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:22,920
Bob.

12
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:23,280
Yeah.

13
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,400
Commercials.

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:24,940
Hello, caller.

15
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,640
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,300
Yeah, and your name is...

17
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:29,580
Bob.

18
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,300
Hi, Bob.

19
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,340
What can I do for you?

20
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,040
What?

21
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:33,580
Go ahead.

22
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,480
Hello, this is Timothy Larry reminding you that just as you need slack,

23
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,960
KNON needs your help.

24
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,440
Send in those pledges and praise Bob.

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,440
I want him.

26
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,220
I don't know who he is.

27
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,620
But I know where he is.

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,720
The subgenius.

29
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,320
Our own SWAT.

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,160
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,380
The spirit world, man.

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,300
You see, it's always the same.

33
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,380
There's no stopping what can't be stopped.

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,680
No killing what can't be killed.

35
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,600
He's our boss!

36
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,260
He's our boss!

37
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,220
He's our boss!

38
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,860
If you want it, here it is.

39
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,300
Come and get it.

40
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:42,300
You are about to experience a full-length subgenius show the way it was meant to be heard.

41
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,000
Eh, eh.

42
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,480
In full-frequency modulation stereophonic broadcast sound.

43
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,460
So relax.

44
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,760
Three beats per measure.

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,580
Sit back.

46
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,160
Exercise one.

47
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,220
And enjoy our feature presentation.

48
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:09,700
This is the story about the brave men and women in the Church of the Subgenius and all the things they did to get themselves evicted from the Hall of Shame and Narcolepsy on Fantasy Island.

49
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,820
But when you get right down to it, good triumphs over evil.

50
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,400
And the forces of light trample into bloody pulp the sickly powers of darkness.

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,940
So remember as we wander through this charnel house, this abattoir we call life,

52
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,840
that even though the future promises nothing,

53
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,900
destruction looms ahead.

54
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,600
And the end of all joys, old age, robs us of everything worth having.

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,780
There are some nice things in life, like a shaft of sunlight drifting down, down...

56
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,740
Down to what to do next.

57
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,800
You know, what is this thing called slack?

58
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,460
What is this slack?

59
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,240
Slack is slack.

60
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,440
You pink!

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,900
You don't know what this slack is.

62
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,560
You can't define slack.

63
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,600
Slack is slack.

64
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,540
Always there.

65
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,320
But it never grows and it never shrinks.

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,420
And you see, subgeniuses are special because they're the ones who...

67
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,020
I grow it. I'll sell it to you.

68
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:06,980
...who...

69
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,240
As I was saying to Bob just the other day,

70
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,340
dox old man, I said, I seem to have a restricted outlook on life nowadays.

71
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,040
It is as though my vision was surrounded by impermeable bands of copper.

72
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,280
And when I put my fingers through the holes,

73
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
I feel nothing inside.

74
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,040
Nothing, Dobbs, you hear me?

75
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,520
I feel nothing.

76
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,700
You know, ever since our introduction in early 1991,

77
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:47,420
the Bob Dobbs Plus version 6.04 has been the unsurpassed leader in fast, fully automated frustration for the radio.

78
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,980
The standard against which all other subgenius wasteware has been measured.

79
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,140
But all things must pass.

80
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:59,560
On July 29th, 1991, the mantle was passed to the new standard.

81
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,640
Bob Dobbs Plus version 7.

82
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,100
Available.

83
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,400
In view of the tremendous aggravation produced by the current version,

84
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,920
many users have asked, why come out with a new version?

85
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,720
Bob Dobbs is already the most hateful program on the market.

86
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,480
I can't even dump the damn thing from my tuner as it is.

87
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,280
The answer is simple.

88
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,140
We take our responsibility as the tautology leader seriously.

89
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,960
Seriously.

90
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:32,420
Like its predecessors, version 7 represents a quantum leap in the ease of confusion, downtime, and advanced audio system bugs.

91
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,020
Ha.

92
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,460
Yes, still reference.

93
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,280
I get confused by all the claims made for these.

94
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:50,840
This profits the radio ground whose powers come from the thunder eons shall be transformed over man.

95
00:04:50,840 --> 00:05:03,620
They shall be the masters of the doors to the new Jerusalem from a narrow front height which is my sign and are sons of the image of my chosen one who is a fool.

96
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,160
It's from the other side.

97
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,980
I can feel him all around.

98
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,820
You can't see the eyes of the demon.

99
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,400
Until him come calling.

100
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,220
This is Dreadmon.

101
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,280
Truly great.

102
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,680
No, no, no.

103
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,280
No.

104
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,040
No.

105
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,840
No.

106
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,140


107
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,240


108
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,240


109
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,240


110
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,240


111
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,240


112
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,240


113
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,240


114
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,040
No.

115
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,500
No.

116
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,920
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sets adjusted.

117
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,280
We are having operating difficulties which has necessitated a delay in the beginning of our Sunday movie.

118
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,520
It's such a wonderful life.

119
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,680
It's a wonderful life.

120
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,580
It's a wonderful life.

121
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,340
It's a wonderful life.

122
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:05,060
And now we don't even force you to listen to the commercials about Bob Dobbs Plus 7,

123
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,600
which is, after all, the fastest gut blowout program ever created for the radio,

124
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,180
crashing it up to 10 megabytes per second on today's high-speed computer transmitters.

125
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,340
What? For time-consuming chores like fax modem harassment, faster is always better.

126
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:28,640
A plus version 7 hour of Slack features improved patent-permeable BlabPack compression cells.

127
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,260
Twang, twang, twang, twang.

128
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,880
And why don't you play some of the lovely cantrips of Jesus?

129
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,160
We don't have to hear this bad stuff all the time.

130
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,680
What a beautiful world it was.

131
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,940
What a wonderful world this could be.

132
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,160
We could all have radios in our heads, you know.

133
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,580
And listen to the show all the time. Wouldn't that be neat?

134
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,240
And you wouldn't know what to do.

135
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,620
You wouldn't know what's tape and what's real, what's live, who's there, why they're there.

136
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,620
Ugh, it's so neat.

137
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,400
The more faith you have in yourself and God, the more Slack you can attract.

138
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,860
Pull the world over your own eyes.

139
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:20,760
Because then you can really just pull the world over everybody's eyes and really see what's going on.

140
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,700
And you can show everybody, expose the identity of the world.

141
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,080
Right.

142
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,420
People saw finally.

143
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,720
I...

144
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,500
If I go into a war, they'll be like gerek kontroll biblin times and go like that.

145
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,520
You know, like...

146
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:52,520


147
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:52,520


148
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,740
Pod 살� kar car k composed hai kam si ba...

149
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,180
You are living in your passion.

150
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,240
But can you think of 바라밍 ska WiFi ma prisoners car to, you?

151
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,120
Well, lately things, they just doesn't seem the same.

152
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,280
Oh, I actin' funny, and I doesn't know why.

153
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,620
Excuse me while I kiss this guy.

154
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

155
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,260
Purple haze all around.

156
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,520
Don't know if I'm going up or down.

157
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,740
Am I happy or in misery?

158
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,100
What is this doll? Put a spell on me.

159
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

160
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,060
Can't live without a piece of magic.

161
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,500
Live here.

162
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,160
I got nothing to give you.

163
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,380
If you can't know your love to tell.

164
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,900
Scene two.

165
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:13,700


166
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:13,780


167
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:21,680
Yeah, I don't know if I'm going up,

168
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:21,680


169
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:21,680


170
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,420
I don't know.

171
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:28,720
Like I said, I don't have any room,

172
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,260
Promo haze all in my eyes

173
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,640
Don't know if it's day or night

174
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,960
You got me going and you blew my mind

175
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,280
Tomorrow or just the end of time

176
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,180
Isaac Hayes

177
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,820
Daddy Hayes

178
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,440
Willie Mays

179
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,940
Helen Hayes

180
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,500
Speaking of Helen, where does getting near go?

181
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,540
When the lights be closing your tidely lies

182
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,860
I'll soon be with you, my love

183
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,000
And give you that potato-headed surprise

184
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,880
Stay with me, darling

185
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,860
Soon

186
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,000
I'll stay with you till all them stars start from falling

187
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,160
And falling

188
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,560
I've been waiting so long

189
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,080
Till then, where am I going?

190
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,360
In the sunshine of your life

191
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,260
Oh, oh, oh

192
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,800
Now hold on just a second there

193
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,220
You leather-faced metal freak

194
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,620
And your potato-headed what-you-call-it

195
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,600
You're talking to her?

196
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,240
That's nice, huh?

197
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,880
Yeah, you bet I'm talking to you

198
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,600
I got something to say right here

199
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,920
Ain't you the man in black?

200
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,740
Just get your stuff ready

201
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,340
It's getting near dark

202
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,480
The lights shining through on you

203
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,460
I'll soon be with you, my love

204
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,360
Who knows?

205
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,560
It's the mornin'

206
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,520
And just we two

207
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,120
I'll be with you, darling, soon

208
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,700
I'll be with you, darling, soon

209
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,640
When the seas all dried up

210
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,220
Just seize the seas

211
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,740
Talking dried up

212
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,080
I'll seize you, baby

213
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,500
I'll see you soon

214
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,020
Shut up!

215
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,100
I said I'll be with you soon

216
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,620
Too very bad

217
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,460
I'm going out of my mind

218
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,700
I'm going out of my mind

219
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,860
Shut up, you!

220
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,640
I'm going out of my mind

221
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,380
I'm going out of my mind

222
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:28,680
I'm going out of my mind

223
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,940
Shut up now!

224
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:51,840
And if I never see you again

225
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,620
No, no, no colors

226
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:54,720
But a touching어주

227
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,520
My darling

228
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:08,420
that chair follow me we all know we're in the art of selling we share a mental and an emotional

229
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:15,760
climate of unconscious selling right in your own home and here's some more of it

230
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,160
the bible and bob are crazy the kind of crazy that comes from faith so when bob says you have

231
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:30,540
to spend money to make money he knows what he's talking about and so do i money is like the wind

232
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:37,700
you can only feel it when it's moving god bless you no mistake time does march on here now that

233
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:45,500
we have a new stereo stereo when everybody sells we're all selling but we all have something to

234
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,660
sell yes everyone's selling together mighty symphony of prosperity for we all have something

235
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,160
to sell

236
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,240
try to escape go ahead try and we're selling it

237
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:09,180
i don't expect you to swallow this tissue of absurdities i expect you to open your ears and

238
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:15,700
learn all this is secret revealed wisdom from subgenius headquarters itself and i don't want

239
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,540
any of you look at the date on this material it's back from the 1990s this is all outdated this is

240
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,120
now this is

241
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,340
the first generation that year now is 2025. can you actually believe that this was actually before

242
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,280
the exodus invasion this was actually before the liberation of the society

243
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:40,640
open your mind without judgment bolivia the tattooed lady people sure had it rough back

244
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,960
then didn't they use judgment yes doc i think if we just move this stone we can see the secrets

245
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,140
the secret of master control programming be careful of stones that you move aside you never know what's going to happen to you

246
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:02,740
under master control all things are equal seeming looking like and appearing to be are not properties of the object

247
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,080
give me a hand here move this stone will you

248
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:18,120
woe be to the one whose limits are so narrow as to believe that a thing is forever and immutably one specific and unalterable being

249
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,520
even the mountain

250
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:21,940
even the mountain

251
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,880
and all things

252
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,820
flow like water

253
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,420
and all things pass away from the eyes of the sons of men

254
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,680
i feel sleepy don't fall asleep it's the curse

255
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,660
i feel tired

256
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:42,640
i still think that people need to address the current problems addressing the past of the future generations

257
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:52,140
what we're looking at here is people living back in the 1990s and not seeing just how terrible they really have it after all it is only the current generation that has anything of any value in the world

258
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,140


259
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,140


260
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,940
we need to kind of have ceiling

261
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,180
then we need to respond to reality

262
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:02,160
and then we have to forward of each making purpose

263
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:06,860
studying

264
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:20,160
everything and how it's gonna happen

265
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:29,100
you by my evil duplicate in the vest pocket universe you know in the past

266
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,380
people actually tried to make themselves look younger and yet at the same time

267
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,540
they tried to get rid of those terrible zits well here in the future all adults

268
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,520
try to put on their oxy 510 which improves their remember reception

269
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,280
swings and terrible mutations which we call the balloon images which make them

270
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,540
all the germ of it at any rate back as far as the mid-1980s when the fashion of

271
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,200
looking ugly was just getting going since then the deliberate don't

272
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:03,700
cultivation of contrived ugliness has swept society to disappear well let's

273
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,720
just have a look at the current religious establishment how we take our

274
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,900
new revised biblical Bible oh dude look at these Ten Commandments they've all

275
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,620
been changed or should we say they've been modernized take for instance oh

276
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,980
rule number five that's an

277
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,140
I'm

278
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,260
I'm

279
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,380
I'm kill people wrote that back in the days when there weren't enough people

280
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,060
now of course the world's overpopulated there's 12 million people we don't need

281
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,800
them anymore so thou shalt kill enjoy it take for instance rule number three

282
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,840
thus are commendable three that was back in the days when people just needed

283
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,320
one wife but now of course we believe in bilingual misrelationships so you have

284
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,300
as many boys as you probably want now that says thou shalt not steal that's

285
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,400
back in the days when there was enough stuff to steal now everyone can still

286
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,000
do all the support their crack habits it's absolutely wonderful world that we

287
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,660
live in don't you think it all now I'm not quite sure

288
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:51,260
it's true being cool yeah this is more show than most folks can handle even handed

289
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:56,140
to him on the end of a shovel there's one thing I but only two ears you must

290
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,820
pick out one show and listen carefully

291
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,560
everyone put on your oxygen masks and don't panic this happens all the time around here

292
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,860
don't worry folks this is only the warm up for the real show of course I am I'm trying

293
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:14,540
to now there's some irrelevant jabbering it sounds like Mr. Magoo down there at the bottom

294
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,640
of the sound well and you know what come over here it's just a little bit more exciting

295
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,980
Well, that brings us to the fact that Master Control is the infinite computer lurking in the gravity well at the center of the universe.

296
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,620
It's simple. The transmitter of secret code messages from Orion, the alien brain implant.

297
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:36,120
Unlike puny, finite biological deities, Master Control does not crave our affection, weep for our failings, or punish our errors.

298
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:45,200
Master Control perceives no differences between self and not-self, but leaves such pastimes to the hollow, instrumental beings.

299
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,700
To create its endless patterns.

300
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,160
Never let it be said that those in control are indeed in control.

301
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,040
Well, that certainly applies in this case.

302
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,140
You know, we've got ten minutes left of show.

303
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,620
What?

304
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,500
Expose some religious secrets.

305
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,280
You mean we don't run on to 2 a.m. this time?

306
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,740
Actually, we've got 30 minutes of show left.

307
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,240
Well, that's a little bit better.

308
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:13,360
But that should not be interpreted in any way to think that anyone is actually endorsing or approving.

309
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,620
Look, if you don't watch out, I'm going to shift it into reality.

310
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,360
This show is being very disappointing.

311
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,680
I've been looking over the, uh, the, uh, the survey.

312
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:29,180
Our wonderful operator is taking these surveys, and the disapproval rating of this show is reaching 72%.

313
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:34,360
And I, I, I don't know how to explain it other than just saying that people are disappointed with what you're hearing.

314
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,240
Are we going to get more of that buttery-sugary popcorn at the end of this program?

315
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,340
You're damn right!

316
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,480
Oh, boy!

317
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,920
Well, in that case, the whole trip was...

318
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,180
You just fold the top of the bag and it fits into the oven. Place it over there.

319
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,780
I can't wait!

320
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,260
Put a blue bag on it, and it comes to support it.

321
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,620
Hold the top.

322
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,640
Oh, I don't want to hear what's in it. I just want to eat it.

323
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,580
Cool. Do not place bagel bagel platters, by the way, on your tables, which are not in the original part of the oven.

324
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,300
That's right. What if you could not place your caramel popcorn on the turntable?

325
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,800
Because it does make popping noises.

326
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,780
Count out to those of the specks of dust that get in between the booth and your record player.

327
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:12,320
Kirk, you should keep giving out that number so we can test the metal of the type of color that's been around here.

328
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,020
I'm ready!

329
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,380
Refreshment.

330
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:15,900
Refreshment.

331
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,460
For your enjoyment, there's hot, fresh popcorn.

332
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,980
Tempting, delicious hot dogs.

333
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,620
And so many kinds of ice cream.

334
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,180
And, of course, sparkling, delicious, ice cold Coca-Cola.

335
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,200
For everybody.

336
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,940
At the refreshment counter now.

337
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,280
Showtime. But now it's time to stretch.

338
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,380
And vent.

339
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,320
I just wish the subgenius would get in here so we can start the show.

340
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,960
Hot, cold Coca-Cola.

341
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,160
You know, people are going to realize that the subgenies couldn't make it.

342
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,960
And that this is all just a bunch of amateurs.

343
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,020
Taste a piece-a-dee-sa pizza for the taste of old Napoli.

344
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,260
You're doing a terrible imitation of Dr. Howe.

345
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,140
No one's going to believe that.

346
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,640
And that puzzling evidence, that sounds like they got it from the amusement park.

347
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:03,140
You know, if I could get a word in edgewise, I could tell you boys how to see your own brains by taking a candle and moving it.

348
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't think the audience is really ready for that.

349
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,080
All you need is one good, strong light source.

350
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,100
Please don't show them. They tend to get sick.

351
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,460
It's a wonderful trick.

352
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,140
I mean, once you see your own brain, you kind of realize that you yourself are nothing but a loser.

353
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,380
A little rubbery, gluey thing.

354
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,680
Surrounded by a vault of bone.

355
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,180
Enough of this trickery.

356
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,460
They know this is all just a hoax.

357
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,200
The subgenies aren't even here.

358
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,100
This is all just a bunch of amateurs faking it.

359
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,740
Dr. Howe, you don't look like that at all.

360
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,500
You're a girl, for heaven's sakes.

361
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,600
And who is this guy trying to pawn himself off his puzzling evidence?

362
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,040
I've seen better imitations at the freak show.

363
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,060
We've never even heard of a Polish prince.

364
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,020
And his father Joe Mama, he's a legacy of a myth.

365
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,020
He doesn't even exist.

366
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:44,860
So...

367
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,360
What's the matter?

368
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,240
Come on out in the open.

369
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,960
Admit it.

370
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,920
There is no Aunt Bertha in the studio.

371
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,500
There never was.

372
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:49,820
Stop doing that.

373
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,560
You're getting my dander up, young man.

374
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,820
We've been stood up.

375
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,980
Don't you understand the significance of this?

376
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,980
They told us they'd be here and they...

377
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,620
They sent Timmy and me to take their place.

378
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:07,560
And Papa Joe Mama specifically said that there'd be a donation to Aunt Bertha.

379
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,560
Dial a story.

380
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,940
Box 1.

381
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,680
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

382
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,640
Aunt Bertha the Troll has died.

383
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,240
We tried to get the information from him, but he couldn't stand the hunt yet.

384
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,960
It's not going to stand for this anymore.

385
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,000
All right.

386
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,840
If those subgenies say they're going to come here at 11 o'clock, we expect them to show up at 11 o'clock.

387
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,640
I left a message on their machine.

388
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,880
I don't mind telling you it's a little bit vicious.

389
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:32,200
I'm sick and tired of all these people that are just through their teeth.

390
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,720
It's like some big conspiracy.

391
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:34,760
All right.

392
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,360
All right.

393
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,380
Calm down, young man.

394
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,940
I'm going to squeeze until I feel the vertebrae between my fingers.

395
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,260
You need to read your Bible.

396
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,620
It's outrageous, I say.

397
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:49,300
You know, God has a special plan for you because you're a very special person.

398
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,100
Where are Billy and Timmy?

399
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,480
It's time for us to go because we're not wanted here.

400
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,840
I'm floating and I can't get down.

401
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,720
He's floating because he can't get down.

402
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,460
Aunt Bertha.

403
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,820
Let these silly young boys do the radio show by themselves.

404
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,580
We're obviously not needed here.

405
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,100
Aunt Bertha, Bobby was looking up your skirt when you weren't looking.

406
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,100
Who's Bobby?

407
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,760
Look at me.

408
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,120
Look at me.

409
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,560
Look at me.

410
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,020
Look at me.

411
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,280
Oh, it's Jimmy.

412
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,740
He just put on his Bobby mask so he could fake us out.

413
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,940
I don't know these boys and I never talk to Bobbies.

414
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,720
Come on.

415
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,780
Ah, that's my foot who locked.

416
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,160
Timmy, Billy, stop.

417
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,320
Aunt Bertha, he stuck his finger at my noo-noo.

418
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,500
He's looking at me.

419
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,020
Oh, my God.

420
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,740
You boys are going to have to have a special session behind the woodshed.

421
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,480
Where's Donald Trump when we need him?

422
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,400
That's where we always do all our fun stuff, isn't it, Jimmy?

423
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,080
Get my phone.

424
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,080


425
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,080


426
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,080


427
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,180
Come on.

428
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,560
Come on.

429
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,500
Put on the weird music.

430
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:44,900
Come on.

431
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,180
Come on.

432
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
I got to tell them all about master control programming.

433
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,120
This ain't entertaining.

434
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,600
You know, when I was walking...

435
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:59,080
Oh, that was, of course, Aunt Bertha and Timmy and Billy on, I believe, KZSU.

436
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,260
Yes.

437
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,380
Our father Joe Mama, Puzzling Evidence, Dr. Howell, and I don't know who the other person

438
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:04,520
is.

439
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,520
.

440
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:05,520


441
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,440
.

442
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:06,520
.

443
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:06,980
.

444
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,160
.

445
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:08,900
.

446
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,680
.

447
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:09,680


448
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,840
Are you ready?

449
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,040
Let's get started.

450
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,100
Here we go.

451
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:18,300
Let's get started.

452
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,300


453
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,300


454
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,300


455
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,300


456
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,440
.

457
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:18,820
.

458
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,100
.

459
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,580
.

460
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:26,800
.

461
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,560
Uh-oh!

462
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:27,560


463
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:27,560


464
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:27,560


465
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:27,560


466
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:27,560


467
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:27,560


468
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:27,560


469
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,240
.

470
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,240


471
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,240


472
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,240


473
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,240


474
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,560
Oh!

475
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,020
This is about to be a sheer holiday!

476
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,820
No time to play, niggas.

What?

491
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,880
Now, if you will flip this record over to the other side,

492
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,260
the testimonies and songs of the children will continue.

493
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,500
Ah, human soul fills a man's belly so well.

494
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,960
If only I had been able to stay asleep.

495
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,820
I had this nightmare.

496
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,020
I dreamed I was on an airplane from Dallas to San Francisco,

497
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,440
but there was problems with the engine or the runway or the landing gear,

498
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,420
and they couldn't land, and suddenly the captain sounded like Hal,

499
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:18,540
and all the stewardesses walking back and forth sounded like Mobius Rex were mumbling,

500
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:24,560
and then I turned around and sitting in the seat next to me was Gary Gabogman!

501
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,860
This is the Gobi Desert, and just fasten your safety belts.

502
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,880
This is a little brief period of turbulence.

503
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,820
More fog. More show.

504
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,640
That speck below us on the left is more.

505
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,840
Hey, am I allowed to smoke in here?

506
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,480
Sure, just try.

507
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,900
Sure. Sure, no problem, Paul.

508
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,640
It doesn't bother me a bit to watch you smoke, Paul.

509
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,240
I don't miss the cigarettes.

510
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,220
It's fine. It's no problem.

511
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,980
I'm all right. I'm all right.

512
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,060
I do not call it a mistake, a mendacity.

513
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,000
I call it a sin.

514
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,200
I call it a sin.

515
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:09,520


516
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,180
I call it a sin.

517
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:10,180


518
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,920
Perhaps flu-based is the word.

519
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,280
All right, all right. Thank you.

520
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,440
Just shake your cat on the sheet of paper.

521
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,740
Down here at the little live station with all the live little doctors,

522
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,580
we make you almost as free as Jesus at this hour.

523
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,920
Yes, but it costs the people of California a lot more than Jesus will ever cost them.

524
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,080
Their lives, their souls, and now, yes, we want their pocket change.

525
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,060
We want their pocket change.

526
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:47,060
And if you don't believe that, son, then you might just as well have shot that man J.R. Bob Dobbs yourself.

527
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,020
You might as well yourself have loaded that Saturday night special.

528
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,040
I did load the Saturday night special, but I handed it to Hatwood.

529
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:06,620
And you might as well have nailed J.R. Bob Dobbs' hands and feet up onto that cross along with Dean Woodman.

530
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,200
Hatwood.

531
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,420
Hatwood.

532
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:07,680
Hatwood.

533
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:16,980
You might just as well have dragged Bob's body through the streets, pelting him with rotten fruit.

534
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:24,800
You might just as well have performed that autopsy and thrown away the eight bullets that would have proved how many gunmen there really were.

535
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,220
We're all guilty.

536
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,460
Guilty.

537
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,740
Guilty.

538
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,740
Oh, does that mean we're show zone?

539
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,380
Yeah, show zone.

540
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:36,980
Okay, everybody.

541
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,860
Thanks for us.

542
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,160
Oh, boy.

543
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,960
That was easy.

544
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,620
I came all the way from Dallas for this.

545
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,860
And the audience is happy, too.

546
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,780
The show is over.

547
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,720
You were mentioning another thing about electricity, the electric world, which, of course, we are all a part of.

548
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,180
Which, of course, we are all a part of.

549
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,320
Which, of course, we are all a part of.

550
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,300
And I was reading the Jewish Daily Times today.

551
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,600
Like you do every day.

552
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,140
Yes.

553
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,480
Henry Jaglon gave it to me to read.

554
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,200
Jaglon.

555
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,300
Gesundheit.

556
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,900
Henry's son of avant-garde filmmaking.

557
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:15,400
Yes.

558
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,660
That's what it means in Yiddish, right?

559
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,740
I'd like to read you a true story.

560
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,080
All right.

561
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,060
Little Eli would eat only if his father played the elevator game with him.

562
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:32,460
Eli's mouth is the door to the elevator, and the food on the plate is people waiting to take the elevator and be carried down to their home in his stomach.

563
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,540
One day, Eli would not open his mouth.

564
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,740
Eli.

565
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:36,960
Eli.

566
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:36,960


567
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,580
His father said, open your door.

568
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,080
The people are waiting.

569
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,820
They want to go home.

570
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,060
No electricity, father, said Eli.

571
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,060
And he shut his mouth, never to open it again.

572
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,580
Yes, little known stories in the world of electricity.

573
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,500
About little known Jews, right?

574
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,660
Every week about this time.

575
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,560
Which is a part of the master program in your subconscious mind.

576
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,960
It's as if your life has been scripted.

577
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,500
It's as if you've been scripted for you.

578
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,760
Through the influences of all the...

579
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:17,080
It may be the one thing capable of saving this cockeyed world, yet you sit back there on your fat hoax and tell me you'll kill it if you can't use it.

580
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:23,000
Well, you go ahead and try you couldn't do it in a million years with all your radio stations and all your power.

581
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,960
Because it's bigger than whether I'm a fake.

582
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,520
It's bigger than your ambitions.

583
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,980
It is bigger than all the precious and fresh hoax in the world.

584
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:35,100
As long as true slack can still be had for free, the conspiracy cannot entirely win.

585
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,960
And Bob still has a chance.

586
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,280
Bob still has a few aces up his sleeve as well.

587
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,380
One of the most crucial being you.

588
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,660
You, the viewer.

589
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:49,040
Every check you write to Dobbs is a new warhead on his spiritual ICBM.

590
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,540
You found that change is very, very difficult.

591
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,520
But that's no excuse.

592
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,100
You can get excited and inspired for a while, but it doesn't seem to last.

593
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,780
That's because you didn't pay up.

594
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,500
And this is because most systems work only with the conscious mind.

595
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,720
Yes, Bobby.

596
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,240
You got me all worked up again.

597
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,140
That would have been nice.

598
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,200
Come with me.

599
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,400
The martyrdom of the prophet herald of our faith, called Bob.

600
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:46,860
And in today's program, we're going to deal with the story of the Bob's martyrdom and the events surrounding it.

601
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,280
Wow!

602
00:36:47,680 --> 00:37:00,220
On that blistering July summer day, there were the barrels of 750 rifles awaiting the command to fire and take the Bob's life.

603
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,100
He seemed so young to die, barely 30.

604
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,980
He was a pencil in a table, and a person's man.

605
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:15,020
He could possibly be guilty of the shocking crime which he was accused.

606
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,460
Would you get off your knees?

607
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,480
Somewhat unorthodox, wouldn't you say, Reverend Scott?

608
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,460
But realistic.

609
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,360
If you deliver sermons like this, it's a wonder you're still an ordained minister.

610
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,320
Or are you the best kind?

611
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,620
Angry, rebellious, critical, a renegade.

612
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,520
Stripped of most of my so-called clerical powers.

613
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,380
But I'm still in business.

614
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,880
That's right, dear friend. Still in business.

615
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,520
There's not much you can do about it.

616
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,500
The Elder Gods tried to stop Bob, you know.

617
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,040
The Elder Gods were jealous of Bob Slack.

618
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,820
Because the Elder Gods have no bodies, you know.

619
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,960
And they can't ooze or squirt like us.

620
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,060
So they sent Bobby to hell.

621
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,900
And stole his squirts away.

622
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,000
Now think of it, friends.

623
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,940
Dobbs in hell.

624
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:08,340
Pursued endlessly by demons and relearning the concept of pain.

625
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,900
Which he'd forgotten in his great slackfulness.

626
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:20,860
While bastard gods like Wotan usurped that sexual, spiritual orgasmicism.

627
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,920
From which they had disconnected Bob's astral senses.

628
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,840
Makes you want to do something about it, don't it, eh?

629
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,740
Huh?

630
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,920
Like what? Shoot a shotgun up into the sky like Jane or Harry?

631
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,260
Like what the hyperclites did that one time?

632
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:43,580
Now friends, these statements may not go well with the polished sensibilities of the rationalists or the modernists.

633
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:50,300
But what Bob's trying to get you to do is to invest wisely in the greatest commodity, dear friends.

634
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,800
The most potentially profitable aspect of your entire being.

635
00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:00,940
The eternal soul gland in your foot that's powered by all of nature.

636
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,480
You probably didn't even know that the soul is a gland.

637
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,060
But that's what this is all about.

638
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,340
It isn't politics.

639
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,980
It isn't some new wave art boy poop.

640
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,120
It isn't pop psychology baloney.

641
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,860
What Bob's talking about is the eternal slack force of this planet.

642
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,600
And it is worth more than everything else on this planet.

643
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:28,000
Bob Dobbs is here to broker the transactions over that soul, over this planet.

644
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,920
Which will inevitably occur when the Elder comes.

645
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,800
And God's begun to hunger for even more of it.

646
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,980
More of your slack.

647
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:40,100
And to see that you don't sell it for less than market value is what Bob wants to do.

648
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,600
He don't want you to sell it cheap just because you're too ignorant of what it's worth.

649
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,740
He don't want you to let it go too cheap, friends.

650
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:54,260
Because he knows where you can redeem it later at a much, much higher price.

651
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,940
And ye shall be rewarded and have slack.

652
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:02,840
If ye but will heed in discernment the mighty, mighty word of Bob.

653
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,780
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

654
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,220
Well, you seem to be enjoying the punishment.

655
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:21,920
Punishment?

656
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,940
Ha ha! The church has blessed me.

657
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,560
That's what it's done.

658
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,960
Back into some new country in Africa.

659
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,540
Hell, I had to look it up on the map to find out where I was going.

660
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,460
Oh, my bishop doesn't know it, but he's given me exactly what I wanted.

661
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,300
Elbow room.

662
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,440
Freedom.

663
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,960
Real freedom.

664
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,540
Freedom to dump all the rules and all the trappings.

665
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,880
Freedom to discover God in my own way.

666
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,540
You call this an act?

667
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,980
It was an act.

668
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:07,300
I saw an article in the recent Billy Graham column on religion.

669
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,640
It said, Dear Dr. Graham, I recently converted to Christianity,

670
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,700
and yet I'm not presently killing Dr. Sabat.

671
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,400
Is this perhaps a theological contradiction?

672
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,140
Can I be a born-again Christian?

673
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,200
And this moment, killing doctors survive.

674
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,060
That's the kind of forces we have against us.

675
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,920
What the hell is this about?

676
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,620
It's about the fact that the land is on fire.

677
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,480
But the hour for Christ's return was at hand.

678
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,780
You want to pretend you're burning in hell.

679
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,400
That's why you had to.

680
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:55,540


681
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:55,800
I'm going to put the heat on.

682
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,140
Leave the heat on so I can feel more like the devil.

683
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,460
Yes, devil.

684
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:02,840
Yes, devil.

685
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,560
Yes, devil.

686
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,620
I'll be your little helper for a day or two.

687
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,180
I'll get your dirty deeds done dirt cheap.

688
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,940
Pull out in front of me.

689
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,700
Hatred.

690
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,200
Hatred.

691
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,060
Hatred.

692
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,360
Hatred.

693
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,540
Oh, no.

694
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,520
They won't give me a job down at Kinko's.

695
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:25,520


696
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:25,520


697
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,400
Oh, no.

698
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:27,840
Oh, no.

699
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,200
Oh, no.

700
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,460
Because you're the devil.

701
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,920
They don't want the devil working at Kinko's.

702
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,600
Oh, I might be the best layout artist in Knoxville.

703
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,640
I might be the most creative layout artist in Knoxville.

704
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,400
But no.

705
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,140
No, no, no, no.

706
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,440
Just because you're the devil.

707
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,320
Just because I have so much hate in me.

708
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,160
So much hate that they knew that I wouldn't really enjoy the job.

709
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,500
I just didn't want to be in the job.

710
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:55,500


711
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,880
I just abused it to the max till they kicked me out.

712
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,920
That's all I wanted.

713
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,060
Oh, I thought everybody hated you, too.

714
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,000
Yeah, well, I just feed off their hate.

715
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,340
Because nobody, nobody can hate me more than I can hate them.

716
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,500
Ain't nothing...

717
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,660
Got that piggy smell.

718
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,900
That piggy, piggy smell.

719
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,540
The hate.

720
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,740
The hate.

721
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,940
That was Reverend Onan Canobite.

722
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,500
And the mysterious Mitch.

723
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,540
Talking about the hate.

724
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:47,920
The hate which empowers the men of Bob, dear friends.

725
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,200
There's nothing wrong with it.

726
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:55,480
Can you not feel the unceasing crystalline love

727
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:55,480


728
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:55,480


729
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:55,480


730
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:55,480


731
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:55,480


732
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,140
of the logic that pulsates within these words they've spoken?

733
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,300
To some, yes, it may be terrifying.

734
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,760
To see the truth within themselves frightens most people.

735
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,640
They can almost see it as a visible force

736
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,920
pressing outwards from the body, straining to escape.

737
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,320
Yes, it blinds some to see the sheer power

738
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,380
of total, complete, irrefutable logic such as ours.

739
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,680
Unimpaired in any way by the conspiracy taints

740
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,500
or pinkish programmings.

741
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,380
Just the simple,

742
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,660
simple truth of the mathematically perfect,

743
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,860
yet organically random permutations

744
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:36,140
of the superior rational which shines on us all through Bob.

745
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,920
Some it scorches, yes.

746
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,760
Some it feeds.

747
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,020
This we know logically by definition.

748
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,400
It cannot be argued.

749
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,880
We have discovered through a complex series of experiments

750
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:53,060
various formulae which prove that if Bob indeed exists,

751
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,760
then nothing we say

752
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,180
can be untrue.

753
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,100
Our faith, therefore, is unshakable.

754
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:04,960
It is a whirlpool, a maelstrom which sucks in all evidence

755
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,260
to its own contrary and spits it out, cleansed, reshaped into proof.

756
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:14,320
Not vague scientific guesswork by Earth primitives,

757
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,480
but the precise code sequence that triggers in the recipient

758
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,600
the knowledge of what it is.

759
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,180
This may be unacceptable to some less flexible minds

760
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,880
which are immune to the imagination virus.

761
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,740
The antibodies of would-be rational thought

762
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,020
may try to consume it, but logically,

763
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,400
because of the context in which we're speaking,

764
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,820
there is no such thing as rational thought.

765
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,540
We believe this logically, without remorse.

766
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,200
There is no rationality.

767
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,160
There is only pure emotion, pure superstition,

768
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,740
pure suggestibility on the part of the human mind.

769
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,400
There is no human dog.

770
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,700
But Bob wants this.

771
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,860
He wants it to continue.

772
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:03,160
He wants Jehovah One, the great mutator,

773
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,540
to know that we know he's there,

774
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,900
so that we are not smited for our pride.

775
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:15,100
He wishes the tape of the universe to forever roll

776
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:20,640
in the natural way, not edited by evil time gods.

777
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,100
And he shall do it, dear friends.

778
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:23,400
Bob!

779
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,360
Bob shall save our souls.

780
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,920
It is, however, recommended that all subgeni

781
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,680
do repent on your deathbeds, just in case.

782
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,860
There are fountains like bruises in the building

783
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,460
Wind is calling, dew is falling

784
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,280
Roses and dew

785
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,300
We never slept, the sweet roses

786
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,360
And dew

787
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,060
Come taste the nectar of roses and dew

788
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,940
Garden is near and it's waiting for you

789
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,660
Sun starts shining, moon is glaring

790
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,320
Come squiggle into view

791
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,760
The garden is full of sweet roses and dew

792
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:15,920
Music

793
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,340
Music

794
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,140
Music

795
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:25,840
Wow, this is electric, Bruce.

796
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:25,840


797
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,980
Oh, yes, dear friends.

798
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,720
This music is by David Feidler

799
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,620
And I must unfortunately hot down on that

800
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,600
Because the overlords are...

801
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:37,400
Listening.

802
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,040
Like the message, meet me under the atomic bomb.

803
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:48,160
Oh, my aching benefits.

804
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,940
We have been sprestled.

805
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,460
Yes, you know how that goes.

806
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:59,200
But now as our god nasty face prepares to relax in the somnolent slumber

807
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:06,700
Here we see a stand of plants measuring hundreds of feet in height

808
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:13,540
Note the rhythmic motions as they sway back and forth now their palpated sternum

809
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:24,860
These disgusting ceremonies are performed by the intelligent plants for the visiting Mariners

810
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:33,580
They say every little gesture that these bucks and maidens make has a specific meaning

811
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,920
Wouldn't you like to know what it is?

812
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,380
Yes, you too can come to the subgenius

813
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:46,700
Beach party if you log enough time enough hours in the church

814
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Who pays your phone bill for you punk? I'm a local caller

815
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:59,920
Here is the vivid imaginary universe that exists alongside our mortal world that magical realm of witches and wizards ghosts

816
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:07,480
goblins gimps and gnomes fairies elves geeks giants and ogres where valiant Knights battle fearsome dragons

817
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:08,700
mermaids

818
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,700
and

819
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,780
mystical unicorns

820
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,320
appear

821
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,620
to the pure of heart

822
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:20,940
to the pure of heart

823
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,020
ha ha ha ha

824
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:32,040
The whole world of enchantment that has bewitched the human mind and spirit since the dawn of time is present in the book of the subgenius

825
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:37,100
Never before has this splendid universe been unveiled in such rich detail

826
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:37,880
music

827
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,460
music

828
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,140
music

829
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,540


830
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,340
Oh, my God.

831
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:08,500
Oh, my God.

832
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:24,220
Oh, my God.

833
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,880
Oh, my God.

834
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:11,080
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

835
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:28,340
Oh, my God.

836
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,300
Oh, my God.

837
00:52:45,920 --> 00:53:09,880
Oh, my God.

838
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:39,040
Oh, my God.

839
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,660
Oh, my God.

840
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:44,520
Oh, my God.

841
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:45,240
Oh, my God.

842
00:54:48,260 --> 00:55:00,440
Oh, my God.

843
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,640
Oh, my God.

844
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:45,660
Oh, my God.

845
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:46,860
Oh, my God.

846
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,500
Oh, my God.

847
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:58,660
Oh, my God.

848
00:55:58,940 --> 00:55:59,520
Oh, my God.

849
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:24,320
Oh, my God.

850
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:35,640
Oh, my God.

851
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:48,320
Oh, my God.

852
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,800
Oh, my God.

853
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:17,460
Oh, my God.

854
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,300
Oh, my God.

855
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:21,660
Entrees served with complimentary gravel cakes and a hot dirt roll.

856
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,040
Ah, now that's more like it.

857
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,580
Come back here, you little bobby girl.

858
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,640
Now, you, don't you try to run away from Reverend Stag.

859
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,440
Did you say hello?

860
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,300
No, I said hello, but that's close enough.

861
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,400
You're a worm, aren't you?

862
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,680
Yeah, that's right.

863
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,940
You don't by any chance know the way through this labyrinth, do you?

864
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,500
Oh, me? No, I'm just a worm.

865
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,040
Oh.

866
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,720
Come inside and meet the missus.

867
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,180
No, thank you, but...

868
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,840
I have to solve this labyrinth.

869
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:24,060
But there aren't any turns or any openings or anything.

870
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,460
It just goes on and on and...

871
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,340
Well, anyway, things are not always what they seem in this place.

872
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,120
Or this show.

873
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,200
You can't take anything for granted.

874
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,300
Uh-uh, baby.

875
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,260
This is Bobland.

876
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,560
What a horrible place this is. It's not fair.

877
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:38,720
You asked for it.

878
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,720
That's right. It's not fair.

879
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,260
I put laps on way half of it.

880
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,500
This was a dead end a minute ago.

881
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,340
No, that's the dead end behind you.

882
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:59,620
Be here one day.

883
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,920
Gonna be Bob's day.

884
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,100
Pocket says hello to the yeti in yours.

885
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,040
Ladies?

886
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,300
Whoa!

887
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,280
And they're off.

888
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,340
Where are they?

889

Where are your friends now?

890
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:09,220
