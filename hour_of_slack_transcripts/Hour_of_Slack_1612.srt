00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,060
Yowl Slack

2
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,720
I hear a phone ringing.

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,640
What could it mean?

4
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,820
Is there like a zero sound in your head?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,700
I hear it now.

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,120
The zero sound.

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,220
No, I hear the hero.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,900
He's there.

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,900
You hear the zero sound in your head?

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,640
That's not a zero sound.

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,940
That's just a knocking on a wake-up door.

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,200
That means you're going to become an El Pisco,

13
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,740
real smarty pants, real soon.

14
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,820
I'm going to become a smarty pants?

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,760
But I'm a subgenius.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
I can't do that.

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,720
Yes, you can.

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,820
That's what it's all about.

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,840
It's happening in the sport.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,380
Squirty pants.

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,100
Oh, squirty pants.

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,400
That's not Eskimos wear.

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,680
Squirty pants.

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,960
Squirty pants.

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,600
Squirty pants.

26
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,780
Oh, squirty pants.

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,520
Squirty.

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,960
If you're out in the desert for five or seven weeks

29
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,320
to half an hour, depending on which regimen you're smoking,

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,040
you may find you're very chafey.

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,100
Chafey?

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,720
Chafey.

33
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,140
You know, you'll chaff easily.

34
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,280
Uh-huh.

35
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,600
Yeah, I would imagine so.

36
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,360
Sounds like...

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,940
I'd rather throw rag in some soap

38
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,040
and argue with the rest of the denizens of the darkness.

39
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,380
I didn't know denizens of the darkness argued over soap.

40
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,400
Oh, no, you did already?

41
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,480
I didn't know that.

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,600
Oh, I thought you said...

43
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,840
I'm just completely confused.

44
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,600
Denizens of the dark argue over soap?

45
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,540
Yeah.

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,620
Uh, sure.

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,840
Okay.

48
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,260
That'll help make us famous.

49
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,500
Just remember it.

50
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,120
Okay.

51
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,040
Don't ever forget.

52
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:09,700
All right.

53
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,700
Well, we're here at Stang Ranch without Dave,

54
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,140
who is in Cleveland,

55
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,700
and yet he is with us by the miracle of radio technology.

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,960
Does it sound like the technology's real bad?

57
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,420
No, it sounds fine.

58
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,300
Sounds great to me.

59
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,980
Sounds like you're right here with me.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,600
Yeah, you sound just like a robot.

61
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,660
You sound like a well-oiled machine, Dave,

62
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,860
which I know you're not.

63
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,060
I know you're a very badly-oiled human flesh pod.

64
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,020
Substantive.

65
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,160
Not subgenius, you know, just substantive.

66
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,540
Absolutely.

67
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,480
I can't even stand...

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,840
Meat.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,940
I love meat.

70
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,300
It's a good thing, because you're mostly made of it, Dave.

71
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,300
Yeah.

72
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,300
You've got to keep on eating your meat

73
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,440
every other daily basis if you want.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,440
See, if you wanted to have an iron deficiency like I had,

75
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,880
the first thing you'd do would be flunk algebra.

76
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:06,760
Eat nails.

77
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,760
Or some other math sciences courses.

78
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,420
And then you'd get put in the technology class,

79
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,460
and then they would put you in like a wood shop.

80
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,480
And then you find out that you were one of the AIs all along.

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,440
Yeah, unfortunately.

82
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,220
You were one of the ghosts.

83
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,540
Or one of the AI, AI, I-I-Is.

84
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,400
Hey, that's pretty good.

85
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:29,720
Hey!

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,540
The AI.

87
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,140
AI, AI, AI, AI.

88
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,680
Is that what the subgenius...

89
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,720
Oh, no, that's terrifying, man.

90
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,460
That's bad news.

91
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:35,800
Yeah.

92
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,420
Skynet is Genesis.

93
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,340
Genesis is Skynet.

94
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,220
AI, AI, AI, AI, AI, AI.

95
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,020
Don't forget.

96
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,660
Say that again?

97
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,800
Don't forget.

98
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,720
When you stub your toe in Spanish, too.

99
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,800
I, I, I.

100
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,720
Man.

101
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,920
The rabbit hole just gets deeper and deeper.

102
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,260
It does.

103
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,280
Well, it's not...

104
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,220
It's not a secret name like, like Joe, Joe Hoover or Satan's underpants.

105
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,140
He said, he said both of them.

106
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,040
He said them both in one sentence, man.

107
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,180
I'm going to have to cut those out of the broadcast version.

108
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,420
Oh.

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,280
It's okay if you say Jehoshaphat on, on underground internet radio.

110
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,660
It's just if you say, or Elder God's name or something like that.

111
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,000
You can say, you know, Nyar Thoth-Tap or anything like that.

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,540
If you say their middle names.

113
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,200
On the broadcast radio.

114
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,180
You'd be really pissed off.

115
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,380
Yeah.

116
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,160
It's some instead.

117
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,900
Of the creatures.

118
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,920
What if you say Nigi?

119
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:31,840
Shh.

120
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,580
But, okay, I look, I'm going to have to cut all of these from the broadcast radio because

121
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:43,340
it summons them only on broadcast radio, not on internet underground radio.

122
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,760
But we're doing both.

123
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,380
You see, we have to do both.

124
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,220
Don't forget that they put the address to the wrong suspenders.

125
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,220
They see.

126
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:56,960
They see.

127
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,560
They see.

128
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,760
Suspending.

129
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,580
They see.

130
00:04:59,580 --> 00:04:59,580


131
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,780
Like when you have to do that.

132
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,100
When you go to a movie, you have to suspend your animation.

133
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,940
You're just leaving in hunger.

134
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,640
Dave, when was the last time you went to an actual movie in a theater?

135
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,940
I think it was, um, 2-0-1-1.

136
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,280
Is that a year?

137
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,180
That was more recently than me.

138
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,260
I think we, the last movie we saw was the last movie that we did.

139
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,260


140
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,260


141
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:35,700
saw was Peter Jackson's King Kong in 2005, and probably the next one we'll see will be

142
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:43,780
Kong Skull Island, which I don't expect to hold a candle to Peter Jackson's, but what

143
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,300
the heck.

144
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,340
It's monsters.

145
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,860
Gotta check it out.

146
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,920
Except that I'll bet you we'd check it out instead of check it out at the last minute

147
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,920
on account of, doesn't it cost like $50 to see a movie now?

148
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,720
Something like that, yeah.

149
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,580
Yeah, it's really expensive.

150
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,840
Besides, it smells, it always had that strange, familiar smell.

151
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,100
It's got a different smell now.

152
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:12,680
They must be using new cleaning equipment, and it smells like FabergÃ© took a poop or

153
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,520
something like that.

154
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,120
In movie theaters?

155
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,300
There's a blend of odors that disguises something.

156
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,660
You don't know if it's that old popcorn plus rug smell.

157
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,920
I wouldn't know, because when we stopped going to that movie theater near our house,

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,560
it was like, oh, it's a movie theater.

159
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:28,560


160
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:28,840
It was closed.

161
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,740
We were the only customers anyway.

162
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,300
Yeah.

163
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,300
We never saw anyone else in there.

164
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:40,780
They had Monopoly pictures of you guys standing at the front doorway waiting for your tickets

165
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,960
and no line going around the block.

166
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,940
Yeah, the only way I can see movies now is we just walk by people's houses and hope that

167
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,680
what they're watching on TV is the same thing the last guy was watching.

168
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,940
Yeah, but sometimes you have to wear stilts, you know?

169
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,340
Well, that's...

170
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,780
Most people don't have their TVs up on the second floor, so it's not a...

171
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:11,240
It's amazing if you go creepy crawling in the suburbs at night how much of other people's

172
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,380
lives you can see just from the sidewalk.

173
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,320
What if you were like a Spring Hills Jack type character?

174
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,540
You had, like, springs on your heels.

175
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,920
Well, the sad thing is there's nothing...

176
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,060
While you were jacking around.

177
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,720
What you see your neighbors doing is them watching television.

178
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,800
Yeah.

179
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,060
Yeah.

180
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,580
You're peeping.

181
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,160
You see a glow in their eyes.

182
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,640
It's only as exciting as whatever sports show they're watching, which is usually what it is, I've noticed.

183
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:44,560
So, you know, it's like, I guess we just have to spend money to go see Kong Skull Island in 3D

184
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,820
and then be horribly disappointed at how somehow incomplete and unsatisfying...

185
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,060
Smallest amount off.

186
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,660
If you look at it from just the smallest angle outside and stuff like that,

187
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,040
you can't see anything.

188
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,800
You can see how many changes.

189
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,120
Camera angle changes.

190
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,660
Man, are they ever quick in NFL sports and NBA sports and everything else.

191
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,060
It's just like going from camera angle to camera angle.

192
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,580
It's just enough to mesmerize you.

193
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,620
And I think that's what the purpose of it is.

194
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:20,700
I hate to sound like a flatulent old PhD of historical reasoning or something like that.

195
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,940
Are you talking about fast cuts on television?

196
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,140
I'm talking about television.

197
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,860
We were just recanting the glow of the television.

198
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,440
And somebody else's third story window and stuff like that.

199
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,580
And also, I just noticed that or not remembered that if you're just a little bit off camera,

200
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,540
if you're just, you know, you're not seeing the actual television set.

201
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,340
You're seeing the light from it.

202
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,460
You can see like a change every half second.

203
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,140
The quick cuts are now so much quicker than they used to be like 10, 20 years ago.

204
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,420
You know what bothers me is fire does that to that flickering thing.

205
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,440
Fire goes.

206
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,180
It goes faster than it used to.

207
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,300
It used to have this slow, lethargic flicker.

208
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,520
Now fire just burns real fast.

209
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,960
The kids just they can't they can't watch a fire that an old fashioned fire that licks slowly.

210
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,740
They have to watch those flames flicker in just about 30 frames, 60 frames a second.

211
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,680
And 3D has to be 3D fire.

212
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,360
The flat fire is not good enough.

213
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,380
Black and white fire.

214
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,380
Forget that.

215
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,640
That didn't matter how great a fire it is.

216
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,420
If it's black and white.

217
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,580
They won't even warm them.

218
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,580
If they could be freezing to death and they won't warm themselves on a black and white fire.

219
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,840
These kids, they just don't get it.

220
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,840
They they they've had everything handed to them.

221
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,080
Three dimensional fire at 60 frames a second.

222
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,460
And it's three times hotter than it used to be.

223
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,060
And the pot is stronger.

224
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,540
We got cheated.

225
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:53,240
They're the ones that saying we boomers ate up all of the environment and left them nothing.

226
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,820
But we're the ones getting cheated.

227
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,400
They get all the flying saucers and the vermin.

228
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,780
And we're the ones getting virtual porno and everything.

229
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:09,360
We're lucky if we get a radio shot mixer and some old microphones that somebody left behind after a band played.

230
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,960
Well yeah, especially if your working for EMS real late in the morning or something like that.

231
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:23,640
And one of those huge, real huge ladies in stuff with bad breath decides she's going to start humping on your leg like a little dog named Susie or something like that.

232
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,180
I wish that would happen for me.

233
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,820
I'm sure you do.

234
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,400
You're on a mission.

235
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:27,780
I'm jealous.

236
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,080
You should try every night, buddy.

237
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,380
Try to get some work done.

238
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
You know what I mean?

239
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,820
You're bragging.

240
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,960
He's just bragging now.

241
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,440
You're trying to make the rest of us feel bad because we don't have those things happening to us on our legs.

242
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,940
No, no.

243
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,280
I'm not trying to reinforce any feelings of inferiority that you might have.

244
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,780
It's so hard for me to work with.

245
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,660
Every night, same thing.

246
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,360
And you don't do anything about it either.

247
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,760
It's your problem to solve.

248
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,700
You can take care of it for me or we or somebody away from here.

249
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,180
Yeah, but see, we don't even know what your problem is.

250
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,840
I told you.

251
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,080
There's a semi-elderly, poof, poof, 300-pound lady.

252
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:18,160
Every time I go on third shift, while I'm waiting to clock in and stuff, she's waiting there for me.

253
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,800
And he calls that a problem.

254
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,720
She starts off just by BS and then talk about, you know, typical office talks.

255
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,640
And next thing you know, she's trying to.

256
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,580
That shit on my head.

257
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,320
That means she loves you, Dave.

258
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,360
That means she likes you.

259
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,680
That's their way of showing affection.

260
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,640
You should pick up on it.

261
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,540
Ask her out.

262
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,980
I see.

263
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,240
That's what she's trying to get you to do.

264
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,940
That's dangerous.

265
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,240
Listen to her in the background.

266
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,320
She's singing a love song to you, Dave.

267
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,340
You can't hear her, but she's singing an operatic love song.

268
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,500
You know, like mixed music.

269
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,200
Yeah, mixed Lydian mode.

270
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,580
Isn't that workplace harassment?

271
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,140
Yeah.

272
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,600
Look, she's singing how Dave is so.

273
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,240
This is Italian, so I'll translate.

274
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,460
He's so handsome.

275
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,000
He's so tall.

276
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,260
His craggy nose like an Indian makes me fall.

277
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,460
I love Dave.

278
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,980
He's such a cowboy.

279
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,760
But if I was with him, he would not be lonesome anymore.

280
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,600
That's the lyric.

281
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,440
The translation of the Italian.

282
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,740
Right.

283
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,740
This is after Dave left her.

284
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,380
He wouldn't let her hump on his leg anymore.

285
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,480
And she's this is her aria where she's decrying her fate.

286
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,180
But she's going to hump him even harder next time.

287
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:54,440
Exit states left wearing a sword and swearing that he will disavow the honor of the Honorable Jim Mernemina.

288
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,460
She.

289
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:55,560
General.

290
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,300
And he's going to slay her.

291
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,220
His brother.

292
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,300
And the Duke is.

293
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,400
Well, it changed to a different scene now.

294
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,180
But yeah, the.

295
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,800
Now she's going to start the aria.

296
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,820
Dave, I don't know what you're complaining about.

297
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,240
That old lady is built.

298
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,540
She has a huge lung capacity.

299
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,220
Those opera singers, you know, they have to be that way.

300
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,580
Did you hear a balcony?

301
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,280
You could do Shakespeare from.

302
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,680
Of course.

303
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,600
The Mud Shark or Mudlark.

304
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,080
You see.

305
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,520
Mudhead.

306
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:39,080
Because you say you didn't see any movies, but did you hear the movie with Meryl Streep called What's Your Face?

307
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,000
Florence Henderson, Jenkins or whatever it is.

308
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:43,940
Yes.

309
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,620
Of course.

310
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,380
Opera singer.

311
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,340
No.

312
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,300
Yes.

313
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,140
What?

314
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,700
You know about that movie.

315
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,140
Which one?

316
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:51,700
Say it again.

317
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,420
Say it in English.

318
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,740
She has basically an unpronounced.

319
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,460
Unpronounceable name.

320
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,480
And it's three words.

321
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,300
And she was.

322
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,880
Jenkins is the last one.

323
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,940
Jenkins is the last name of her three names.

324
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,680
And it's Florence.

325
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,300
Florence something Jackson.

326
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,740
Jenkins.

327
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,320
Jenkins.

328
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,740
Are you guys on Jenkins?

329
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,300
No.

330
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,200
Because are you talking about a movie?

331
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,480
Yes.

332
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,360
Oh, OK.

333
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,040
That's good.

334
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,840
Yes.

335
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,540
A movie with Meryl Streep.

336
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,700
Yes.

337
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,520
And it's not the movie with the soundtrack I'm playing.

338
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,280
It's called Background Now by Bernard Harmon.

339
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,460
No, it is not.

340
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:28,920
No.

341
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,460
No.

342
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,980
So what about this movie?

343
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,860
Well, it's a woman singing.

344
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,180
She thought she was the greatest opera singer in the world.

345
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,280
And she was one of the worst.

346
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,520
She would pick these really difficult arias, which are hard for even a regular good opera singer.

347
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,420
And she was just a regular person.

348
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,940
But she'd rank halls and stuff and put on performances and make all these people come to them.

349
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,480
I don't know why they'd come there.

350
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,740
And she couldn't tell that they were laughing at her for a long time.

351
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,120
It's actually a really sad story.

352
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,380
Well, she was married to Citizen Kane, right?

353
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,220
And he was so rich, he put her on stage.

354
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,200
What's his name?

355
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,620
Mangrove.

356
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,580
Mango Mussolini or whatever they call him.

357
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:12,820
Trump.

358
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,760
Remember when Trump's acting career before when he was not famous yet?

359
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,380
Yeah, actually, I do remember before he was famous.

360
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,720
Unlike everybody else, apparently.

361
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,620
Yeah.

362
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,960
Well, I deeply remember the insinuations, too.

363
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,500
It was very hurtful.

364
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,180
Well, yeah, Trump wanted to be an opera singer originally.

365
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,560
And he got up out there.

366
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,240
He bought his way onto the Carnegie Hall stage.

367
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,940
And he was doing the Barber of Seville.

368
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,120
And it sounded like...

369
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,440
It sounded like Gomer Pyle doing it.

370
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,020
Only Jim Nabors really could sing opera.

371
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,240
But it was like Jim Nabors trying to sing opera badly.

372
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,440
As Gomer Pyle.

373
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,180
Jim Nabors was actually an opera singer.

374
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,840
And Trump, then, there were some, of course, reviews where they mocked him and laughed at him.

375
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:09,960
And he paid a whole army of people to write glowing reviews of his singing.

376
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,920
In fact, there were more reviewers than there was capacity in the theater for people.

377
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:17,980
He hired...

378
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,320
The theater could only have held about 200 people.

379
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,100
And yet, there were...

380
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:30,840
There were 5,000 glowing reviews of that one performance by Donald Trump that appeared the next day.

381
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,020
And it was always the Barber of Seville, too.

382
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,620
And he'd go up there and he'd pretend like he was going to give somebody a shave.

383
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:45,300
Instead, he'd show, like, it would be a colomask, kind of like a little drill or something that they use in releasing the water.

384
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,200
Sometimes it's even more difficult than that.

385
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,400
But I don't understand how they do it.

386
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,080
Well, I mean, I admired his attempt to be an opera singer.

387
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,220
And I admired his attempt to be a president, too.

388
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:09,740
Especially now that he's been reduced to gibbering insanity, talking about how the last ten presidents are reading his mind.

389
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,700
And Hillary Clinton, he said, was mind-controlling him with her white pantsuit.

390
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,160
And making him say things and misspell words like tap.

391
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,520
Let's assign.

392
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,960
Let's assign that he's the fabric of reality that he lives in no longer supports his realism.

393
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,880
You know, it's like one of those early Sanskrit poems.

394
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,900
He's become too real for the world.

395
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:40,300
He's too truthful for the rest of reality to support such great truthfulness.

396
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,500
That's why they have the Sarad and Sitar soundtrack.

397
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,800
And Gomer Pyle still sings the X-Park moments.

398
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,400
At least we're happy to do so.

399
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,940
You know, unlike some other production company.

400
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,160
I just want to get down in the mud and do it like a dog.

401
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,100
This reminds me of that show we did with the grandchildren.

402
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,940
Don't you think?

403
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,620
He sings like Elias.

404
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,320
Hey, can you sing Everybody Dance Now?

405
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,840
Everybody dance now!

406
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,400
Can you do that?

407
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,140
Boom-da-boom-ba-ba-boom-foo.

408
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,260
I think I'd like to have my snakes lathered up and probably.

409
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,000
Clean my teeth for a little while.

410
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:32,160
Maybe have a huge snack of escarboles or green pudding, whatever.

411
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,180
Some of that delicious.

412
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,080
Green pudding?

413
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,280
That sounds like a monster.

414
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,940
He wanted to get his snakes lathered up.

415
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,420
It's salty.

416
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,580
We saw the snakes lathered up today.

417
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,540
Yes, we did.

418
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,420
We went to the Rattlesnake Roundup in Walnut Springs, Texas today.

419
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,340
Yeah, but they kill all those poor snakes.

420
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,380
A lot of them are not the same dead.

421
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,600
They're not the only snakes that bite everybody.

422
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,380
They're the ones that just like trying to avoid human beings.

423
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,000
No, these are all deadly rattlers that want to kill you.

424
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,060
Because they know that you want to kill them.

425
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,400
That's just built into being a rattler.

426
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:18,280
You can get rattlesnake heads in jars of formaldehyde or alcohol or something for only 10 or 12 bucks.

427
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,040
Yes, nice little clear mason jar.

428
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,460
Just like a jelly jar.

429
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,520
With a decapitated snake in it.

430
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,840
I'd like to try some.

431
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,520
Someday, perhaps.

432
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,440
You can get snake balls.

433
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,500
But you didn't even know that there were such things as snake balls.

434
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,640
But they sell them in pairs.

435
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,400
Yeah, I didn't either.

436
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,060
They told me they were baboon balls.

437
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,640
I started arguing and I realized they were also primates like the rest of us.

438
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,000
No, honestly, I have pictures of the snake balls to prove it.

439
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,840
And they're definitely snake balls.

440
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,880
I've got a hairband.

441
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,560
It's like a mountain oyster.

442
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,440
It's more like a moth.

443
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,620
It's like a prairie diaphragm or a didgeridoo.

444
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,220
Dino nads. Those are the best.

445
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,900
Juicy dino nads.

446
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,580
Hey, Princess Wee, look, the music is at 420.

447
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,040
You know what that means?

448
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,540
That means the music's been playing for 4 minutes and 20 seconds.

449
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,020
20 seconds?

450
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,800
What the hell?

451
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,840
What are you talking about?

452
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,500
Princess Wee just wandered away from the studio.

453
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,180
She's gone.

454
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,800
Just wandered away.

455
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,980
The vortex took her.

456
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,200
Just took her away.

457
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Well, you know, if you can't be understood when you make a pronouncement,

458
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,900
you should expect people to walk away from you.

459
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,760
You have to at least keep one little hair, one little miniscule thread of reality

460
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,160
going between a shared concept.

461
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,920
You can't just walk up to people and start babbling nonsense to them

462
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,660
and expect them to sit down and say,

463
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,440
Oh, oh, oh, that was really you.

464
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,140
Yeah.

465
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,040
I'm surprised to hear you say that, Dave, that last sentence that you said.

466
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,560
I'm despised to hear you say it.

467
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,840
That's what I personally, it's a figment of our imaginations.

468
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,160
That's all it is.

469
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:05,920
Did I hallucinate?

470
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,280
Fake news.

471
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,220
Was Dave just singing, I don't want to be buried?

472
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:10,900
No.

473
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,580
Oh, okay.

474
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,060
Man, that was intense.

475
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,180
You were singing, you sound just like Joey Ramone.

476
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,680
You don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery?

477
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,060
Yeah.

478
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,460
Pet cemetery.

479
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,920
That's what I thought you said.

480
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,500
That's what I thought you were singing when I first came back.

481
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,960
You have to say it like pet cemetery.

482
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,480
That's what I thought you thought, that you had thought before anybody sang anything.

483
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,660
Pet cemetery.

484
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,420
Cemetery.

485
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,580
Yeah.

486
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:39,980
Cemetery.

487
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,300
Yeah.

488
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,620
Yeah.

489
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,240
I don't want to live my life again.

490
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,000
Again.

491
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:50,700
Again.

492
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,260
Again.

493
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,320
Again.

494
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,400
You have to have a pound and a half of snake balls.

495
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,900
I could be a rock and roll singer.

496
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,660
I know how to do inward singing too.

497
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,660
You have to have a pound and a half of snake balls?

498
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,460
Yeah.

499
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,220
You could be a rock singer?

500
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,320
If he had snake balls, he could be a rock singer.

501
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:07,860
Yeah.

502
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,360
What kind of snake balls?

503
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,760
Mick Jagger had snake balls.

504
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,300
That was a secret to his power.

505
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:13,960
Really?

506
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,120
They're a very valuable source of protein too.

507
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,600
I'm sorry.

508
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:25,580
Well, these are just novelty spheres covered with snake skin.

509
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,120
But they're magic.

510
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,020
That's the thing.

511
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,200
They're cool looking.

512
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,360
Well, that is the thing.

513
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,080
They're very cool looking.

514
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,400
They could give you power.

515
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,840
Yeah.

516
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,960
That's what your border does.

517
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:42,640
It holds your population there under 300,000.

518
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,120
Do you want power, Dave?

519
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,040
Power?

520
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,360
Power?

521
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,060
Over others?

522
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,040
Do you want power?

523
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,920
Untreamed of power.

524
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,460
Over the week.

525
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,040
You can't knock a bowels or continent.

526
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,240
It's not a different language.

527
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,120
It's a part of our own understanding.

528
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,100
Or do you want pleasure?

529
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,600
Which do you choose?

530
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,160
Power or pleasure?

531
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,620
Pleasure.

532
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,160
Pleasure.

533
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,160


534
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:19,820
Pleasure.

535
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:19,820


536
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:19,860
Pleasure.

537
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,080
Pleasure.

538
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,080


539
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,100
Pleasure.

540
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,160
There's nothing to do with us.

541
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
He can't make up his mind.

542
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,920
Why not both, Dave?

543
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,740
Go for power and pleasure.

544
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,660
You told me I'm not gonna make the deal much later.

545
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
I don't even know what the hell I'm waiting for.

546
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:40,280
There's nothing to do with our barbecue flavor or special section on the mango Mussolini

547
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,660
or any of the other pirates.

548
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,740
Where's eat me?

549
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,480
There's nothing to do with us.

550
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:45,800
There's nothing to do with us.

551
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,440
There's nothing to do with us.

552
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:47,780
There's nothing to do with us.

553
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:47,860


554
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:58,660
Dave. I see. Dave changes the subject. I see. It's weird. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. You just had,

555
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,320
you just had a chance to sell your soul for great, vast rock stardom, and you, you blew it.

556
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:12,380
You missed your chance. You changed the subject. You weren't really even listening. Satan just made

557
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:18,080
an offer to you a second ago with cool background music, and you missed it.

558
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,360
That was your one big chance to be like Mick Jagger and have the snake balls.

559
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:32,200
You could have had the snake balls, Dave. You could have been the snake balls,

560
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:41,400
but instead, you're snack balls. Cheesy puffs of life. It didn't rotate very far from the center,

561
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:41,900
Captain.

562
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:49,420
Captain Roger Weisshauser, Von Heider. Everything's just, just the way you planned it.

563
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,000
You thought that breaking up the snake ball stick was going to have some kind of

564
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,420
reintroductory time where you'd need to be a transition or something like that.

565
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,020
There's not necessarily anything in this board. We, we don't.

566
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,840
We, uh.

567
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,220
It's just what we've come to. It's just what we're reducing.

568
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,520
What's the word you're used to? Braying.

569
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,800
Where we're heading and where we just landed.

570
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,820
A braying jackass. Hey, you should run for president.

571
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,540
I couldn't tell if that was Dave.

572
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,460
A braying jackass.

573
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,820
Dave, you sounded crazy. You should run for president.

574
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,980
A braying jackass.

575
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:36,740
President cowboy. Well, we've already had one of those, and he wasn't, he wasn't a real cowboy,

576
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,520
though. Reagan. Or was that Bush? They were both cowboys.

577
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,620
Reagan.

578
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:41,700
Reagan.

579
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,360


580
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,360


581
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,360


582
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,360


583
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,360


584
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,360


585
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,040
Reagan. It was Britney Spears.

586
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,880
President Spears.

587
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,360
And after Britney Spears, I think it was Unguash, the Deer Slayer.

588
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,060
President Michael Jackson was a short lived president.

589
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,480
He slept on the job a lot.

590
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,960
Hiding at Neverland instead of administering the country.

591
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,280
Yeah, he was a capitalist.

592
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,780
I mean, a real one. He had different companies and stuff.

593
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,300
But, you know.

594
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:12,760
He owned a...

595
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,280
President Jackson.

596
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,300
He named his 2020 barbeque.

597
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,980
President Michael Jackson. Not Andrew Jackson.

598
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,500
No, Michael. Yes.

599
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,800
President Michael Jackson.

600
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,000
The least understood president.

601
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,640
Who?

602
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:35,000
I read that a lot of movie stars and rich people are thinking of running for president now,

603
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,700
because they're going, oh, well, hell, I could do that.

604
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,140
I've known more about it than that guy.

605
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,300
I could do a better job of it than that guy.

606
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,780
I'm even richer and better looking.

607
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,000
Much better looking.

608
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,820
So, you know, I mean...

609
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,940
And nobody is. They're all a bunch of spaz dicks.

610
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,400
It's going to be President Oprah Winfrey.

611
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,600
She's going to run and she's going to make some difference.

612
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,940
And she's going to clean up the swamp in Washington.

613
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,180
Yeah, right.

614
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Did you know that was prepared?

615
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,360
Well, you use Goldman Sachs bankers as mops when you clean up.

616
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,320
The swamp, right?

617
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,900
I was going to clean up the picnic table and the baskets in the whole area.

618
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,920
Nobody volunteered for the toilets, did they?

619
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,560
No.

620
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,660
Let's drain the toilets in Washington.

621
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,780
No, no, no. Let somebody else do that.

622
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,660
Let the janitor drain the toilets in Washington.

623
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,560
We're going to be busy draining the swamp.

624
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,380
I hate manatees.

625
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,240
We'll drain the swamp and they'll be flopping there, suffocating.

626
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,360
Well, manatees.

627
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,940
Manatees actually are air breathers.

628
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,840
They won't suffocate.

629
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,520
But then I'll drown them.

630
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,300
We'll drown them then.

631
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,220
We'll fill the swamp.

632
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,740
We'll fill the swamp and kill the manatees and the whales.

633
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,660
Drown the whales.

634
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,240
Nuke them and drown them.

635
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,060
All you got to do is drive around in an outboard motor long enough and you'll kill a manatee if you're in the right spot.

636
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,660
Thanks, Obama.

637
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,500
Thanks for reading my mind.

638
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,840
Thanks for tapping my phone.

639
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,000
Thanks for recording everything I ever said, Obama.

640
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,280
And using it against me.

641
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,280
How dare he?

642
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,420
See, we're caught with a sickening self-consciousness resolution.

643
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,980
Oh, it's hard.

644
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,000
Our memories have been implanted by previous memories.

645
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:31,700
We always dreamed there would be a day we'd wake up in hell and Donald Parsons would be humped.

646
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,380
We'd be dumped in Stumper.

647
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,560
You know, what's his name?

648
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,700
Mango Mussolini.

649
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,100
You like that word mango, don't you?

650
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,680
No, I like mangoes.

651
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:50,780
And it is a description of the color of his hair, which is like, well, is it like a yellow thing or is it like a pink thing?

652
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,660
How can they be both in either one of each kind?

653
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,480
Yeah, it's pink all over.

654
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,760
It's kind of like, you know, the room, your daughter's room, you paint.

655
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,160
The color you paint your daughter's room.

656
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,660
It's really pretty, you know.

657
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,500
That's what we should paint our room.

658
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,360
Pink.

659
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,640
Yeah, daughter pink.

660
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,400
Trump sold pink.

661
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:23,680
The color that you would paint your daughter's room, you know, because you thought it fit a little girl's personality.

662
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,460
It's kind of pink.

663
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,420
It's kind of yellow, golden color.

664
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,280
But, you know, it's mango, you know.

665
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:32,940
Mango.

666
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,260
Yes, mango.

667
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,060
It doesn't make one lick of sense to me.

668
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,800
Our room has been pink.

669
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,720
I mean, that would be traditional to paint it pink.

670
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,880
Well, Dave's suggesting we paint it the color of the president's real, real, real hair.

671
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,940
Oh, mango.

672
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,860
Yeah, mango.

673
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,900
Mango man.

674
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,540
Pancakes.

675
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,040
That's got man in it.

676
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,000
That's because he's a man.

677
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,820
Oh, yeah.

678
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,680
I'm a weak man and he's my idea of a strong man.

679
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,740
I'm a stupid man and he's my idea of a smart man.

680
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,920
I'm a poor man and he's my idea of a rich man.

681
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,080
That's me.

682
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:11,780
Okay.

683
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,400
A dumbass.

684
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,500
Yep.

685
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,040
Yep.

686
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,180
And I'm not alone.

687
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,500
And you built like a 53-year-old woman, too.

688
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,980
And we're going to fill that swamp so high, you're all going to drown.

689
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,000
Mm-hmm.

690
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,100
We're going to fill it up.

691
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,960
We're going to refill that swamp like it's never been filled before.

692
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,380
You'll be swimming in an ocean of Goldman Sachs bankers.

693
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,360
You'll be walking on the shoulders of giants of industry.

694
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,760
Because they'll be the swans.

695
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,080
The swamp will be full of nothing but rich men.

696
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,440
Yeah.

697
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,340
Rich men.

698
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,440
There'll be a swamp.

699
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,960
Instead of manatees, there'll be men in business suits.

700
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,360
Yeah.

701
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,780
But men, the poor white men of this world, they're such victims.

702
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,080
Such victims.

703
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,020
It's so hard to be a white man these days.

704
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,080
I feel so sorry for them.

705
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,220
It's so hard because the sissies pick on us.

706
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,720
The girls pick on us.

707
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,060
Everybody just picks on us.

708
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,740
It's not fair.

709
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,520
We're victims.

710
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,400
Some people talk funny languages and stuff.

711
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,240
I can't understand.

712
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,140
I know they're making fun of me, and that's why I want to...

713
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,600
Yeah.

714
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,180
To me, they sound pompous and faggy.

715
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,140
Like tomatoes, yeah.

716
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,020
They understand me, but to me, they sound pompous and faggy, so I beat them up.

717
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,980
I got that word from that movie, Idiocracy.

718
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,180
I know what that means.

719
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,800
That means people in offices are stupid.

720
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,480
I work with my hands because I'm smart.

721
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,360
Really?

722
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:49,620
I can't...

723
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,560
I work...

724
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,420
Well, they put...

725
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,220
They fired...

726
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:57,060
They laid us off at the Kaiser blade factory because they hired a bunch of Vietnams.

727
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,000
That's why.

728
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,160
And because I showed up drunk all the time.

729
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,020
I'm a victim.

730
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,480
I'm a victim.

731
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,280
It's Obama's fault.

732
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,940
He was reading everybody's mind.

733
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,620
His wife was reading their mail.

734
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,720
The consul.

735
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,720
His wife was...

736
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,620
Moose Shell was reading their email, and Obami was reading their minds.

737
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,840
And stole Don Trump's brain.

738
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,920
And then he had to hit it under the bed somewhere.

739
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,540
And now he won't give it back.

740
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,380
We'd have to keep it in like a weird container with fluids in it and stuff.

741
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,060
And we could communicate psychotronically with it.

742
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,480
Just go to the window.

743
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,180
Bring me a hamburger.

744
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,480
That's how politics works, man.

745
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,420
Huge.

746
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,660
Bring me a huge hamburger.

747
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,600
Or something like that.

748
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,980
That's how it's done.

749
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,400
Huge.

750
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,800
A huge hamburger.

751
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,520
Huge.

752
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,240
Huge.

753
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:51,860
Huge.

754
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,160
Huge.

755
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:52,420
Huge.

756
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:59,160
So you gotta pretend like you're out in the middle of the wilderness without any clothes on.

757
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:02,660
Damn.

758
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,300
Well, I didn't say nothing different than when you're making certain things.

759
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,880
You know what I'm talking about.

760
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,000
Pretend.

761
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:14,600
Pretend I'm out in the wilderness while I am out in the wilderness.

762
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,580
Yes, you are in the wilderness.

763
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,560
And I know about your little deal with staying here to wear underpants while you're doing the show.

764
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,660
Because you think like nobody will see through the windows because the nearest other house is 12 miles away.

765
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,960
Or 100 miles away. I don't know.

766
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:38,460
Actually, the nearest house is pretty close.

767
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,440
But there's a lot of trees in between.

768
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,760
We can't see them.

769
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,680
They can't see us.

770
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,680
So we're doing the show, as he said, without no pants on.

771
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,160
Free. Free to do the show without any pants on.

772
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:03,140
Oh, we didn't have to drive to a radio station with pants on.

773
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:08,440
No, we didn't have to go up into the elevator to the WCSB radio station.

774
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,360
Wearing pants.

775
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,440
No!

776
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,580
We didn't have to do any of that.

777
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,480
We can run up and down the stairs wearing no pants at all.

778
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,260
Free. Free. Free. Free.

779
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,420
My life's dream has come true.

780
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,040
I can run pantsless through my own radio station.

781
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:32,040
...my nature intended you to live with no panties or poo-poo shoes on you.

782
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,040
No poo-poo shoes.

783
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,480
I always have those.

784
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:37,860
No poo-poo shoes?

785
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,520
My poo-poo shoes if I'm going to wear no pants.

786
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,000
What kind of a show is this?

787
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,980
I don't know.

788
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,700
We used to talk about how the conspiracy held down the mutants.

789
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,720
And this is now like the absolute...

790
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,540
This is the age of the conspiracy.

791
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:58,940
The bullies won the election and they're going to pick on all the nerds forever and ever and ever.

792
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,580
That's the idea.

793
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:05,280
And are we going to sit back and be silly and let this happen?

794
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,280
Probably.

795
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,160
Probably, yeah.

796
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:17,900
Because until the revolution comes, subgeniuses are going to party and bulldada and party and bulldada and party and bulldada.

797
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,620
Mm-hmm.

798
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,460
Until the cows don't come home.

799
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:21,680
In that order. In that package.

800
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,260
That's a sad prescription there.

801
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,420
That just makes me want to use some of these alternative cuss words.

802
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,400
Yes, Dave, I'm looking at a sheet of paper that says,

803
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,120
alternative cuss words field tested and mother approved.

804
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,180
And it's got things like,

805
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,920
shut your pie hole,

806
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,380
Judas Priest,

807
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,880
heavens to Betsy,

808
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,680
dad gummit,

809
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,920
kiss my grits.

810
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,580
I thought there were going to be silly absurdist names like Quentin Fisbrill and the eyeball poppers.

811
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,520
What the hay.

812
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,840
Shucky darn.

813
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,380
Dad blame it, dad gummit, dad blast it.

814
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,460
Dog gone it.

815
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,740
Con sarn it, con found it.

816
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,340
Dad burn it.

817
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,260
Dad burn it and dag nab it are next to each other on this list, Dave.

818
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,880
I was reading dad burn it just when you said it.

819
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,560
Dave is awesome.

820
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,200
Here's the son of a series.

821
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,400
Son of a biscuit eater.

822
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,020
Son of a Baptist preacher.

823
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,840
Son of a nutcracker.

824
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,140
Son of a motherless goat.

825
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,820
Now we're understanding things better with motherless goat.

826
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,720
He leaves you.

827
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,440
Horse hockey, horse pucky, horse feathers, horse pitutti.

828
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,340
Sometimes when they talk about hockey, they go, let's get the puck out of here.

829
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,460
That's what it says right here.

830
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:55,580
For heaven's sake, for the love of Pete, for Pete's sake, or best of all, for crying out loud.

831
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,680
They forgot horses.

832
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,540
How about Cripes?

833
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,900
Always one of my favorites and I worship daily.

834
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:07,840
Cripes is in line here with criminy, creps, doo-doo, and caca.

835
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:09,900
Caca?

836
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,560
Yeah.

837
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,140
Well, that doesn't make a damn lick of sense.

838
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,900
Good gravy, good grief, gadzooks, jack wagon.

839
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,380
What is that?

840
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,260
Fiddle faddle.

841
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:22,500
What the hell is that?

842
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,020
Fiddle sticks.

843
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,200
Cotton picking malarkey.

844
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,460
Bucket head.

845
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,700
Malarkey.

846
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:31,880
Malarkey.

847
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:32,880
Knucklehead.

848
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,360
Shucks.

849
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:34,980
Rats.

850
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,460
Gosh.

851
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:36,740
Shizzle.

852
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,040
Toot.

853
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,160
What does toot have to do with shizzle?

854
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:47,500
Well, that's like if you belong to one of those special Korean supper clubs and stuff,

855
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,000
you have to wear that thing right on your nozzle.

856
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:55,300
And you have to make yourself available like to four-foot tall sailors and stuff like that.

857
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,880
It's not an easy work for anybody, especially if you've got like bloated eyes,

858
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,860
or if you just have an arm.

859
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,260
I know it's a tough time when your sockets are dry.

860
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,740
That's why everyone needs three times a day, just to sit back and relax and smoke one or

861
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,220
drink one.

862
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,160
Or have a couple of them.

863
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,280
Because you know it's going to be a long wait until the movie stops.

864
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,460
Hey, where are we?

865
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,840
Here's the lamest one on the alternative.

866
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:31,840


867
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,160
Alternative cuss words list.

868
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,020
H-E double hockey sticks.

869
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,880
Everybody loves that one.

870
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,660
H-E double hockey sticks.

871
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,880
That sounds like something Kimmy Schmidt would say.

872
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,800
Yeah, that is.

873
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,500
She says, what, the ham sandwich.

874
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,660
Right.

875
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,260
What, the ham sandwich.

876
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,420
And shut the front door.

877
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,860
She actually says that?

878
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,260
No, she doesn't.

879
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,540
Oh.

880
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,060
No, I said that.

881
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,500
That is a good one.

882
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:04,300
And it has the positive qualities of swear therapy.

883
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,100
Yes.

884
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:10,600
They say that if you swear enough, you feel relieved and won't have hypertension and slavery.

885
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,740
They makeotic lungs in different regions.

886
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,420
Wow.

887
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,220
At least I'd give it a try, but I'm on a different plan.

888
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,460
I'm on plan X from planet nine.

889
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,600
No, I'm on plan nine from outer space.

890
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,000
Yeah.

891
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,340
That's the way I don't have to play.

892
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,560
I don't have to play as much as I should.

893
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:38,960
The men from planet X have a plan for nine o'clock Sunday nights.

894
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:47,740
And that's to listen to The Hour of Slack on WCSB and insert station name here.

895
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,440
Because it's on nine o'clock Sundays everywhere.

896
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,480
Yes.

897
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,020
Forever.

898
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,640
Everywhere in the world.

899
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,140
The Hour of Slack.

900
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,620
Nine o'clock at nine.

901
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:58,880
Nine.

902
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,280
On channel nine.

903
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,060
That's a horrible, horrible thought.

904
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,300
But mine's so planned.

905
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:12,700
Little tiny babies and children will be struck asunder, sir, by such civility and stupidity.

906
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,720
Their minds laid waste.

907
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:25,740
But that evil Reverend Ivan's dad, who cares not a whit for any child he knows.

908
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,080
He can...

909
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,120
He can...

910
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,600
He can...

911
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:28,600


912
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,380
He just can't...

913
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,360
That's not him.

914
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,720
Who the hell is that?

915
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:38,940
I'll just light my ten million dollar cigar using this baby's head for a match.

916
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:50,060
For I am Ivan Stang, the most powerful cult leader since Jim Jones.

917
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,400
I can get 903 people to kill themselves.

918
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,580
I can get 903 people to kill themselves.

919
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,980
I can get 903 people to kill themselves.

920
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:02,980


921
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:02,980


922
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,440
And three of them cheated.

923
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,440
Hey, wait a minute, Stang.

924
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,980
I don't think you've had anybody...

925
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,880
You haven't had a heavy list of fatalities.

926
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,520
I mean, I know there's been some...

927
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,280
Not that we've advertised.

928
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,620
No, we haven't advertised the...

929
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,040
Yes, Pete, for sure.

930
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,800
No, we keep that on the DL.

931
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:28,080
Actually, Dave, X-Day two years ago, there were...

932
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,580
There were...

933
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,600
Some pretty serious, horrifying crimes.

934
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:40,760
However, the perpetrator got away with them because the perpetrator's name happened to be J.R. Bob Dobbs,

935
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,720
living avatar of Slack, luckiest guy in the whole world.

936
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,840
He made a million dollars every time he killed one of those jerks, accidentally.

937
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,480
I'm so happy about him.

938
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,360
He thought he was making sweet love to them.

939
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,700
Or their car, as the case may be.

940
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,440
The car got better mileage.

941
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,860
Under a running car, yeah.

942
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:06,380
Yeah, after he did their car, the Nostrils car, the car got better gas mileage.

943
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,020
Huh.

944
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,060
Go figure.

945
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:11,540
After Bob had had his way with it.

946
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,620
Using the exhaust pipe, apparently.

947
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,500
Uh-huh.

948
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,260
I'm surprised he could fit.

949
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,460
You mean they were actually consummating their solar eclipse?

950
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,380
Yep.

951
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,260
In the bassoon of a front-league bar?

952
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,380
In front of...

953
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,420
In the front...

954
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,180
In the front seat of a car, but Bob was in the back rocking it.

955
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,200
A car that was parked in the middle of a campground.

956
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,560
Yeah, but Bob was in the back rocking it.

957
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,460
He was attracted by the noises.

958
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,060
They were lucky because they kept the car door locked.

959
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,240
He didn't get in there and kill them with his love.

960
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,260
Reverend...

961
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,040
Reverend...

962
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,500
Oh, God, I can't even say his name on the radio.

963
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,220
He wasn't so lucky.

964
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,980
He ended up like that little dog, Snuckles.

965
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:56,920
Yeah.

966
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,060
Yeah, boned.

967
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,420
And I mean literally boned.

968
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,020
I don't mean euphemistically.

969
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,200
I mean his bones were removed from his body.

970
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,080
There was nothing there but blood and clothing.

971
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,200
And thanks, Bob.

972
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,440
Thanks, Bob.

973
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,120
Bob's been tapping my phone.

974
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,360
I noticed that.

975
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,440
He seems to know things he's not supposed to know.

976
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,980
And it's not true.

977
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,700
None of it's true.

978
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,840
I didn't say any of that, but he heard all of it.

979
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,980
Yeah, you have a teaching career.

980
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,860
So it can't be held against me.

981
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,660
Because Bob tapped my phone.

982
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:34,540
So if you hear recordings of me saying things that are reprehensible and horrible,

983
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,640
it doesn't matter because it's Bob's fault.

984
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,120
It's been rigged.

985
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,220
Yeah, it's been rigged.

986
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,180
It's all been set up.

987
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:41,880
Yeah.

988
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,860
Yeah, it's a set up.

989
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:51,160
Bob's been connecting his lines and putting a wiretap in his telephone for the last...

990
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:57,500
his cell phone for the last six and a half, three, seven, last few minutes right now.

991
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,360
Not shortly, but, you know, pretty soon.

992
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,460
Trump.

993
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,080
Did you know that Trump listens to this show and has a transcript made?

994
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:07,520
I know.

995
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,020
That's why he has these tirades at six in the morning.

996
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,480
That's a sign of dementia.

997
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,260
Right.

998
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,700
That he caught it from the hour of slack.

999
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,620
Dementia is contagious.

1000
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:24,560
And this show is the primary host for that parasite.

1001
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,180
And you'll see when you get hour of slack.

1002
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:32,960
And he's like, he thought he was a disciple of Reagan and they were going to teach him

1003
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,440
trickle down theory.

1004
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,460
Trickle down Alzheimer's.

1005
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:39,300
And actually it was yellow, golden showers and stuff.

1006
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:39,800
Right.

1007
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,040
Trickle down theories.

1008
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:41,680
And indeed.

1009
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:49,200
Trickle, trickle down Alzheimer's contagious because Reagan was in a band with me and Philo.

1010
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,340
I don't know if you knew that.

1011
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,320
No, I didn't know that.

1012
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:51,920
Oh yeah, of course.

1013
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,440
It's in Book of the Subgenius.

1014
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,000
He was in Doctors for One Pan.

1015
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:55,280
Oh.

1016
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,100
Yeah.

1017
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:01,520
He was in a band with, actually I wasn't in the band when Bob was in Doctors for One

1018
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:01,800
Pan.

1019
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:05,060
But Bob and Reagan and Philo all used to jam.

1020
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:05,880
Wow.

1021
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:06,600
Yeah.

1022
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,680
And Tim Crane, that one guitar player.

1023
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:11,900
Wow.

1024
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,760
So yeah, you just never know.

1025
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:26,160
One minute you're a successful underground happy, frop smoking beatnik improv jazz musician.

1026
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,020
Yeah.

1027
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:31,080
And then the next thing you know you're president who's completely unqualified.

1028
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,020
I had to keep coughing.

1029
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,960
One minute you're in a doctor band and the next minute you're president.

1030
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,340
Go figure.

1031
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:37,740
Go figure.

1032
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,300
It's crazy.

1033
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,400
I mean, it's crazy.

1034
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,880
The whole world's upside down.

1035
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,380
He was also an extra.

1036
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:49,160
Remember Jason and the Argonauts with Hans Harryhausen and the music by Bernard Herrmann?

1037
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,060
Yeah, sure.

1038
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,640
Yeah, I can recite that thing.

1039
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,160
You know the Harryhausen film there with Captain Sinbad and the eight-time champion?

1040
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1041
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1042
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1043
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1044
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1045
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1046
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1047
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1048
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1049
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1050
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1051
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1052
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1053
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1054
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1055
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,160


1056
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,260
It was like one of those tiny reptilian dwarfs from Alpha Centauri, remember that one?

1057
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:08,460
Do you remember one where you're in state panties and first three-quarters of the way

1058
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:14,100
out in the middle of the ocean and yet standing right on shore there and about ready to elaborate

1059
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,460
on everything.

1060
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,420
I don't know what you're talking about, but yous brine, man.

1061
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,940
It toughens the skin.

1062
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,960
Think, Dobbs.

1063
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,240
No one understands.

1064
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,140
Think.

1065
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,140
Thank Dobbs.

1066
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,600
Thank Dobbs.

1067
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,900
Just think what a heck of a position we'd be in.

1068
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,900
We'd definitely be on the receiving end of the storm.

1069
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,780
We'd be a magnet, you know?

1070
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,860
Thank Dobbs this show is only an hour long.

1071
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,420
Thank Dobbs for all the bounty he has given us.

1072
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,440
Oh, you don't like Faldi at all, do you, Mr. Stang?

1073
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:56,820
Oh, think of the 23 hours a day that Bob grabs us.

1074
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,740
We don't have to do this show.

1075
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:05,800
In his kindness, Bob gives us 23 hours out of each Sunday

1076
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,960
when we don't have to do or hear the hour of slack.

1077
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,000
Uh-oh, what's beeping?

1078
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,160
It's Philo Drummond calling your phone.

1079
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,320
Call me.

1080
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,960
Hey, wait a minute.

1081
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:18,360
Hold on.

1082
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,800
I'm going to have Holden accept.

1083
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:20,680
Hello?

1084
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,060
Hey, man, what's happening?

1085
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,920
You're on the hour of slack, Dr. Drummond.

1086
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,540
You're on the hour of slack.

1087
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,420
I had to put Dave on hold.

1088
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,100
You happened to call while we were doing the hour of slack.

1089
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,060
Hey, listeners, this is Dr. Philo Drummond who just accidentally called in.

1090
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,040
Say hi, Philo.

1091
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:42,740
Hi, Philo.

1092
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,040
How's it going?

1093
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:51,360
So, yeah, man, are you going to come to Austin and we're going to party with the girls and Paul Mavridis?

1094
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,380
Yeah, I guess as much as we can, sure.

1095
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,440
The listeners don't know this.

1096
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:17,960
By the time they hear this show, theoretically, we will all have been partying at South by Southwest with Johnny Depp and Neil Young and the Devos and Talking Heads and Jonathan Demme and Terrence Malick and Richard Linklater and all those Austin...

1097
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,060
So I should bring my autograph book, I guess.

1098
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:19,800
Huh?

1099
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,360
I should bring my autograph book.

1100
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,820
Robert Rodriguez will get to party with all those famous Austin movie people.

1101
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,040
Because they're making a movie about us because we're famous.

1102
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,360
Do we get to rub their elbows?

1103
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,760
We get to rub their elbows and...

1104
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,740
Hey, what do we rub their elbows with?

1105
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,760
And inspect their children because we are doctors.

1106
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:39,720
Arnica gel.

1107
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,520
Rub their elbows with arnica gel.

1108
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:47,440
Hey, I left Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, on the other line.

1109
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:47,680
Yeah, he's on hold.

1110
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,560
I guess we have to call...

1111
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,800
I don't even know how to do this.

1112
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,560
I don't know how to go back.

1113
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,600
Should I...

1114
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,480
Drop off?

1115
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,960
Would that bring him back if I dropped off?

1116
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,740
No, I don't want to bring him back.

1117
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,880
I want to kill him.

1118
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,340
We've been trying to keep him dead for years.

1119
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,660
He just keeps coming back.

1120
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,040
No, we love Dave.

1121
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,380
We don't want to kill Dave.

1122
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,800
I honestly don't know how you go back and forth on this phone.

1123
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,920
The show's almost over, though.

1124
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:17,920
That's the blessing.

1125
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,960
That's the most wonderful thing about it.

1126
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,600
Dr. Drummond, tell us about the Roku channel.

1127
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:26,460
OSI 74.

1128
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,280
Well, you know, it's a good thing that it's perfect timing

1129
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,340
because I just posted a new not director's cut

1130
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:39,020
with bonus super double secret footage.

1131
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,480
Unseen footage of Night of Slack.

1132
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:46,360
I just posted that on our OSI 74.

1133
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,980
The Night of Slack, the famous devival where J.R. Bob Dobbs was shot?

1134
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,940
Right, that's the one.

1135
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,320
And it has now...

1136
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:02,460
Legendary unseen outtake footage never before seen by human eyes

1137
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,640
that for now will be seen for the first time.

1138
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,060
Does it have glass madness?

1139
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:07,880
In the world.

1140
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:08,820
In the world.

1141
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:09,660
Does it have...

1142
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:10,960
No, I've seen it.

1143
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:11,600
It has glasses.

1144
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,660
It does have glasses.

1145
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,020
No, glass madness.

1146
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,020
It's glass madness performing.

1147
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,420
It does have glass madness.

1148
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:23,360
If I recall correctly, it has glass madness with a deaf sign language interpreter.

1149
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,080
Right.

1150
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:25,660
And it has...

1151
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,300
Negative Land.

1152
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,120
And has the weatherman doing 52 card pickup with the crowd.

1153
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:32,580
That's right.

1154
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,800
That was Negative Land's second live show, was it?

1155
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,480
Yeah, there was David Wills.

1156
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,260
A subgenius devival.

1157
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,320
Shut the front door.

1158
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,120
No, it's true.

1159
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:46,140
Famous Reckless was there on stage throwing cards at the crowd.

1160
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,660
And it really had them worked up.

1161
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,040
They were all laughing really hard during their performance.

1162
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,020
Wow.

1163
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,160
So that's up there now.

1164
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,800
We're getting ready to post...

1165
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:00,860
The second edition of Negative Land's Our Favorite Things.

1166
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,760
We posted the first one last month.

1167
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,500
And we're going to be posting the new...

1168
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,980
This is the bonus features from that same DVD.

1169
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:13,700
It's going to be up there with some subgenius stuff peppered in there.

1170
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,920
We also are working on the new Ministry of Slack episode.

1171
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,180
Reverend X is working on that.

1172
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,700
And he's got some of that new footage that you worked on.

1173
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,600
From the last X-Day.

1174
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:35,200
Yes, he told me that he's planning to do a special treatment of some of that footage.

1175
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:42,760
Yeah, he wanted some of the kind of raw footage of the camera walking around saying hi to people.

1176
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:43,580
We don't do that.

1177
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:43,780
Stuff like that.

1178
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,140
Because the only person that runs any cameras there is me.

1179
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,660
Yeah, so there's no reason to do any of that.

1180
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,260
Well, it's all...

1181
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,120
No reason at all.

1182
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:55,720
Yeah, who's going to film me if I'm doing all the...

1183
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,440
You're filming, so why film anything?

1184
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,200
That's what I said.

1185
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,220
Why would you care about that anyway?

1186
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,760
What are we going to do about Dave?

1187
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,200
Dave is like...

1188
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:03,780
It's like we can't...

1189
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,440
It's not at a real radio station.

1190
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,420
Everything's going through my iPhone.

1191
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,780
Oh, so you're at the radio station, huh?

1192
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,800
Yeah, I'm at the radio station in Glen Rose, Texas.

1193
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:18,420
Oh, the one on the hub of Stang Ranch?

1194
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,540
Yeah, the one on my dad's old table.

1195
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,120
Yes, the hub that we created, yes.

1196
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,660
The radio station in your mind.

1197
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,100
In our minds.

1198
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,360
In all of our minds.

1199
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,300
You know, I've been missing my radio show.

1200
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,160
I haven't been on the radio show in a month.

1201
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,720
Man, it must be terrible.

1202
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,860
I've just been working so hard.

1203
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,740
Poor Dr. Drummond.

1204
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,820
For the children.

1205
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,260
For a greener, brighter future, though.

1206
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,040
Green, that's good.

1207
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,280
That's better than a red future.

1208
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,980
Building a bridge into the future.

1209
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,200
Oh, that's great.

1210
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,760
That's the kind of guy I am, though.

1211
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:01,620
I try to do it all for everyone else.

1212
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,000
You're famous for that.

1213
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,760
My magnanimity.

1214
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:09,320
Well, this stupid show is almost over.

1215
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,180
We have to deal with Dave at some point.

1216
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,100
So do I?

1217
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:13,940
Should I drop off?

1218
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:20,160
Yeah, but you called with such serendipity.

1219
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,200
I hate to let it go.

1220
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:22,880
Yeah.

1221
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,280
We weren't...

1222
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:29,160
That TV show that Philo's talking about is on Roku television,

1223
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:34,240
which you have to have a little Roku dumaflachi.

1224
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:34,740
Right.

1225
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,940
But then you get millions and millions of channels

1226
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,640
that you can't get any other way, and they're quite good.

1227
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:40,840
Some of them.

1228
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:41,740
Some are quite bad.

1229
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,420
And then there's the subgenius channel on OSI 74.

1230
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,480
It's not all subgenius all the time,

1231
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,680
except in the subgenius section.

1232
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,260
It's a subgenius subsection.

1233
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,980
It's a subgenius section subchannel on OSI 74,

1234
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,680
which also hosts a lot of other...

1235
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,400
I would say it's subgenius-like material.

1236
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,280
Yes.

1237
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,060
In the way it's presented, as well as its content.

1238
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,480
It's all bulldot-ish.

1239
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,220
Yeah.

1240
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:19,160
Yeah, anybody would appreciate the nostalgic aspect of it, I think.

1241
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,760
Even if they aren't even old enough to know what nostalgia means.

1242
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:23,960
They'd still love it.

1243
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,620
Hey, I just thought of what we can tell Dave.

1244
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:27,140
What?

1245
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,980
Tell him I had another heart attack.

1246
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,480
No, no, no.

1247
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,660
That's a great story.

1248
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:32,460
It's not funny.

1249
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,460
That's a bad luck story.

1250
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,140
No, man.

1251
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:40,580
You would not believe I'm the rock star of the cardio rehab.

1252
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,440
Well, maybe you had a hard attack.

1253
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,520
Man, I had a hot attack.

1254
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,720
It just made me...

1255
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,780
Once they cleared out that blockage and Rhoda rooted me,

1256
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,140
that gave me superpowers.

1257
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,440
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1258
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,140
I can do anything.

1259
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,860
That's the kind of powers I normally have.

1260
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,180
Well, see, I've been wondering...

1261
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:03,240
Just from being alive.

1262
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:10,100
Okay, they have a defibrillator at the cardio rehab place in case one of...

1263
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,520
For some reason, it's all old people, Dr. Drummond.

1264
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,440
Really old people.

1265
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,280
I don't know what I'm doing there.

1266
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:14,620
They're old and they're fat.

1267
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,260
I don't know what I'm doing there.

1268
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,560
But I thought...

1269
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,740
I asked the nurse this.

1270
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:23,400
It's like, okay, if I'm dead and the defibrillator brings me back to life,

1271
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:30,240
if I'm normal, will the defibrillator give me mutant powers or give me super strength?

1272
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,680
And she said no, but I think she just said that to prevent me from trying it.

1273
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:35,640
Probably.

1274
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:35,780
Probably.

1275
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,060
Because that's what I'm going to do.

1276
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:42,200
Hey, you know, Reverend Stang, if everybody in the listening audience goes to...

1277
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:48,660
Even if they don't go to their Roku device to watch the new special non-director's cut

1278
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:53,120
of the Night of Slack, which includes the double super secret program,

1279
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:58,280
called Probationary Unseen, Never Before Seen by Humanized Footage, if they would just

1280
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,940
go and watch that, they would see Reverend Stang the way...

1281
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:08,460
When I think of Reverend Stang in my mind and I visualize him, that's what he looks

1282
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:08,840
like.

1283
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,960
Well, that's what I look like again now.

1284
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,180
I'm still the...

1285
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,700
With a green jacket, with a green jacket, ranting at the crowd.

1286
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,340
That's you.

1287
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,040
That was Paul Mavridis' green jacket.

1288
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,260
Because I didn't have anything that nice.

1289
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:21,500
It's an awesome jacket.

1290
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,920
I didn't have anything that nice.

1291
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,100
I didn't have anything that nice.

1292
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,080
Whose tie was it?

1293
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,780
I don't know.

1294
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,640
Somebody else's tie.

1295
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:27,980
Somebody else's tie.

1296
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:28,780
Is that when they...

1297
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,820
You're destroying watches right now.

1298
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:31,840
Is that when they grade your time?

1299
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,180
Say, look at what...

1300
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,180
You're controlling time.

1301
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:34,220
What's the whole distinction?

1302
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:38,340
You're giving a demonstration, the whole demonstration of time control right now.

1303
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:46,700
Well, folks, all I can say is that Night of Slack show was the high point of our career.

1304
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,360
It was, what, 20...

1305
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,300
No, 35 years ago now.

1306
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:50,960
So...

1307
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,160
Yeah.

1308
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:53,860
It's been going downhill ever since.

1309
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:54,960
Praise Bob.

1310
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,880
The people should go out there and watch it so that we can get millions and millions

1311
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:07,800
of hits and views on our Roku channel, which will drive billions of dollars towards the

1312
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,540
church's coffers, mighty coffers that need to be constantly filled.

1313
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,840
Yeah, we need lots of hits.

1314
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,020
Lots of hits and views.

1315
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:17,920
Because we like to...

1316
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,480
Those translate to real dollars.

1317
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,440
...every, like, five minutes.

1318
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:22,880
Those translate to real dollars.

1319
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,100
Yeah.

1320
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,000
Yeah.

1321
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:24,620
Yeah.

1322
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,200
Yeah.

1323
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:25,560
Yeah.

1324
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,440
That's...

1325
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,220
Real dollars.

1326
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,760
...subgenius.com.

1327
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:36,380
The first sentence on subgenius.com, well, after becoming ordained minister, the next

1328
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:40,240
sentence is about the Roku channel, and there's a link to it.

1329
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,020
So you can actually watch it on your computer.

1330
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:44,620
Yeah.

1331
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,260
Sort of.

1332
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:45,960
Because it goes...

1333
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,040
Well, it goes to Vimeo.

1334
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:51,240
We have all of our content is linked in Vimeo.

1335
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,080
That includes all that extra stuff.

1336
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:53,080


1337
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,200
All of the X Day stuff that I put out.

1338
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,020
It's uncensored, by the way, right?

1339
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,040
The raw X Day footage?

1340
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,740
It's raw X Day footage.

1341
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,560
Not safe for work or children.

1342
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:01,960
Ah.

1343
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,840
Twelve short subjects.

1344
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,180
Unless they're children that are older than 21.

1345
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,220
That's right.

1346
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,780
There are 12 X Day short subjects on that Vimeo thing.

1347
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,920
Also on RevStang YouTube.

1348
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,820
I noticed there wasn't a whole lot of...

1349
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:22,180
It wasn't as overly gratuitous in its nudity content this time, although...

1350
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:25,660
Oh, that's because I'm saving that footage for the 30-minute documentary.

1351
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,360
Oh, good.

1352
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:27,800
Good.

1353
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,020
The really hot...

1354
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:33,740
All the stuff that you're going, well, where's the real juicy, super juicy stuff?

1355
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,480
That's in the 30-minute documentary.

1356
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:41,720
That's the triple X-rated stuff that always happens every X Day uncontrollably everywhere.

1357
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:42,180
Yeah.

1358
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:42,860
Out of control.

1359
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:43,500
Nobody can stop it.

1360
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,420
Totally out of control.

1361
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,520
Nobody can stop it.

1362
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:49,960
It looks a lot like the orgy scene at the end of that movie Sausage Party.

1363
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:51,240
I thought it...

1364
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:51,960
I think...

1365
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:55,460
If I hadn't known that it had happened so many years ago, I would have thought that

1366
00:58:55,460 --> 00:59:00,020
that's what that scene in Caligula was based on, the movie Caligula.

1367
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:04,540
Well, that was based on the parties that Bob used to throw before they were called

1368
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,240
X Day.

1369
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,260
Oh, yeah.

1370
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:06,660
Okay.

1371
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,100
You were at those.

1372
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,100
I wasn't.

1373
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,300
They invited you.

1374
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:10,820
Oh, yeah.

1375
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,520
You got to go.

1376
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:12,440
They never invited me.

1377
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,080
Well, I had so many drugs.

1378
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,420
I had so many drugs, it's wiped that portion of my brain out, though.

1379
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,460
I can't really remember it, except for the sex.

1380
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:19,980
Hmm.

1381
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,160
Well, I hate to say it.

1382
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,000
But this show is pretty much over.

1383
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,120
And poor Dave was left in the lurch.

1384
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:26,220
Yeah.

1385
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,200
Poor Dave is dead.

1386
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:27,380
Poor Dave.

1387
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,640
He doesn't even know what happened.

1388
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,600
So, Dr. Drummond...

1389
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,240
Say hi to Dave.

1390
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,360
All right.

1391
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:33,800
Well...

1392
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:39,940
Like everyone else, we'll be listening to your show, The Puzzling Evidence Show, from

1393
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,580
Berkeley on KPFA.

1394
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,120
Yeah.

1395
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:43,960
And...

1396
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,140
When I make my glorious return this next week.

1397
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,680
Okay, Dr. Drummond.

1398
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,260
We'll see you.

1399
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:52,040
See you, Dr. Drummond.

1400
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:52,500
See you.

1401
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:52,720
Praise Bob.

1402
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,100
See you.

1403
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1404
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:58,040
See, he knows how to do the yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1405
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:58,740
Well, don't I?

1406
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,340
Because he invented it.

1407
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,800
He showed Mel Blanc how to do it.

1408
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,300
Now, what happens...

1409
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:04,740
I don't...

1410
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,020
I can't even unlock my phone.

1411
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,640
Okay, that was the hour of slack, friends.

1412
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,280
Subgenius.com.

1413
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,340
Now, what happened to Dave?

1414
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,660
Did we hang up with him?

1415
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:12,820
We killed Dave.

1416
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,200
Oh, no.

1417
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,020
Dave's dead.

1418
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:17,740
I'll try again.

1419
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,300
I have to do things.

1420
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:21,540
Bye.

1421
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:21,760
Bye.

1422
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:21,940
Bye.

1423
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:22,020
Bye.

1424
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:22,020


1425
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:22,020


1426
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:22,020


1427
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:22,020


1428
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:22,020


1429
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:22,020


1430
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,340
Dave, I'm sorry.

1431
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,780
We had a little accident there.

1432
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,080
You had an accident?

1433
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,780
Yeah, I had another heart attack.

1434
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,040
No, I'm just kidding.

1435
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:33,780
I'm just kidding.

1436
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:34,900
We...

1437
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:40,300
I got another call, and I picked it up, and it was Dr. Drummond.

1438
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:51,080
And we hadn't had him on the show ever, and it was such a serendipitous moment that we

1439
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,020
got carried away.

1440
01:00:52,040 --> 01:01:00,500
And we ended up talking and doing a bunch of promos for his Roku Subgenius TV show channel,

1441
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,380
which there is one.

1442
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:04,440
That's why you were in the mood.

1443
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:08,520
Well, we were doing the show, and the whole time we kept talking about, what do we do

1444
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,080
about Dave?

1445
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:16,020
And I didn't know how to make my phone switch back and forth between the two calls, because

1446
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,000
I've never had two calls at once.

1447
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:21,540
And I still don't know how to, actually.

1448
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:24,020
What happened on your end?

1449
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:26,740
Did you just wait and wait and wait, and it finally hung up?

1450
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:29,220
Yeah.

1451
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,300
I'm sorry.

1452
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,440
Well, that's all right.

1453
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:40,220
But it was one of those crazy things where it was the unexpected.

1454
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,940
It sounded like it worked out poise-ically.

1455
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,500
But then we used up all of the show.

1456
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,200
Except for this part.

1457
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:51,520
What?

1458
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,520


1459
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,520


1460
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,520


1461
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,520


1462
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,520


1463
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,520


1464
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,520


1465
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,520


1466
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,520


1467
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,520


1468
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,520


1469
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,520


1470
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,520


1471
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,520


1472
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:51,520


1473
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,240
Oh, which doesn't have any background music.

1474
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,660
Maybe I should start that up.

1475
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:03,400
We can still do the ad part of the show where we tell people off the broadcast radio, only

1476
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,320
on the internet.

1477
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,500
We can tell them that, really, if you want to be a cool subgenius and know what's really

1478
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,760
going on, you want to be a member.

1479
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:10,540
Want to be a member.

1480
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:18,180
And it's only 35 bucks, and you get a huge package of really cool stuff, including decals

1481
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:19,140
and a decoder pin.

1482
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,500
And you're an ordained minister.

1483
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:21,500


1484
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:30,400
And you can eavesdrop and tap our phone and look at the scrubgenius secret members only

1485
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,840
forum, which has the good pictures.

1486
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,240
Much better than Facebook.

1487
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:35,660
Mm-hmm.

1488
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:37,980
They're pretty.

1489
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,540
So there's that.

1490
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,240
Pretty stupid.

1491
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,180
Well, you don't know.

1492
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,440
Well, no, of course I don't know.

1493
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:46,040
I don't know anything.

1494
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,500
But I'm acceding to this.

1495
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,120
It's like a response for the moment.

1496
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,660
They are pretty stupid, though.

1497
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:51,500
Yeah.

1498
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,760
I thought they were.

1499
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,840
I posted a picture of a fossil.

1500
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:58,900
I would have volunteered another comment, like, they have 12 tits apiece or something, you

1501
01:02:58,900 --> 01:02:59,540
know, like a dog.

1502
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:08,080
I posted a photograph of a fossil ghost skeleton today on scrubgenius forum that we just discovered.

1503
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:12,140
Every time we make a new discovery, I post it there immediately.

1504
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:14,400
The fossil robot.

1505
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:18,520
Dave, you probably don't know about the fossil robot skeleton we found.

1506
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,560
A fossil prehistoric...

1507
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:21,500


1508
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:21,900
Robot.

1509
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,260
Skeleton.

1510
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:29,420
Laying on the ground, broken up, it was sproinged or something in its death throes, and its

1511
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:34,400
spine was all real, real long and sproingy, like a bad spring.

1512
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,880
And it was a robot.

1513
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:38,320
It had little red buttons on its chest.

1514
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,720
Of course, they'd fossilized, turned to stone.

1515
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:47,680
And one of those sort of perpetually surprised robot expressions that they tend to have.

1516
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:49,480
And...

1517
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:50,880
Yeah.

1518
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,220
It was made of stone.

1519
01:03:52,460 --> 01:04:00,780
The metal had converted to stone, and it was a fossil robot that we date at around 110

1520
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:03,040
million years B.C.

1521
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:07,580
The ghost skeleton is kind of, who knows?

1522
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:08,980
You can't date those.

1523
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,200
They don't have carbon.

1524
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:15,860
Now, these are actual rock formations in the plunderers of your hacienda town?

1525
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,380
Yeah, yeah.

1526
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,860
We, yeah, we discover these fossils all the time.

1527
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:21,260
You know, we're opening a museum.

1528
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:23,420
And we've got a devil skeleton.

1529
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:25,940
Prehistoric devil, of course, not a modern one.

1530
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:29,680
Yeah, you're gonna have like, kind of like a mammoth cave going down, kind of thing,

1531
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,460
going down there.

1532
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:31,120
We have caves.

1533
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,380
Take gondola rides through the middle of the Stangler Rancho and stuff.

1534
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:35,160
Right.

1535
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,000
Yeah, that's called the murder run.

1536
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,600
It's like, run for your life ride.

1537
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:45,360
Well, as long as you can see the top of the Cinderella wheel, you know you're not gonna

1538
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,460
pass by that quickly.

1539
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:50,140
And there's the, uh, the snake nest ride.

1540
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,240
Yeah.

1541
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:51,240


1542
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:51,240


1543
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:56,080
Where you go down into the snake nest and then run back out real fast.

1544
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,000
Because we don't tell them that it's a snake nest.

1545
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:02,560
We tell them, hey, you want to see our final attraction, man-eating chicken.

1546
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,640
It's down there in that cave.

1547
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,740
And they go in the cave and of course it's full of rattlesnakes.

1548
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:11,260
And, and they, they get a thrill.

1549
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:12,180
That's a big thrill.

1550
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,560
I would like to buy some land.

1551
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,480
Any land.

1552
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,500
And we got dinosaur, ghost dinosaur tracks.

1553
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:23,780
They're kind of blurry.

1554
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,920
But that makes them special.

1555
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,560
You know, because they're left by ghost dinosaurs.

1556
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,200
Yeah.

1557
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:32,060
And, uh.

1558
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:40,200
Just a little, little flavor, a little essential flavor of, of, uh, hey, how come you keep

1559
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:45,660
on using the word mango and Mussolini all the time when you're talking about dis, disallowing

1560
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:46,980
and disaffection and stuff.

1561
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,280
I was about to ask you that.

1562
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:53,980
Dave, you've said that phrase mango Mussolini about 10 times on this show.

1563
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:58,900
I thought it was at least 25, 30, 33,000 million times.

1564
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:08,280
You know, some really substantial number, not just some kind of cockamamie, uh, reportage

1565
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,280
has nothing to do with reality.

1566
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,860
I, I'm sorry.

1567
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:14,240
I'm just sickened.

1568
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,400
And, and hey, what are they?

1569
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,320
What's petards?

1570
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,980
Is that like under, that's like leotards or something?

1571
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,880
Petards like hoist upon thine own petard.

1572
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,800
Hoisted by one's own petards.

1573
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:25,480
Yeah.

1574
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,240
Yeah.

1575
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:34,840
Hey, that's actually, that's, that's, that's a rude way of talking that exploits, uh, petarded

1576
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,600
people who wear petards.

1577
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,540
See, yeah, that's one philosophy.

1578
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,140
One theory was petard people.

1579
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:42,340
Petards.

1580
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,840
He's wearing a petard.

1581
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,080
Hey, petardo.

1582
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,040
Don't play petards.

1583
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:46,500
Yeah.

1584
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:48,460
He's hoisted on his own petardo.

1585
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:48,960
Yeah.

1586
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:50,420
It's okay.

1587
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:51,600
Cause Trump's president now.

1588
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,660
We can say that now.

1589
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:53,780
It's okay.

1590
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:54,740
Cause Trump's president.

1591
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:55,180
Yeah.

1592
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:56,860
Retard, petard.

1593
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:59,120
See, I could say that Trump's president now.

1594
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:02,720
So that's the real etymology of the, of the erection.

1595
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:05,660
That's the reason why you can't go all the way back into the future.

1596
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:10,400
There weren't exactly what you were talking about because there's a, I don't know, there's

1597
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:16,020
a big block against people studying the ancient wisdoms or, uh, uh, you know, the, the, the

1598
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:16,020


1599
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:16,360
So that's where these bad, uh, these, these works are tied.

1600
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:16,360


1601
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:16,580
And we, uh, we were like, I garnered the basics of science and knowledge.

1602
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:18,200
It's, um, it's something like that.

1603
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,020
Is it something like that?

1604
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:24,260
Well, there's a block against science, knowledge, and truth these days because it gets in the

1605
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:25,200
way of the agenda.

1606
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:32,780
The beautiful agenda which rises up around us like a flowering garden.

1607
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,060
Aww Ø¶ï¿½

1608
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:37,500
Things will be back the way they used to be.

1609
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:40,240
I love the flowery agenda.

1610
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:45,860
With feudal landowners, and I will be like an English lord, l l lording it over

1611
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,940
my feudal serfs in their

1612
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,900
futile lives of

1613
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:50,420
servitude.

1614
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,940
Because Trump's president now, so I

1615
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:54,560
can say that.

1616
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:57,480
Yeah.

1617
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,140
Go cry, snowflake.

1618
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,160
I call them snowflakes.

1619
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,100
You got a cooler with that,

1620
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:13,940
man. You trying to hurt me or what?

1621
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:15,520
Jeez.

1622
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,340
I'm trying to be president.

1623
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,080
The plane goes up and down my spine every time

1624
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,960
you do that. I'm thinking about running

1625
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:22,680
for president.

1626
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:25,700
I'm stupid.

1627
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,120
Vote for me, because I'm

1628
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:28,580
the best.

1629
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,160
You can't interrupt

1630
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,120
the flow of the

1631
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,220
disgorgement all at the same time

1632
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,840
because then everybody

1633
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,540
loses their noodles, so to speak.

1634
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,920
They'll just forget what

1635
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,780
they're doing there for.

1636
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,080
That sells now. That's what sells.

1637
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,440
That's what the kids want.

1638
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,940
That's all they'll listen to.

1639
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,200
Any 52-year-old

1640
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,960
kid could understand that, that's

1641
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,960
for sure. Especially if their

1642
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:00,920
hair was on fire.

1643
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,940
I don't know if we can get

1644
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,420
away with that on the air, though. Do you

1645
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:07,780
want to try it, or should we leave them

1646
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:09,240
out of the argument, so to speak?

1647
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,920
Well, first I have to ask you

1648
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,620
this, Dave. Would you

1649
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:15,800
as a friend, as a friend,

1650
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,900
would you tell me if my face

1651
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:18,860
was on fire?

1652
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,240
Um, yeah.

1653
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,440
You would? Of course.

1654
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,740
You're a mensch.

1655
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,780
Thanks. I'm a true mensch.

1656
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:29,720
There's some people, it's like they're talking to their

1657
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,580
friend and the friend's face is on fire

1658
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,980
and they'll go, well, sir's him right if he doesn't

1659
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:35,960
know. I'll just let his face

1660
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,340
burn. I'm not even going to tell him.

1661
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,940
How do you live with people like that?

1662
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,700
Especially if your yacht's

1663
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,680
broken up and it's different tiny little

1664
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,820
small pieces floating around the harbor.

1665
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,860
Nobody can get to it and you just realize

1666
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:49,160
you lost one

1667
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,920
peahole of a lot of money.

1668
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:53,640
Yeah, well, but it's

1669
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,920
yeah, there's other yachts.

1670
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:57,700
Yeah, Buffalo.

1671
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,880
You lost one yacht. You can get

1672
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:00,520
another yacht.

1673
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:03,580
Yeah, you

1674
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:05,500
want to make sure the passage is

1675
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,300
smooth like the...

1676
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,160
What's that movie, Tristan?

1677
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,580
They sold it by Shakespeare or something, right?

1678
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,980
I never saw that

1679
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,580
and they didn't have a classic

1680
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,460
illustrated of it, so I'm not

1681
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,340
familiar with it.

1682
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:21,580
I thought, sure,

1683
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:22,900
you would know of all people.

1684
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,340
Of course, a lot of times you don't like to

1685
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:26,900
refer to yourself as a people.

1686
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:28,700
I've

1687
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:31,480
actually read a lot of

1688
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,400
Shakespeare, but I've read

1689
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,680
a lot more science fiction.

1690
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,460
One of my favorites was

1691
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:38,900
A Midsummer Night's Dream

1692
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,340
when they had the orchestra

1693
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:43,380
was, I forget, who was

1694
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:45,120
the one guy who was the opioid addict?

1695
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,800
He's shooting right in his brain.

1696
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:47,940
Dr. Morpheus.

1697
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,780
Dr. Morpheus.

1698
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,220
Dr. Morpheus.

1699
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,360
They named that for the strip, right?

1700
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,960
That was like the days of burlesque halls and stuff like that.

1701
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,100
Yeah, that drew

1702
01:10:59,100 --> 01:10:59,720
the crowds.

1703
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,720
He handled

1704
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:03,520
underpants.

1705
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,460
They joked about

1706
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:09,020
calling it the cheesy part, but that was just

1707
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:10,720
a slogan...

1708
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,600
Gildan Stern and Underpants?

1709
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,580
Gildan Stern and Morgan Stern are dead.

1710
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:15,420
Underpants.

1711
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,200
Yep.

1712
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,040
I try to forget it, you know what I mean?

1713
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,160
The first thing

1714
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,840
I asked in freshman English

1715
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,280
was if we'd ever heard of that.

1716
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:34,060
I know you don't want to talk about that.

1717
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:35,560
You're having a talk about something

1718
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,160
substantial, has some meaning,

1719
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:39,840
you know.

1720
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:42,940
I don't know.

1721
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,700
I don't want to talk about things that

1722
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:45,580
trigger me.

1723
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,540
Those are triggers.

1724
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,320
I don't want to think about things

1725
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,920
that are bad.

1726
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,640
I only want to think

1727
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,140
about things that are good.

1728
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:58,400
Like her.

1729
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,280
She's singing again, Dave.

1730
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,640
That giant woman

1731
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,200
that humps your leg at work.

1732
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,880
She's singing again.

1733
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:10,340
She's singing about love of you.

1734
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:11,560
She's singing about you.

1735
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,600
She doesn't love me.

1736
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:15,800
She loves you, Dave.

1737
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,040
They all love you.

1738
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:17,980
I know.

1739
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,540
She's singing.

1740
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:22,020
In heaven, everything is fine.

1741
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,780
Well, in Italian.

1742
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:27,460
In heaven, everything is fine.

1743
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:31,020
You got yours and baby, I got mine.

1744
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:33,260
Yep.

1745
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,080
That's the way I remember it.

1746
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,080
That was that movie about your life

1747
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,200
called Eraserhead.

1748
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:39,660
Mm-hmm.

1749
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:41,740
They made a documentary about

1750
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:43,280
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1751
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,680
in the 80s.

1752
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,060
80s?

1753
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:46,820
Around 1980 or so, was it?

1754
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:47,980
Called it Eraserhead?

1755
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,860
I think it was 1980.

1756
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,300
Maybe it was even 79.

1757
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:51,160
It could have been.

1758
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,780
If you were a hipster,

1759
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:53,880
it could have been 79.

1760
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:54,820
Right.

1761
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,740
And if you were, you know,

1762
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:57,620
It was just before.

1763
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,740
ate a lot of frozen TV dinners

1764
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:01,280
and stuff, it was probably 1981.

1765
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:02,700
Yeah.

1766
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,900
Yeah, I identified with that movie.

1767
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,340
I was a young man

1768
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,460
who had just gotten married

1769
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:10,000
and had a first kid.

1770
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,300
And the kid had a,

1771
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,380
was like a worm-headed snake being

1772
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:15,380
with no limbs.

1773
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:15,980
Yeah, yeah.

1774
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,160
I love to make you that.

1775
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:17,360
Yeah.

1776
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,000
Make this horrible noise.

1777
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:21,500
Yeah, that was my,

1778
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,920
I was that guy.

1779
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:24,300
Yeah.

1780
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,740
I mean, I was feeling,

1781
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:26,940
that's why I was so popular,

1782
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,620
especially among the bird people.

1783
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:29,560
Remember those guys

1784
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,620
that used to shoot up the meetings

1785
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,960
and everything like that?

1786
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:35,220
And one time they clipped his honor,

1787
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,160
the great, you know,

1788
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:37,880
the big pooh-wow,

1789
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:38,520
what's his name?

1790
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:39,240
I don't know.

1791
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,880
I never worked in Hollywood again

1792
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:41,480
after that.

1793
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:43,920
They made sure I'd never work

1794
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:44,300
in Hollywood.

1795
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:44,980
They would after that.

1796
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:45,260
Yep.

1797
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,960
No more fight kicking for you,

1798
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:47,560
you know?

1799
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:48,220
Ha, ha, ha.

1800
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,900
I mean, I guess you're supposed

1801
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,340
to try and keep from regurgitating

1802
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:52,820
like you're chasing a dolphin

1803
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:53,440
or something.

1804
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,660
Oh, man.

1805
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:57,380
I don't know where to get

1806
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,600
or where to leave off

1807
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,880
or where to start, you know?

1808
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:01,280
That's the human condition.

1809
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:01,960
It's what's wrong

1810
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:02,980
with our country today.

1811
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:04,180
Yep.

1812
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:06,480
Yep.

1813
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,860
It's the human condition, man.

1814
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,700
I believe what I need to believe.

1815
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:14,680
Yep.

1816
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,700
It's called cognitive dissonance.

1817
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,420
It's when things don't line up

1818
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:20,660
in your cognition areas.

1819
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,120
Bob sold it.

1820
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:23,860
I smoked it.

1821
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:24,740
That settles it.

1822
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:27,720
I'm going to keep these...

1823
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:28,480
You were dissonant too, wasn't he?

1824
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:30,440
I'm going to tighten these blinkers

1825
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,360
even tighter around my eyes.

1826
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:34,400
I'm going to see a 10-degree

1827
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,980
field of view.

1828
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,860
That way I only see

1829
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:39,180
what I aim my head at,

1830
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:40,160
what I want to see.

1831
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:41,560
I don't need to see

1832
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,080
some damn other things

1833
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,360
that are trying to show me

1834
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:44,560
different.

1835
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,860
Screw that stuff.

1836
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,080
I'm going to see

1837
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,360
what I'm going to look at.

1838
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,420
I'm only going to see

1839
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:52,760
what I want to look at.

1840
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,120
You can't blame me for that,

1841
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:55,800
now can you?

1842
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:57,680
That's a man's right

1843
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,860
to see only what he wants to see

1844
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:00,860
and believe only

1845
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:01,940
what he wants to believe.

1846
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,600
It's the pulling of the wool

1847
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,000
over one's own eyeballs.

1848
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:05,600
That's it.

1849
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:07,340
That's what Bob taught.

1850
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,060
Break thinking.

1851
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,160
You just stop.

1852
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:10,900
You just quit thinking about it.

1853
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,280
You don't use your mind

1854
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,340
to think about your religion.

1855
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,800
You just believe.

1856
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:18,740
That's it.

1857
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:20,580
Yep.

1858
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:22,900
That's why I'm going to be

1859
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:23,840
crying in my beer.

1860
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,720
That's why I like fake news,

1861
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,000
like the Bible,

1862
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:29,740
the Koran,

1863
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:32,660
or the Holy Book of the Subgenius.

1864
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,780
I love the fake news.

1865
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,860
Fake news gives me hope,

1866
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,160
hope for the future.

1867
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:39,720
The real news fills me with

1868
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:42,440
fear, loathing, terror.

1869
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,900
I like the fake news.

1870
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:44,780
Praise Bob.

1871
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:46,820
Praise Bob.

1872
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:47,960
Yeah.

1873
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,660
These are not scientific.

1874
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,840
Wonder like some of them are.

1875
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:55,020
All right.

1876
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,540
Well, Dave, you know what?

1877
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:00,400
I'm going to have to go

1878
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,640
because of the simple reason

1879
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,800
that my tape recorder

1880
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,080
is running out of tape

1881
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,580
or battery, actually.

1882
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,800
It's a digital recorder.

1883
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,140
It's running out of battery.

1884
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,580
So I'm going to have to make it stop

1885
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:12,760
or I'm afraid it won't save.

1886
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,160
OK.

1887
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:16,020
An hour and 17 minutes.

1888
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:16,800
All right.

1889
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,320
All right.

1890
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,740
That gets me off the hook.

1891
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,260
Well, I don't know about that.

1892
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,120
Well,

1893
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,560
we'll have to do it again

1894
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:30,580
next week,

1895
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,660
except we're not going to be here

1896
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:32,180
next week,

1897
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:34,940
but we'll have to do a rerun

1898
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:35,420
next week

1899
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,280
or run this five times.

1900
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,880
That's what they do at some stations.

1901
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,080
Ha, ha, ha.

1902
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:43,920
Ha, ha, ha.

1903
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:44,460
OK.

1904
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:45,760
Nighty-night, Dave.

1905
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:46,560
We have to go now.

1906
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,200
I'm going to try to send you

1907
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:49,760
them illustrations

1908
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,400
if you feel like doing that

1909
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,040
and so forth.

1910
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:53,640
Yeah, yeah.

1911
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:54,460
You better send them.

1912
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,080
OK.

1913
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:57,420
And friends,

1914
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:58,460
the place to send

1915
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:59,680
your illustrations is

1916
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,320
Post Office Box 807

1917
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,480
Glen Rose, Texas

1918
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:07,260
76043.

1919
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:08,580
Isn't that amazing?

1920
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,180
Yes.

1921
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:12,580
Ha, ha, ha.

1922
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:14,800
I'm sorry.

1923
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,060
Well, we'll be back

1924
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:17,060
in Cleveland in May.

1925
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:21,680
And until then,

1926
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:24,080
we must fade out.

1927
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:26,800
Fade away.

1928
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,620
It's better to fade away

1929
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:31,540
than burn out.

1930
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,500
Oh, he's gone.

1931
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,260
Well, so are we.
