00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,840
From PR News in Washington, I'm scratched at a U.S. military lab in Rancho Mirage

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,460
and one side of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,560
Governor Pat is urging caution.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,040
President Obama has left snowbound drought-stricken California.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,860
The president's visit will demonstrate his concern about California,

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,840
the worst states.

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,120
During a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah,

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:36,700
he'll announce $160 in federal livestock in Southern California.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,880
White House spokesman Jay Carney and Mr. Obama are at a stalemate.

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,480
The two met separately with a mediator today

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,760
and hurled insults at each other in press conferences afterwards.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,340
The worst presidents in over 100 years.

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,940
But the meetings increasingly seem fruitless.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,160
Russian foreign officials condemned the U.S. for seeking PR news in Geneva.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,640
An independent investigator says

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:58,840
the U.S. is the only country in the world that has a U.S. state.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,880
This is PR News in Washington.

18
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,040
From here on out, it's up to you, Mac.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,380
All right, Mac.

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,220
You got it?

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:09,820
Yeah.

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,680
Okay, now, it's coming at you, too.

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,920
Handle it gentle now.

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,680
All right.

25
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,880
I've got it.

26
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,300
Here.

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,200
All right.

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,440
One, two, four, three.

29
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,460
The subgenius.

30
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,880
Power of the subgenius.

31
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,140
I'll call in first.

32
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,800
Good, though.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,220
Yeah.

34
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:30,660
Good.

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,100
Okay, now, let's get to work.

36
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:32,440
Here.

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,000
Here are the time bombs you rigged up.

38
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,780
Six grenades.

39
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,260
Yeah, that ought to do it.

40
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,860
Shalakandala nebastoya!

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,760
Shalakandala nebastoya!

42
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,720
Bob?

43
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,240
Bob?

44
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,040
Bob?

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,420
Bob?

46
00:01:59,760 --> 00:01:59,760


47
00:01:59,760 --> 00:01:59,860
Bob?

48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:00,860
Bob?

49
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:00,860


50
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:00,860


51
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:00,860


52
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:00,860


53
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:00,860


54
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:00,860


55
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:00,860


56
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:00,860


57
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:00,860


58
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:00,860


59
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:00,860


60
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:00,860


61
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:00,860


62
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:00,860


63
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,860
certain

64
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,120
...

65
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,620
Concentrate, Dagger.

66
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,260
There it is.

67
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,500
All right.

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:30,860
I forgive your would-be otras.

69
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:30,860


70
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:30,860


71
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,420
ل

72
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,060
I'm getting you the only thing there is to eat in this here swamp.

73
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,860
Right here! You've arrived!

74
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,740
Right here! You've arrived!

75
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,400
Right here! You've arrived!

76
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,560
Right here! Here! Here! Here!

77
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,720
Uh, excuse me, just a country sing.

78
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,380
I'm the new farm caretaker!

79
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,520
Ha ha ha!

80
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,280
Gah ha!

81
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,120
I hit that moth one of my...

82
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,260
...early in the night.

83
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,460
Aaaaaah!

84
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,340
Aaaaaah!

85
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,660
Fwennnnafman! Fwennnnafman!

86
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,340
Okay, the geniuses will see us now.

87
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,940
Now remember, when you speak to the geniuses, keep your questions short and to the point.

88
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,300
The geniuses do not like those who waste their time.

89
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,300
Genius, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.

90
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Hm, I might need to bring another genius in on this.

91
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,780
We're gonna have to bring more geniuses in on this.

92
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,420
Yeah, I think we should have a quickening with all the geniuses.

93
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,560
I'll summon the council.

94
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,700
Okay, if you guys just wait here a sec,

95
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,240
we're gonna have a quickening with the council of the...

96
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,840
...council of geniuses.

97
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,380
See what we can do for you.

98
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,280
Alright, now!

99
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,160
We've taken out most of the synagogues, destroyed San Francisco,

100
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,760
sent my friends into a dark oblivion,

101
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,100
and so our next order of business will be Burning Man!

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,960
Burning Man is the biggest hippie festival in the world,

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,440
and tomorrow, we're gonna wipe them all out!

104
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,860
May I ask where you attend church?

105
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,840
Oh, I... I ain't got no time for no church.

106
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,900
No time for God's people?

107
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,120
We all need accountability and encouragement from each other.

108
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,340
Yes, this is important.

109
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,400
We should all strive to be good people towards our fellow man.

110
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,760
But if one separates oneself from a local fellowship of believers,

111
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,400
it makes it difficult to live.

112
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,220
What are you, man? Some kind of preacher?

113
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,840
Perhaps the two of us could attend a service together.

114
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,220
Hey, look, I already told you, I ain't got time for no church.

115
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,620
Besides, I gotta work here tomorrow.

116
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,440
Tomorrow? On Sunday?

117
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,700
Well, this should be a day of rest,

118
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,260
where we enjoy fellowship with family, friends, and...

119
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:16,820
Shh! Quiet!

120
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,260
The Self Genius Hour of Squash!

121
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,860
Now she looks like a different girl.

122
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,200
We've given her a fashionable choppy bob,

123
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,520
and she's got a nice little hat.

124
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,360
Oh, look who's talking.

125
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,640
Yeah, Bob, you used to be on this show.

126
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,680
Your basic plan was pure genius.

127
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,200
But it takes a very special type of genius to...

128
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,560
All right, Bob, it's over. Come out with your hands up.

129
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,360
A good way to understand quantum...

130
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,120
A good way to understand quantum...

131
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,860
A good way to understand quantum...

132
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,220
A good way to understand quantum cryptography

133
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,780
is to think of three people.

134
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,520
Alice, Bob, and Eve.

135
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,180
Alice wants to send secret information to Bob,

136
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,420
and Eve wants to listen in...

137
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,500
Alice takes her information,

138
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,020
a string of zeros and ones, or bits,

139
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,780
and encodes them on photons, particles of light.

140
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,400
Now, the encoding is done in such a way

141
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,400
that Eve, if she looks at these photons,

142
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,640
will inevitably mess them up.

143
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,460
She'll change them in a way

144
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,380
that Alice and Bob can figure out.

145
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,420
So, after Alice has sent the photons to Bob,

146
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,520
she and Bob can confer

147
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,380
to find out which photons have been tampered with.

148
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,420
The photons that haven't been tampered with,

149
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,620
the pristine photons,

150
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,860
now constitute a secret key

151
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,720
shared only by Alice and Bob,

152
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,220
whose security is guaranteed by the laws of physics.

153
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,700
So, essentially, what someone would do

154
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,600
is sit down at a computer and start performing it.

155
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,460
And what the computer does is takes that data

156
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,440
and it will look at their performance on the train sequence

157
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,400
versus novel sequences they've never performed before.

158
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,620
And you can use that information to say,

159
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,660
this participant knows that particular data

160
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,640
or knows that particular information,

161
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,180
therefore it's Bob.

162
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,580
You don't have to know nothing else about them.

163
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,080
It's simply their performance and their motor abilities

164
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,400
that can tell you who they are based on what they know.

165
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,120
I'll sue the church!

166
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,760
We can't sue the church.

167
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,120
They'll poke fun at us in the church bulletin.

168
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,640
It wouldn't be the first time.

169
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,120
Please don't sue the church.

170
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,200
I'm asking you as your friend and neighbor.

171
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,700
Back to you, Bob.

172
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,560
Your Honor, we don't have that kind of money.

173
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,560
We're not a synagogue.

174
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,440
In that case, I award the deed to the church.

175
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,580
You're giving him the church?

176
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,520
Last time, please give the church back.

177
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,220
That is gonna drive me nuts.

178
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,560
Look, this church is our only option.

179
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,960
Don't you kids want to live here?

180
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,480
Anything's better than that dump we came from.

181
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,180
Anything's better than that dump we came from.

182
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,180
I'm so sorry for all your horrible problems.

183
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,420
Wherever shall we go?

184
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,800
You can come to my church.

185
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,760
And what church might that be?

186
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,240
The church of the subgenius.

187
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,280
Oh, yeah, that's right.

188
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,980
Let's do something else.

189
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,440
There's always an exhale involved.

190
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,260
I know, I noticed.

191
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,960
This is adorable.

192
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,940
This is adorable.

193
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,040
This is adorable.

194
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,400
Shut up. Are you pink?

195
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,300
It's just so funny since we showed you a pink and you were like, poo.

196
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,540
What happened?

197
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:19,800
Yeah.

198
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,600
Um, I said, Ashlyn, I really liked it.

199
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,140
Oh, okay, so somebody must get on n***a thing and then you can change your mind?

200
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,520
Yes.

201
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,240
Oh!

202
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,540
Got my first bobble.

203
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,440
Kinda looks like me.

204
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,880
Most bobble see don't even look like guys, but this actually looks like myself.

205
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,980
What happened?

206
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,240
Yeah.

207
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:37,820
Poo.

208
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,980
He killed Bob.

209
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,140
Maybe Bob asked for it.

210
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,140
I know he did.

211
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,760
But you didn't know his other side.

212
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,780
He could be real sweet.

213
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,320
He wasn't just any boy.

214
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,100
Bob had something that made him different.

215
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,180
Made people follow him.

216
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,360
Maybe a little better than the crowd.

217
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:04,960
You know what I mean?

218
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,160
Yeah, well, that's okay, because I don't want you to go see him anyways.

219
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,540
We don't need your damn charity.

220
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,260
I wasn't trying to give you charity.

221
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,340
I only wanted to help.

222
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,160
I'm sorry.

223
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,020
I'm sorry.

224
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,140


225
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,700
I'm sorry.

226
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:20,740


227
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:20,740


228
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:20,740


229
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:20,740


230
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:20,740


231
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:20,740


232
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:20,740


233
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:20,740


234
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:20,740


235
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:20,740


236
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:20,740


237
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:20,740


238
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,620
Just kidding, you don't need to go see me.

239
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,580
I have to go, I just got off the moon.

240
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:27,580


241
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,100
Counting down, you said time was holding you back.

242
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,220
Why not?

243
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,760
However, you know what happened to Bob's heart?

244
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:31,760


245
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:31,760


246
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:31,760


247
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:31,760


248
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:31,760


249
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:31,760


250
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:37,900
It's Bob I told you about earlier.

251
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,880
He knows he's lost his house, and doesn't have any friends now?

252
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,500
I don't care, God forbid!

253
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:40,500


254
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,640
Why hold it against us, Mort's dead, and Bob there, who's also gone napping.

255
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,200
This stinking punch's getting good too.

256
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,360
Yeah?

257
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,260
What's that about?

258
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,080
Okay.

259
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,580
It was my brother who��

260
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:50,700
He learned how to fight and fight so,

261
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:50,700


262
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,620
Bob!

263
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,640
Bob!

264
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,080
There goes Bob!

265
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,040
Bob!

266
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,380
Bob!

267
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,980
Bye bye Bob!

268
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,100
Bob!

269
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
The way that this is gonna come down...

270
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,940
Would you let me speak? You guys ain't gonna like this.

271
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,140
I don't care what any of you got to say about it.

272
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,060
This is not your show.

273
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,480
This is the Bob Show. And that's the way it's gonna be from now on.

274
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,180
We only have a couple days to get this in order.

275
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,520
So when Bob changes the entire plan

276
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,960
which is basically sabotaging what we're here to do

277
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,620
it's really upsetting.

278
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,680
We just need to back off for a while

279
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,540
and take things a little more slowly.

280
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,280
We cannot run the show.

281
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,160
Our goal has never changed.

282
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,640
We want to make sure that you can walk freely,

283
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,720
roll freely.

284
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,260
So are you gonna work with us?

285
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,200
After being banished from the property

286
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,220
Bob and I had our come to Jesus moment.

287
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,360
Everything's back on track.

288
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,680
I think he's in his room.

289
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,060
I'm gonna call him.

290
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,060


291
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:55,980
Hi.

292
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,080
I'm just wondering if you'd be willing to come back.

293
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,740
I'm not gonna come back there

294
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,800
and get him out of that...

295
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,740
I'm done with Bob.

296
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,220
I work with Bob somewhat.

297
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,020
This stuff wasn't in that box.

298
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,440
I know.

299
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,080
If he ain't gonna like me, he's gonna put up with me.

300
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,040
What is that?

301
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,980
You can part with this.

302
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,140
I don't know if I can.

303
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:16,900
Yes you can.

304
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,360
I'm gonna call him.

305
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,440
I'm gonna call him.

306
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,060
I'm gonna call him.

307
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,280
Please leave a message.

308
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,600
We will call you back.

309
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,360
Thank you. Have a good day. Bye.

310
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,160
There's a rainbow heading your house.

311
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,380
To your house.

312
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,360
It's a rainbow and it's pink.

313
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:40,980
It's a rainbow and it's pink.

314
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,860
Um, you have...

315
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,380
I think you have the

316
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,760
Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

317
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,400
So when you get home

318
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,280
call me back. Bye.

319
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:50,980
Bye.

320
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,680
From PR News in Washington,

321
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,500
I'm in New York where PR's

322
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,440
Bob filed this report.

323
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,080
Here in New York, Bob's dangerous.

324
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,940
The Connecticut State Police says the New York

325
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,560
Bob's in Connecticut are treacherous.

326
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,060
We're seeing people that are not worthy

327
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,300
get stuck in where I'm spot out.

328
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,140
The old advice is good advice. He says

329
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,380
don't go out unless you have PR News.

330
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,200
The Obama Administration

331
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,300
is leading an international initiative

332
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,720
to create a global

333
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,340
surveillance network. The project

334
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,000
aims to set up a global

335
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,320
PR network. National security officials

336
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,020
say an international surveillance

337
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,100
network would also help spot potentially

338
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,220
dangerous surveillance networks wherever

339
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,340
they pop up in the world. Whether

340
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,300
they were released accidentally or

341
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,760
as part of a surveillance network.

342
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,580
A lot of eyes and there were many.

343
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,420
780,000 in

344
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,400
North America that are blamed in nearly

345
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,800
two dozen disease outbreaks.

346
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,280
The Labor Department has found

347
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,820
an uptick in tick-offs

348
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,780
from Georgia to Maine.

349
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

350
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,740
This is PR.

351
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,460
This is what the wiry

352
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,040
damage we receive every six

353
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,040


354
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,040


355
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,040


356
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,040


357
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,060
number two in Democrat euch,

358
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,000
Thank you.

359
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,480
Thank you.

360
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,400
From PR News in Washington, I'm the pedophile, womanizer, and drug addict.

361
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,040
Across a 100-mile wine region.

362
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,840
A number of people finally claims their unemployment benefits fell this week so they can be destroyed.

363
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,380
The long-term unemployed expired December 28th, since Democrats have agreed to that.

364
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,600
You know, uh, you know...

365
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,360
Boehner says he plans PR News before late February.

366
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,260
Stocks 88, 15, 6, 28.

367
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,400
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett says you're listening to PR News in Washington.

368
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,460
Must be tough being Clark Kent, isn't it?

369
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,120
Yes.

370
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,060
Superman!

371
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,460
No. No, I really...

372
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:20,900
I am.

373
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,840
I really like it sometimes.

374
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:22,980
General Zod.

375
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,500
Even though I do make a fool of myself.

376
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,760
Today begins a new order.

377
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,140
Superman!

378
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,460
But you know, if it weren't for him...

379
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,300
In return for your obedience...

380
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,980
I never would have met you.

381
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,700
You will be allowed to live.

382
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:33,860
But...

383
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,780
He is you.

384
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,080
I am General Zod.

385
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,900
It's... it's kind of confusing.

386
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:40,980
General Zod.

387
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,020
Not to me, it isn't.

388
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,220
But consider...

389
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,640
For the first time in my life, everything's clear.

390
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,840
For your如

391
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:54,840


392
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,420
lên

393
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:05,040
You are the

394
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:17,620
You are .

395
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,940
Ah, yes, dear friends.

396
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,280
We're here, and apparently Lowsome Cowboy Dave is here, too.

397
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:28,980
Two minutes.

398
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,720
He is.

399
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,460
Two minutes have passed.

400
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,400
He is.

401
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,800
He was flashing us.

402
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,060
And here I am fondling my spleen.

403
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:37,940
Sorry.

404
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,460
We're glad to have you with us fondling your spleeny.

405
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,240
What, you say you're a couple of minutes late?

406
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,280
What is time to the subgenius?

407
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,300
What is time to the ascended man or woman?

408
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,840
But it's just another thing to mock.

409
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,240
Is it relative as indeed we might assume?

410
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,380
Have I ranted about how much I hate now?

411
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,060
The now thing.

412
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,480
Have you heard of the movement to end now?

413
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,960
I vaguely heard of it.

414
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:16,380
I heard it had something to do with exacerbating wounds that were already very, very scarred.

415
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,880
I don't like now because people who live in the now pay no attention to the then.

416
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,340
They're all like, I don't want to do that now.

417
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,660
But the problem is it's always now.

418
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,300
I am a thenist, not a dentist, a thenist.

419
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,260
I prefer to think about the then and there.

420
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,980
The now is too fleeting.

421
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,940
I can't get my hands on it, you know.

422
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,920
That's the way, that's, I have spent some moments pondering it in the novel known as Neighborworld,

423
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,940
which is formerly known as the English camp.

424
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,180
And the idea of the then and the now.

425
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:02,700
There is no time in the way that we know it except for it's placed on our shoulders

426
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,640
by these huge metamorphic beings we can't understand yet.

427
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,740
But basically the idea of the then is always so warm and squishy.

428
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,840
Right.

429
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,720
The now is so much more relatively cold now.

430
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,860
Then it was so warm.

431
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,220
And it will soon be warm again.

432
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,720
And then we will be toasty.

433
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,140
But you see, I'm a nowist.

434
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,720
Yes, Princess Wee is a nowist.

435
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,640
But I didn't want to interrupt you, dear.

436
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,060
We're making comment on something else.

437
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,580
The nowy.

438
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,440
The nowy.

439
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,400
Was that an ancient people of the North American continent

440
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,600
that worshipped going backwards and forwards?

441
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,140
Yes.

442
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,140


443
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,980
Much in the way that H.G. Wells predicted only without the strangers.

444
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,320
Are you talking about the Native American tribe known as the Fookowies?

445
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,220
Yeah.

446
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,260
And they always ask where they are.

447
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:56,700
I know.

448
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,460
Nah, nah.

449
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,040
I still laugh whenever I heard someone say that.

450
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,920
Oh, speaking of saying that, which I just said,

451
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,080
I need to give some credits where credits are due.

452
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,600
When you called in, Dave,

453
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,920
it was the perfect time.

454
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,520
Actually, it was right on my piece of paper,

455
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,780
my log of the future of this show.

456
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,600
It said 15 minutes.

457
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,540
But we started two minutes late, you see.

458
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,280
Anyway, the last thing we heard,

459
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,200
Superman and all of the PR news and the titles

460
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,020
were by the great Fernandin and a lemur.

461
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,680
And a little bit of a cut up by the purple Johnson blimp situation.

462
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,360
The music we heard was, of course,

463
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:48,060
the Psychoskeletons, a tune called Chumalhoni Transplant,

464
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,780
which you can find all of their stuff on SoundClick,

465
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,960
the Psychoskeletons.

466
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,740
And the long collage was by The Large.

467
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,180
All of those cut ups from a million sources,

468
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,360
people talking about Bob, talking to Bob, Bob talking.

469
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,060
That was actually The Large imitating all those TV shows

470
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,160
and radio shows and old movies that he cut up.

471
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,380
For goodness sakes.

472
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:11,800
How about that?

473
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,620
And you know, I just like to say, Reverend Ivanstang,

474
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,520
it's an incredible job you do,

475
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,220
bringing all these different eclectic forms of artistic expression

476
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,940
right into your own vacuum cleaner and into your own backyard

477
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,100
where you can put it up on Front Street.

478
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:34,940
And at least some people will be able to hear this if they ever listen,

479
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,880
because it is certainly unique in the now.

480
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,420
You know, even worse than...

481
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,520
There were competing things.

482
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,340
There used to be more than one and they were all brilliant.

483
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,800
And it was a hell of a struggle, man.

484
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:59,500
Almost worse than the nowists are the movement to end now, now.

485
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,360
Which kind of defeats the purpose.

486
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,600
But you know, this here is the church of the subgenius.

487
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,500
We are the church of the subgenius.

488
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,720
We are the antidote.

489
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:11,780
We are the antidote.

490
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
To all placebos.

491
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,520
We are the antidote pudding.

492
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,960
We are the long legs and the stocking, stocking gams

493
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,760
and the French made uniforms.

494
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,000
Sorry.

495
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,720
No bob, no aim, no race.

496
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,020
We were disqualified from the race for doping.

497
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,640
I'm sorry I laugh, but the tour words were never spoken

498
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,300
and they still never are.

499
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,560
No, they never...

500
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,240
Well, they occasionally are.

501
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,540
Truer words may yet be spoken.

502
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,660
They're not being spoken now.

503
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,660
But screw now.

504
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,440
I don't care about now.

505
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,340
I don't care.

506
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,540
Don't care, don't care, don't care.

507
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,940
Well, what about the then that we all remember

508
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,080
that we're supposed to forget?

509
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,960
You can ask Princess Wee about this.

510
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,340
We're here.

511
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:01,620
You can...

512
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,800
A church time on Santa Monica Boulevard.

513
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,060
Boulevard in your not too recent, not too long ago past.

514
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,540
Visiting friends and family and stuff and having a good time.

515
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,500
Having a jolly old time.

516
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,980
Looking at L.A. from an outsider's viewpoint now.

517
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,340
And a little disagreement with a science...

518
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,660
I don't want to say the word because I don't know you.

519
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,060
You don't even like the word.

520
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,340
A proponent of a certain religion that you consider very, very...

521
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,920
Are you whining about the Scientologists now?

522
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,500
About the guy you beat up, yeah.

523
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,100
And how you wound up on the LAPD blotter and stuff like that

524
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,100
for trying to strangle them in there.

525
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,980
It didn't have anything to do with him being a Scientologist.

526
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,160
I just didn't like the last Mission Impossible movie.

527
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,080
I thought he said he didn't like the cut of his jib.

528
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,860
Is that your excuse for throttling a guy who's...

529
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,440
I'm sorry.

530
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,540
They interrupted Wee, didn't they?

531
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,800
His jib was not cut correctly, as she said.

532
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,320
But that's okay.

533
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,700
That's all right.

534
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:05,140
You know, speaking of, again, speaking and L.A.,

535
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,060
it's Oscar night and that's why no one's listening to our show tonight,

536
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,780
in this recording, this recording period.

537
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,240
It's this Sunday night as we record this.

538
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,900
The Pink's are watching the Oscars.

539
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:28,240
And Princess Wee and I have gathered Yahoo! commentary again.

540
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,700
I hate to tell you, Dave.

541
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,160
I was looking at the newspaper online

542
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,720
and there was a little article about the Oscars happening,

543
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,040
the Academy Awards tonight.

544
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,920
No, but they've had this terrible rain and mudslides

545
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,480
and houses are sliding down hills in Los Angeles.

546
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,620
So they had the red carpet got wet.

547
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,640
Well, it was a cute little article,

548
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,360
but what was much cuter were the following,

549
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,380
the Yahoo! comments,

550
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,680
which, as befits that august news assemblage,

551
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,900
Well, please.

552
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,960
You know, if you say anything about the Academy Awards,

553
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,760
well, that calls for a dissertation on the evils of President Obama.

554
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,680
Naturally.

555
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,300
You know, if you mention the Oscars and it rains,

556
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,560
then that means it's time for a lecture about the falsitude of global warming

557
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,100
and how evil Michelle is.

558
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:32,480
They yell and get very angry about the idea of global warming.

559
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,800
See, I had to go to school there for a while,

560
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,480
and every once in a while they make you write a paper about this kind of stuff.

561
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,020
And I'm just telling you,

562
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,880
Well, you're a Marxist college professor, Steve.

563
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,440
From a firsthand basis and stuff,

564
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,740
you go and you look at the research and stuff

565
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,080
and you have to go to that Google Scholar Scooch

566
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,640
and whatever it is, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

567
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,200
But, you know, you go to the Scholar Search

568
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,660
and where they have peer-reviewed documents and stuff like that.

569
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,560
And the global warming stuff is like, there's tons of stuff going on,

570
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,680
and there ain't no global warming.

571
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:05,780
There's no global warming.

572
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,960
There's like about, you know, 36 things there.

573
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,520
As opposed to like 36,000 where you have to keep on waiting,

574
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,360
the engines going through.

575
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,980
Man, that's a lot of names that sound the same, you know.

576
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,740
Well, here's what Truthseeker had to say about the Academy Awards.

577
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:28,720
Wah! I feel so sorry for the elitist, obozo-loving hypocrites in Hollywood,

578
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,260
a bunch of self-aggrandizing, phony PCA-holes.

579
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:40,040
The funny thing is happening in the land of the libertards.

580
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,520
L.A. has such high taxes on business, period.

581
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,460
The movie business included, comma,

582
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,760
that a vast majority of big screen productions are filmed elsewhere.

583
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,320
Canada and even New York are getting increasingly larger numbers of productions.

584
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,480
L.A. lost the Tonight Show in the revenue and 150 jobs.

585
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,180
Way to go, L.A.!

586
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,460
You stupid left-wing fools!

587
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:14,920
The whole state of California is run by stupid left-wing fools!

588
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,100
And no long-term vision other than voting base and power.

589
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:28,840
The unions run the politicians and the minorities get all the benefits.

590
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,980
The Golden State is forever tarnished.

591
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,320
That was the first comment on...

592
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:35,900
Oh, my god.

593
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,540
...Rain at the Academy Awards.

594
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,860
Can I just thank you, though, for actually doing that?

595
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,560
In a way that fits the medium, and I certainly appreciate that.

596
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,520
And those of a certain barbecue of a land, maybe their forceps are shaped a little different,

597
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:57,260
will get the middle part of what you just said and the way you addressed it...

598
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,100
And nothing else.

599
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,140
And the way that you started screaming and everything,

600
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,160
and we all started picking our heads...

601
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:08,740
Now, Princess Wee has a comment that we read from someone.

602
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,000
Yes, but I had to put punctuation marks in it to read it because there are none.

603
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,480
No, you're going to have to read it without punctuation marks.

604
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,780
I have to try to read it that way? Okay, here it goes.

605
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:32,440
Oh, no, no. How can the far-lefty elite fawn over each other and denounce the 1% while driving their expensive cars in the rain?

606
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,220
Whoa, why do people pay attention to these people who cares what they do?

607
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,700
They play make-believe in front of a camera and people pay the millions for it.

608
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:47,340
It's pure stupidity. One sentence. No periods.

609
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,680
Well, that's the way.

610
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,540
It's the wave of the future.

611
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,980
Has anyone figured out that the red carpet is really the communist carpet?

612
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:01,040
That's right. That was a serious one-liner comment.

613
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,200
The red carpet. Obviously, they're just dangling the truth right in front of us.

614
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:12,680
Now, there's one very prolific Yahoo commenter who goes by the name of Hard Man,

615
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,800
which I assume is a promise to the ladies.

616
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,380
And you know what kind of guys are making those.

617
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,640
Yeah, that's.

618
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,240
That's why they have to brag that way.

619
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,740
Anyway, what this guy had to say was,

620
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:33,280
All the rich 100% Obama libs in Hooliwood, period.

621
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,420
Flying from Europe and elsewhere in polluting jets, period.

622
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,340
Then get in their gas-guzzling limos.

623
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,980
Parade under electricity-gobbling high wattage lights.

624
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,520
Wasting more of Earth's resources per minute.

625
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,720
And a hundred other Earthlings good.

626
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,960
So they can kill each other how wonderful they are.

627
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,660
So they can tell each other how wonderful they are.

628
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,600
If we are lucky!

629
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,140
Exclamation point.

630
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:08,560
One of them will give us a little speech about global warming and evils of you using fossil foals.

631
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:16,440
How they have joined other polluting rich 1% Obama celeb friends to do the same.

632
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,540
Wink, smiley face.

633
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,600
But that wasn't enough.

634
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:25,260
For Hardman, 12 minutes later, he was still angry.

635
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,880
And he came on and he said,

636
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,480
Will the beautiful, talented, strong, smart, fit, hardworking, funny, caring,

637
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,880
spender of millions of tax dollars and extreme user of fossil foals

638
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:48,460
riding in polluting private jets and limos with 10 servants by her side everywhere she goes be there too?

639
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,820
Moo shell.

640
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,180
Is part of the cool celebrity crowd now.

641
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,440
Will the ugly one be there to take the stage and tell us what we should eat again?

642
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,320
Unbelievable.

643
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,460
You know what I always want to type in after things like that is the phrase,

644
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,520
Ooh, mad bro.

645
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,660
I'd like to do something from early Charlie Brown episodes.

646
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,080
Like, mm-mm-mm.

647
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,680
Your brain is falling out of your...

648
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,160
Ears.

649
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,120
And then have, you know, going to that Vince Giraldi music.

650
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,240
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

651
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,680
You know what I mean?

652
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,600
No.

653
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,200
Because that would be more like stupid.

654
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,360
No.

655
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:37,720
I'm sorry.

656
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,740
As far as stupid goes, listen to this music in the background.

657
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,260
That's Dave playing the guitar.

658
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,020
right now.

659
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,960
Actually, it's two Daves.

660
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,180
This is the two Daves

661
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,060
X Day concert

662
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,300
from 9X Day,

663
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,420
which I think was about

664
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,360
seven years ago.

665
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,320
No, yeah,

666
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,680
seven years ago or so.

667
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,820
And there was Dave

668
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,620
of the Lonesomes

669
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,140
on guitar

670
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,600
and Princess Wee

671
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,180
on flute

672
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,620
and Reverend Angry Larry

673
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,260
on bass

674
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,680
this particular time.

675
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,240
We stumbled upon

676
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,240
this music yesterday

677
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,420
and broke our ankles.

678
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,860
But the music

679
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,820
sounded pretty cool.

680
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,080
Well, it did at the time.

681
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,380
That's why I'm a thenist.

682
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,980
Now, Princess Wee...

683
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,080
In today's modern languages,

684
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,460
one thing you must be

685
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,020
certainly aware of

686
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,420
that the thenists

687
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,720
charge a lot of money

688
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,100
to have your roots come out.

689
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,880
That means sent

690
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,660
all the way back

691
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,080
to the original inhabitants

692
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,900
of Mars.

693
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,140
Of course you know that,

694
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,520
don't you?

695
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
Of course, of course.

696
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,860
It's not like it's a secret,

697
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,400
of course.

698
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,140
Hey,

699
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,820
somebody sent me an email

700
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,960
today that said

701
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,200
that we're at war with Russia.

702
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,860
And this is day four

703
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,520
of America in crisis.

704
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,220
And that all of our freedoms

705
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,160
are gone already.

706
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,160
Well, they might be right

707
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,020
about that part.

708
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,780
And he also said

709
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,160
that

710
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,040
that

711
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,720
that

712
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:17,740
that

713
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:17,740


714
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:17,740


715
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:17,740


716
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,640
that

717
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


718
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


719
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


720
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


721
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


722
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


723
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


724
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


725
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


726
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


727
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


728
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


729
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


730
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


731
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


732
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


733
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


734
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


735
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


736
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,640


737
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,900
The Candle in the Shell

738
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,640
What did he say?

739
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,060
He said

740
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,660
the political buffoons

741
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,300
will come out

742
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,580
and worship Obozo

743
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,920
and Michelle Obozo

744
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,060
will present something

745
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,540
a huge libertar gathering.

746
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,520
I want to see

747
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,240
a gay divorce

748
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,820
like the gay wedding

749
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,700
at the Rose Bowl Parade.

750
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,020
Did you ever think

751
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,480
that was another

752
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,660
another comment

753
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,980
from our many listeners?

754
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,020
Princess Wee,

755
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,500
you had...

756
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,080
Are generated

757
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,540
by the

758
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,120
by the

759
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,280
Gross National Product.

760
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,660
I mean, the RNC.

761
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,820
Some of them

762
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,300
are probably

763
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:45,960
just generated

764
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,800
because they use

765
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,100
all use the same

766
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,580
catchphrase.

767
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,700
like Libertard and what's the Obama one?

768
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,100
Obama and...

769
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,740
Obozo.

770
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,100
Obozo and Moose Shell.

771
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,440
You know, in our upbringing as staunch Americans,

772
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,000
Obozos were on the bus.

773
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,060
And, you know, you don't do something like that.

774
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,460
You can't.

775
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,760
You just can't hold it.

776
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,500
I don't have anything against the Bozos.

777
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,720
They're, you know, I've squeezed the wheeze.

778
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,380
They want you to.

779
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,160
They like it.

780
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,400
They'd like you to put them down and kick them around and make fun of them

781
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,280
because they know what their position will be in the future.

782
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,080
The Bozos won't be on the back of the bus in the future.

783
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,200
And by Bozos, I mean literally Bozos.

784
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,120
I'm not using that as a metaphor for anything else.

785
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:43,300
I mean people dressed like clowns or surgically made to look like clowns

786
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,460
because they're pink.

787
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,560
They're proud to be pink.

788
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,580
Go ahead.

789
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,600
Squeeze the wheeze.

790
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,300
That doesn't hurt me.

791
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,400
I'm pink.

792
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,100
You can do anything to me.

793
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,260
But they're lying.

794
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,580
They're making a list.

795
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,840
And they're going to kill us all in our sleep while they grin,

796
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,440
wielding their evil Bozo knives,

797
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,560
sharpened on your tongue like a razor strop.

798
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,340
Now, how about this comment?

799
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,260
Princess Weave, what is this comment?

800
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,760
If there are any suicidal pilots of large aircraft,

801
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,360
i.e. passenger jetliner aircraft,

802
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,620
Air Force bomber, etc.,

803
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,540
please consider ramming your ship into this building

804
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,660
during peak television viewership.

805
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,940
The building coordinates are 34.101996

806
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,960
and minus 11.3407.

807
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,980
And the best time would be 7.45 p.m. California time.

808
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,800
You will go down in history as having taken out

809
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,240
the entire Hollywood communist homosexual society

810
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,360
in a single blow.

811
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,140
You will be a hero for the ages.

812
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,160
I just didn't show up.

813
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,900
I just didn't show up for work for about 36 days in a row.

814
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:51,920
Yeah.

815
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,440
And I got married to a guy.

816
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,100
Yeah.

817
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,040
And I'm collecting nine bazillion dollars

818
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,740
in social welfarism from Joe Stalin.

819
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,900
He's given it to me personally.

820
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,500
He even sent me like one of those autographed pictures

821
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,540
and stuff like that.

822
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,220
I think Joe Stalin got a bad rap.

823
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,880
Oh, wait, no, I mean Joe McCarthy.

824
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,680
No, wait, what's the difference?

825
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,620
Joe.

826
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,880
Oh, what's the difference?

827
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,320
Yeah.

828
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,840
They used to stand for a person

829
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,920
who stood above the arguments of time.

830
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,140
Now it stands for somebody who's a feminist

831
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,720
or a nowist or one of these other ridiculous cults

832
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,540
springing up having to do with time control.

833
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,640
Hey, hey, let's not get personal, man.

834
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,400
What?

835
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,700
I wasn't personalized.

836
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,560
I was evacuated many, many centuries ago.

837
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,020
I have no political leanings.

838
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,300
I'm a leftist, I think.

839
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,900
You're just wobbling.

840
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,420
You're in the middle of the road, aren't you?

841
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,340
You old wobbly.

842
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,340
That's what it is.

843
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,720
Wobbly old days.

844
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,340
I remember last week you talked about my slurring speech

845
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,460
and we even screamed out,

846
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,040
no, he's not, he's a nice old man, stuff like that.

847
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,040
I just, you know, I hadn't been drinking or something.

848
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,180
We were trying to defend you from all the many people

849
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,860
who were out to get you, Dave,

850
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,100
which is almost, it is all your neighbors, you know.

851
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,900
They form a gang.

852
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,600
You said that Dave was slurring his speech?

853
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,040
Well, that's the way it is in these urban,

854
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,360
urban vessels.

855
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,860
I mean, these little squalid conditions.

856
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,380
It's like Dickens' days, you know.

857
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,020
It's like me and the Victorian poorhouse thing,

858
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,080
thing where I got going, you know,

859
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,260
and the androids on top of it.

860
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,300
You know, bill collectors call you up

861
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,120
and they, you know, start a real friendly conversation about,

862
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,040
oh, you know, the last time you bought foot powder

863
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,360
or the fact that you're a staunch,

864
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,280
you're an independent or something like that.

865
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,880
And then the next thing you know,

866
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,080
you know, I talk about your kids and so forth.

867
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,300
And, but they don't stop.

868
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,060
And that's how you can tell they're automated.

869
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,100
They're not real.

870
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,280
And then they come up with responses that make sense.

871
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,200
Right.

872
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,440
It's that AI stuff,

873
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,620
that artificial intelligence stuff, man.

874
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,080
You can still get them.

875
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,180
It's a robot.

876
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,320
It's a robot.

877
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,800
You're talking to a robot.

878
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,180
Well, now, come on.

879
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,660
We've, admit it, you guys,

880
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,860
we've done shows that were completely automated

881
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,880
where we just turned on that voice replicator

882
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,740
and let it kind of fed about five,

883
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,420
eight pages of the Scrub Genius Forum into a computer

884
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,200
and gave it the we voice and the Stang voice

885
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,140
and the Dave voice

886
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,660
and some really horrible background music

887
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,680
that the computer made badly.

888
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,520
And that was, in fact,

889
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,980
that's the way we did the show before last, I think.

890
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,580
Was it that?

891
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:38,980
Once again.

892
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,700
Once again, the pointy head of science

893
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,000
can be pointed like a finger up or down.

894
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,580
It can be used for good or evil.

895
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:46,880
Yes.

896
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,140
So, which is it you're going to choose,

897
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,560
Reverend Adam Stang,

898
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,440
high E-pop or Troubadour?

899
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,300
Okay, let's see.

900
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,740
The evil wire will,

901
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,260
if I snip the evil wire,

902
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,580
it'll shut down the bomb

903
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,560
and the world will be safe.

904
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,740
But how do I know that's not the good wire?

905
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,000
If I snip the good wire,

906
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,080
then all goodness vanishes

907
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,120
and no one will ever be able to have sex again

908
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,980
and the pinks will win

909
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,520
and the Yahoo commenters

910
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,360
will be the only ones on the red carpet.

911
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,560
Maybe jiggle a little bit.

912
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,500
No, no, no.

913
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,220
Better not jiggle.

914
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,660
Jiggle it a little, little, little open.

915
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,540
Jiggle it a little, little, little open.

916
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,640
You remember Reverend Jiggle It a Little Open?

917
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,280
I remember Jiggle It a Little Open very well.

918
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,780
Yeah, he's a real nice guy.

919
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,540
He was one of the Queegee Boat Cartel.

920
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,220
Uh-huh.

921
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,000
Used to come to X-Day all the time.

922
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,320
Then I guess he grew out of the subgenius.

923
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,500
Yeah.

924
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,240
Or something.

925
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,620
I guess that's what they do.

926
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,320
I guess they just grow out of the one true baloney religion

927
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,380
of all times, except for now.

928
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,600
Not now.

929
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,100
You don't be so harsh on yourself.

930
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,620
You're crazy, Lord, you know.

931
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,340
Don't be so harsh.

932
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,400
Hey, man, you have to...

933
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,280
Tell him, Dave, tell him.

934
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:09,840
...up a little bit, you know.

935
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,220
Tell him, tell him.

936
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,860
You know, you're going to have a stroke thinking like that.

937
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,660
You know, I'm walking around like you're screaming

938
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,940
and the people don't understand, dude.

939
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,500
Or they don't understand that you're a subgenius,

940
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,120
you know, and stuff like that.

941
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,200
No, they don't understand.

942
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,300
They don't understand.

943
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,980
Hey, I've got...

944
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,240
I have to play a public service announcement,

945
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,720
but I'm not going to take anyone off the air, okay?

946
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:33,960
Okay.

947
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,240
I'm not even going to turn the music down.

948
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:35,940
Here it goes.

949
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,700
This is a real public PSA.

950
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,800
I can't hear the music track.

951
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,380
But it's...

952
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,620
You see why?

953
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,060
It's you, Dave.

954
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,580
Yeah.

955
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,400
If loneliness drives some girls to prostitution,

956
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,780
it drives some men in another direction.

957
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,760
Yeah.

958
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,200
The history of homosexuality is as long as the history of man.

959
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,540
From the glory that once was Greece

960
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,020
to the decadence that destroyed Rome,

961
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,000
homosexuality has been both despised and idolized.

962
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,600
Alexander the Great,

963
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,100
Julius Caesar,

964
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,520
Frederick the Great,

965
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,480
Leonardo da Vinci,

966
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,040
and Michelangelo.

967
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,160
How about some of the names that any homosexual

968
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,220
will point to as examples

969
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:33,400
of virility and the defense of his way of life?

970
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,300
Just step over here.

971
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,980
Though nothing new,

972
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,020
homosexuality is having an upsurge since the war.

973
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,600
Yeah, it's not the only thing happening.

974
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,340
Whether it is an actual...

975
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:47,340


976
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:47,500
It's not the only thing happening.

977
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:47,500


978
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,000
Whether it is an actual increase

979
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,200
or merely an increased public acceptance

980
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,980
is a point to be argued.

981
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,460
The Mattachine Society,

982
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,520
an organization for homosexuals.

983
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,760
The Church of the Subgenius is on the air now.

984
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,340
Well, anyway,

985
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,060
I found another thing about homosexuals

986
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,440
that I was reading an article

987
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,100
in the Christian Science Monitor, of all things,

988
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,620
an article called

989
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,500
Why Gays Scare Conservatives.

990
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,160
And although I didn't really read the article,

991
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,140
I read the comments,

992
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,840
which is about the best way to do the news,

993
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,740
you know, these days.

994
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,280
Is there anything about why gays like convertibles

995
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,280
or anything like that?

996
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,360
Or is this strictly a political tract?

997
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,000
This is a guy who has it all figured out.

998
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,820
In one paragraph,

999
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,220
he's going to say what the problem is.

1000
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:43,720
Ah.

1001
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,760
And here it is.

1002
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,100
The problem is,

1003
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,460
people have no clue about what makes life work.

1004
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,220
So let's go with this liberal agenda.

1005
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,320
Let's test it.

1006
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,260
The world embraces homosexuality.

1007
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,600
Everyone in the country can marry their own gender now.

1008
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,200
There spelled just wrongly.

1009
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,940
Everyone who feels they're born the wrong gender

1010
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,620
can have a sex change operation.

1011
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,680
Compliments of the Affordable Health Care Act.

1012
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,500
Lesbian women can buy a car.

1013
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:17,500


1014
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:17,500


1015
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:17,500


1016
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:17,500


1017
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:17,500


1018
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:17,500


1019
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,400
Buy trade with men for purchase of their sperm.

1020
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,140
Their.

1021
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,660
Homosexual men can buy trade with women

1022
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,360
for the use of their,

1023
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,200
with two E's,

1024
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,780
eggs and wombs.

1025
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,420
And the Affordable Health Care will help them pay for it.

1026
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,760
Everyone is now equal.

1027
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:42,360
Every state wants to legalize pot as Colorado

1028
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,500
so they can be equal.

1029
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,220
Now every state has legalized pot,

1030
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,620
so they're equal there.

1031
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,740
Both spelled wrong.

1032
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,800
So far we have homosexuals and potheads all equal

1033
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,760
with everybody else.

1034
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,900
Now money.

1035
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,240
Every state has minimum wage.

1036
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,260
All states are equal.

1037
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,000
Everyone makes 10, 10 an hour.

1038
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,180
Is that the end of it now?

1039
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,920
Have we made the whole country equal with one another?

1040
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,460
Who mad, bro?

1041
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,320
Who mad, bro?

1042
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,180
I think that many of these people need to be

1043
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,860
put in special institutions

1044
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,040
where they can look at their brains

1045
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,180
and see what is troubling them.

1046
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,860
I think there may be some confusion about the facts,

1047
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,560
but I also think that some of their brains are miswired.

1048
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,240
You know what I think it comes down to?

1049
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,840
There are a couple kinds of right wing lunatics in this world.

1050
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,200
There are the people who say,

1051
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,360
Anybody that was like startled by electroshock,

1052
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,100
you know, like you get,

1053
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,380
like you're hiding in the closet during,

1054
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,540
nevermind.

1055
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,800
I was just going to say real quick,

1056
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,320
there are those out there who have an attitude of,

1057
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,760
I got mine, go get your own.

1058
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,940
And then there are others out there who,

1059
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,260
and then there are others out there who have an attitude of,

1060
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,260
I ain't got mine and screw you,

1061
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,060
you ain't getting yours either.

1062
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,660
Disemboweled again.

1063
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,220
I think some of these people are just jealous.

1064
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,400
I think they're jealous of the Hollywood elites

1065
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,160
and their limos.

1066
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,460
And I think they're jealous of the gay homosexuals

1067
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,860
who are having a great time.

1068
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,460
Well, I know that this, uh,

1069
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,780
person who calls himself Obama sucks,

1070
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,220
that's O-B-A-M-A capital S-U-X,

1071
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,160
has made it all real clear by saying,

1072
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,400
Yahoo is censoring hard tonight.

1073
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:31,920
Poor guy.

1074
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,940
They didn't though.

1075
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,760
Hard man posted every 10 minutes.

1076
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,880
Bunch of yahoos.

1077
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,500
He's probably, you know,

1078
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,120
a sponsor generated thing that just comes out by the,

1079
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,300
they wrote that up.

1080
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,360
Some, probably a person didn't even write it.

1081
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:47,700
Anymore.

1082
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,780
They only, you know,

1083
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,020
I mean, not even a suggestion.

1084
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,380
That program's all, you know,

1085
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,420
let's see, it's the Hollywood night of the year,

1086
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,080
the Academy Awards.

1087
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,800
Well, all the liberals live out there.

1088
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,440
It's a good time to.

1089
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,100
Yeah, like Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood,

1090
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,940
those liber turds,

1091
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:13,340
you good, homosexuals like Clint Eastwood and Mel Gibson.

1092
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,480
Don't forget John Wayne.

1093
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,580
His real name was Marion.

1094
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,860
I heard like homosexuals.

1095
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,940
John Wayne was a queer.

1096
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,600
Mr. Nixon or whatever his name was.

1097
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:19,900
What?

1098
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:20,960
What'd you say?

1099
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,640
John Wayne was a queer.

1100
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,420
You mean Marion?

1101
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,360
I installed mirrors in his house.

1102
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,320
They were two-way mirrors.

1103
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,280
That's from Repo Man.

1104
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,320
That's a character.

1105
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,680
Well, I just remember the end where the car took off.

1106
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:36,960
I'm sorry.

1107
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,260
Yeah, he was the guy that everybody thought was a kook.

1108
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,960
He rode away in the alien time machine in the end.

1109
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,620
Yeah, he was the one.

1110
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,900
Well, he wasn't really the one.

1111
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,820
I think it was the car was the one, wasn't it?

1112
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,920
Repo Man, not to be confused with a more recent movie

1113
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,120
called Repo Men, which was really messed up.

1114
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,280
Why was it messed up?

1115
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,040
I didn't see that when I saw the originator.

1116
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,340
It looked like this had no relation

1117
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,840
to the original Repo Man.

1118
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,980
It was directed by some newish guy.

1119
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,320
You know how those news are.

1120
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,860
He came up with the idea of using Repo Man

1121
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,380
as a vehicle for some-

1122
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,600
No, it was guys who repo body parts.

1123
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,620
And it was one of those schizophrenic movies

1124
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,280
that seemed like two people directed it,

1125
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,480
and one thought it was a comedy,

1126
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,940
and one thought it was a horror movie.

1127
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,400
And they really didn't integrate the two very well.

1128
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,120
But if you did like it,

1129
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,860
or you were getting paid to like it,

1130
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,100
you would say it was a dark comedy.

1131
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,240
No.

1132
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,260
You would not say, for instance,

1133
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,900
that it was failed on two sides or two fronts

1134
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,660
of both comedy and also-

1135
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,920
Darkness. Darkness.

1136
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,040
Darkness.

1137
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:45,440
And suspense.

1138
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,480
And satanic evil.

1139
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,100
And film noir things.

1140
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,100
Are we letting Satan down, Dave?

1141
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,400
Are we, Dr. Sinister, Princess,

1142
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,780
are we letting our lord and master Satan down

1143
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,840
by trivializing these important issues?

1144
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,480
Satan is an unforgiving master.

1145
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,640
You will always disappoint him.

1146
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,540
No, we're not letting him down.

1147
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,580
He's got a lot in common with his buddy, God.

1148
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,380
Yep, Joe Hoover.

1149
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,520
They used to call him Joe Hoover and Zet Zeron,

1150
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,220
hanging out in the same bars,

1151
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,080
got hit by the same truck,

1152
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,860
come and stumble and drunk out of a bar once,

1153
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,720
but did anything really happen to him?

1154
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,400
No.

1155
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,120
They just laughed and went back

1156
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,080
and had a few more transubstantiated beers.

1157
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,220
We were talking to Pappy earlier today.

1158
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,040
That's my father.

1159
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,840
She's a wonderful woman.

1160
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,320
And Pappy said that he's a preacher,

1161
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,480
or teaches Bible, he's not,

1162
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,020
well, yeah, he's a preacher.

1163
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,740
He teaches Bible studies.

1164
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,640
Well, he's also an alchemist on the side.

1165
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,360
Yeah, he is.

1166
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,020
He's actually, he's a Masonic alchemist,

1167
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:48,300
a complete skeptic and disbeliever,

1168
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,820
and yet he teaches Bible studies.

1169
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,280
He likes to point out the really weird stuff.

1170
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,200
But anyway, he said today,

1171
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,060
he instructed Princess Wee and I

1172
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,160
that the devil was equal to God.

1173
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,060
Yes.

1174
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,640
He said, my father said that.

1175
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,620
He said, the devil, he's another God.

1176
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:09,680
He's the other God.

1177
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:13,920
That's what he said.

1178
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,000
I'm not sure.

1179
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,000


1180
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,000


1181
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,100
I know, I can hear your discomfort in even saying that,

1182
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,500
although you proudly admit your father's a satanic person.

1183
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,960
No, no, he's not at all.

1184
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,260
He's a good, well, he's turned over a new leaf.

1185
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:27,880
Let's put it that way.

1186
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,620
He's a Bible scholar that plants seeds of doubts

1187
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,480
in his little Sunday school class.

1188
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,700
Because he's a Bible scholar,

1189
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,780
he doesn't believe a word of it is accurate, historically.

1190
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,160
Well, there's actually a code.

1191
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,260
Not one word.

1192
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,180
I think that's why they resisted translating the Bible

1193
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,880
into native languages for so long.

1194
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,320
That's why they what?

1195
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,000
I think that's why the Catholic Church

1196
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,180
resisted translating the Bible into vernacular languages for so long.

1197
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:00,680
Well, wasn't it Michelle Bachmann who said the Bible was,

1198
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,620
Jesus wrote the Bible in English?

1199
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,860
You know, like...

1200
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,660
No, no, that was the guy in Texas during the Civil War

1201
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,000
who said that we shouldn't go to Vietnam

1202
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,980
because if the Bible was good enough for, if the Bible was good enough,

1203
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:13,980


1204
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,160
the way it's written for Jesus is good enough for me.

1205
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,540
Jesus spoke English and some people didn't even laugh at what he didn't.

1206
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,860
Walking straight, thinking straight.

1207
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,900
That's an old one, man.

1208
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,000
Think crooked, walk crooked, and crooked.

1209
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,120
I'm sorry I said that, I guess.

1210
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,940
Because now I'm completely and totally cut off.

1211
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:43,960
I think this is day, this, well, this is the subject of the Bible.

1212
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:43,960


1213
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:43,960


1214
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:43,960


1215
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:50,800
This song I labeled Bob Raping Jam with the two Daves.

1216
00:48:50,840 --> 00:49:00,320
It's got Reverend Angry Dave on bass, maybe guitar too.

1217
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,260
And this is Dave, Dave Lonesome.

1218
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:03,560
Yes.

1219
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,280
I can't hear it.

1220
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,180
You can't?

1221
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:07,800
No.

1222
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,420
Well, turn your phone up.

1223
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,100
Turn your radio up.

1224
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,380
Turn your hearing aid up.

1225
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,680
Turn, run over to the radio and turn it up and hold your phone right next to the speaker.

1226
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,960
Oh wait, no, that's what we always tell them not to do.

1227
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,920
No, I usually get, I usually can hear the background well enough to respond.

1228
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:27,600
I know.

1229
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,140
That's why I'm puzzled.

1230
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,580
But you know, the phone lines here have changed.

1231
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:39,940
It's, I'm sorry you can't hear it, Dave, because I wanted to have kind of a tribute to our guitar player buddies.

1232
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,080
Like you and Reverend Angry Dave.

1233
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:43,700
Well, I'm Larry, Larry, Larry.

1234
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,340
And of course there's a lot more guitar player buddies.

1235
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,460
Reverend Suds wasn't on this one.

1236
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:54,480
And the Flyin' Ryan Brothers were never there, although they play out in Chicago now.

1237
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:54,980
Yeah.

1238
00:49:55,420 --> 00:50:06,360
And in fact, I even have a song to close the show that's about, it's a guitar player apologizing to all the girls for all the musicians.

1239
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,760
Well, there were only a few that one night.

1240
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,520
And I even had, I even have Iodine 131 queued up right now.

1241
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,680
You do?

1242
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,160
Yeah, you want me to play it?

1243
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,620
If you shut up, I'll play it.

1244
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,540
Oh, don't tell Dave to shut up.

1245
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,200
Well, I'm not going to let him play over it.

1246
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,500
And he can't hear it anyway, he says.

1247
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,160
That's right.

1248
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,240
How come I can't hear it?

1249
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,580
Well, here, let's try it.

1250
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:31,580
Yeah!

1251
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:32,740


1252
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,380
Yeah!

1253
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:36,640


1254
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:36,920
Yeah!

1255
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:37,420


1256
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:37,440


1257
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,060
Yeah!

1258
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,300
When I said Chernobyl was so long ago.

1259
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,300
Nothing to worry about.

1260
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:52,280
And now I hear in the news these dumb guys in the Department of Energy and the Defense Department are going to start build a bunch of Chernobyl's across the United States.

1261
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,140
And then I hear in the news that Chernobyl's not really over, no.

1262
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,220
All these people are dying.

1263
00:50:58,980 --> 00:50:59,560
It's all.

1264
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,180
The pollution's getting into the water.

1265
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,660
It's getting into the aquifers.

1266
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,620
All this whole.

1267
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,000
Everything.

1268
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,840
I think we'll see it all once I'm one

1269
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,300
But the distance between here and Cleveland

1270
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,800
No, man, we're getting it too

1271
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,400
Too late, Gary

1272
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,780
You know, and then I started thinking

1273
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,560
How come my moods are getting so

1274
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,520
Drank

1275
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:26,060
The iodine, the 131

1276
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:29,400
Has got my thyroid on the run

1277
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,240
And the krypton, the 85

1278
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,700
Is making it hard just to stay alive

1279
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,080
With the iodine, the 131

1280
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,180
The iodine, the 131

1281
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:45,520
No more running to the metal man

1282
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,160
No more bending the hand

1283
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,620
Power, power, send the power, save the man

1284
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,920
Shake the bony hand, shake it good

1285
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,280
The barium, a 248

1286
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,540
This baby's sterile, I can't procreate

1287
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,820
And plutonium, a 207

1288
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:15,160
So long, folks, I'll see you in heaven

1289
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:18,360
But the iodine, the 131

1290
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,700
The iodine, the 131

1291
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,660
No more running to the metal man

1292
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:27,700
No more bending the hand

1293
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,380
Shake the bony hand of the poison man

1294
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,340
Shake the bony hand, shake it good

1295
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,620
So there's over 2 million known pollutants

1296
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:48,160
That can cause cancer, pancreatitis

1297
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,960
Bad juice, gingivitis

1298
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,420
Bad breath, acne

1299
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,580
What's the use?

1300
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,880
The iodine, the 131

1301
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,220
Has got my thyroid on the run

1302
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:07,100
And the Krypton, a 85

1303
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,480
He's making it hard just to stay alive

1304
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,000
With the iodine, the 131

1305
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,280
The iodine, the 131

1306
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,360
No more running to the metal man

1307
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,320
No more bending the hand

1308
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,980
Shake the bony hand of the poison man

1309
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,880
Shake the bony hand, shake it good

1310
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,200
No more running to the metal man

1311
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,880
Shake the phony hand.

1312
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,100
The poison man.

1313
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,140
Shake the phony hand.

1314
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:42,780
Shake it.

1315
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,520
Shake it.

1316
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,280
Shake it.

1317
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,680
Shake it.

1318
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:50,600
Shake the phony hand.

1319
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,420
The poison man.

1320
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,600
The heart man.

1321
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:01,860
Was the author of Neighbor World, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1322
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,680
Singing with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1323
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,640
Off the album Sex in Another Dimension.

1324
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:15,080
And I'd just like to say that I think Mr. Abel Nerds, what's his name again?

1325
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:15,520
I'm sorry.

1326
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:19,760
Mr. Colonel Dave.

1327
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,060
Colonel Lintard Dave.

1328
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,200
Of the protagonist there for us.

1329
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:31,760
Did a wonderful job also in the, do you remember the, I can't remember.

1330
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,060
Colonel Sphinx Lonesome.

1331
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:44,760
Oh, I said that I was going to play a song about guitar players saying an apology on the part of all guitar players to all girls.

1332
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,600
And it's a song by the Rainmakers.

1333
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,700
And it's live and I'm going to play it.

1334
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:58,480
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, which often is about theological things.

1335
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:02,140
But sometimes that includes guitar players.

1336
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,920
Like Dave.

1337
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,460
I think, I think what it has to do is with the deep delay system.

1338
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:15,400
Not, you know, like on a guitar switch where you can just like, you know, see if your sphincter muscles start to vibrate too hard.

1339
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,180
That means that your calcium balance is real low.

1340
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:22,560
I don't know if you ever read that because I think it was a magazine.

1341
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:27,240
I think it was some drug they were giving me when they were giving me electroshock therapy at the same time.

1342
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,160
And if you need more information, folks, that's subgenius.com.

1343
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:31,880
What's up, UMNI?

1344
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,200
I'm Dave.

1345
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:32,200


1346
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:32,460
Thanks for having me.

1347
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:32,460


1348
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:49,920
If you've ever had the misfortune or the fortune to date a musician or have a relationship with a musician or, God help you, have you ever married a musician, we're sorry.

1349
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,180
One, two, three, four.

1350
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,480
Well, I met her in a bar.

1351
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,080
Naturally.

1352
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,060
And naturally she wanted to dance.

1353
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,620
I politely declined.

1354
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,160
Naturally.

1355
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,940
I said, I really hate this band.

1356
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,540
We went for coffee at a little cafe.

1357
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:23,900
I had more picks in my pocket than I had spare change.

1358
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,260
She said, hold it right there.

1359
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,160
Just stop where you are.

1360
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,040
Not another guy.

1361
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,720
Not another guitar.

1362
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:32,640
Not another guitar.

1363
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,320
Not another guitar.

1364
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,220
Not another guitar.

1365
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,320
Not another guitar.

1366
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,340
To get her off of my mind.

1367
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,120
Naturally.

1368
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:46,220
And so naturally I gave her a call.

1369
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,980
Someone else answered the phone.

1370
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:50,220
Naturally.

1371
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,940
Then I recall that she lived with her mom.

1372
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:55,080


1373
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,100
I said, you have a daughter.

1374
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,860
That's the fairest by far.

1375
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:01,060
She said, who shall I say's calling?

1376
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,200
Who shall I say's calling?

1377
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,040
You know me better than you are.

1378
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,860
You're a lover boy here.

1379
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,860
And could I borrow her car?

1380
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,000
Oh, not another guy.

1381
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,700
Not another guitar.

1382
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:11,340
No.

1383
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,060
Not another guy.

1384
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,680
Not another guitar.

1385
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:20,240
Not another guitar.

1386
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,820
Not another guitar.

1387
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,700
Say, you boys of song.

1388
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,780
You're all the same.

1389
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,680
Chasing a dream that you cannot name.

1390
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:37,140
They showed her to cry, a sofa to crash A meal and a mama with no strings attached

1391
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:45,500
She said, you sang a song, oh no better I should But you know how to make it all sound so good

1392
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:10,640
Well, to make a long story short We fell in love and she done me wrong

1393
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:19,080
She'll say the same about me, naturally But to my face and not in a song

1394
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,780
We're both gonna make that same old mistake again someday

1395
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:27,960
Gonna happen to her, it'll sure not happen to me

1396
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,660
There's just something to now and then

1397
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,200
That music that makes us do that dance

1398
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:36,020
In that special brew of tears and fear and fear and romance

1399
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,740
It's losers night in teen town bring your fake ID

1400
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:44,140
You know you're never too young to be too old for me

1401
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,180
And I'm never too bad to be more trouble than I'm worth

1402
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:52,160
Just another sad angel sang unto the sad earth

1403
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,040
Oh, it's another long night, it's another low moon

1404
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,080
It's another long night

1405
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,660
To hear another old song

1406
00:58:59,660 --> 00:58:59,660


1407
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,300
To hear another old tune

1408
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,980
Another long glance across another long far

1409
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:07,100
Another girl, another guy

1410
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,860
Another guitar

1411
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,060
Another girl

1412
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:11,140
Another guy

1413
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,960
Another guitar

1414
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,160
Well, I'm just another guy

1415
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,940
With another guitar

1416
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,160
Just another guy

1417
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,040
With another guitar

1418
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:29,320
Hey, Hey, hey hey shut up

1419
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:29,660
Bow-wow

1420
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:09,240
You've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1421
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:25,880
For free information, write to P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

or see www.subgenius.com

1423
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,140
Praise Bob!

1424
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,920
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1425
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:46,260
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1426
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,280
Not just this show, but Subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1427
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,780
But if you truly love Bob,

1428
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:55,860
and want some of the best in the world,

1429
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,360
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1430
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,300
you should go to subgenius.com front page,

1431
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,860
or especially the radio page,

1432
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,880
or the catalog store pages,

1433
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,180
and help out financially as best you can.

1434
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:13,560
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1435
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:17,200
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1436
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:20,120
But some of you still have jobs.

1437
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:23,480
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1438
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,460
even if it's only once a month.

1439
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,040
And that's not from enough of you.

1440
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,440
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1441
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:38,220
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1442
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:43,740
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1443
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:53,860
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44117.

1444
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:55,840


1445
01:01:55,860 --> 01:02:01,380
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
