1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,280
Well, we don't try to make people feel better.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,680
In fact, we hope people feel worse.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,680
They feel so bad that they decide to regurgitate.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,360
And what the prophets were doing back then was saying,

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,900
nothing's going to change if you vomit.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,160
And we want to send that to you if you'll support this ministry.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,720
The Self Genius Power of Swag.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,200
Hi, I'm Bob.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,140
I'll tell you.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,300
I'm Bob and I've discovered a fuel burned in your engine can choke off its fuel.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,120
The fuel removes harmful power and mileage.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,360
So did, did, hey, where did, uh, did 420 guy leave already?

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,340
Yeah, yeah, it's after 420 and so he, uh, well, he's...

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,200
So that's what you mean by 420 guy.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,780
There he goes in his own spaceship flying along Highway 1.

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,140
So, uh, 101.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,680
It's not after 420.

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:57,920
He's wobbling.

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,140
He's going to hit that building.

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,680
Don't do it.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,920
Oh, man.

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,640
The old green silo on the edge of town.

24
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:03,900
That's terrible.

25
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:04,920
No, he's okay.

26
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,780
See, he went right through it.

27
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,540
It's a virtual highway.

28
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,000
Man, I should have known in San Francisco.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,920
See, in Cleveland, man, everything's real, baby.

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,120
All too real.

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,020
You know, their city slogan used to be Cleveland, you gotta be tough.

32
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,320
That was when they were at their very lowest.

33
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:23,880
Lowest, yeah.

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,720
Which was pretty damn low.

35
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,400
When the river was burning.

36
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:27,760
Yeah.

37
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,120
Yeah.

38
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,120


39
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,120


40
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,120


41
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,120


42
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,120


43
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,120


44
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,120


45
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,100
His hair caught on fire.

46
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,420
Long before Michael Jackson.

47
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,720
Both of these happened more than once.

48
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,540
That was used to be a requirement.

49
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,100
Yeah.

50
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,460
To be a city mayor.

51
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,100
In Cleveland, you had to set your hair on fire.

52
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,200
And people wouldn't tell him either.

53
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,220
They wouldn't even tell him who to set it on fire.

54
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,240
At an amateur hour.

55
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,640
Yeah, sure, she wasn't wearing clothes, but that was part of the point.

56
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,120
So, how long was his hair on fire before they extinguished the mayoral duty?

57
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,280
Oh, you know, I don't know.

58
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,120
I wasn't there.

59
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,220
It was before my time.

60
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,340
I just heard about it.

61
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,220
It's legendary.

62
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,340
I think the length was...

63
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,500
You can wick me at, I'm sure.

64
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,420
One click.

65
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,180
Cleveland Mayor hair fire.

66
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,940
So, Michael Jackson was a Johnny come lately.

67
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,280
Michael Jackson was the mayor of Cleveland at one time.

68
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,780
He, uh...

69
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,360
I should shut up now.

70
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,000
Careful.

71
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,220
Remember these politically incorrect asides.

72
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,740
Like...

73
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,820
Some episodes of Tourette's syndrome.

74
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,000
Though possibly excusable.

75
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,500
Bad Tourette's.

76
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,380
Well, how come the South Park guys can get away with that stuff?

77
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,660
And we can't.

78
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,080
Because this is the capital of free speech radio.

79
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,400
No, but I can't get away with it even...

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,840
Hail Fredonia.

81
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,940
Even up in Imus land in the northeast, I can't get away with anything.

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,380
They arrest me for everything I say on the radio.

83
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,880
And, get this.

84
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,720
I have to call the police.

85
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,960
I have to call the police to let me into the station.

86
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,900
How do you think that feels?

87
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,960
So, you broadcast by their suffra...

88
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,700
Especially when they pat you down and do the cavity search.

89
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,020
They have all the keys.

90
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,080
I thought you kind of liked that.

91
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,700
I used to, sure.

92
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,140
I think I might have some cavities.

93
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,900
No, it's cold.

94
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,980
They have all the keys, man.

95
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,000
They got all the keys, though.

96
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,860
That's the thing.

97
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,300
Oh, yeah, yeah.

98
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,560
Now, seriously.

99
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,480
When you do a subgenius show in Cleveland, Ohio.

100
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:27,720
I don't know.

101
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,260
You have to wait outside in 10 degree below zero weather until the policeman comes to let you into the building.

102
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,400
And that's all because of Osama Bin Bush and his henchmen.

103
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:39,800
Oh, man.

104
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,980
Oh, my goodness.

105
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,240
Osama Bin Babin.

106
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,420
It used to be that anybody could walk into any radio station and take over any show.

107
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,780
Watching the swinging love corpses right now.

108
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,780
And now, nobody can do any of that.

109
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,480
Look.

110
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,480
This guy's a funny.

111
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,040
He's got a nuclear pad or whatever.

112
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,440
You know what?

113
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,440
I guess Bob Nelson got out while the going was good.

114
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,760
Isn't Bob Nelson still tunneling towards the D-Rows?

115
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,940
Yes, he's still performing his experiments.

116
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:16,780
Digging deeper and deeper into the Nevada desert until sooner or later he breaks through to the inner earth.

117
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,820
The hollow earth in which the Nazi hell creatures dwell.

118
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,220
And other dwellers in the abyss.

119
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,740
Sometimes he's right below your feet.

120
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,000
See that trap door on the floor?

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,060
Don't open it.

122
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,660
Just look at it.

123
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,520
Don't even look at it.

124
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:29,880
Forget it.

125
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,360
Whatever you do, kids, don't knock three times on that trap door and say,

126
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,680
Yard sub thog.

127
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,160
Yeah, don't do it.

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,080
Copyright 1952.

129
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,640
Sterno.

130
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,140
Keycaver.

131
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,320
Right.

132
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,840
Well, that's true.

133
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,380
You know, I mean, you were bad to your bone at the time.

134
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,360
Oh, I'm very bad to my bones.

135
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,200
You know, I don't get enough calcium and I keep bumping into things and cracking them.

136
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,700
Yeah, I have that problem.

137
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,980
I think that's a subgenius thing, too, by the way.

138
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:55,980


139
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:55,980


140
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:02,020
I think that when you when you when Dobbs becomes part of you in his way and he does

141
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,060
it to each of us differently, some more painful than others, that it sort of causes a problem

142
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,240
with perception that makes you trip over the cat or run into the wall a lot.

143
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,140
It's psychic vampirism.

144
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,680
Bob's a psychic vampire.

145
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,720
Psychic vampires.

146
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,560
Oh, man.

147
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,780
That's one of my favorite subjects, actually.

148
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,180
You know, there's there's actually a psychic vampire cult.

149
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,600
Yeah.

150
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,520
Located in the greater Cleveland area.

151
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,660
Yes, there is.

152
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,360
There is.

153
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,680
Yes.

154
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,360
Cool.

155
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,080
I just I just talked about Bob making me trip over the cat.

156
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,660
Now the cat's got an air ball.

157
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,300
Well, is that the time when you're supposed to go, oh, I can't make a lot of meetings,

158
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,360
but I'd like to at least meet some people.

159
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,100
Now, you said there's a there's a slack vampire cult in Cleveland.

160
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,420
No, a psychic vampire.

161
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,940
Well, yeah, not.

162
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,580
Yeah, I guess they they kind of do steal slack from people.

163
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,640
Or maybe I don't know.

164
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,820
Look it up online.

165
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,700
There's there's a few articles about them.

166
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,180
I'm not going to talk too much about them, but they they trace their spiritual heritage

167
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,040
back to some ancient Egyptian thing.

168
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,120
Oh, the Mayans, of course.

169
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,080
No, not really.

170
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,960
That's just the Egyptian lodge.

171
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,100
You see, I heard psychic vampire and I sort of trace their heritage to an ancient Nixon.

172
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,580
These guys actually also make fun of other like vampire people.

173
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:24,580


174
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,580
They actually make fun of people who call themselves vampires who are not them.

175
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,560
They're particularly ones who actually drink blood in rituals and wear the white face,

176
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,940
smell like clowns.

177
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,800
Do they do that, too?

178
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,660
Do they do not like blood here on one cheek and stuff and a red nose and stuff?

179
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,480
Well, no, just the goth.

180
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,160
The goth.

181
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,100
They don't have the red.

182
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,400
Otherwise, they wear a lot of rubber and vinyl.

183
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,540
Well, when they get old, their noses kind of turn red, you know, from the rosacea or

184
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:53,800
whatever.

185
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,760
Well, that's a problem that you could just easily fix by removing your face.

186
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,560
You know, that's all you got to do is just like make the incision lines in the right

187
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,640
place and just rip it off and start a new face.

188
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,200
They've already done face transplants.

189
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,200
Well, what a wonderful thing for a psychic vampire to do to have his face constantly

190
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:19,340
transplanted so that so that so that there's a French woman who was mauled by a dog.

191
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,540
Dog tore her face off and they got her a transplant.

192
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,060
Yeah.

193
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,400
Right.

194
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,840
A dog face like on the island of Dr. Moreau.

195
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,160
Yeah.

196
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,720
They actually transplant the dog's face onto her.

197
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,220
It's like.

198
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,340
Yeah, it serves that dog right.

199
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:32,940
Yeah.

200
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,540
And the dog got mauled.

201
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:41,680
She's naturally she's actually now worshipped by by a small number of homeless schizophrenics.

202
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,700
Plus she has a great gig in the circus.

203
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,820
What makes you think all homeless are schizophrenics?

204
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,760
I didn't say that all homeless are schizophrenic.

205
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,520
I said she was being worshipped by a small band of homeless schizophrenics.

206
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,820
Who, you know, once you get back to that ancient Egyptian thing, you know, they think

207
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,400
she's Anubis now that she's got this dog face.

208
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,180
The homeless people are like.

209
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:03,860
I'm making this up.

210
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,660
In one year in the United States, half a million who look for lifelong happiness admit that

211
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,740
they had not found it.

212
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,620
It means that with every passing year, failure, bad luck.

213
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,020
They had to shoot a man to start a graveyard.

214
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,400
And inexpensive, too.

215
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:21,740
Yeah.

216
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:23,880
I really think the constitute the affirmers of transforms.

217
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:23,880


218
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,500
Do you believe your razor blades lying around?

219
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,660
Do you like babies?

220
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,100
I hadn't thought of it.

221
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,100
No, why?

222
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,660
I'm awful hungry right now.

223
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,220
I wanted to stay this way forever and ever.

224
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,340
I have all the faith in the world.

225
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,960
And, you know, I wanted to have.

226
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,580
The Ether, I kill you.

227
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,140
I might lose my hand.

228
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,940
That could happen to anybody.

229
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,180
I want to die.

230
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,060
If that's what you want, sure, why not?

231
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,700
There's no greater thrill in the world.

232
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,160
Plate, as usual.

233
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,720
To arrive.

234
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:51,720


235
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,780
But he was very popular and nobody-minded, of course.

236
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,040
Doomed to fail.

237
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,060
Well, it's certainly a good thing when we're going up to DEFCON Blue again.

238
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,820
Hey, you know, that reminds me.

239
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,340
There's actually a cool post-apocalyptic movie.

240
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,160
I think, Stang, you've got to have seen this.

241
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,800
It's called DEFCON 4.

242
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,520
Oh, that's an oldie.

243
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,300
Yeah, that's an oldie, but good me.

244
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,420
It's a B movie that actually rates like an A.

245
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:25,140
There is a wonderful History Channel special going around called Life After People,

246
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,140
which shows what would happen to the planet if all the people suddenly disappeared

247
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,220
and they conveniently don't leave corpses.

248
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,100
Oh, that's also a National Geographic channel, The Day After Humans.

249
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:44,860
Basically, as soon as 85 minutes after humans are off the planet,

250
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,160
There's a lot of subgenius porn on television.

251
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,020
Subgenius porn?

252
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,300
Yeah, end-of-the-world movies.

253
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,640
Time lapses of forests growing in the middle of Dallas.

254
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,600
You know, can I mention a website on the air that I found the other day

255
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,220
that's a pretty cool Cold War website?

256
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,500
It gives, like, the history of all things Cold War.

257
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,360
It's called ConnellRad.com.

258
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,600
ConnellRad?

259
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,840
Yes, ConnellRad is in the old civil defense, control,

260
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,320
electronic radiation acronym.

261
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,900
I thought he was the former Prime Minister of Germany during the 19...

262
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,340
When I was a little kid, I thought he was, like, the king of the United States.

263
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,320
Yeah, we all have...

264
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,640
This is a ConnellRad warning.

265
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,340
Yeah, they used to have...

266
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,420
This is only a test.

267
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,760
Yeah, a ConnellRad warning, remember?

268
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,720
The little cuddly doll they had?

269
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,340
Hide under your desk.

270
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,960
Cover your head with newspaper.

271
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,580
And funnel your ConnellRad dolly.

272
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,700
Yeah, and at ConnellRad.com, they have a history.

273
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,240
about the duck and cover movie.

274
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:56,200
And it's like the Citizen Kane of disaster preparedness movies.

275
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,760
Well, ConnellRad himself was portrayed by William Wildburn, Van Heerden.

276
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,300
No, he was...

277
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,640
Cornell Wilde played ConnellRad.

278
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,040
Oh.

279
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,580
Yeah.

280
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,780
ConnellRad?

281
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,220
That sounds like a G.I. Joe character or something.

282
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,740
Colonel Radical versus G.I. Joe.

283
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh.

284
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,680
They're making a...

285
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,500
G.I. Joe movie.

286
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,480
Of course.

287
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,040
Yeah.

288
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,560
Of course, because...

289
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,340
We've done everything else.

290
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,380
You know, this is what they do.

291
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,260
Yes.

292
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,260
Every 20 years, they run out of ideas, and they just start...

293
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,880
Go back to the cool things I played with as a kid.

294
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,740
I tell you what.

295
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,360
Now, this is...

296
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,080
You know, there's an awful lot of...

297
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,640
Dropout.

298
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,320
Dropout.

299
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,380
Useless memorization.

300
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,280
Ignorance.

301
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:38,940
Nazis.

302
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,580
I don't know what it is you're slapping around that makes you so happy.

303
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,900
It can't be much of anything, quite frankly, which is why you try to reach for the phone

304
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,820
and get all the information.

305
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,580
Get off on the receiver.

306
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,660
Get some help.

307
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,160
The real.

308
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,660
The real.

309
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,140
Okay.

310
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,000
You could be...

311
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,340
You could be...

312
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,140
Maintain an erection.

313
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,640
Go on.

314
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,120
Big sticks.

315
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,320
Long and hard.

316
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,500
The Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly, and Savage, and Ingram, all off the air.

317
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,480
All off the air.

318
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,260
All off the air.

319
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:02,420
Yeah.

320
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:02,860
Yeah.

321
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,300
Yep.

322
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:03,860
Yeah.

323
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,620
I'm paranoid.

324
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,800
Yeah, I understand.

325
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,060
Yeah.

326
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,580
I went on the internet tonight, and I got some information.

327
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,180
When you're on the internet, you can get information.

328
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,640
Mm-hmm.

329
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,760
Incredible.

330
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,800
K.I. Joe.

331
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,220
K.I.

332
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:18,740
Mm-hmm.

333
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,000
What do you think a dick is?

334
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,560
Dick?

335
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:20,800
Yeah.

336
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,820
I'm illiterate.

337
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,280
Mm-hmm.

338
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,840
Mm-hmm.

339
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,240
Mm-hmm.

340
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,620
Mm-hmm.

341
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:23,980
Yeah.

342
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,260
Uh, let's go to Bob.

343
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,580
Bob.

344
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:26,840
Bob.

345
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,240
Good morning.

346
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,080
Bob.

347
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,560
Bob.

348
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,140
Bob.

349
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,700
Bob.

350
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,240
Bob.

351
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,680
Bob.

352
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:30,800
Bob.

353
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:30,820
Bob.

354
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,280
Mr. Dobbs.

355
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:32,960
Well.

356
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,440
Well.

357
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,560
I'll wait.

358
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,540
We've just recently had a giant sinkhole open up in downtown Cleveland, right underneath

359
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,520
a bunch of lawyers.

360
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,460
Hmm.

361
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:48,880
Hmm.

362
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,240
Hmm.

363
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,260
Hmm.

364
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,260


365
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,260


366
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,260


367
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,260


368
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,260


369
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,260


370
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,300
Well, that explains much.

371
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,580
Where was that?

372
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,780
I feel like God was getting a little bit of revenge.

373
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,120
Right.

374
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,960
That's what I was thinking.

375
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,420
It sounds like divine providence.

376
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,420
Where was that?

377
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:05,160
Somewhere downtown, one of the big office buildings, they had to close off a street

378
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,680
or something.

379
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,340
Sure.

380
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,540
It wasn't just a pothole.

381
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,200
It's kind of hard to tell the difference sometimes.

382
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:09,860
It was underneath a building.

383
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,920
It was like a month ago.

384
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,680
It caused a whole lot of damage.

385
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,280
Which building?

386
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:13,520
Which building?

387
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:13,520


388
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,800
I impaled an alien at the solar...

389
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,600
I think it was the soldiers and sailors monument as a part of an art school video project once.

390
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,500
I just thought I'd mention that.

391
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,660
Oh, okay.

392
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:32,220
Well, I understand that as we suck water out of the earth underneath our fair cities,

393
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:38,820
the hollows left where the water once was eventually sort of cave in and houses get

394
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,520
swallowed up.

395
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,740
It happens all the time where I'm from, actually.

396
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,000
All those limestone caves full of water.

397
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,480
We take all the water out of them.

398
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:47,800
Hmm.

399
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:47,800


400
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:47,800


401
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:47,800


402
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,060
And giant sinkholes engulf major interstate.

403
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,440
One day you're going to be driving home from wherever you're going and all of a sudden

404
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,020
the I-80 will turn into a giant sinkhole.

405
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,740
That's funny.

406
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,560
You'll wonder why.

407
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,580
Yeah, my route over to I-90 caved in.

408
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,000
Really?

409
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,100
Over on Coit Road.

410
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,400
Oh, is that why it's closed now?

411
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,380
It's been repaired since then, but I started to head in.

412
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,660
Yeah, I tried to take that route a few weeks ago.

413
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,220
It was blocked off.

414
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,100
There was just part of the street just dropped into the ground.

415
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,000
Well, the Native Americans had a tunnel network that stretched somewhere from around here

416
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,920
where the Hopewell culture remains are to all the way to the center of Tennessee.

417
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,820
You could go like hundreds of miles underground, supposedly.

418
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:42,000
Well, and of course they were in league with Sightings and his imps so that they were able

419
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,640
to get into the caves that lead to the literal hell, which is around the center of Tennessee.

420
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:46,740
Yeah.

421
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,260
And it's kind of like a real place with troglodytes who are experts at torturing you and yet keeping

422
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,760
you alive.

423
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,000
Do they have like white hair and like kind of reddish eyes and stuff?

424
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,320
No, you're thinking of that movie The Time Machine.

425
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,200
That's in the future.

426
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,200
That's yet to come.

427
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,060
Okay.

428
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,640
That's when they emerge and rule the earth.

429
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,480
I always step another time again.

430
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:05,800
I'm sorry.

431
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,380
Yeah.

432
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,960
And we got about...

433
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,140
Every time you mention an alternate future, that opens up yet another alternate...

434
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,300
Scientology is...

435
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:16,620
An internet.

436
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:16,620


437
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,100
An industry of death.

438
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,800
It's a Nazi pseudoscience.

439
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,060
Euthanasia campaign.

440
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,060
Scientology was designed for you.

441
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,740
A piece of mud.

442
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,980
Scientology is...

443
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,080
Adventure.

444
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:25,600
Mystery.

445
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,040
Western.

446
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,600
Tech to spy.

447
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,260
Science fiction.

448
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:27,620
Fantasy.

449
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,300
Romance.

450
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:28,820
Romance.

451
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
Where does the money go?

452
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,140
Where does the money go?

453
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,420
Gays.

454
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:31,640
Gays.

455
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,300
Mind control.

456
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,140
To bend men's minds and brainwash them.

457
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,740
Mind control program.

458
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,740
That's a lot of riches.

459
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:37,820
Dianetics.

460
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,080
It's outmoded Scientology.

461
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,540
Sellout.

462
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:39,960
Sellout.

463
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,720
Ah, yes.

464
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,060
Ah.

465
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,500
Church of Scientology.

466
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:43,840
Gay.

467
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,060
Gay.

468
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,260
Gay.

469
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:44,640
Like you.

470
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,160
Man.

471
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,340
I started playing with it.

472
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,220
As a kid, I always wanted to be a Scientologist.

473
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,040
Uncomfortable experiences.

474
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:49,900
All ass.

475
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,360
All ass.

476
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,520
Fun.

477
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:50,820
Fun.

478
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,860
To tell you the honest to God truth, I would be dead.

479
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,480
Fun.

480
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,600
Scientology hasn't helped.

481
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,780
What do I do now?

482
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,880
My answer is to buy.

483
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,100
Buy.

484
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,340
Buy.

485
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:57,460
Buy.

486
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,220
And get help.

487
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:58,860
And get help.

488
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,280
So genius.

489
00:15:59,440 --> 00:15:59,940
A better call.

490
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,380
So genius.

491
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,840
A better call over this call decay.

492
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,040
If you cooperate, we could make you more cheerful.

493
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,640
Shivering.

494
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,480
Agonized darkness.

495
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,280
The choice is yours.

496
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:06,940
Slam tomorrow.

497
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,940
Shot in your own face.

498
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,540
I'm sorry.

499
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,160
Barbaric.

500
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:09,700
Barbaric.

501
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:09,860
Gay.

502
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,080
Gay.

503
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,300
Gay.

504
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:10,440
Gay.

505
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,840
Never mention Scientology again.

506
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,560
Religious oppression.

507
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,520
Injecting.

508
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:28,980
Injecting.

509
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,140
Yes.

510
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,340
But you don't sit.

511
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:30,940
Don't sit.

512
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,180
Sit.

513
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,620
Sit.

514
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:31,900
Sit.

515
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,140
Sit.

516
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,940
Not a head.

517
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,600
Member.

518
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,040
Member.

519
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:34,480
Member.

520
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:34,860
Zero.

521
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,180
Zero.

522
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,680
I know.

523
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,260
Gay.

524
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:36,520
Gay.

525
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:36,780
Gay.

526
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:36,900
Gay.

527
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,800
Toxic exposure.

528
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,420
In the world.

529
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:38,800
In the world.

530
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,160
In the world.

531
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,840
Doesn't get any.

532
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,460
Doesn't get any.

533
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,740
Who's.

534
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,120
Who's.

535
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,420
Gay.

536
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:41,800
Gay.

537
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,080
Gay.

538
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,160
I'm a Scientologist.

539
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,640
I'm gay.

540
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:43,880
Gay.

541
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,060
Gay.

542
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,320
Stupid.

543
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,380
Scientologist.

544
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:45,900
Reduce.

545
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,020
Reduce.

546
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,100
Scientology.

547
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,780
Man is.

548
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,100
A.

549
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,280
Piece of flesh.

550
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,640
They've left me to die.

551
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,120
It's not a religion at all.

552
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:52,740
Interested.

553
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,200
Only in money making.

554
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,080
Which brainwashes its members.

555
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,520
And then bankrupts them.

556
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:57,860
All.

557
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,100
True.

558
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,940
Say its leaders.

559
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,440
The church is an evil and dangerous cult.

560
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,460
Y'all take folks' money.

561
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,720
Y'all brainwash people.

562
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,560
Science fiction.

563
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:04,960
That.

564
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,200
That.

565
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:05,380
That's.

566
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:05,660
That.

567
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,360
That's trouble.

568
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:06,740
Trouble.

569
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,480
Brain damage.

570
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:08,760
Scientology.

571
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,080
That.

572
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,800
That's terrible.

573
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,220
That's bad manners.

574
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:11,760
You know.

575
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,560
Insane.

576
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,040
Or something like that.

577
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,900
This is wrong.

578
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:15,800
Something.

579
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,080
Something needs to be done about it.

580
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,620
Furious.

581
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,180
Hubbard.

582
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,000
L. Ron Hubbard feels the heat.

583
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,640
We live in a world where.

584
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,100
Where.

585
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,460
Where.

586
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:22,980
Uh.

587
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,120
Uh.

588
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:24,780
Uh.

589
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,940
We have.

590
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,720
Mud.

591
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,180
And uh.

592
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:28,980
Therefore.

593
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,020
Uh.

594
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,080
I.

595
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:31,660
Cheating.

596
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,160
Lying.

597
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,940
To killing.

598
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,660
Deception.

599
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,340
Frankly.

600
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,920
We all thought it was pretty amusing.

601
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,700
Freak out.

602
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,280
Freak out.

603
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:37,880
Pretty stupid.

604
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,460
Pretty stupid.

605
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,400
Hubbard knew nothing.

606
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,360
Hubbard knew nothing.

607
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:40,740
Cult.

608
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,180
Cult.

609
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,060
Weird gang that was.

610
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,620
Uh.

611
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,360
You know.

612
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,500
Just being invented.

613
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,100

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:48,960
Cult.

618
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,120
Scientology.

619
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,500
Cult.

620
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:50,920
Cult.

621
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,120
Cult.

622
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,360
Cult.

623
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,580
Dangerous cult.

624
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,220
Demon cult.

625
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,080
I just don't see.

626
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,240
I just don't see.

627
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:57,920
Uh.

628
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,440

00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,180

00:17:59,420 --> 00:17:59,540
Uh.

631
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,500
Dirty tricks.

00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,360
Penis.

633
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:02,780
Penis.

634
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,240
Penis.

635
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,640
Penis.

636
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,660
Is that Ron Hubbard?

637
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,500
You betcha lie.

638
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,660
Battlefield Earth.

639
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,980
We will become aberrated.

640
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,320
We will not change.

641
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,100
I don't care.

642
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:11,920
I don't care.

643
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,040
I really don't care.

644
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,800
And I mean that.

645
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,860
I actually don't care.

646
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,600
Cult of.

647
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,100

648
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,720
Obsessed with making money.

649
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,640
Demonic organization.

650
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,760
Greedy.

651
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,760
Three headed babies.

652
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,960
Out of space.

653
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,200
UFO aliens.

654
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,360
The more you know.

655
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,380
The less you know.

656
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,140
You know.

657
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,700
You know.

658
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,660
You sort of.

659
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,160
Twitch.

660
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,500
Twitch.

661
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,200
Sweat.

662
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:29,740
Sweat.

663
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,460
I didn't realize.

664
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,360
I didn't realize.

665
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,300
And I said whoa.

666
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,240
Real weird.

667
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,220
Real weird.

668
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,240
You know and I was.

669
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:35,920
And then I was just.

670
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,660
You know.

671
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,100
It really lets you know what it's like to live with a Gestapo.

672
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,000
Scientology has the most debilitating set of rituals of any cult in America.

673
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:43,660
Get off.

674
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,500
Freak out.

675
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,020
Freak out.

676
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,780
PR flat.

677
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,360
Wasted.

678
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:46,720
Wasted.

679
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,160
Wasted.

680
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,500
Wasted.

681
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,020
Church waste.

682
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,480
Church waste.

683
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:48,960
Church waste.

684
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,400
Church waste.

685
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,480
Church of Scientology.

686
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,380
Fascistic.

687
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,140
Totalistic.

688
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,600
The Church of Scientology.

689
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,120
They have hate at the core of this cult.

690
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,760
I think there will be more drugs.

691
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,020
Easy access to heroin.

692
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,040
Drug technology.

693
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,180
Murderers and rapists and criminals.

694
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,620
Fill my church up with um.

695
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,140
You know.

696
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,540
You know.

697
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:04,920
No.

698
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,060

699
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,240

No.

706
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,040
No.

707
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,840
Freedom to spread.

708
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,180
Like.

709
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,380

You know.

712
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,220
You know.

713
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,480
You know.

714
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:08,620
Like.

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,040
Insanity and.

716
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,640
Like.

717
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,140
Jamming.

718
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,820
Some airy fairy way.

719
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,640
Airy fairy way.

720
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,880
Scientologists are.

721
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,420
Nothing.

722
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:19,780
Nothing.

723
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,200
Nothing.

724
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,560
Nothing.

725
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:20,920
Weak.

726
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,160
Good.

727
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,420
Good.

728
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:21,660
Good.

729
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,160
Loosen up.

730
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,200
I'm getting you to do all this.

731
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,760
Exciting day.

732
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,100
I'm about to fill your exciting day.

733
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,700
Too much?

734
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,440
Are you ready for that?

735
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,200
I've checked my zipper.

736
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,660
I've checked my zipper about ten times today.

737
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,520
Well today we are learning about a really exciting thing.

738
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,460
Scientology.

739
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,180
Doesn't that sound like fun?

740
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,200
I'm pretty excited about that.

741
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,000
Thank you very much.

742
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,840
Scientologist leads to teenage girls.

743
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,400
Scientologists are a little off.

744
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:39,840
You see.

745
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,120
L. Ron Hubbard was a little off.

746
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,380
We're all a little off aren't we?

747
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,320
Hang the rest.

748
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:44,700
Cult.

749
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,620
Make a lot of money like crazy.

750
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,260
Pass it up.

751
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,400
Up.

752
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:47,940
Supernatural.

00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,520
Teenage girls.

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,100
Hot pants.

756
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:50,960
Scream.

757
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,840
Brutal punishment.

758
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,840
Do it just with men.

759
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,040
Men.

760
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,440
Women.

761
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,000
Dude.

762
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,640
Is a little off.

763
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,160
Bunk.

764
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,400
Bunk.

765
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:56,620
Trick.

766
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,000
Lied.

767
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,820
Dropping out.

768
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,580
Who made it up?

769
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,260
Comatose.

770
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,960
Severely dehydrated and covered in cockroach bites.

771
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:02,740
Good.

772
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,040
Okay.

773
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,300
Okay.

774
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:03,780
Hold on.

775
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,540
Dog.

776
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,080
Dogma.

777
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,080
Baptist and Catholics and Pagans and Hindus and Buddhists and Muslims.

778
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,120
You are born and you die.

779
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,000
You are born and you die.

780
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,920
You are born and you die.

781
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,700
You are born and you die.

782
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,460
Until you achieve.

783
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,060
Born and you die.

784
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,940
You are born and you die.

785
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,840
You are born and you die.

786
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,620
You are born and you die.

787
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,480
Until you achieve.

788
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:16,780
But.

789
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,140
This is going to sound a little redundant.

790
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:18,960
Dianetics.

791
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,420
Dianetics.

792
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,380
The control of the mind.

793
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,120
Dianetics.

794
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,440
Again.

795
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:21,960
Again.

796
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,600
Dianetics.

797
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,080
Neurosis.

798
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,680
Neurosis.

799
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,560
Psychosis.

800
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:24,940
To get.

801
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,600
Psychosis.

802
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:25,960
To get.

803
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,260
Again.

804
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,060
It sounds a little redundant.

805
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:27,840
Dianetics.

806
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,080
Good.

807
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,540
Doing alright.

808
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:28,980
Again.

809
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,700
Move up and move up and move up.

810
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,040
Move up and move up and move up.

811
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,340
Not exciting.

812
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,240
Dianetics.

813
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:33,900
We're getting really deep.

814
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,760
Things are going bad.

815
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,300
I have pain.

816
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,040
I am unconscious.

817
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,720
I don't.

818
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,440
I don't think well.

819
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:37,980
Good.

820
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,460
Little spaceships break your leg.

821
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:39,820
Rock.

822
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,060
Rock.

823
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,580
Broke.

824
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:40,760
Broke.

825
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:40,960
Rock.

826
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,240
Trip.

827
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:41,540
Trip.

828
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:41,860
Rock.

829
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,120
Rock.

830
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,360
Wrong.

831
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,880
I do the wrong thing again.

832
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,280
But I do the wrong thing.

833
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:45,940
Good.

834
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,340
Good.

835
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,060
Zap.

836
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,400
Zap.

837
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,000
Zap.

838
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,300
Fault.

839
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:48,680
False.

840
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,300
Thayton.

841
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:49,800
Thayton.

842
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,260
Thayton.

843
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:50,760
Thayton.

844
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,040
Thayton.

845
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,400
Thayton.

846
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:51,900
Thayton.

847
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,300
Thayton.

848
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,560
Thayton.

849
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,280
You are Thayton.

850
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,640
Thayton.

851
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,040
Thayton.

852
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,520
Thayton.

853
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:54,960
Thayton.

854
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,020
Thayton.

855
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:55,620
Thayton.

856
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,120
Thayton.

857
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,680
Thayton brand new.

858
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,200
Thayton.

859
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,580
Thayton.

860
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,120
Here it is.

861
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,660
Sound crazy.

862
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,680
Zip zip Thayton.

863
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,880
Tom Cruise is Thayton.

864
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,600
Psychotic.

865
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,500
Thousands of aliens from all over the universe fighting for control of your body.

866
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,600
Thayton let Tom Cruise go.

867
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,440
Isn't it sad?

868
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:10,840
Woo!

869
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,140
Woo!

870
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,560
Aren't we all a little off?

871
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,800
Because you're off and I'm off.

872
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,180
Thayton.

873
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,140
Maybe you're a little off.

874
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,740
Maybe you're a little off.

875
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,580
I love this.

876
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,380
I love this.

877
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,500
Have you had fun today or what?

878
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:18,760
What?

879
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:19,860
Six.

880
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,340
Six.

881
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:20,800
Six.

882
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,380
Six.

883
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,600
My life just changed.

884
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,580
I thought it would be hard.

885
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:23,980
It would be hard.

886
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,360
It would be hard.

887
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:24,940
Congratulations.

888
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:25,600
Six.

889
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:25,700
Six.

890
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,040
Six.

891
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,380
Six.

892
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:26,640
Six.

893
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:26,880
Six.

894
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,060
Six.

895
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,180
Six.

896
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,340
Six.

897
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:27,440
Six.

898
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:27,760
Six.

899
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,340
Stress.

900
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,240
Anxiety.

901
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,600
Depression.

902
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,660
Negative thinking.

903
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,460
Irrational behavior.

904
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,520
Unwanted aches and pains.

905
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,460
Painful experiences.

906
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,340
Dianetics.

907
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,860
The cause of what's wrong in your life.

908
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,600
You're going to learn how to get rid of it.

909
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,280
We go through life.

910
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,020
What are we doing?

911
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,940
And why are we doing it?

912
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,140
Primitive.

913
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,480
Pleasure.

914
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,260
In a very irrational way.

915
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:53,840
Problems.

916
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,300
Feeling depressed.

917
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,200
Anxiety.

918
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:55,700
Panic attacks.

919
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,340
But why?

920
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,000
Pain.

921
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,640
Have anesthesia.

922
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,080
Sick.

923
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:58,480
Drunk.

924
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:58,960
Drugged.

925
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,440
Think negatively.

926
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,460
And irrationally.

927
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:00,880
Now.

928
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:01,860
Dianetics.

929
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,020
Controlling the way you think.

930
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,660
The way you act.

931
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,540
And the way you feel.

932
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,320
The way you whack.

933
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:05,540
Whack.

934
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:05,700
Whack.

935
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:05,940
Whack.

936
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,320
The hit.

937
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,720
The pain.

938
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,580
The feel of the bass.

939
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,200
The feel of the bass.

940
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,780
Watch what you're doing.

941
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,160
Get out.

942
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:09,720
You can't breathe.

943
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:09,800
You can't breathe.

944
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,340
Very deep.

945
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,280
Why don't you watch what you're doing?

946
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,000
Look at what you've done.

947
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,440
Get out.

948
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:12,860
Get out of here.

949
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,480
Completely irrational.

950
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,200
Fears.

951
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:14,780
Insecurities.

952
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:15,800
Irrationalities.

953
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,600
Stress and depression.

954
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,520
You crash into a tree.

955
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh my god.

956
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,100
Yeah.

957
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,220
Stress is killing me.

958
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,860
Life is short, you know?

959
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,720
Yeah, I hear you, man.

960
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,500
You know?

961
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,180
Dressed out.

962
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,480
Sick.

963
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,340
It won't stop hurting.

964
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:28,780
A mother.

965
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,320
Allergies.

966
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:29,700
Ulcers.

967
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,480
Migraine headaches.

968
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,900
Unexplained aches and pains.

969
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,420
And so forth.

970
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,680
Can be traced back to the harmful effect of Dianetics.

971
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,980
You can get rid of Dianetics.

972
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,500
In Dianetics, the little man in your mind handing out data.

973
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,380
With Dianetics.

974
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:39,960
You don't like it.

975
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,500
Cancel this.

976
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,400
K. K. K.

977
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,120
Stressed out.

978
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,740
Stressed out.

979
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,400
I'm killing me.

980
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:43,580
Good.

981
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:43,820
Good.

982
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,400
Do you smell?

983
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:44,780
Good.

984
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,100
Yeah.

985
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:45,780
All right.

986
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,020
Duh.

987
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,560
Very good.

988
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:46,800
Good.

989
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,340
I can't see.

990
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:47,940
Dumb.

991
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,360
Good.

992
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:48,880
Continue.

993
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:49,560
Dumb.

994
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:49,920
Feel there.

995
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,460
This, this stress is killing me.

996
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,100
Well, you know.

997
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,640
Well, you know.

998
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,000
Okay.

999
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:53,580
Good.

1000
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:31,960
I see how it's going to go Healthcare, Graduate School Now.

1001
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,960
Why, why why toward take you to work to become a

1002
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,460
No faith society.

1003
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,060
Financial dealings.

1004
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,960
The source of what my values really are.

1005
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,420
Creator, cult, creator, cult.

1006
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,700
That is just not relevant.

1007
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,180
They said, then they said, then they said, then they said.

1008
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:48,800
Give me an illustration.

1009
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,940
Proceed, proceed, read.

1010
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,680
On a regular basis, literally every day,

1011
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,560
I think it was a lot to do with ignorance pulling the wool over our eyes.

1012
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,540
That was sad.

1013
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,640
Give people.

1014
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,940
Scientologists don't feel they have to have a dual personality.

1015
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,400
In the whole of my career, for profit.

1016
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,420
Too filthy, too filthy.

1017
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:05,980
No, I mean.

1018
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,740
No, I mean.

1019
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,720
Good move, good move.

1020
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,820
Head, I think, is irrelevant.

1021
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:09,520
I mean.

1022
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,400
It's it, it's it, it's it, it's it, it's it, it, it, it, it.

1023
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,800
I mean.

1024
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,840
Cut my hair.

1025
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,400
Cut, cut.

1026
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:14,920
Deeply.

1027
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,340
Fish, it's absurd.

1028
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,500
We must bring this discussion to an end.

1029
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,160
Scarf.

1030
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,880
Fish, it's absurd.

1031
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,080
When I got the feeling to start for myself,

1032
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,780
I went to a damn Scientology meeting.

1033
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,300
Jumping on all the furniture.

1034
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,300
Then I went and got that L-Ron.

1035
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,280
Hubman built on Scientology called Dianetics.

1036
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,660
Dianetics, Dianetics.

1037
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,660
I walked in this damn place and this woman comes over and says,

1038
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,380
Hello, I'm a Satan.

1039
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,480
I said, what?

1040
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,100
She said, I'm a minister for Scientology Church.

1041
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,200
I'm a Scientologist.

1042
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,580
I'm a Scientologist.

1043
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,840
They took me in this room and hooked me up to an e-meter.

1044
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,960
I'm a Scientologist.

1045
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,320
They started asking me all these questions about my life.

1046
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,460
That little needle on that thing kept going up and up and up.

1047
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,060
They said, Betty, you have all kinds of engrams in your head.

1048
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,360
And we can cure all that.

1049
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,980
Ain't no way in hell I'm giving that woman $5,000.

1050
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,500
I said, I heard y'all could audition this shit for free.

1051
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:26,220
And she said, see, I've come and talked to you for an hour.

1052
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,720
And they kept asking me all these questions about my life.

1053
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,280
And it was real personal.

1054
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,200
I didn't like it.

1055
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,240
I got up and said, I'm going to leave.

1056
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,400
I'm going to leave.

1057
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,400


1058
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,400


1059
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:35,900
I'm going to leave.

1060
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,080
I'm going to leave.

1061
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,440
I'm going to leave.

1062
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:37,440


1063
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:37,760
You know what?

1064
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,160
They say all these celebrities are into Scientology.

1065
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,020
I've done some research on the internet.

1066
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,500
It's a cult.

1067
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,500
Go take all your money.

1068
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,200
I'm a Scientologist.

1069
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,080
You are a Scientologist.

1070
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,100
It's a cult.

1071
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,200
Go take all your money.

1072
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,900
Thanks for listening to all these podcasts.

1073
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,440
Podcast.

1074
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,720
Today is Bob.

1075
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,540
Now, we have Bob.

1076
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,280
Now, we have Bob.

1077
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,420
Bob's on the show.

1078
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,140
And he was so popular, I asked him to come back.

1079
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,780
If you're not familiar with Bob, his history is that he was a professional.

1080
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,300
Hi, Bob.

1081
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:11,780
How are you doing?

1082
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,640
You know, I don't know.

1083
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,160
I wasn't there.

1084
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,520
And a lot of people were.

1085
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,060
Interviewed some PRs to find out what this was all about.

1086
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,000
I take an incredible amount of meat.

1087
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,860
Incredible amount of meat.

1088
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,880
TV tabloid shows.

1089
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,040
Over and over and over again.

1090
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,920
White PR.

1091
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,660
The church.

1092
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,580
Over and over and over again.

1093
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,400
Thousands of times.

1094
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:31,840
Yeah.

1095
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,200
Promise never to go to bed.

1096
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:33,380
Yeah.

1097
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,040
Yeah.

1098
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,260
Yeah.

1099
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,260


1100
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,260


1101
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,260


1102
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,260


1103
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,260


1104
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,260


1105
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,260


1106
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,260


1107
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,260


1108
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,300
Before your head.

1109
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,600
Head.

1110
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,100
Head.

1111
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,480
And I could see that BD made sense.

1112
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,420
Duh.

1113
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:39,860
Duh.

1114
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,160
I was involved with several.

1115
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:41,660
Shooting.

1116
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,420
We have a party.

1117
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,400
It's quite poetic.

1118
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,020
Very touching.

1119
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,520
Very moving.

1120
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,960
Tom and Katie use drugs.

1121
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,420
Simple.

1122
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,280
White PR.

1123
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,100
Crack a joke.

1124
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,840
Crack a joke hole.

1125
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,700
So, it was all over the place.

1126
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,620
I mean, it was all over.

1127
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,580
Yeah.

1128
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,140
It's a major piece.

1129
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,120
All you have is a godless society that's materialistic.

1130
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,480
And let me tell you.

1131
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,340
Suppressive governments.

1132
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,400
You know, mental illnesses.

1133
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,980
Or every human.

1134
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,520
Behavior and motion and action is in itself the basis of a mental illness.

1135
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,500
Of course, the value of Scientology.

1136
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,200
They're there.

1137
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,320
They're ruining their lives.

1138
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:14,960
And it's okay.

1139
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,820
And say, hey.

1140
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,440
Killing my wife.

1141
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:16,980
Drugs.

1142
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,360
I found a gun in my son's drawer.

1143
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,220
The cult.

1144
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,260
The cult Scientology.

1145
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,520
The cult Scientology.

1146
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,120
The cult.

1147
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,940
You know, our cult got some serious situations going on.

1148
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:25,500
Crimer.

1149
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,120
Murders and things of that nature.

1150
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,380
So, don't know what they're doing.

1151
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,040
And we.

1152
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,120
Because we've got a cult.

1153
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,320
Wherever there's a lot of people living.

1154
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,160
Problems.

1155
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
It doesn't take much.

1156
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,000
90 murders.

1157
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,440
90 people were murdered.

1158
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,060
Killed in church Scientology.

1159
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,540
Which is lots of fun.

1160
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,440
And very exciting.

1161
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,080
They love it.

1162
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,780
Get going.

1163
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,880
Yeah.

1164
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:42,760
Scientology.

1165
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,660
It doesn't take much.

1166
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,160
Well, Bob, I want to thank you.

1167
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:45,860
I really love it.

1168
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,400
I really love it.

1169
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,320
I'm very interested in you.

1170
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:47,720
So, I'm now.

1171
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,140
Big.

1172
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,980
Tom Cruise on.

1173
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,360
Tom Cruise.

1174
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:52,940
Scientologist.

1175
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,680
Being a Scientologist.

1176
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,160
When you drive past an accident.

1177
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,860
It's not like anyone else.

1178
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,360
As you drive past.

1179
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,380
You know you have to do something about it.

1180
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:02,740
Because.

1181
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,080
You know.

1182
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,520
You're the only one that can really help.

1183
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,040
We are the authorities on getting people off drugs.

1184
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,520
We are the authorities on the mind.

1185
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,900
We are the authorities on improving conditions.

1186
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,720
Criminon.

1187
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,480
We can rehabilitate criminals.

1188
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,220
Way to happiness.

1189
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,280
We can bring peace.

1190
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,240
And unite cultures.

1191
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,340
It is.

1192
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,500
Being a Scientologist.

1193
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,880
People are turning to you.

1194
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,580
So, you better know it.

1195
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,380
You better know it.

1196
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,720
And if you don't.

1197
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,500
You know.

1198
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,220
Go and learn it.

1199
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,980
You know.

1200
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,000
I mean if you're a Scientologist.

1201
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,800
You see life.

1202
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,920
You see things.

1203
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,200
The way they are.

1204
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,200
And I thought.

1205
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
Oh what a beautiful thing.

1206
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,460
Because maybe one day.

1207
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,960
It'll be like that.

1208
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,960
You know what I'm saying.

1209
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,000
Maybe one day.

1210
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,600
It will be.

1211
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,260
Wow.

1212
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:56,760
SP.

1213
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,120
He's like.

1214
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,000
They'll just read about those in the history books.

1215
00:28:59,260 --> 00:28:59,600
You know.

1216
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,060
The thing is.

1217
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,200
I just go through that tech.

1218
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:02,620
And it's.

1219
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,160
It's literally.

1220
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,480
It's.

1221
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,100
It's not.

1222
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,260
It's not.

1223
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,260


1224
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,260


1225
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,260


1226
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,260


1227
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,260


1228
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,260


1229
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,260


1230
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,260


1231
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,940
How to run from an SP.

1232
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,200
It's PTSD.

1233
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,840
How to shatter suppression.

1234
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,040
Confront shatter suppression.

1235
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:10,880
You apply it.

1236
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,380
It's like boom.

1237
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,420
Look.

1238
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,760
I wish the world was a different place.

1239
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,520
I'd like to go on vacation.

1240
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,780
And go.

1241
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,840
And romp.

1242
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,340
And play.

1243
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,080
And just.

1244
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,640
Do that.

1245
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,460
You know what I mean.

1246
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,520
I mean.

1247
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,900
That's what I want it to be.

1248
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,680
Okay.

1249
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:31,880
That's how.

1250
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,520
I would.

1251
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:32,920
You know.

1252
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,280
There's times.

1253
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,120
I'd like to do that.

1254
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,480
But.

1255
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,320
But I can't.

1256
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,400
Because.

1257
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,840
I know.

1258
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,340
I know.

1259
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,180
So.

1260
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,900
I have to do something.

1261
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,260
Don't I?

1262
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:51,700
Yeah.

1263
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,900
I really have to do it.

1264
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,420
Because I can't live with myself.

1265
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,340
If I don't.

1266
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,260
And it's.

1267
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,680
And that really is it.

1268
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,860
So it's our responsibility to.

1269
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:01,720
Educate.

1270
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:01,840
And.

1271
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,140
Create the new reality.

1272
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:04,900
You know.

1273
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,640
We have that responsibility to say.

1274
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:06,860
Hey.

1275
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,160
This is the way it should be done.

1276
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,680
I have to tell you something.

1277
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,680
I really.

1278
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,120
It.

1279
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,800
It is.

1280
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,180
You know.

1281
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,920
It's rough and tumble.

1282
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,540
And it's.

1283
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,660
Wild and wooly.

1284
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,560
And it's a blast.

1285
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,780
It's a blast.

1286
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,240
When I think about those people out there.

1287
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:25,960
Who.

1288
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,900
Are depending on.

1289
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,520
Us.

1290
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:30,780
And.

1291
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,940
I think about that.

1292
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,360
I do what I can.

1293
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,960
And I do it.

1294
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,600
The way I do everything.

1295
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,380
There's nothing.

1296
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,460
Part of the way.

1297
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,220
For me.

1298
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,700
It's just.

1299
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,240
A Scientologist can be defined by a single question.

1300
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:58,500
The question.

1301
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,500


1302
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,500


1303
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,500


1304
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,500


1305
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,500


1306
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,500


1307
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,500


1308
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,500


1309
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,540
Would you want others to achieve the knowledge you now have.

1310
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,480
In answering that question.

1311
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,640
Tom Cruise has introduced LRH technology.

1312
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,120
To over 1 million people of Earth.

1313
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,460
And that's only the first wave he's unleashed.

1314
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,500
Which is why the story of Tom Cruise Scientologist.

1315
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,840
Has only just begun.

1316
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,720
We of the church believe.

1317
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,800
That all men have inalienable rights.

1318
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,880
To destroy their own lives.

1319
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,980
That all men have inalienable rights.

1320
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,780
To destroy their sanity.

1321
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,980
And to destroy the opinions of others.

1322
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,720
That all men have inalienable rights.

1323
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,780
To destroy their own kind.

1324
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,420
That the souls of men.

1325
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,160
Have the rights to destroy.

1326
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,400
The study of the mind.

1327
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,940
And the healing of mentally caused ills.

1328
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,660
Should be alienated from religion.

1329
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,700
Not condoned in non-religious.

1330
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:56,700


1331
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:56,700


1332
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,080
Fields.

1333
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,380
And that no agency less than.

1334
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,180
We of the church.

1335
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,560
Has the power to suspend.

1336
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,240
Or set aside these rights.

1337
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,140
Overtly or covertly.

1338
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,200
And we of the church believe.

1339
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,140
That man is seeking to destroy.

1340
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,700
That his survival depends upon himself.

1341
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,540
To destroy his fellows.

1342
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,680
And to destroy brotherhood.

1343
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,520
With the universe.

1344
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,940
And we of the church believe.

1345
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,860
That the laws of the church condoned man.

1346
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,180
To destroy his own kind.

1347
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,640
To destroy the sanity of another.

1348
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,980
To destroy or enslave another's soul.

1349
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,900
To destroy or enslave another's soul.

1350
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:35,960
To destroy or enslave another's soul.

1351
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,040
To destroy or enslave another's soul.

1352
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,160
Yes dear friends it does appear.

1353
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,720
That this episode of the hour of slack number 1157.

1354
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,200
Ended up being the repository.

1355
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,900
For many of the Scientology bashing clips.

1356
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,640
Mostly edited by Reverend Norrell Preff.

1357
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,340
That have been stacking up around here like cord wood.

1358
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:58,340
I personally don't have any more against Scientology.

1359
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,340
Than I do against all rival cults.

1360
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,560
Such as Christianity or Mohammedism.

1361
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,160
And I'm not particularly into the anonymous anti-cult cult.

1362
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,420
Mainly because it seems like just another rival cult itself.

1363
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,920
But hey what you gonna do.

1364
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,060
Invite them all to X-Day I guess friends.

1365
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,800
And X-Day is coming up.

1366
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,340
The world ends July 5th.

1367
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,920
And we're having a hell of a party to prove it.

1368
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,300
Like we do every year.

1369
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,140
Also it's subgenius mating season.

1370
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,420
If you are interested.

1371
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,220
And if you think you have what it takes.

1372
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,140
Such as no fear of the outdoors.

1373
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,260
You can look at the events section of our website.

1374
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,720
At subgenius.com

1375
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,340
There are many naughty pictures.

1376
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,960
Because our X-Day drills take place.

1377
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,580
At a clothing optional campground in New York State.

1378
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,880
Called Brushwood.

1379
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,100
Our mating grounds.

1380
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,720
Anyway before the slew of Scientologisms.

1381
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,220
We played some live radio recordings.

1382
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,260
From Dr. Sinister's radio synesthesia show.

1383
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,500
On WCSB Cleveland.

1384
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,140
Which follows our slack in that noble city.

1385
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,840
With guests Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1386
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,280
Priestess Pisces.

1387
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,360
Rocknar and No Money Mark.

1388
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,300
And yours truly.

1389
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,700
We also heard early on some puzzling evidence.

1390
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,540
From KPFA Berkeley.

1391
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,240
The oldest living subgenius show.

1392
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,780
With host puzzling evidence.

1393
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,020
Subgenius Church co-sub founder Dr. Philo Drummond.

1394
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,380
Dr. Howell.

1395
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,360
Gary Gavro-Trend and so many others.

1396
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,560
Our titles and a few other clips and claps.

1397
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,940
Were by Mr. Lee Murr.

1398
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,640
And no he has no website.

1399
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,340
The background music right now.

1400
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,860
Is from the new CD called.

1401
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,180
Totality.

1402
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,120
By the Flyin' Ryan Brothers.

1403
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,840
With Reverend Jimmy Ryan.

1404
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840
For more on their fine music.

1405
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,820
You'll like this.

1406
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,120
See.

R-Y-A-N-etics.com.

1409
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,860
Well let's cut the yakking now.

1410
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,040
For some more music.

1411
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,380
Which like Scientology and subgenius.

1412
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,220
In this case is mostly about money.

1413
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:14,000
First up is from one of our chicken head friends.

1414
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,600
Kid Whatever.

1415
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,620
Well it's one for the money.

1416
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,820
Two for the money.

1417
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:19,820


1418
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,020
Twos for the money.

1419
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,320
Three for the money.

1420
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,020
Goals.

1421
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,340
Goals.

1422
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:22,880
James Archie Davis.

1423
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,100
하고ranea.com.

1424
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,880
Ocho Öxum.

1425
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,220
Everything that I got and isn't.

1426
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,280
Double sobriety.

1427
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,560
James Elian.

1428
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:40,560


1429
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,140
Was working.

1430
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,620
Esgrafopi Lajinder.

1431
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,160
Dave Pinkney.

1432
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,740
What's real when he stans it's real when they don't start it at all?

1433
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:49,780
No.

1434
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:49,780


1435
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,820
I'll try to do that one thing before this one gets cut.

1436
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,520
Go over money

1437
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,040
Go over money

1438
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,880
You're so money and you don't even know it

1439
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:46,780
Go over money

1440
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,760
Go over money

1441
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:49,760
You're so money

1442
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,040
You're so money

1443
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:39,480
You're so money

1444
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:18,340
You're so money

1445
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:26,600
You're so money

1446
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,860
The greatest thing on earth

1447
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,420
Is love of money

1448
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,200
We thank our lucky stars

1449
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,160
We thank our lucky stars

1450
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,520
And money

1451
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,540
I treasure each account with loving care

1452
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:14,400
I guess from the deep inside us

1453
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,720
There's a touch of all-king Midas

1454
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,580
Hey!

1455
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,820
To the king!

1456
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,820
Thank you

1457
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,660
Not at all

1458
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,840
The greatest thing on earth

1459
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,940
Is love of money

1460
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,000
Jed, ain't you lucky to have friends

1461
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,380
Who take such interest in your money?

1462
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,340
My doggie granny, you're right

1463
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,940
We are looking into studies

1464
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:04,940


1465
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:04,940


1466
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:04,940


1467
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:04,940


1468
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:04,940


1469
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,280
You got to work atços

1470
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,480
And have nothing to talk about

1471
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,120
前

1472
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,760
And see if you ever have

1473
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:08,760


1474
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,980
I can pray

1475
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,720
That the one in 가능

1476
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:12,720


1477
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,280
Hand in hands

1478
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,280


1479
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,280


1480
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,400
To our neighbors

1481
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,160
And alabaster

1482
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,880
Oh Jesus...

1483
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,200
I do!

1484
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,140
Me a man who threw away the key

1485
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:27,700
And set the speed to barely playing

1486
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,060
For thirty days, thirty days

1487
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,600
There was a time when I could believe that

1488
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,540
I could recall every day I had lived

1489
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,400
And that joyride, it came like a slide

1490
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,980
And I got very a little out of hand

1491
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,920
I used to wake up anxious each morning

1492
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,940
Time it was coming, I didn't want to kill

1493
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,640
But now the first day of every month's just

1494
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,540
Another day to share in a bunch of guilt

1495
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,960
But thirty days, I am a prisoner

1496
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,920
Thirty days out in the sea

1497
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,760
I shall tunnel out of all this trouble

1498
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,020
I will be free in thirty days

1499
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,060
Well, it's been a bad month, my friend

1500
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,580
And last month, it was a bad one

1501
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,580
And the time was not so bad either

1502
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,020
No wind got knocked out of my life

1503
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,160
No, I don't want to fight

1504
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,720
I just want to breathe

1505
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1506
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,720
So God created better than heaven

1507
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,760
And only seven days they say

1508
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,380
But on that seventh day he rested

1509
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,400
Oh, but I heard it another way

1510
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,000
I heard that he died drunk and lonely

1511
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,220
Created trouble in town alone

1512
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:43,480
These thirty days he shoots out the bullet

1513
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,240
And the whole moon just to remind us

1514
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,820
We're on a roll

1515
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,840
But thirty days, hell, September

1516
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,300
And I could use a day or two

1517
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,880
For lots of mystery, I will remember

1518
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,860
But thirty days, thirty days

1519
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:07,500
There's lots of mystery, I will remember

1520
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,780
But thirty days, thirty days, thirty days

1521
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,980
Thirty days, thirty days

1522
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,780
Thirty days, thirty days, thirty days

1523
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:30,380
The CEO of the former CEO of the CEO of and the CFO of

1524
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,060
Business is business

1525
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,040
There's no question on my mind

1526
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,380
None, no question in my mind

1527
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,360
Check it, check it

1528
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,200
Rejection, rejection

1529
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,820
Right now I happen to be a CEO, EO, EO, EOO and follower

1530
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,920
is too much.

1531
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,340
Take advantage of.

1532
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,320
9-11. I don't think

1533
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,480
it doesn't matter. Fairy tales

1534
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,280
in the form of science fiction.

1535
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,700
Too far-fetched. Hardcore.

1536
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,580
Hardcore. If you want information about

1537
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,780
lower forces, you can find it at our site on the

1538
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:00,780
internet. www.allmormons.com

1539
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,700
Business is business.

1540
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,520
I, the, the, the

1541
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,420
Mormon needed to be restored.

1542
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,760
Um, but um, well he

1543
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,580
wasn't telling the truth.

1544
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,980
I just want to uh, make a quick comment about those two Mormons.

1545
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,060
Make a quick comment about those two Mormons.

1546
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:15,820
Sure. Corrupted.

1547
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,780
That was quick. It's, it's old.

1548
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:19,860
Yeah.

1549
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,920
Old like me.

1550
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,120
I had to, I want to, you know,

1551
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,760
I hear all the subgeniuses complaining about getting old

1552
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,080
and I went to get my eyes checked

1553
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,380
and it, right after my birthday.

1554
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,560
About a, a

1555
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,760
week after and went in there and found

1556
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,000
out that I had to get bifocals.

1557
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,620
Uh-huh.

1558
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,960
Well what about straight focals?

1559
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,760
Yeah, Stan, what about the congenital

1560
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,320
glaucoma and leprosy?

1561
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,380
Oh, that's just part of the satire.

1562
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,620
Huh? That's part of the joke.

1563
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,320
Right. Don't you get it, man?

1564
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,240
We have to do about it until we start laughing, you know?

1565
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,800
But apparently I have a mutant spot on the back of my

1566
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,620
eyeball that they,

1567
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,780
it kind of looks a little bit like a

1568
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,500
Dobbs head in the retinal photography.

1569
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,800
So it's... Which is why they keep bringing me

1570
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
in, but it's apparently now I have

1571
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,700
to get bifocals so I can sort of

1572
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,660
split the retinal spot that looks like

1573
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,300
Bob into two

1574
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,000
visual

1575
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,680
You're about to learn why old people kind of

1576
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,680
tilt their head back when they read the newspaper.

1577
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,480
Because they have three ovaries.

1578
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,400
Yeah. Or not

1579
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,460
frozen ones, I mean three, not

1580
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:22,860
free.

1581
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,700
No, I have free ovaries. I try to

1582
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,580
give them away all the time, but nobody will take them.

1583
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,700
Well that's like the spot behind your eye.

1584
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,160
It is not a mutation.

1585
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,660
It is perfectly normal and natural, especially

1586
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,420
if it's a scroll down Bob's head.

1587
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,260
It makes it even all the more

1588
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,280
natural and organic.

1589
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,000
Maybe it is exactly a Dobbs head.

1590
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,580
Maybe a Dobbs head somehow

1591
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,200
burned itself onto the inside of one of your

1592
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,920
eyeballs. Or has chosen you.

1593
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,780
It has, yeah. You've been chosen.

1594
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,020
Well, and they thought it was a cancer at first.

1595
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,080
And they said, well of course that's what they're going to think it is.

1596
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,940
They're going to think it's cancer because

1597
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,020
of the growth of Bob tissue in you.

1598
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,060
Right, right. So apparently

1599
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,500
one of my eyes,

1600
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,320
this would be the left eye,

1601
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,240
is an eye of

1602
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,960
Bob. Well the left eye

1603
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,140
is the path to the right mind. That's true

1604
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,660
because Dobbs heads see,

1605
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,920
I mean Bob can see out of every

1606
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,660
Dobbs head.

1607
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,960
And if there's one at the back of your eyeball

1608
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,080
that means he's, you're one of his

1609
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,520
main spy cameras, you might say.

1610
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,200
And I've got to tell you there's something

1611
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,200
really creepy about it. The girl I met

1612
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,180
in the Waffle House, when they

1613
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,100
first found this, it was actually

1614
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,080
shortly after

1615
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,060
I talked to the girl who said I saw

1616
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,360
Bob here and he stiffed me.

1617
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:37,660
So,

1618
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,260
apparently

1619
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,260
there's something wrong or

1620
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,860
right with this Waffle House.

1621
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,040
That's when the Dobbs head

1622
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,500
marked.

1623
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,180
Well now you know there are a lot of false Bobs

1624
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,820
and Bob robots

1625
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,060
walking the streets

1626
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,020
these days. Yeah, sometimes the pipe

1627
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,100
doesn't dangle the right way. The pipe should

1628
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,120
dangle to the left. Or am I seeing it mirror

1629
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,260
image? Should it, is it pointed

1630
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,640
to his right

1631
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,240
or your, the camera left?

1632
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,940
The camera left, facing left, yeah.

1633
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,180
Yeah.

1634
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:10,420
Absolutely.

1635
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,260
So you know they could have that wrong by

1636
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,280
different degrees and still be selling you

1637
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,100
a line of stuff.

1638
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,140
Oh sure.

1639
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,840
Speaking of selling you a line of stuff as Lunsum

1640
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,020
just was, you can learn more about everything

1641

Cleveland Heights

1646

Ohio

1647
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,480
411

1648
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,340
8

1649
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,920
Before the radiosynesthesia

1650
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,100
just then and after the Beverly Hillbillies

1651
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,080
we heard Bob Walkenhorst

1652
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,940
performing his song 30 Days

1653
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,400
solo at the Record Bar in Kansas City.

1654
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,160
I downloaded those

1655
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,280
by the way, they aren't on any album that I know of

1656
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,200
although Bob does have a new album

1657
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,680
out called The Beginner.

1658
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,280
Almost all of the collages in this episode were by

1659
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,780
Norrell Preff of norrellpreff.com

1660
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,400
who seems like

1661
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,180
one of the people put in this country

1662
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,580
just to cut audio clips.

1663
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,080
He has cut up a whole lot of audio clips.

1664
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,460
Thousands of them.

1665
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,640
There are some people put in this country just to kill Americans.

1666
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,960
George Bush is one of them.

1667
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,280
He has killed a whole lot of Americans.

1668
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,720
Thousands of them.

1669
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,140
And he has crippled hundreds

1670
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,940
of thousands of them.

1671
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,820
The devils

1672
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,860
would love very much to do away with democracy.

1673
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,100
We are not a great nation.

1674
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,520
You have this silly little woman out of

1675
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,980
I don't know, where the hell is she from?

1676
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,080
Arkansas?

1677
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,720
This white

1678
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:39,760
stupid looking, ugly,

1679
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,380
vile, racist

1680
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,360
stupid.

1681
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,140
Sometimes it's true.

1682
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:47,900
Reality sucks.

1683
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,660
Not a law is applied, licensed by the Department of

1684
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,640
Corporations Equal Housing Law.

1685
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,660
Erectile dysfunction.

1686
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,160
Can't maintain an erection.

1687
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,060
Send John McCain into retirement.

1688
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:59,140
President Bush and the Pope share a lot of common values.

1689
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,640
Terrorism and extremism.

1690
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,280
Walmart guns falling into the wrong hands.

1691
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,180
And you're not doing anything about it.

1692
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:05,940
You're just like me.

1693
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,340
Guns and God completely burned out.

1694
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,220
Most people in America feel

1695
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,960
exactly as you do.

1696
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,720
That's how they do it.

1697
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,060
You know, I mean, you live around all those places like

1698
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:19,100
Langley and Fort Meade and you probably

1699
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,280
hang out there too.

1700
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,420
I'm actually right now really close to NIH.

1701
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,780
The National Institutes of Health.

1702
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,420
And that's an interesting

1703
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,180
maze of a place.

1704
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,460
I'm sure there's something weird

1705
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,260
going on there. There's always weird stuff going on.

1706
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,960
Well, you're putting

1707
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,220
Dobbs heads in all the medical books, right?

1708
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,400
Pardon?

1709
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,800
You're putting Dobbs heads in all the medical books, right?

1710
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,240
No, I haven't

1711
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,260
gotten that far yet.

1712
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,160
Right now, I also work

1713
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,040
with a funeral

1714
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,200
service group and I'm working my way

1715
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,920
into them because funeral

1716
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,420
people really do have a very subgenius

1717
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,200
line in them.

1718
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,960
Yeah, and they're experts

1719
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,060
at getting lots of money for

1720
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,180
doing stuff

1721
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,320
that's totally unnecessary.

1722
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,860
Well, and there are, we have a lot of

1723
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,480
ministers who are embalmers

1724
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,520
and so forth.

1725
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,200
Reverend Sifu. Yeah, and they're the only people

1726
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,900
that are happy when your relatives die.

1727
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,140
I mean, you naturally gravitate to them because you're smiling

1728
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,900
and stuff. Didn't people drop

1729
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,120
as much money on a casket as they would on

1730
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,160
like a car, a luxury car?

1731
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,120
Yeah, a yacht. So it can be buried

1732
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,140
in the ground. Well, if you're really cool, you're buried in your

1733
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,040
car. Right. Oh, yeah.

1734
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,860
And sometimes the cars are hand-closed.

1735
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,200
Unless you're in France right now.

1736
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,980
And there's a town in France where the mayor,

1737
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,860
because they have no more room in the cemetery,

1738
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,140
They made it a crime to die.

1739
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,080
It's criminal to die.

1740
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,120
So I'm betting that that's where Bob

1741
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,240
is right now. So when you croak, they put you

1742
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,740
in jail instead of in a cemetery.

1743
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,600
Well, no, you just can't die.

1744
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,160
It's illegal. Now, what's the name of

1745
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,100
this town? I need to call my dad real

1746
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:53,380
soon.

1747
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:56,900
It's a little

1748
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,060
province, and I can't remember the name right now, but it was in

1749
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,160
the news and I remember reading about it and I

1750
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,660
passed it along to a couple of people.

1751
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,380
Death took a vacation.

1752
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,500
Death was outlawed.

1753
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,360
I'm telling you, as much

1754
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,240
as we kill Bob, I'm going to bet you

1755
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,260
that Bob's there right now. That's what I

1756
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,080
think. I think the pipe is barking into your

1757
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,200
pineal gland right there, baby. That's what's

1758
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,660
really going on there, and you're just

1759
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,220
doing as you're told.

1760
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,680
Well, did Bob keep coming back because of the

1761
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,200
stem cells that were being drawn from the

1762
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,580
stem of the pipe?

1763
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,180
Yeah, think of it. I mean, well, how could

1764
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,080
you? You know, you're having thoughts of someone else.

1765
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,700
But I mean, whoever's thinking, think of it.

1766
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,720
Well, you have to remember that

1767
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,060
as people have seen me, I don't, when I

1768
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,100
talk about Bob or Connie, I

1769
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,080
usually don't have any idea what I'm saying.

1770
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,780
See? It's like

1771
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,080
channeling. Yeah. It is channeling.

1772
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,300
Only you're channeling yourself.

1773
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,080
Yeah, you're the fish on the hook, and you're the one who

1774
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,120
baited it. And the, yeah, right, the fisherman

1775
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,100
and the fish. Yeah. And it's

1776
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,780
amazing. I get, I would

1777
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,060
get on stage at things like, and

1778
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,040
it comes out of my mouth. I don't

1779
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,160
prepare. I just let that

1780
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,000
spot, apparently, in my eyeball.

1781
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,140
Like, simultaneously

1782
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,900
being the mouth and

1783
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,180
anus of Bob. Talk about your

1784
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,380
alpha and omega. Yeah. Absolutely.

1785
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,200
That little spot in my

1786
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,160
eyeball just tells my brain what to say.

1787
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,180
What goes in must come

1788
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:18,880
out. Absolutely.

1789
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:21,080
Better out than in. Think of it,

1790
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,200
you're a perfect person then, even though you're not

1791
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,260
really in on it anymore.

1792
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,100
You know, everything that goes in does

1793
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,340
come out perfectly, and you're, you're

1794
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,280
a witness. You're a perfect witness

1795
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,160
to a perfect crime. What comes

1796
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,580
up must go down.

1797
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,060
And that's why I'm always glad that someone records

1798
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,860
stuff, because I don't know what happened.

1799
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,140
Well, it's all being recorded around you. I have to look at the foot later.

1800
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,760
You're one of the main features.

1801
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,440
Right. And all you gotta do is just, like,

1802
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,140
Well, but see,

1803
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,000
she doesn't have the thing that'll play back

1804
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,160
what her, Dob's eyeball is

1805
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,300
seeing. Right, I depend on staying

1806
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,220
for that. I wait. And then,

1807
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,080
We need to, we need to figure out where

1808
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,120
that Dob's head in your

1809
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,020
eye is transmitting to.

1810
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,260
And, uh. Besides your brain. I mean,

1811
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,320
Is it upside down? In other words,

1812
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,860
did the, uh, Dob's head

1813
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,000
kind of invert itself

1814
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,080
to where he's

1815
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,920
upside down on your eyeball? Right.

1816
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,200
No, you know, he is, he is right side

1817
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,040
up. Um, and

1818
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,060
Well, you see, that's the danger of staring

1819
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,180
at a Dob's head upside down.

1820
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,940
Yeah, it's like early

1821
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,000
telescope. You can't, you know, the squares

1822
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,180
start going into your skull. Well, this thing

1823
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,800
is probably an implantation.

1824
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,220
Like the pipe itself.

1825
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,900
Right. Uh, uh, an

1826
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,540
exist, uh, technological,

1827
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,220
uh, advanced landing, you might say,

1828
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,600
inside of Pisces

1829
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,960
retina. So,

1830
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,900
what we need to do now is

1831
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,600
trace the signal

1832
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,220
that's going from that. Right.

1833
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,320
I mean, and then we can figure out who placed

1834
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,120
the Dob's head, or what. It's a signal.

1835
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,980
Maybe we can triangulate on some distant

1836
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,020
star. It's a signal. Or

1837
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,220
nearby federal office building.

1838
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,040
I don't know. I, I, well,

1839
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,100
you know, and I, apparently it's been there since

1840
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,720
I, before I lived in D.C.

1841
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,580
I was in there when I was in Georgia.

1842
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,260
Well, that's where you picked it up then, probably.

1843
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,520
In the Cracker Woods somewhere.

1844
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:09,720
Well, you know, or...

1845
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,060
One of those guys out of deliverance jumped up and gave you your

1846
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,840
med-vain. I remember after several, two

1847
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,980
X days in a row, after both X days,

1848
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,960
I ended up having a major

1849
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,440
surgery.

1850
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,540
So, there's something going on there. That's pretty common.

1851
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,500
Yeah, that is. That does happen.

1852
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,000
But, uh, because the, I, you know, as

1853
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,080
we've suggested, some, maybe we're being

1854
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,900
ruptured up into the escape

1855
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,800
vessels of the sex goddesses.

1856
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,860
One organ at a time.

1857
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,460
Right. Or a few cells at a time.

1858
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,180
Or, you know, part of your

1859
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,420
DNA gets taken.

1860
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,360
I, I don't know. Hair.

1861
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,180
Look at Dave. Yeah, it could be like a

1862
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,920
bad, you know, like, trans... Memory. Look at hearing.

1863
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,800
...mit or what thing, like in

1864
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,320
old Star Trek. What was that? The transducer

1865
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,220
responder? You know, and it's fouling

1866
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,220
up. We don't know. It's, it's,

1867
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,180
but it clearly is like taking one or two

1868
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,080
organs at a time instead of the whole body

1869
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,680
and the whole psyche and everything at once.

1870
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,080
Well, let's see. It's taken my...

1871
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,940
They, they messed up my kidneys

1872
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,300
once and then they took my gallbladder.

1873
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,180
Did they ever take away

1874
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,300
your love? Yeah, did they

1875
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,160
go after your shoes or any other, you know, like,

1876
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,200
parts of your, you know, like, clothing that we might

1877
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,240
want to look at? Well, somebody took

1878
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,220
a corset from me at

1879
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,200
Brushwood one year. And it was

1880
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,140
a male. That was Bob. And I never

1881
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,700
have gotten it back. That was Bob.

1882
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,460
It was. It was Bob. He needs

1883
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,320
that. He took my black lace up corset.

1884
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:29,600
...to the picture that he's wearing.

1885
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,320
He has to wear that as a headdress

1886
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,340
sometimes because he is, his brain is

1887
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:37,760
literally exploding, but Stang doesn't want you to know

1888
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,440
Well, he might have needed it for some kind

1889
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,480
of Masonic treasure hunt. Now, we

1890
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,800
don't have to jump to conclusions. Yeah, well...

1891
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,920
It may have been something simple.

1892
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,420
Y'all know me. It's a big corset.

1893
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,560
I can't imagine. You would have to stuff it

1894
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,600
quite a bit. You know, uh, do you know

1895
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,500
who this is? What, what actually did

1896
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,200
the system here?

1897
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,540
You make it sound like you know who took it.

1898
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,460
There's a, like, a pot... Yeah, Bob!

1899
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,180
...or a Mooney sign or a

1900
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,500
Quark or something. Bob took it. But, you know,

1901
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,600
I don't, I, Bob's, I mean...

1902
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,680
There is a rascally raccoon

1903
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,660
out there at Brushwood that's known to steal

1904
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,680
corsets and ladies'

1905
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,560
intimates. A cross-dressing

1906
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,760
raccoon? Right. A transvestite raccoon.

1907
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,660
I mean... Well, I don't know.

1908
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,680
He may just collect them like my collection

1909
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,320
of shoes and sweaters.

1910
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,200
The Betty Paid shoes and the

1911
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,700
Hammer Film sweaters with the

1912
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,280
bloodstains? You're talking about collecting shoes.

1913
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,800
Now, if it was Kirstie Alley's

1914
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,620
corset, you'd want that, wouldn't you

1915
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,980
Stang? Kirstie Alley corset?

1916
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,640
Yeah. Actually, my friend Mr. Sister

1917
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,160
is the Kirstie Alley collector.

1918
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,600
Oh. Although,

1919
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,380
you know, she's definitely... I, I

1920
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,380
was, uh, I appreciated

1921
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,660
Kirstie Alley's

1922
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,260
um,

1923
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,440
representation in the, uh, National

1924
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,500
Enquirer, which would always make

1925
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,500
fun of her whenever she

1926
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,280
gained weight.

1927
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,240
And, uh,

1928
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,120
because she was a Scientologist, and

1929
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,100
therefore it was okay... Well, Scientologists

1930
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,100
are chubby people anyway. You know,

1931
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,160
to, to make fun of somebody who's

1932
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,200
weight, just because they're a Scientologist.

1933
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:08,860
But, uh,

1934
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,180
I actually did think she was kinda hot.

1935
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:13,780
For once...

1936
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:16,080
At every stage. At all

1937
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,340
of her stages. You know, there's

1938
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,820
there is, there's lucrative

1939
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,960
money in

1940
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,040
certain types of films

1941
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,920
involving larger women. Oh.

1942
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,980
Okay. And

1943
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,740
on that note, uh,

1944
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,160
it looks like, uh, Clark is running down

1945
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,140
here, actually. We're down to the last couple minutes

1946
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,080
of the program. Oh, that's right. We had time

1947
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,100
control this weekend.

1948
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,200
And, uh, by the way, just for the record, just for the

1949
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,960
record, uh, you know, I, I think it's high time

1950
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,020
we abolish daylight savings time.

1951
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,640
I think it's the biggest waste of time ever.

1952
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,980
I say it's time we abolish time

1953
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,280
itself. Yeah. I mean, it, it does not do

1954
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,280
what it... Well, actually, the good news is, the good news

1955
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,100
is that extra hour of daylight did help

1956
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,000
the snow melt a little better. My, my

1957
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,080
savings have already been abolished. You only

1958
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,320
think that it helped the snow melt better.

1959
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,240
We got an extra hour of daylight today

1960
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,320
so the snow could melt. Like, oh, look at this.

1961
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,060
No, no more light was created.

1962
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,920
That was a joke, man.

1963
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,240
Come on. I know you knew it was.

1964
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,180
I didn't think you felt it

1965
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,100
though, you know? Yeah. It's important.

1966
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,160
So, yeah, as, uh, as

1967
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,040
Al Ducey would say, it's getting near

1968
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,560
the hour. Alright. So, um...

1969
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,260
Have fun, kids. It was good

1970
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,180
talking to all of y'all. I, I have enjoyed talking to

1971
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,260
all of you as well. Enjoying WCF.

1972
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,180
Y'all have a good evening.

1973
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:29,960
With that, I shall take my leave. I will smell the

1974
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,700
salchow. Me as well.

1975
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,860
Hasta luego. Hasta luego a todos.

1976
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:35,980
You're on the air. Make it quick.

1977
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:38,040
Just wanna say, I thought it was a really good show tonight

1978
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,260
and, uh, Pisces is awesome.

1979
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,400
She, she, uh, is...

1980
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,040
Yeah, she's one of the best callers to the station. I mean, her

1981
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,340
stories are funny. She's really witty.

1982
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,280
She should have her own show.

1983
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:48,740
Seriously.

1984
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,000
You know, that wouldn't be, uh, half bad.

1985
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,380
That wouldn't be a bad show at all.

1986
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,160
A Pisces show. That'd be, uh...

1987
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,200
That'd be fun. Yeah, too bad for us she lives

1988
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:58,760
in Washington.

1989
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,540
Too bad for us that anyone

1990
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,200
lives in Washington.
