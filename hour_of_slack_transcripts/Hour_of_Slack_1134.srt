1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:28,820
This is your host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang, leaving Barney's Coffee Shop and Bar in Amsterdam with Dr. Hal Robbins, Princess Wee Ardo, and Governor Rottenaar, towards the last legs of the Cannabis Cup Tour, on which Dr. Hal and Rottenaar are judges, and on which Princess Wee and I are vendors, sacred vendors.

2
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,000
I could have stayed in there all night long.

3
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:42,400
You could stay in any of these coffee shops all night long, and it's been, it's taken great discipline and effort to make it from coffee shop to coffee shop.

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,680
Barney's, Barney's was the best.

5
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:55,720
Barney's had the greatest bribes of any coffee shop, and some of them, some very good froth as well, no doubt, but they gave us samples.

6
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,580
There's a car, a truck.

7
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,140
Seconds.

8
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:13,620
Well, okay, we better, since friends, we have to pay attention to finding our way home now, so that's the story here in Amsterdam for the hour of slack.

9
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:15,480
Tonight.

10
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,500
Tonight.

11
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,660
And with that Christmas song by the Children of Holland.

12
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:35,060
This is Radio Nederland returning you to The Scenic World in Hollywood.

13
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,820
Look, look, it's all dovetails.

14
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,660
It's all dovetails.

15
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,580
A sea of them.

16
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,180
A sea of dovetails.

17
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:55,080
We're standing under the overtune, friends, in a subterranean pirate radio basement station in Amsterdam, Holland.

18
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,800
Dr. Hal is here, and Princess Wee, Pope Black, and Governor Rottenaar.

19
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:08,160
And a number of other humans or subgeniuses wearing Dobbshead masks, making the whole scene look like some kind of warped twisted Fellini movie.

20
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,200
Yes, it's like living in a foreign film.

21
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,980
Everything is there except the subtitles.

22
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,280
And oh, how I miss the subtitles.

23
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,600
Which might explain to me what the hell is really going on here.

24
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,120
But of that, I remain ignorant as perhaps you too, the listener.

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,300
All we can do is have faith.

26
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,800
Yes, faith in that face of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,040
That endlessly dotted halftone or sometimes high contrast face.

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,140
If we can but seize upon that as the focus of our attention, our love, and our thoughts.

29
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:56,440
Perhaps we can be safely guided back to a place of cool music and cool speech, talking, and so forth.

30
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:06,280
But in the meantime, we're trapped here in this dungeon basement with the Church of the Subgenius.

31
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,180
Megachurch.

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,540
Sex.

33
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,020
Sex.

34
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,340
Sex.

35
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,380
The only path to salvation.

36
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,280
Megachurch.

37
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,680
Sex.

38
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,140
Sex.

39
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,480
Sex.

40
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,500
The only path to salvation.

41
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,440
Very carnal.

42
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,820
Hawk is 80 years old now.

43
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,900
And he's admitted that he slept with his brother.

44
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,500
Very carnal.

45
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,820
He slept with his brother.

46
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,340
Brother.

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,740
Br-br-br-br-br-brother.

48
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,600
Megachurch.

49
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,000
Sex.

50
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,440
Sex.

51
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,600
Sex.

52
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:24,780
Sex.

53
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,840
The only path to salvation.

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,720
Megachurch.

55
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,100
Sex.

56
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,620
Sex.

57
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:28,920
Sex.

58
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,800
The only path to salvation.

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,760
You are listening to this session because you needed slack tonight.

60
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,840
Tonight.

61
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,720
You.

62
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,040
Yourself.

63
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,140
The one listener.

64
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,720
Not those other listeners, but you.

65
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,860
The one listening now.

66
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,060
You.

67
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,760
I, we knew you needed the slack of Bob.

68
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,380
Yes, Bob.

69
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,020
It's no longer God.

70
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,420
It's you.

71
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:54,420


72
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:54,420


73
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:54,420


74
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:54,420


75
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:54,420


76
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:54,420


77
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:54,420


78
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,420
The one that we're talking about.

79
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,120
Who cares about those old fashioned Gods?

80
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,000
This is the newfangled, cool Bob from bob.com.

81
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,800
Yes, we are here to bring you what you needed.

82
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,220
Slack.

83
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,040
A respite from normality.

84
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:20,940
A break from your daily grind and perhaps a headache or two.

85
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,960
because the music here recorded in the stomach of my colleague Dr. Howe about six hours ago.

86
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,920
Bob! Bob! Bob!

87
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:37,320
Why, listen, you can hear the subgeniuses calling for their lord and master Bob,

88
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:48,420
singing praises to Bob, that ever-present smiling face tattooed inside the inner side of your eyelid

89
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,900
so that you can never stop seeing them.

90
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,640
Yes, yes, yes.

91
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:04,500
And only on Radio Patapo are the signals allowed to go out unblemished, uncoated, the pure signal.

92
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,580
There's no extra code in here, not like all the other radios that you listen to.

93
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:17,580
No, at Radio Patapo in Amsterdam you hear only the pure sounds of the angels.

94
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,220
The sound of heaven.

95
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,740
Those sirens always make me feel like I'm in the TV show The Prisoner.

96
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,100
So Bob is sort of this parody of the culture?

97
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,980
Some people call the Church of the Subgenius a joke or a parody,

98
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,900
just because our...

99
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:53,880
Our religious leader, like some others, is a patent fraud and fake.

100
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,240
But, hey, you know, where would any religion be without its fair share of hypocrisy?

101
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,320
Bob founded the world's first industrial church.

102
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:14,700
It's a church made for this modern world where you get planned obsolescence.

103
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,820
Well, we know that most religious leaders are going to get...

104
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,200
boring and tedious after a while.

105
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,760
So Bob is what he calls a short-duration personal savior.

106
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,520
We want you to buy every bit of wisdom and entertainment that Bob sells,

107
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,300
but after that you're welcome to move on to the devil or Jesus or L. Ron Hubbard or Elvis

108
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,460
or your favorite porno star.

109
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,020
Maybe your favorite comic book artist.

110
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,780
Yes, my colleague here is Dr. Howe.

111
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,660
He's the one who wrote the book, The Toast of San Francisco.

112
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,560
But of course what we bring as we go catapulting into the future is just more of the past.

113
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:04,220
Because the more the future continues, the more of the past there's going to be in it.

114
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:11,180
Until finally there will be room for no more future, but only the vast, heat-up accumulation of the past.

115
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,060
And at that time we will bring matters to a close.

116
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,160
So Tony, we're waiting.

117
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,820
First şöyle сейчас,

118
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,940
Raquel

119
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:36,980
Alors Pierce

120
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,620
I think I got you all back, guys.

121
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,740
Joining you, all right.

122
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,500
Where do you live?

123
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,400
California.

124
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,140
Do you think my future might be obsolete?

125
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,000
Is life's puzzle somewhat incomplete?

126
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,180
Have you lost anything more than just a joke?

127
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,040
If you have to ask then you will never know

128
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,360
I'm not telling you what to do

129
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,960
You wanna try out something new

130
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,140
Save our humans of today

131
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,280
Let me tell you how

132
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,600
You change now

133
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,540
You change now

134
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,600
You change now

135
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,580
Now

136
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,500
Now

137
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,620
Now

138
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,380
You change now

139
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,480
Now

140
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,760
Now

141
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,060
Now

142
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,080
You change now

143
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,740
You have that feeling that others think you're strange

144
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,600
Would you like to get even with everyone you hate?

145
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,520
Do you think that you're the one who might be next?

146
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,520
It's possible you're better than the rest

147
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,640
I'm not telling you what to do

148
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,180
Know yourself what you should do

149
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,380
Your normality starts today

150
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,020
Let me tell you how

151
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,840
You change now

152
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,840
You change now

153
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,860
You change now

154
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:26,880
Now

155
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,760
You change now

156
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,240
You change now

157
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,520
You change now

158
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:44,000
You change now

159
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,480
Thank you.

160
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,060
You're taking now.

161
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,880
You're taking now.

162
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,960
You're taking now.

163
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,860
You're taking now.

164
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,720
You're taking now.

165
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,620
Oh, yes, dear friends, Mutate Now by the band Mutate Now,

166
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,440
which happens to be our friend Reverend Scott Stanton of sickvideo.com

167
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,100
and a couple of German guys.

168
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:03,480
And you can find the video of that and much, much more of their material

169
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:11,660
from myspace.com slash mutatenow or mutatenow on YouTube and watch the video.

170
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:18,980
Oh, those people suddenly appeared in Dobbshead masks at Radio Patipo in Amsterdam,

171
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,640
which we heard some of via Lord Yeti just a little while ago.

172
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,460
And plus, we heard some miscellaneous sounds of the Frop Cup there

173
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,980
and various interviews with High Times TV and others.

174
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,940
More of that to come.

175
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:41,020
And collages by Fernandenende Limer and Norelpref.com.

176
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,640
And...

177
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,460
And more will follow, but first I must answer some questions last month

178
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,900
on the subgenius puzzling evidence show from KPFA Berkeley.

179
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,720
I think this show is a frightful, still-living human specimen of miracle of medical science.

180
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,880
When the coming era of Dobbs comes over the nation,

181
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:08,560
and if Reverend Stanton becomes the Pope of the USA,

182
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,460
what will be the separation?

183
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,340
What will be the separation of church and state?

184
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,240
Quarter inch.

185
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,700
It'll be lifted.

186
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,140
Theocracy.

187
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,620
One and fourteenth of an inch.

188
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,300
It's a theocracy.

189
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,440
When Bob is world overlord, there won't be any difference.

190
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,980
It'll be lifted and separated.

191
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,700
It's a total theocracy.

192
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,400
When Bob is world overlord.

193
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,500
Completely depend on the subjugation of all the masses

194
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,280
to make the virus pursue the appropriate course.

195
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,620
Hey, do you have any of that virus?

196
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,480
I think some of that virus are taking over.

197
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,360
When Bob is world overlord.

198
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,940
Radio show.

199
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,800
I think it's working.

200
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,820
I can't understand a word.

201
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,000
Man, that's some of the best virus you've ever heard.

202
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,080
Great wild hog that you've ever seen.

203
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,000
How and I were at the virus cup.

204
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,480
How was that?

205
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,220
How'd that go?

206
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,640
That's right.

207
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,080
I and state.

208
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,180
I mean, there's no problem.

209
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,140
Well, I told them how you graduated magna cum laude from marijuana university.

210
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,120
I was shocked that I was such an expert on marijuana.

211
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,680
I was shocked that they marked me down by four points for my allegedly frivolous answer.

212
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,800
After years of flapping, how did you find this?

213
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,980
Allegedly frivolous answer.

214
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,360
This hidden knowledge of marijuana.

215
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,520
Well, that was my question because I'm a frapper.

216
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,300
You know me.

217
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,820
Yeah, he's a frapper from way back.

218
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,880
You got your frapper abuser t-shirt on.

219
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,260
That's right.

220
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,060
Show us your diploma.

221
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,060
Here.

222
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,220
Whip it out.

223
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,820
The radio audience.

224
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,700
Oh, I forgot to bring it.

225
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,400
Which camera is it?

226
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,320
It's on camera two.

227
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,360
I have it, not him.

228
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,960
Radio audience is tuned to camera two.

229
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:33,700
I forgot to bring it.

230
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,860
I mean, she has a frapper abuser t-shirt.

231
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,040
Frapper abuser.

232
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,580
I don't have it.

233
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,920
By the way, I have the list of, you know, I have the list of, you know, I have the list

234
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,180
of winners in the Frop Cup.

235
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,080
Yeah.

236
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,900
Our Slack people already heard it.

237
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,140
And who won?

238
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,840
Was it G13 Hayes?

239
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,240
Who was the winner?

240
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,000
Super Jenkum Hayes was the number one winner.

241
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,180
Whoa.

242
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,020
That wasn't the popular favorite.

243
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:52,420
Jenkum.

244
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:52,640
Jenkum.

245
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:52,900
Jenkum.

246
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,360
Jenkum.

247
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:53,380


248
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:53,440


249
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:53,680
Jenkum.

250
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:53,820
Jenkum.

251
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,040
Jenkum.

252
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,040


253
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,100
Jenkum.

254
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:54,800
Jenkum.

255
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:55,740
Jenkum.

256
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,280
Jenkum.

257
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:56,820
Jenkum.

258
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:56,860


259
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:56,880
Jenkum.

260
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:56,980
Jenkum.

261
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:00,980
Jenkum.

262
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,180
Jenkum.

263
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,820
Jenkum.

264
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,060
Jenkum.

265
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,560
Jenkum.

266
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,180
I'm sure that was her final word.

267
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,180


268
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,180


269
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,180


270
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,180


271
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,520
Let's see.

272
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:25,240
Did she make it to half a million?

273
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,240


274
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,240


275
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,240


276
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,420
Biggest prize is when Ren first won.

277
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,040
She won.

278
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,680
Biggest prize.

279
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:27,680


280
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:27,700
Biggest prize.

281
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,580
Biggest prize for sitting in the room.

282
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,740
Okay, but what does that come for?

283
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,460
Same thing with a makeover once again.

284
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:34,900
Lame.

285
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:34,900


286
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:34,900


287
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,420
You know what I mean?

288
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,800
I mean, we didorta gets her.

289
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,500
Running over with that other idea.

290
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:38,500


291
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:46,020
But in the Cannabis Cup, there was a contestant called Princess Bob Indica.

292
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,900
For real.

293
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,540
Corn swoggle it, and we never ran into each other.

294
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,900
And I back away, and it goes away.

295
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,600
Well, that's unfortunate.

296
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,520
Although I have been communicating with Plastic Mediator.

297
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,580
Plastic Mediator was another winner in the Frop Cup.

298
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,820
That was some good stuff.

299
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,900
I had a sample of Plastic Mediator hash.

300
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,180
You did?

301
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,740
This one's got a divot.

302
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:15,720
They were giving out grams of Plastic Mediator hash at the Dobstown bar.

303
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,400
Oh, my.

304
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,940
I see.

305
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,740
I'm going to have to revise my personal chronology of recent events.

306
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,600
But it is a lot less dusty.

307
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,340
Mr. Nothinghead was a big winner.

308
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,360
Yes, I remember that.

309
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,240
And under the Lung Junk category, Death Lung Head.

310
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,900
The Death Lung Hash, which was scraped from former subgenius Chaz Smith, was the winner.

311
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,800
At that cafe, yes.

312
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,680
Death Lung Hash.

313
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,060
Yeah.

314
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,960
Lunk.

315
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,580
Death Lung Hash.

316
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,300
Lung Junk.

317
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,380
It's the game joke.

318
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:59,200
For the listeners who aren't familiar with Lunk, Lunk is the material that is scraped from the lungs of heavy smokers after they die.

319
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:06,740
You have to be in the Lunk Club, and that way your Lunk will go to the next Lunk user.

320
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,080
It's sort of like you can give your body parts, you can give your Lunk to the Lunk Club.

321
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,440
Now, what is the organic relation between Lunk and Gradoo?

322
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,860
Well, Gradoo is sort of like generic Lunk.

323
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,060
Yeah.

324
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,400
Yeah, sort of like environmental generic Lunk.

325
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,080
Could be from anywhere.

326
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,420
Right.

327
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,640
Lunk is always Gradoo, but Gradoo is not always Lunk.

328
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:25,960
Correct.

329
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,300
Correct.

330
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:32,040
And there's that mysterious substance, Glaxo, which accumulates in the navel and between the toes.

331
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,360
It's beautiful.

332
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:32,820
Yeah.

333
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,700
Don't forget.

334
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,600
It's the beginning of the show.

335
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,220
Yeah, I know.

336
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,660
That Billy Button Lent sweater.

337
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,180
That's the one we had for sale last year.

338
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,600
Now, the Billy Button Lent Lunk was another one.

339
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,240
It's a really weird spider.

340
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,160
It's what they call America.

341
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,120
That's a real...

342
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,640
I dare you to call.

343
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,080
I dare you to try to talk to us.

344
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,620
She could knit a Billy Button Lent sweater.

345
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,880
The United Snakes of Marijuana.

346
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,260
It's beautiful.

347
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,580
It looks like a tail.

348
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,880
A potato?

349
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,740
Oh, no.

350
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,120
The Billy Button Lent sweater was real popular last year.

351
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,340
Your daughter is a psychopath.

352
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,060
Since time began...

353
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,320
She is on the verge of insanity.

354
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,980
Out of the slime and darkness.

355
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,240
And I strongly believe she has been symbolic.

356
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,400
Oh, isn't that good?

357
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,980
Murdered by marijuana.

358
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,000
Murderers.

359
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,140
No.

360
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,800
If you break, a white fluid oozes out.

361
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,460
Use your eyes.

362
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,200
Marijuana and hashish.

363
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,880
Joints.

364
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,260
Roach.

365
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,200
Joint.

366
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,420
Scorched, irregularly burned butt.

367
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,740
As a matter of fact, hard narcotic addiction.

368
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,880
Oh, no.

369
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,220
It frightened me.

370
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,380
The story you are about to hear is...

371
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,060
The subgenius.

372
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,580
Power of Swatch.

373
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,880
To protect the cigarettes.

374
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,820
Long cigarettes.

375
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:03,100
Long cigarettes.

376
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,240
Hello?

377
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,940
This is Longhead.

378
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,500
Who?

379
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,540
Longhead.

380
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:09,840
Oh.

381
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,140
Oh.

382
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,420
I see.

383
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,460
Come early and we'll have cots together.

384
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,740
Oh, boy.

385
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,180
Yo, yo.

386
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,160
And death.

387
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,440
Another cup?

388
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:19,960
No, thanks.

389
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,480
I've had enough.

390
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:20,880
Why?

391
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,560
I ought to have more sense into paying the attention to cranks.

392
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:23,940
Why?

393
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,580
Because they're the kind of woman who comes with a crate.

394
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:26,960
Oh.

395
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,340
I feel more at home wrapped up with pretty ribbons.

396
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,420
It's rather daring for me.

397
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,700
But if it pleases you, that's all that matters.

398
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,480
Oh, talk about that later.

399
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,180
Oh, no.

400
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,700
Hey, Philo, can you squeeze the juice out of this thing right here?

401
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,780
Yeah, here, let me bend over.

402
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,880
Bend over, okay.

403
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,560
Boys, boys, boys.

404
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,100
Your youthful pranks will be the death of you.

405
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,200
It looks like tapioca.

406
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,900
It was supposed to be tap water.

407
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,760
Now I think it's time to tap into a different stream.

408
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,520
It's lunk.

409
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,660
It's, yeah, just some lunk.

410
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,120
It's the gradu covered drain at the bottom of the shower.

411
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,560
If you put your bare feet there, you'll be dead in an hour.

412
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,240
You put your bare feet in the lunk?

413
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:08,660
Right here?

414
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,320
Hello?

415
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,100
Is there a relation between gradu and sludge?

416
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,340
Oh, yeah.

417
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,880
Is sludge strictly like the antithesis of silence?

418
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,800
Speak not to me of sludge.

419
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,720
I only got like 30 seconds.

420
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,440
30 seconds to...

421
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,580
Are you familiar with the colloquial euphemism moss-headed lunker?

422
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,920
Of course.

423
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,440
That's my favorite fish.

424
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,840
Yeah, the old moss-headed lunker at the bottom of the pond.

425
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,360
That's the biggest fish in the pond.

426
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,940
Why, that's the one they make the ghost meat fish out of.

427
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,100
Yeah, the old moss-headed lunker is a mighty fancy.

428
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,600
Fish meat.

429
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,260
But he's hard to catch.

430
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,460
Because when he sees you coming, he burrows down into the mud.

431
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,980
Where's that lunker sound coming from?

432
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,420
It looks just like a hill of mud.

433
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,600
Yeah, but I use a yo-yo for me.

434
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:00,020
Yo, yo, I'm trying to talk to you about that old moss-headed lunker down there at the bottom

435
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,040
of the pond.

436
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,720
Let's just clear the air.

437
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,200
So friendly.

438
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,740
He's your best friend.

439
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,500
He likes you.

440
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,340
In the nice, deep water.

441
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,260
Drifting silence of the pond.

442
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:08,600
Lunker fish.

443
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,500
Scrape this.

444
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:10,900
Scrape it.

445
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,520
You scrape him.

446
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,580
Beams of light come down through the water.

447
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:13,800
Scrape him so fast.

448
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,360
Scrape him good.

449
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,060
You rub him between two sticks until the fish actually catches on fire.

450
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,900
Claw dad goes by.

451
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,800
And cooks itself.

452
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,080
Friendly crocodile.

453
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,520
Right.

454
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,140
You have to rub him really fast.

455
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,720
Unfortunately, this same idyllic pond also harbors toxic slugs.

456
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,480
And red tide.

457
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,140
Here he goes again.

458
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,700
Because everything you say on the radio comes straight out of my nose.

459
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,060
Once free, get on your feet.

460
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,240
My head just said slugs.

461
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,320
But everything smells like feet.

462
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:36,660
It's all over.

463
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,380
All over in Central California filled up with slugs.

464
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,460
They'll give you a hideous disease.

465
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,240
Oh!

466
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:43,820
Oh!

467
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,540
That's no way to treat the show.

468
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,480
Oh!

469
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,720
Oh!

470
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,000
That's not right.

471
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,100
Don't swing that lunk like that.

472
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,840
Steam clean.

473
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,680
Now that's the bucket of lunk, not the bucket of anal fissure tissue.

474
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,000
Tough bugs, man.

475
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,520
What is the type of that lunk head talking coming from?

476
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,800
The lunk head?

477
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,340
Yeah.

478
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:05,860
You must find a cop.

479
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,320
In the back of the car.

480
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,320


481
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,320


482
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,320


483
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,320


484
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,320


485
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,320


486
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,320


487
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,320


488
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,620
The lunk head.

489
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,660
The lunk head.

490
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,040
Oh, I see.

491
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,560
Oh, it's the lunk heads in the other booth.

492
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,460
That's a beloved radio personality.

493
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,620
Art Lunkheader.

494
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,540
The ones that are shooting.

495
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,320
They're sending us obscene gestures.

496
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,840
At the speed of light.

497
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,780
Gang signs, man.

498
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,740
And it's competitive, man.

499
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,800
It's competitive obscene gestures.

500
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,180
It's highly compressed video signal coming through.

501
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,560
Well, he's got his obscene gesture embedded with riding instruments.

502
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,320
That's why they took Art Lunkheader off the air back in 1689.

503
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,320


504
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,320


505
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,320


506
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,320


507
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,320


508
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,320


509
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,900
Oh, wow.

510
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:36,900


511
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,500
Hock up a lunger there.

512
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,140
His daughter was a tragic lunk head, wasn't she, Diane Lunkheader?

513
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,800
Yes, she was a pole dancer who plummeted to oblivion after a series of failed fessings.

514
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,820
Now, do you think that lunker and lunger have the same root word origin?

515
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,500
Yeah, lung.

516
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,200
Well, then the root seller.

517
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,880
Oh, yeah.

518
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,380
Hey, you guys want to go out and share?

519
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,080
I say I'm some glam cop dancer tonight.

520
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,900
Don't throw the answers tonight.

521
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,960
Where do we go?

522
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,960
I'm a glam cop dancer.

523
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,740
I noticed their similarity.

524
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,260
I thought we just did that.

525
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,200
And their familiarity.

526
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,300
I thought we...

527
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,480
Don't go on the show.

528
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,300
I thought we...

529
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,360
Don't look in the basement.

530
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,600
All right, we're not on the show now.

531
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,640
Don't go in the...

532
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,680
We're hiding in the back room of the show.

533
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,620
Don't open the door.

534
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,220
Okay, bend down.

535
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:14,720
Get under that desk.

536
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,220
He knows you're on the way.

537
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,640
Let's get under that desk.

538
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,120
Shouldn't play with...

539
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,600
Don't call Palmer up right now and wake him up.

540
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,980
Don't slew any room.

541
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,300
Okay, now, Gary, you get back over there under that desk.

542
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,440
Whatever happened to me?

543
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,960
We're all under the desk together now.

544
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,160
Whatever happened to Palmer?

545
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,320
Okay, when the next caller shows up, we'll all jump out.

546
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,260
And surprise him.

547
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,280
Okay, okay.

548
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,380
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

549
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:34,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

550
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,580
Okay, okay, okay.

551
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,500
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

552
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,140
Here he comes.

553
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,200
Okay, here's the caller.

554
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,260
I'm going to reboot the Michael Pepe.

555
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:40,580
Ow!

556
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,460
Hey, no, Michael Pepe, not me.

557
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,220
848-4425.

558
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:44,940
That's not the caller.

559
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,760
Okay, gentlemen, this is the cusp of a historic occasion.

560
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,740
Okay, here we go.

561
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,940
Let us set our teeth and march forward.

562
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,320
So the caller forgot that that was their cue.

563
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,220
Yeah, caller, you failed us.

564
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,600
You failed us once again.

565
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,000
You failed your country, your nation, and your God.

566
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,560
You know, this would be a great show up.

567
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:05,560


568
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,200
But one for all these really poor callers that we get.

569
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,980
This I've got to hear.

570
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:17,200
Stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner,

571
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,640
stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner.

572
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:19,820
Cool.

573
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,380
That is as it should be.

574
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,340
I was drunk.

575
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,460
We're selling a different drug, baby.

576
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:27,860
Exactly.

577
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,000
It's a healthy drug.

578
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,480
Yeah.

579
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,000
Slag.

580
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,740
With Bob.

581
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,180
Slag.

582
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,480
With Bob, you don't need a lighter.

583
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,000
Nope.

584
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,320
You don't need a fancy glass.

585
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:35,700
You don't need a pipe.

586
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,860
No, sir.

587
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,320
With Bob?

588
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,760
Well, actually, you do need a pipe.

589
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,540
And a lighter, I guess.

590
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,200
You definitely need a pipe.

591
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,280
And, of course, a lighter.

592
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,200
You don't want to be totally lean.

593
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,680
Yeah, I guess you do need a lighter.

594
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,760
But it can't be a bubble pipe.

595
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,240
And it's not actually that healthy.

596
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,140
A pipe made out of chocolate, maybe?

597
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,180
It's not actually really healthy.

598
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,600
And you can't say it's not a habit for him, either.

599
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,460
But it's an alternative.

600
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,800
It's an alternative pipe, baby.

601
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,240
You can get really out there on Bob.

602
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,800
Never, ever come down.

603
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,560
But, friends, I'm Bob.

604
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:05,560


605
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:05,560


606
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:05,560


607
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:05,560


608
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:05,560


609
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,780
And, friends, don't use Bob as a crutch.

610
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,920
This isn't the crutch of the subgenius.

611
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:18,620
You let him use you as a crutch.

612
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,080
Let Bob lean on you.

613
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,980
Possibly financially.

614
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,400
It's the greatest thing a person can do is to fund Bob's great adventure.

615
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,100
Let Bob...

616
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,900
You be Bob's crutch.

617
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,840
And, friend, if you really...

618
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,540
If you really want to be Bob's crutch, you can be Bob's crutch.

619
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:41,720
If you really want to get into Bob, want to know what's inside his head, let Bob smoke.

620
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,980
Friends, really, I mean, you can throw yourself into that pipe.

621
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,640
And then maybe you'll be the molecule that goes into his brain and gives him that next

622
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,400
great idea.

623
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:05,540
Now, just recently, somebody on alt-slack, a subgenius forum, was talking about this.

624
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:05,540


625
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:05,540


626
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,120
And they were saying, what is Bob smoking in that pipe?

627
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,860
Is that marijuana?

628
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,100
I'll bet it is.

629
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,700
420.

630
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,380
Well, actually, friends, what's inside Bob's pipe is the same thing that's inside Bob's

631
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:18,620
head.

632
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,820
As New Monet put it, what's inside Bob's head...

633
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,440
I have to read this, because this is a new revelation.

634
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,920
Some of you old timers haven't heard this.

635
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,780
What's in Bob's pipe and inside his head is the multiverse, the antiverse.

636
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:42,220
The diviverse, the negaverse, the demiverse, the klasiverse, the periverse, the division-by-zeroverse,

637
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:50,140
the square root of negative one verse, the averse, the roboverse, the hitlerverse, the

638
00:25:50,140 --> 00:26:02,980
nocverse, the gayverse, the pooverse, perverse, the quantumverses, the hootervearse, the claymationverse,

639
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,760
the monsterverse, antivirus.

640
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:04,760


641
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:12,040
hyperspace, hypospace, overspace, underspace, throughspace, wormholes, beetleholes, blackholes,

642
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:18,800
buttholes, blackwhores, patrizemi, verschluggener, and trace amounts of halva.

643
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,020
And also the Alamo.

644
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,200
Yes, the Alamo is inside Bob's head.

645
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,820
Bob?

646
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,900
By gobs, that man is crazy. Are you Mangy Old Scorpion? By gobs.

647
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,360
The subgenius power of SWAT.

648
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,580
Uh oh, what happened?

649
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,180
We got super dead air.

650
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,460
Hey, pause! Dead air!

651
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,840
This past 10 minutes of dead air has been brought to you by the First Church and the Last Laugh,

652
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,580
the world's fastest growing snack religion, 150% less dogma, it's a light religion.

653
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:40,020
One holy day year today, isn't it? But April 1st will be the 30th annual St. Stupid's Day parade.

654
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,200
So get ready for it, and we'll see you at the Embarcadero Plaza, Monday, April 1st at noon.

655
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,340
And now back to our regularly scheduled program.

656
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,600
Dead air is really not dead. It has things in it.

657
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,800
Living things are not actually dead things.

658
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,620
Is this the bathroom?

659
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,480
This is the bathroom.

660
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,660
Ten minutes of complete silence.

661
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,620
Ten minutes of complete silence.

662
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:15,200
In honor of silence from which all sound comes from, we have to give homage to that silence.

663
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,980
I can't believe that.

664
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,660
Just like giving homage to that stupidity.

665
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,820
How about Philip Glass and his famous silent song?

666
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,660
The multi-talking guy show.

667
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,280
Just a cascade of voices.

668
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,040
Finally, there's going to be a girl on the show.

669
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:30,880
Bop, bop.

670
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,080
A tower for hell Nazis.

671
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,380
Yeah, a tower. It could be a tower for some.

672
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,140
For others, it's just an opposite end of the question.

673
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,520
If only the hell Nazis would stay in their tower.

674
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,820
But no, they have to leave and come out and afflict the rest of us.

675
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,780
And their telephone networks like nothing you've ever seen.

676
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:57,020
That way, that telephone networks is phenomenal, if not criminal.

677
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,640
Telephone networks.

678
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,300
Yeah, telephone networks every time.

679
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,800
The net covers essentially everyone.

680
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,760
So are you saying that the show actually had a silent part?

681
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,100
Asylum from what?

682
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,740
The point was there was no sound coming out of the speakers.

683
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,680
But the First Church of the Last Left bought that silence.

684
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,140
We paid for that silence.

685
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,220
Thank you. Thank you.

686
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,880
The payment for a silent part.

687
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,420
Was there a sound or was it like...

688
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,680
It was a sound or unsound mind.

689
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,020
It's available. This silence is for rent.

690
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,080
I mean, you can plug in anything you want.

691
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,300
You can put signage in there.

692
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,260
Once we get it on tape, one of Doug's cassette tapes, it goes on there.

693
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,400
Yeah, one tape.

694
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,940
Could we mix some of the silence in with the show that's going on now?

695
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,120
We could divvy it up. Everybody could take some home with them.

696
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,200
Can we use an 8-track tape?

697
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,660
No, I mean, can we use it right now?

698
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,720
That's a good idea. Squirt some of that silence in there.

699
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:53,340
...will set the Mormon Church over all America and over all the world, for it is written in...

700
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,260
Written anymore.

701
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,080
That was the silence part.

702
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,520
That was good. That was good.

703
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,540
That was kind of an acoustic hook for the Michael Peppery.

704
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,460
That's just a test, right? A test of the silent radio network.

705
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,400
This has just been a test.

706
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,340
You would have heard the following message.

707
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,340
Michael Peppery's stakeout.

708
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,360
The sounds that you did hear were very unimpressive.

709
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,880
...if I dare you to talk to us.

710
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,980
What's there to be afraid of?

711
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,100
Oh, you know what? I forgot about this.

712
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:26,700
A guy from Ontario emailed KPFA and said,

713
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:32,560
I listen to the show all the time, I like the show, but the guy says the number too fast.

714
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,400
And I can never call up.

715
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,260
Well, in that case, you...

716
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,120
Listener censored radio.

717
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,320
Oh, bro.

718
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:44,240
And one of the general managers of the show sent, shot me the email and...

719
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,980
All right, let's give out that number.

720
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,380
One of the general managers. Have you ever noticed in this station how this...

721
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,180
We have more general managers than employees.

722
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,200
You know how many colonel managers there are? 16.

723
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,860
And there's like 24 generals, 16 colonels.

724
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,560
And it's all I can do to manage my privates.

725
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,380
And then there's just us privates.

726
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,600
580 of us little private managers.

727
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,840
I got my privates...

728
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,400
Managed.

729
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,240
...hidden. Hidden away.

730
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,140
And it's about time. Nobody wants to see it, believe me.

731
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,560
No, I don't even want to see it.

732
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,200
Too late.

733
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,960
Well, here, pick this. Pick on this...

734
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,580
Why are you giving me this magnifying glass?

735
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,900
Well, you know, it's all relative. It depends on where you stand.

736
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:29,980
Rob. Rob.

737
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,000
New or

738
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,060
Plagued.

739
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,060
Cold.

740
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,900
You're so happy you could die

741
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,540
And at the same time terrified

742
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,900
So much distraction, you're confused

743
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,120
You end up laughing at the truth

744
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,100
Stupid is cool

745
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,200
You sit in front of your TV

746
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,420
At least there's something to believe

747
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,400
That's taking time bomb on command

748
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,520
You do the goose step on demand

749
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,640
Stupid is cool

750
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,720
Stupid is cool

751
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,100
Stupid is cool

752
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,660
Stupid is cool

753
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,080
You're so cool

754
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:56,180
You wanna be all you can be

755
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,120
You are so eager to agree

756
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,080
That slogan's on the line

757
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,760
And it's mirror how you feel

758
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,460
The lowest passions are ideals

759
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,400
Stupid is cool

760
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,460
Stupid is cool

761
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,540
Stupid is cool

762
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,540
Stupid is cool

763
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,960
You're so cool

764
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,120
You're so cool

765
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,220
You're so cool

766
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,040
You're so cool

767
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,100
You're so cool

768
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,300
You're so cool

769
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,920
You're so cool You're so cool

770
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:45,920
You're so cool, you're so cool, you're so cool, you're so cool, you're so cool, you're

771
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,080
so cool, you're so cool, you're so cool.

772
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,980
Stupid is Cool from the video by Mutate Now.

773
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,040
And what a great old new cult that is, friends.

774
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:11,560
You can see that video with links at sickvideo.com or Mutate Now on YouTube or MySpace.

775
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:17,300
And before that, friends, we heard some puzzling evidence with Dr. Philodrumon, Dr. Howe, Bishop

776
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:23,260
Choey, Michael Pepe, and puzzling evidence and yours truly and other people, and Leemur,

777
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:30,820
and Norell, Preff, and some ranting from the Baltimore Devival by yours truly, Reverend

778
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,480
Ivan Stang.

779
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,020
And now back to Berkshire.

780
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:51,900
Dr. Hal and I got in trouble on John Sinclair's radio show for talking of extra meditation.

781
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,760
Yeah, yeah, he didn't think that was cool.

782
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,300
Oh, did we do that?

783
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,260
This was the guy with the MC5, dude.

784
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,800
The guy John Lennon wrote a song about.

785
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,900
And he said extra meditation was, and it was on Radio Free Amsterdam.

786
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:13,440
But were we free to discuss the right of extra meditation?

787
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,560
No.

788
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,880
The right to extra meditation and the right of it.

789
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,600
It's an inane.

790
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,000
Nay.

791
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,020
Nay, on radio.

792
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,620
It's not Radio Free Amsterdam.

793
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,940
It must be Radio Anti-Bob Amsterdam.

794
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,300
Well, it certainly wasn't our show.

795
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,260
Don't forget our God-given right to pyroflatulation.

796
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,500
Well, now, Philo, you've got to go in steps.

797
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:32,980
You can't.

798
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,260
You can't expect the people to be that liberal.

799
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,980
Yeah, they're still putting water on their...

800
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,800
You must move by income.

801
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,540
They're like dripping water or walking through the water.

802
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,020
They're waterboarding us.

803
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,880
Here's Reverend Stang.

804
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,280
Oh, man.

805
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
My pleasure.

806
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,520
This is my colleague, Dr. Hal.

807
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,300
Dr. Hal Robbins from San Francisco.

808
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,580
These two guys will be coming in to do some time on the radio show during the college on Tuesday.

809
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,240
I hope so.

810
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,040
Looking forward to it.

811
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:10,680
And they actually both have been involved in radio broadcasts for the last 25 years, I'm afraid.

812
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,620
Yeah, I get it.

813
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,700
East Coast, West Coast.

814
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,960
So we'll come wandering by at some point, I guess, probably Tuesday.

815
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:17,700
Yeah.

816
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,080
Whenever you feel free.

817
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:21,740
Great.

818
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,780
That's hard to do, actually.

819
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,920
Reverend Stang.

820
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,460
That's me, Price Bob.

821
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,060
Reverend Stang.

822
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,840
Father, am I correct?

823
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,420
No, actually, I'm just one of the head clerks.

824
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:44,480
Yeah, J.R. Bob Dobbs is the high E-pop and guru.

825
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,220
He's that smiling, be-piped face that you see.

826
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,040
Bob.

827
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,580
Yeah.

828
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,260
We call it the Dobbs head.

829
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,420
The Dobbs.

830
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,480
Yes, my colleague here is Dr. Hal Robbins.

831
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,240
Dr. Hal.

832
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,360
Master of church secrets from San Francisco.

833
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,540
I do a very fine doctor myself.

834
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,820
Well, I'm envious at how well you do.

835
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,940
What a great job.

836
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,420
There's no envious side of everybody.

837
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,080
No, one of the seven deadly sins.

838
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,180
The seven affronts.

839
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:22,380
Well, you know, we came to Amsterdam to preach Bob's word of slack,

840
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,500
but we found that we were preaching to the saved.

841
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,320
Everybody here already has slack.

842
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,060
Bob's like pure white.

843
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,180
Right, so our job is done.

844
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,560
We're just relaxing now.

845
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,520
That's why we're going to preach to the Holy Joseph.

846
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:42,460
The Joseph, Daddy of Jesus, is a highly placed reverend in the church.

847
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,960
Actually, he's more like what we would call a saint.

848
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,720
A saint?

849
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,120
Yeah, he's a saint.

850
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,860
God damn, I thought he was a saint.

851
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,520
Yeah.

852
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,100
I'm a saint.

853
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,440
Well, wasn't one of the popes of Europe in here earlier, Pope Black?

854
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,420
Pope Black, yeah, he was on our show.

855
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,940
He is a provisional.

856
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,200
Provisionary pope.

857
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:10,780
Right, currently a little Spanish dog that lives in Germany has more authority,

858
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,080
more papal authority than Pope Black.

859
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,680
What about the papal bull?

860
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,180
We've got a ton of that.

861
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,640
We've got a load of papal bull.

862
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,640
In fact, you've got to watch where you step in Dobstown.

863
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,280
Yes.

864
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,680
Well, wherever you smell that bull, look around and you'll find Bob nearby.

865
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,100
Or at least one of his menace.

866
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,220
Well, it's a lot of, theottle's shoulders would smell like that

867
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,660
Orinella won't những and don't speak like Bob like anyone else.

868
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,640
Yeah, I'll say I've seen a lot of the papal bull as the Priests.

869
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:52,620
I had them最初 charted into aviation club Judas Rebels of our church in my family in Jerusalem.

870
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,280
Two years ago.

871
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,000
Two years ago.

872
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,120
I was talking to the priest Paul Finley.

873
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,060
And we hung out at the Cannabis Cup Expo for a little while.

874
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,860
I had never been to one of those before,

875
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,920
and I was gratified to see that it was just like I expected.

876
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,280
Yeah, yeah, just like the picture.

877
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:13,800
Yeah.

878
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,660
You will thirst for slack, and you must receive slack.

879
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,420
Right, the subgenius must have slack.

880
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,920
That doesn't mean that you must go out and get slack.

881
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,480
That means you must already have had it in order to even be a subgenius.

882
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,480
It may be misplaced, or maybe you haven't appreciated the slack that you already had.

883
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,740
Some people, it takes them a while to learn.

884
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:48,200
The slack lies in the simple things oftentimes, like extra meditation, a daily act.

885
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,380
That's a sacred rite.

886
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,080
The silence of the extra meditation chamber.

887
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,340
Anyway, no one would interrupt anyone during that.

888
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,080
That's a particular solemn morning rite.

889
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,460
Yes, that's true.

890
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,200
Bob?

891
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:06,980
Bob?

892
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,620
You're a part of every boy and girl's body, right?

893
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,020
Yes, yes, the doctor took me out.

894
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,420
Bone.

895
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:13,880
Bone.

896
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,720
Tuck, tuck, tuck.

897
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,040
Right at the beginning of your large butt.

898
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,540
Okay.

899
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,840
Well, I look like a narrow, pinkish-gray tube.

900
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,820
How big or small are you?

901
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,620
I'm a half inch wide and two inches long.

902
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,080
Yes, yes, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

903
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:28,620
That's right.

904
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,800
Right, Bob.

905
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,280
Bob.

906
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,360
Bob.

907
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:30,460


908
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,160
Doctor, since I was a very useful organ, I have no real purpose.

909
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:35,940
I see.

910
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,220
Bob.

911
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,440
Scientist, Bob.

912
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,760
Scientist, scientist.

913
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,500
Bob, Bob.

914
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,080
Over and over and over again.

915
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:41,740
Hey, that's right.

916
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,420
Once the boys and girls get into my body again.

917
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,900
Oh, definitely, Uncle Bob.

918
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:46,860
Bob, Bob.

919
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,520
Mother.

920
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,080
Mother.

921
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,780
Asshole.

922
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,280
Asshole.

923
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,120
You mean nowhere.

924
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,040
It's waste.

925
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:51,540
Correct.

926
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,260
Bob, Bob.

927
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,160
Zuper duper.

928
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,640
That was noralpref.com.

929
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,660
And more torture now.

930
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,300
On Puzzling Evidence.

931
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,040
They're waterboarding us.

932
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,380
Well, it's because I say waterboard the crap out of them.

933
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,000
The little Dutch boy took his finger out of the dike and has gone to a coffee shop.

934
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,300
He's at the dump cream.

935
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,280
That's sampling the place of love.

936
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,920
That's the newest fad.

937
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,660
People are waterboarding themselves.

938
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,180
I'm going to waterboard the dike.

939
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:21,740
You know that story.

940
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,360
Every schoolboy knows that tale.

941
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,000
It's a bummer.

942
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,740
I'm going to waterboard that little falls.

943
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,700
Do schoolboys still know the tale?

944
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,300
That's a little.

945
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,080
Little Dutch boy.

946
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,920
I'm going to waterboard Tilton Park.

947
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,940
I'm not sure that it's valuable for them to learn that lesson except as part of cultural studies.

948
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,940
Because, in fact, the story is completely bogus and not even Dutch in origin.

949
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,260
And there was no waterboard?

950
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,580
There was no dike, no finger, no little Dutch kid.

951
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,440
Oh, yeah.

952
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,560
What do you call this?

953
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,240
No airplane.

954
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,580
It was, in fact, made up by an American.

955
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:59,060
Still, so many people think it's happened that even the Dutch government can't react against it.

956
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,180
So, there's been.

957
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,900
A cover-up.

958
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,400
They've erected a statue of the little Dutch boy and so forth.

959
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,340
Another cover-up.

960
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,320
It's bogus.

961
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,060
That's because people expect to see it.

962
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,760
Well, I knew it was bogus, but I thought that it was Dutch.

963
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,960
No, you're going to tell me that the Dutch boy paint.

964
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,020
Dutch boy paint's logo is bogus, too, right?

965
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,860
Oh, it's really painted on there.

966
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,820
Well, if that's bogus, then what about Bob Dobbs?

967
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,600
What about the whole church of the sub-church?

968
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,500
What about Sherwin-Levitt?

969
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,360
That's a little Dutch boy.

970
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:24,920
He's alive.

971
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,060
Calm down.

972
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,080
Couldn't Bob be alive?

973
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:27,720
Gentlemen.

974
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,120
Gentlemen.

975
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,640
Order.

976
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,680
Order.

977
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:29,800
Order.

978
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,100
Order.

979
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:30,280
Order.

980
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,280


981
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,280


982
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,280


983
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,000
William's paint, it doesn't cover the world.

984
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,500
What a comedy.

985
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,640
What a comedy.

986
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,360
I thought it covered the world.

987
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,060
Oh, that cannot be.

988
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,840
I do not want to live in a world where there is no Bob Dobbs.

989
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,140
I thought we were in a world covered by paint.

990
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,440
I'm going to explain the problem.

991
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,300
I saw the logo.

992
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,520
I'm having a crisis.

993
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,820
For Bob is to be praised.

994
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,700
Praise Bob.

995
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,980
The facts surrounding Bob are incontrovertible.

996
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,880
There is no doubt of the existence of Bob or his stories in this world.

997
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,160
But other religions.

998
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,200
Are highly felt.

999
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,280
And their premises can be examined.

1000
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,220
Praise his sweet name.

1001
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,180
They are going to be silenced.

1002
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:05,640
Right this far.

1003
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,320
Bob is fire.

1004
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,520
Bob is ice.

1005
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,080
Bob does not have body life.

1006
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,240
This guy is doing the real show.

1007
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,560
Praise God.

1008
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,440
He's doing the Bob show.

1009
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,780
We don't have to do anything.

1010
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,740
We can just relax.

1011
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,000
He's been doing it quietly in his room all over the years.

1012
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,140
That's like an ancient Glass Madness song from the 19...

1013
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:22,360
Me too.

1014
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,160
Yes, he's quoting the classics.

1015
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,880
I just spoke to that fellow three days ago.

1016
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,300
Just me.

1017
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:27,860
Just me.

1018
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,140
Yes, all these Johnny come late nights.

1019
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:30,260
I'm going to have to go to the bathroom.

1020
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:30,260


1021
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:30,260


1022
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,260
Can I?

1023
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:42,440
This capi lovers.

1024
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:42,440


1025
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:42,440


1026
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:42,440


1027
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:42,440


1028
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:42,440


1029
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:42,440


1030
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:42,440


1031
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:42,440


1032
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:42,440


1033
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:42,440


1034
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,020
Goodbye.

1035
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:43,580


1036
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:43,580


1037
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,240
Bye boxing.

1038
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,240


1039
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,240


1040
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,240


1041
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:44,400


1042
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:44,400


1043
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,520
Go making a gro testified postエним you'll see reduce the number of children staying

1044
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:49,520


1045
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,560
All alone.

1046
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:58,920
I apply partly to a single loved attire.

1047
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,240
I am sorry.

1048
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:09,120
Glass Madness did that, and now Dr. Howell in Amsterdam,

1049
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,180
ranting at the Akhnaton subgenius devival.

1050
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:19,280
Of course, fellow lotus eaters and traversers of Demimonde,

1051
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,940
it's great to smoke all this marijuana,

1052
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,300
and frock is one of the many hundreds of synonyms for marijuana.

1053
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:33,460
But frock in subgenius theology classically means a special herb known as Hapifroxipulops,

1054
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:40,520
frock for short, which only grows on the selected droppings of certain Tibetan holy men

1055
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,300
in that country's mysterious mountain fastness.

1056
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:50,200
But metaphorically, we call cannabis and sensimia frock also,

1057
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:56,560
because it certainly has some of the same effects, providing slack on the man.

1058
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,880
Oh, remember, slack is not tension, slack is leisure,

1059
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,580
and only in leisure can anything worthwhile be created.

1060
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:09,240
But false slack? You may think you want to conspiracy these products.

1061
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,580
They will dangle before you every latest glittering tchotchke,

1062
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,220
every iPod, Palm Pilot, and so forth.

1063
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:21,200
I say, if thy iPod of empty, pluck it out,

1064
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:26,560
because you will find that the moment you have this object of your desire,

1065
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:31,140
it will fail to satisfy, and instead, your thirst, your lust,

1066
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,100
will be transferred to the next expensive item,

1067
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,500
which in all probability will be manufactured by the phone company,

1068
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:42,680
which history will show will be the greatest instrument of tyranny ever leveraged

1069
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,640
against the weak flesh and spirit of a faltering humankind.

1070
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,000
It makes me hungry.

1071
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,500
Here comes that big silence.

1072
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,520
First church in the last lap is going to buy another chunk of silence.

1073
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,820
No, puzzling evidence has left his post.

1074
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,580
Very true.

1075
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,280
The show is...

1076
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,060
It's careening out of control.

1077
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:58,820
The show's out of control.

1078
00:45:58,900 --> 00:45:59,480
There's no driver.

1079
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:00,600
Dead air everywhere.

1080
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:01,520
Lean this way.

1081
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,440
No, lean this way.

1082
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:08,640
Normally, you see, friends, puzzling evidence conducts the show like a master conductor.

1083
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,120
All of this, what sounds to you like chaos,

1084
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,500
is actually carefully planned and controlled by puzzling evidence.

1085
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,720
But Bishop Joey is right.

1086
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,360
Control board.

1087
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,400
We can lean on this side of the show,

1088
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,160
and then we can run over to that side of the show real quick and make the show turn.

1089
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:23,580
Yeah.

1090
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,640
All right, now back to the way.

1091
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,620
Yeah, back to the way.

1092
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,100
Yeah.

1093
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,020
Oh, the show is careening again.

1094
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,980
Oh, God, this is making me sick.

1095
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:30,800
Come on, call it.

1096
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,140
Get aboard.

1097
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,940
Yeah, this is what we were talking about earlier.

1098
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,540
This is where the nausea action sets in.

1099
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:35,720
What's that?

1100
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,400
Chunky stuff on the floor?

1101
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:37,980
Sick.

1102
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:38,440
Caller.

1103
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,820
You're on the show, and you have to leave early and go home.

1104
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,380
Oh, I was hoping it was a camera.

1105
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,680
You wish you could stay, but you're nauseous.

1106
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,160
Oh, God, if I'm...

1107
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:45,640
It's either you're going to hurl...

1108
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,960
I could use a plate of ambergris right now.

1109
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,120
You're going to hurl, or you're going to...

1110
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,580
Steam and heap and take.

1111
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,140
Listen, do the...

1112
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,740
Okay, nobody go to that side of the show.

1113
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,080
Okay, don't go to that.

1114
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,660
If you go to that side, there's like a puddle of something that you might step in.

1115
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,860
Filo butter, if you ask me.

1116
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,320
Don't step in that in your good shoes, people.

1117
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,540
Okay, puzzling is back.

1118
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,620
Don't tell anybody on this seat.

1119
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,600
Pretend we're not here.

1120
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,600
Everybody start talking.

1121
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,420
Is it okay?

1122
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,300
Do you want to hear a praise ball?

1123
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,340
Praise ball!

1124
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,400
I can hear you.

1125
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:16,900
Praise ball!

1126
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,800
Hallelujah, amen.

1127
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,200
Now, brothers and sisters,

1128
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,080
tonight's sermon is going to be a very short one.

1129
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,340
But a very clear one.

1130
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,420
Because there are two things I'm going to preach about tonight.

1131
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,140
And that's slack and work.

1132
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:41,060
Now, how many of you out there have a job and actually have to work for a living?

1133
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,780
Come on, put your hands up.

1134
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,900
How many of you got to work?

1135
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,940
Now, the conspiracy invented work billions of years ago.

1136
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:56,080
Before man had to work, we lived in a bonobo-like paradise.

1137
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,460
Where drugs grew on trees like berries.

1138
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:04,940
And bubbly brooks frothed from the ground with the best beer and wine.

1139
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,780
And no one had to work.

1140
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,440
And no one needed food or drink or had to pay for a thing.

1141
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,900
And the only thing you wanted when you wanted to have sex was ask.

1142
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,620
This was the cornucopia paradise that we once lived in.

1143
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,900
Until they came along and invented work and money.

1144
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,020
And then they took this money.

1145
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,600
Which is actually a slave token.

1146
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,580
And they created work so you could earn these slave tokens.

1147
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:38,920
To buy things that they made to sell to each one of you.

1148
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,800
That used to be free.

1149
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,740
They made conspiracy food.

1150
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,500
Conspiracy drugs.

1151
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,620
That not only make you sick.

1152
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,420
But used to be free.

1153
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:55,320
Conspiracy beer and wine and whiskey used to bubble up from the ground.

1154
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,000
And you could drink it.

1155
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,780
And not even get a hangover.

1156
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:01,260
But now not only do you get a hangover.

1157
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,140
You have to pay for it.

1158
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,380
With the slave tokens you earn.

1159
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,280
Yes my friends.

1160
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,380
Tonight I'm going to perform a holy ritual.

1161
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:16,280
That will cure each and every one of you of work.

1162
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,960
Yes my friends.

1163
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,280
Some churches heal you of work.

1164
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:25,500
Some churches heal you of what pains you.

1165
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,940
But tonight I am going to sicken each and every one of you.

1166
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,060
So you are too sick to go to work tomorrow.

1167
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,460
Do I hear a praise bomb?

1168
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,220
By the powers vested in me.

1169
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,540
And J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1170
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,520
And the Church of the Subgenius.

1171
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,100
With my title as Pokeball Europe.

1172
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,980
I hereby sicken each and every one of you.

1173
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,440
And command you not to go to work tomorrow.

1174
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,180
And to lay in bed with a hangover.

1175
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,740
And to never ever ever ever work again for these slave tokens.

1176
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,820
Do I hear a praise bomb?

1177
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:06,500
Amen.

1178
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,340
Hallelujah.

1179
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,460
But now without further ado.

1180
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,700
You shall rise up.

1181
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,420
And find Bob.

1182
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,360
And join the Church of the Subgenius.

1183
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,260
And join the army of freaks.

1184
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,840
The freaks and hippies.

1185
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,200
And heavy metal heads.

1186
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,340
And goths.

1187
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,360
And weirdos.

1188
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,820
And we shall rise up.

1189
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:30,200
And be an army against their football coaches.

1190
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,680
And lawyers.

1191
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,140
We shall be a bulwark against their bullshit.

1192
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,780
Do I hear a praise bomb?

1193
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,560
Amen.

1194
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,140
Amen.

1195
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,580
Amen.

1196
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:44,940
Amen.

1197
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:45,340


1198
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:45,360


1199
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:45,360


1200
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:45,400


1201
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:45,400


1202
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:45,400


1203
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:45,520
Amen.

1204
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:45,520


1205
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:47,720
Amen.

1206
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:49,600
Amen.

1207
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:00,480
Amen.

1208
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:00,520
Amen.

1209
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:00,560
Amen.

1210
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:03,060


1211
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,720
AŤIăIc¤ oħ.

1212
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:16,520
That testing horizon a çeţcə

1213
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,520
I thought we'd go back to the old-fashioned way.

1214
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,300
And this revival with a wedding.

1215
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,340
A sacred, subgenius wedding.

1216
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,500
Now, we're going to wear this beautiful, well, this coat.

1217
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,760
Poe Black and Poe Pesonina.

1218
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,700
But, you know, and it's a big but.

1219
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,200
In this church, we can marry you to anything you want to marry.

1220
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,140
So if you want to come up and be part of this too, you're welcome to.

1221
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:41,080
If you have a boyfriend, girlfriend, same-sex, animal, your wallet, your car keys, anything.

1222
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,080
The beer in your hand.

1223
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:46,080
Whatever else is in your hand.

1224
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:46,880
Come on up.

1225
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:53,040
But for now, Poe Black and Poe Pesonina, step forward, please.

1226
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,340
Step right up.

1227
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:59,860
To get your holy short-duration marriage right here, test your mettle and win.

1228
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,120
The little lady.

1229
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:01,420
The little lady.

1230
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,820
A snooping dog.

1231
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,000
No, we're not moving it up here with me.

1232
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:06,840
You're down there.

1233
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,500
I'm up there.

1234
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,780
I'm the holy man.

1235
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,940
I'm up here on this ascended level.

1236
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,200
Also, I can see you better down there.

1237
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,060
And she's really cute.

1238
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,520
She's going to be married.

1239
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,360
Oh, shut up.

1240
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:27,960
Oh, yes, beloved friends, boyars, jealous associates, and any hidden cameras.

1241
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,360
Do you.

1242
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:37,840
Poe Black, in certain name here, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

1243
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,680
Say yes.

1244
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,380
Yes.

1245
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,340
Same with you.

1246
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,160
Say yes.

1247
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:41,580
Yes.

1248
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:47,020
And how long shall this period of sanctified coupling last?

1249
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:57,120
Normally, it's 24 hours, but I think in this case, it is 24 eternities of pure, raging sex hurt.

1250
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:57,740
Yes.

1251
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,320
Yes, baby.

1252
00:52:59,520 --> 00:52:59,740
Yes, baby.

1253
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,020
Yes.

1254
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:00,680
Yes, baby.

1255
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:00,740


1256
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:01,120
Yes, baby.

1257
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:01,120


1258
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:01,120


1259
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:01,120


1260
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:01,120


1261
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:01,120


1262
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:01,120


1263
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:01,840
Yes, baby.

1264
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:01,840


1265
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:01,840


1266
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,780
I don't want you to make a mockery of this sacred ceremony.

1267
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,780
I want you to sanctify it and make it real and hard.

1268
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:19,740
I want you to go home and go back to that hotel room, that sleazy, fly-ridden, fly-bit hotel room with the vibrating bed.

1269
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,860
And I want you to fuck, baby.

1270
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:29,260
I want you to fuck and fuck and fuck and fuck and fuck as if your very life depended on it.

1271
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,340
Because it does.

1272
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:31,980
So, yes, it does.

1273
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:41,600
So, we are gathered here together in the presence of J.R. Bob Dobbs, Connie Dobbs, whatever form or other deities, Jesus, whatnot,

1274
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:47,260
to join this man and this woman, and thank God it's a man and a woman this time,

1275
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:57,100
in a temporary but no less virtuous bondage of holy matrimony, for better or for worse, and this time forever.

1276
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,160
Forever.

1277
00:53:59,460 --> 00:53:59,980
Forever.

1278
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:01,500
Forever.

1279
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,360
You're going to hear that again in hell.

1280
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,480
Do you feel a spirit?

1281
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,740
Put your hands on each other and say, praise Bob!

1282
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,300
Praise Bob!

1283
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,620
Praise Bob!

1284
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,660
Praise Bob!

1285
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,800
Now, this is a bond of sub-holy wedlock.

1286
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:28,860
So, no matter what physical position these two may take in the next eternity, their moral standing shall be upright.

1287
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:29,300


1288
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:29,900
Woo!

1289
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:30,340
Woo!

1290
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:30,880
Woo!

1291
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,120
Woo!

1292
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:31,120


1293
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:31,120


1294
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:31,120


1295
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:31,120


1296
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:31,120


1297
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:31,120


1298
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:31,120


1299
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,180
Woo!

1300
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:49,160
Woo!

1301
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,220
Woo!

1302
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,280
Woo!

1303
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,740
Woo!

1304
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:00,740


1305
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:00,740


1306
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:00,740


1307
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:00,740


1308
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:00,740


1309
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:00,740


1310
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:05,160
Take this woman, Nina, to be your lawful wedded wife.

1311
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,900
In short duration, subgenius matrimony.

1312
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,360
To have and to hold.

1313
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:14,120
To do damn near anything you want to do with.

1314
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,940
For sickness or in sickness or in kinkiness.

1315
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,220
In rich or poor.

1316
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:25,620
Through any hardship or disaster that may befall her in the next eternity.

1317
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:30,280
For whatever sick and twisted but knowest blessed reasons.

1318
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,380
For the next 10,000 years.

1319
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,680
Say, I do!

1320
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,140
Hell yeah, I do!

1321
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,020
Do you, Nina!

1322
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,000
Do you poor, sad, deluded creature.

1323
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:49,320
Agree to take on the horrible job of looking after this giant-sized infant.

1324
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:52,960
This huge 35-year-old baby.

1325
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:58,660
To diaper him and feed him and put up with his insane bullshit.

1326
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,700
For God's sake!

1327
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:03,420
For worse than rich or poor and sickness and kinkiness.

1328
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:04,100
Say, I do!

1329
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:04,880
I do!

1330
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,480
Praise God, she said, I do, the poor thing.

1331
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:11,360
Now, shake on it and say, it's a deal!

1332
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,700
There you go.

1333
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:16,960
Oh, look, it's a hand fasting.

1334
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,420
Like the ancient pagan traditions.

1335
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:24,300
The Pope, like, is hand fasting himself through Pocostina.

1336
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:28,460
With, uh, packaging tape.

1337
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,600
It's true!

1338
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:30,780
It's true!

1339
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,820
Now, get on the ring and put the ring on.

1340
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,260
Now, like, you know, that's...

1341
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:44,260
Friends, if you're joining in by television or webcam, if you don't have a special ring,

1342
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,300
you can make a wedding ring with the...

1343
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,680
We call it the sacred temple of Devoe.

1344
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:54,480
Just form the hole and the pole and thrust the pole deep into the hole repeatedly.

1345
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,200
There you go.

1346
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,240
That's so romantic.

1347
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,940
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1348
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,720
We take this ring as a symbol of the Holy Spirit.

1349
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,600
The Holy State of Marriage and wedlock is real as fuck.

1350
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:10,640
So, by the authority invested in me by Jehovah God, God, the law, and everything else in

1351
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:16,660
defiance of the laws of nature, I now pronounce you man and wife.

1352
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:24,700
You must now kiss each other, groan each other, clutch and feel up each other, fall on the

1353
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,740
floor and rip it.

1354
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,360
Well, whatever is within.

1355
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,700
And don't break my tripod while you're doing this.

1356
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:30,700


1357
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:30,700


1358
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,280
And don't do that, if I poke black now.

1359
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,760
Damn, this love stuff is always expensive.

1360
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,920
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

1361
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,020
It is done.

1362
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,200
A man and a woman, praise Bob.

1363
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,460
Praise Bob.

1364
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:44,520
Praise Bob.

1365
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:45,680
Praise Bob.

1366
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,300
Praise Bob.

1367
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:46,700
Praise Bob.

1368
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:46,860
Praise Bob.

1369
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:47,220
Praise Bob.

1370
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:47,680
Praise Bob.

1371
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:53,040
And so, folks, all I have to say is give our books and pamphlets a chance.

1372
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,800
Especially Revelation X, the Bob Apocrypha.

1373
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:00,560
That is the second in a planned series of books which will march through the decades.

1374
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:00,680
But we'll have more of them.

1375
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:00,680


1376
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:00,680


1377
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:00,680


1378
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:00,680


1379
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:07,000
until finally they are all out and before the eyes of the world.

1380
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,800
And when they are, and when the selected elect have read them,

1381
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,600
then down will close the end of time.

1382
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:22,000
And we will come to the ultimate terminal where everything is final and nothing is general.

1383
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:29,120
Ask Dr. Howell, ranting there at the subgenius revival in Amsterdam, 2007.

1384
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:34,780
More on Dr. Howell at askdrhowell.com.

1385
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,440
That's A-S-K-D-R-H-A-L dot com.

1386
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:42,860
And this is Hour of Slack number 1134.

1387
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:50,400
You can learn more about the Church of the Subgenius and the Hour of Slack at subgenius.com.

1388
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:56,900
The background music here is by Speed Cave of speedcave.com.

1389
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:57,920
Praise Bob.

1390
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,300
Meanwhile, we're broadcasting here on behalf of the Church of the Subgenius

1391
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,900
because the time is running out.

1392
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:10,260
Our world grinds to its end in its last agonized moments.

1393
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:17,780
We hope you've made up your mind about whether or not to embrace the doctrine of J.R. Bob Dobbs

1394
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:22,940
and grasp at it as a drowning person grasps at a straw,

1395
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:26,640
although a straw is really not useful at this time.

1396
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,000
Now I'm going to turn you back to Ivan saying,

1397
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:37,160
remember, subgenius principles can easily be understood.

1398
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,780
Just look at Bob's face.

1399
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:46,180
This is a face-based business and a business-based religion, friends.

1400
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:52,760
So now in the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs, I want to pass a benediction on to you.

1401
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,800
May all your moments be filled with slack, however you define it.

1402
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:08,500
And may all of your thoughts be completely devoted to the thoughts and patterns of the face of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1403
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,080
Praise Bob.

1404
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,640
Let there be slack.

1405
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:12,720
Praise Bob.

1406
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:13,820
Praise Bob.

1407
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:14,220
Praise Bob.

1408
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:15,680
Praise Bob.

1409
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:15,920
Praise Bob.

1410
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:15,920


1411
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:15,920


1412
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,220
Praise Bob.

1413
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,120
Praise Bob.

1414
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,440
Praise Bob.
