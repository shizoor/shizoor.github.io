1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
I keep feeling and I hear shuffling noises all about me.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,200
Shuffling?

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,220
Well, not exactly.

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,140
More like little sucking noises.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,200
You know, a...

6
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,100
That's great.

7
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,580
Look!

8
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,540
I know who it is!

9
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,200
I know who it is that doesn't belong among us!

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,240
I swear, I know who it is!

11
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:18,940
It's...

12
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,880
The Self-Genius Hour of Slack!

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,440
Oh, that's not true!

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,400
Wake up, you...

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:33,600
Bob?

16
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,120
...forsaken people, you!

17
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,600
The best there is, this man here that works for you!

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,320
Your government, our country, the best country there is because of me like...

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:42,500
Bob?

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,860
I'm proud of you.

21
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,140
Bob?

22
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,560
They're gonna hear about this, not just in the territories, but in Washington.

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,820
Across the length and breadth of this nation, they're gonna know that name.

24
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,160
Bob?

25
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,140
Now, what do you got to say about that boy?

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,680
I was drunk.

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,740
I didn't know what I was doing.

28
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,560
I didn't know what I was doing!

29
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,380
I didn't know what I was doing!

30
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,460
Good morning and welcome to the Subgenius Devotional Hour here.

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,080
Um...

32
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,720
Before the normal scary time.

33
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,180
As the smoke of that burning goeth up forever...

34
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,820
...that was a stink-all.

35
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,660
But it had lots of prophecy involved.

36
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,660
You heard it right here on the Subgenius Hour.

37
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,680
And lots of few words.

38
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,420
Blood belches from the earth.

39
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,340
My lights in the sky rebuke thee.

40
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,160
The children of heaven.

41
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,760
and the angels from heaven are among these spreading lies and deception.

42
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,320
They turn not as they go.

43
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,280
Within five years, the United States, as we know it, will cease to exist.

44
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,420
We're living in terrible, perilous, chaotic times.

45
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,860
Praise the Lord.

46
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,020
And these times are not going to get any better, my friend.

47
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,360
Amen.

48
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,900
They're going to get worse and worse.

49
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,440
Love is free.

50
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,480
Okay, I know you all think you want to know what's going on.

51
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,680
That's okay.

52
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,140
So I saw this thing coming.

53
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,060
I saw this thing coming to me.

54
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,420
I didn't know what it was, but it looked funny.

55
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,280
There were deceptions which have surrounded our space program.

56
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,700
Spacecraft entered the moon's gravitational field in the sixth segment of the flight.

57
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,900
The gravity of the moon is one-sixth of that on Earth.

58
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,700
The orbit around the moon was flown 66 miles above the moon's surface at 6,000 miles an hour.

59
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,820
At 10 after 9, the beeping began.

60
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,920
It went down to the...

61
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,040
reserve fence, watched through binoculars, and we did see this thing.

62
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,320
Now, it's about the size of the moon, with a small crescent at the bottom that's well lit like starlight.

63
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,400
The top is a dark gray mass.

64
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,760
It came down through the trees, whatever it was.

65
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,200
Have you ever heard of one?

66
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,640
Have you ever been in one?

67
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,600
Have you ever seen one?

68
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,260
Have you, by television, ever seen one?

69
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,100
If you haven't, it's the greatest sight this side of heaven.

70
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,000
Good evening, everyone.

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:41,860
People from this Earth have already seen some of their spacecraft, which they call flying saucers, and other flying objects which they cannot describe.

72
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,320
These objects are real and are spacecraft.

73
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,740
I represent a group of scientists who work with but one purpose, to put an end to war.

74
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,540
Naturally, such a goal can't be obtained without

75
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:04,340
out experts of superior ability. Men of vision. Men such as you, Doctor. Gathered here, exchanging

76
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,200
information daily, putting aside all thoughts of personal success. We hope to achieve exciting

77
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,160
new techniques, leap years ahead of the others. I don't think I need to tell you how effective

78
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,740
our voices will be when the world learns of our achievements. Well, there you have it.

79
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:30,340
Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is? They are friendly people and are by far more advanced

80
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:38,280
spiritually and physically than the people of this planet. At the present time, they are

81
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:48,560
observing us. They wish to help us to help ourselves to attain a higher understanding of life

82
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
and its meaning.

83
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,820
What do you think about Bob?

84
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,400
Who's Bob?

85
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:01,500
Alright, well, what do you think about the UFOs which are presently going to, which are

86
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,100
presently in formation to blitz the Earth and put particle beams through the head of

87
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,520
everyone that doesn't know Bob?

88
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,040
You're out of your mind.

89
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,920
And we're off this planet and out of this world soon.

90
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,620
Hey, friends.

91
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,540
Next week, in fact, July 5th, the world ends.

92
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,420
That's how we experts of superior ability decided to end war.

93
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:39,800
Anyway, that last clip there was a Reverend Stevie Hambong from ancient subgenius media

94
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,760
barrage tapes.

95
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:47,840
Before that, Leemur, penantanandi Leemur and Gartenius Alina, different cut-ups of openings,

96
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,040
mostly Leemur.

97
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,600
And I'm Bob.

98
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:57,040
And we heard some ancient KPFA puzzling evidence from Berkeley radio.

99
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,640
Really, a lot of stuff from the old media barrage, the lab explaining X-Day.

100
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,100
Later, we'll have documentary sex sounds.

101
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,220
Sex sounds from...

102
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,080
No one is ever safe on this hostile planet.

103
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,200
X-Day.

104
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
5X Day, actually, the last one.

105
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,580
By the way, this music in the background is from the original X-Day.

106
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


107
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


108
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


109
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


110
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


111
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


112
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


113
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


114
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


115
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


116
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


117
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


118
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


119
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


120
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


121
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


122
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


123
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


124
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,580


125
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,120
The X-Day is the amino acids who are the headlining band for this X-Day.

126
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:33,520
The amino acids at amino acids at the amino acids dot com.

127
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:44,460
Now, friends, however, Reverend Susie the Ploosie brings us some of her X-Day love and expectation.

128
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,580
Enough to get me all expectorated.

129
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,560
I'm not going to lie.

130
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:49,560


131
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:49,560


132
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:49,560


133
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:49,560


134
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:49,560


135
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,560
Because nobody knows how to bring in the new end of the old universe like Susie the Ploosie.

136
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,760
It's getting late for the great planet Earth.

137
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,120
A storm of hail and fire mingled with blood is cast upon the Earth and a third of the

138
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,000
world is burned.

139
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,540
A fiery mountain is hurled into the sea and a third of the world is burned.

140
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:19,540


141
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:19,540


142
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:19,540


143
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:19,540


144
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:19,540


145
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,540
The sea and its creatures have perished.

146
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,900
A great star has fallen from heaven upon a third of the Earth's rivers and springs.

147
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,300
Their waters have become polluted and bitter.

148
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,780
The sun, the moon, and the stars are struck.

149
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,640
A third of the world is in darkness.

150
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,040
Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the Earth because of the risk of the trumpet blasts

151
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,540
which the angels are about to take.

152
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:49,540


153
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,080
The sound of the trumpet blasts are heard in the sea and the sea is broken.

154
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,080


155
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,080


156
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,160
It's a great sound.

157
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,760
It is done!

158
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,140
The final trumpet has sounded!

159
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,200
The mighty cities of the nations fall!

160
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Islands disappear!

161
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,520
Mountains crumble!

162
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,180
As God's final wrath pours upon mankind!

163
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,020
As lightning flashes from the East to the West, so he comes.

164
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,840
The Son of Man, anointed in power, returns with majesty and glory to take his kingdom.

165
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,300
Bob, let's really have some smoke on this one, alright?

166
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,580
Alright!

167
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,540
Let's have some smoke, Bob.

168
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:19,540


169
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:19,540


170
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:19,540


171
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:19,540


172
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:19,540


173
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:19,540


174
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:19,720
Let's go.

175
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,360
Time is running out for the human race.

176
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,860
Get ready for the judgment day.

177
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,560
The sun is shining.

178
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,840
Come on, get happy.

179
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,640
The Lord is waiting to take your hand.

180
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,120
Shout hallelujah.

181
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,520
Come on, get happy.

182
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,300
We're going to the promised land.

183
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,160
And if she wants to get some white underwear, it might be best she get them in asbestos.

184
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,600
All right?

185
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,960
Might better get them in asbestos.

186
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,680
Listen, I'm teasing now, of course.

187
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,740
Don't let her put on asbestos britches.

188
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,260
All right?

189
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,300
It might be harmful to your breathing.

190
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,100
First, I want to remind you that in the last days, there will be some scoffers who will do every wrong they can think of and laugh at the truth.

191
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,460
If you are scoffing right now, in your heart, if you are not believing...

192
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:04,660
Bob!

193
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,840
...coming back, you are one of the signs of his coming.

194
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,200
If you're going to continue to scoff, will you do me a favor?

195
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,180
Prepare for the end.

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,340
Well, there's a day soon coming when the judgment of the world will begin.

197
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,500
When the sky will be darkened and the mountains dance like drunken men.

198
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,780
When the people of the earth will fall like fruit from the tree.

199
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,400
Oh, I wish you'd all believe me.

200
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,960
I wish you all could see.

201
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,480
I wish you'd all believe me.

202
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,800
I wish you'd all believe.

203
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,420
The truth will not hurt you.

204
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,960
Only the lie.

205
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,920
I wish you'd all believe me.

206
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,040
You don't really believe that, do you?

207
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,940
I don't know.

208
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,540
Impossible, fantastic, ridiculous, absurd. Really?

209
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,400
The ambush.

210
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:17,920
The set.

211
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,700
And it's working.

212
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,560
1998, the year of fear.

213
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,580
Jack, explain it way, please.

214
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,140
Now, these are not my dates.

215
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,180
We don't set dates.

216
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,840
This is one of the best intelligence sources in the world, along with Jane's defense out of England.

217
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,680
But let me tell you this, friend.

218
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,500
We believe things are going to come and happen sooner than we think.

219
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,920
The world must have seen it coming, right?

220
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,760
I'm afraid not.

221
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,940
Even though the technology had been around for years.

222
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,480
Nobody really paid too much attention to it.

223
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,240
Almost no one saw it coming.

224
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,820
Almost no one?

225
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,200
Yeah, almost.

226
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,160
Those of us who did express our concern were just branded as paranoid.

227
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,840
As people who hated technology.

228
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,240
People who just weren't ready to be part of a new, united world.

229
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,200
Don't listen not to this child of Satan.

230
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,600
Reverend, I gotta admit, this doomsday warning has me just a smidge twitterpated.

231
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,900
Oh, now be calm, Ned.

232
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,920
But be afraid also.

233
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,680
Tremendously afraid.

234
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,360
For the day of reckoning is upon us.

235
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,060
Oh, reckoning now!

236
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,060
We're heading across the river.

237
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,580
Wash your sins away in the tide.

238
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,220
It's all so peaceful on the other side.

239
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,180
Forget the troubles, come on, get happy.

240
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,740
You better chase all your cares away.

241
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,920
Hallelujah, come on, get happy.

242
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,720
Get ready for the judgment day.

243
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:56,280
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

244
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,740
What about tomorrow?

245
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,200
Just four lives ahead.

246
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,160
Will there be a brighter future?

247
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,600
Or just how the world's gonna end?

248
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,360
Woo, woo, yeah.

249
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,720
Ain't gonna wait.

250
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,040
There's any length.

251
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,920
There's no time.

252
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,700
Ah.

253
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,060
Oh, what a horrible dream.

254
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,640
Ha, ha!

255
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,980
Oh, man.

256
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,500
Boy, that bitch was right.

257
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,100
I have fallen down on the job, ear seekers.

258
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,480
I've been pussyfooting and fiddle-farting around

259
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,440
at the most crucial juncture here of mutant existence ever.

260
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,780
Because this is a damn ministry here.

261
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,120
So from now until X-Day,

262
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,900
it's no more Mr. Nice Girl.

263
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,680
Oh, I've got to be more than just mere Reverend Susie the Floozy

264
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,300
to get this job done.

265
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,620
I've got to be the whore of Babylon on a three-headed pea dog, too.

266
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,200
Because it's time to sound the mutant survival call.

267
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,540
Too much is hanging in the balance here

268
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,820
because there are still unsaved subgenius souls out there.

269
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,980
Mmm.

270
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,100
I can wait.

271
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,000
I've freed your stench from here, baby.

272
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,060
Oh, yes.

273
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,020
It's the twilight of the elder gods for the Yeti Uber race.

274
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,800
And praise be the holy name of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

275
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,740
Because thanks to him,

276
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,100
we're scraping the crappy dirt of this planet off of our shoes, baby.

277
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,640
The doomsday clock is ticking down the final moments.

278
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,940
We're on a drunken chicken run with the end time.

279
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,260
And it's zooming up on us a lot sooner than they think.

280
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,840
Yes.

281
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,320
X-Day is coming up July 5th.

282
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,420
This very year, Seekers.

283
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,460
It's 7 a.m.

284
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,700
Think, if you haven't thought already.

285
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,700
Have you decided how you're going to spend eternity?

286
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,960
As a human pork rind screaming in the stinking wreckage of a dying planet?

287
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:43,600
No.

288
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,960
Or as a satisfied member of the fastest growing apocalypse cult,

289
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,160
snugly ensconced aboard the escape vessels of the sex goddesses,

290
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:03,680
en route through space and time to an idyllic future of sated lusts and mind-reaming pleasures?

291
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,940
Duh.

292
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,520
Tough choice, huh?

293
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,660
Oh, but there are some among us who aren't sure yet.

294
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,100
Maybe they can't.

295
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,360
I can't quite tell if they're pink.

296
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,020
Or if they're truly a mutated son of Dobbs.

297
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,800
Hell, just send in that membership fee.

298
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,740
And whether you're pink or not, chances are everything will be fine.

299
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,140
Hell, those saucers come with airlocks and torpedo tubes.

300
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,900
I'm sure we'll be able to do a little weeding out once we're airborne.

301
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,640
Oh, but that can come later.

302
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,900
And hopefully there won't be a lot of weeding to do.

303
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,740
Because weeding's hard on a girl's knees.

304
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,420
But I don't expect a lot of the wrong kind of people to be on board if you catch my drift.

305
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,780
Because they're going to be misreading the flaming signs in the heavens

306
00:15:53,780 --> 00:16:00,760
and trying their brand-X apocalyptic solutions until it's too late to turn to Bob.

307
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:07,920
Oh, but they never have been able to figure out how to get it right anyway.

308
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,280
Oh, they screw it all up.

309
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,080
They can't tell a 999 from a...

310
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,940
666.

311
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:25,400
And I can see how they could mistake our triumphant subgenius Ragnarok for their cheesy bargain basement Armageddon.

312
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,940
Oh, but hey, you putzes.

313
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,300
Armageddon tired of waiting for you to get around to it.

314
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,060
Your god can't get it up to destroy the Sodom and Gomorrah that it has created for itself.

315
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,080
Oh, but Bob's going to clean house on his own.

316
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,600
This cat box, but good.

317
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:53,280
And the mighty wrath of Jehovah One and Negi and the elder gods and the sex goddesses are just for the overkill.

318
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,040
Oh, Bob, great is thy power.

319
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,940
Cream rinse us all in your sweet load and rupture us up into the heavens.

320
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,760
Yay, we strip naked and light the sacred froth and implore your mercy upon your believers.

321
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,380
Yay, yay, yay.

322
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,960
Yay, yay, yay.

323
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,520
In the days of the end, there shall come from among the race of men a new ruler.

324
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,120
From the chaos of the nations, he will forge peace and security.

325
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,980
As one risen from the dead, he will entrench the world with his sorcery.

326
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,340
And at the time appointed, he will take his place in the very temple of the Lord of Hosts.

327
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,200
Scattering the true children of the Father over the face of the whole earth.

328
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,420
He is Bob.

329
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,260
Bob.

330
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:43,960
Bob.

331
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,660
What makes Bob holler?

332
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,240
What makes Bob holler?

333
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,140
When I asked Bob, he explained this way.

334
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,660
And he said,

335
00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:01,460
Well, when a little sweetie pie in a misker twirls by and rolls those big blue eyes,

336
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,960
Oh, I holler.

337
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,980
And when some pretty chick says she loves my fiddle legs,

338
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,480
Well, now then, that can do the trick.

339
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,840
Oh, I holler.

340
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,260
Oh, I holler.

341
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:20,600
And, uh, you know, even if X-Day didn't work out, we'll go for Sex Day.

342
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,560
We want you to have a dance into the new century.

343
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,040
Screw into the new century.

344
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,080
Sleep and eat your way into the new century.

345
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:40,280
And the baptism is basically to wash away that pink taint from rubbing elbows with and kind of purify them.

346
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,080
The baptism is a very beautiful event because, you know, it's a very beautiful event.

347
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,000
Most of us need a bath.

348
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,660
Okay.

349
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,680
And now, I want you to gently feel your neighbor's nipple to your left and to your right.

350
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,660
Oh!

351
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,600
Oh!

352
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,860
Oh!

353
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,440
Oh!

354
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,200


355
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,540
Oh!

356
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,280
Oh!

357
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,220


358
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,220


359
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,720
Oh!

360
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,100
Oh!

361
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,380
Oh!

362
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:03,600
Oh!

363
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,040
Oh!

364
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,900
Oh!

365
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,260
Oh!

366
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,260


367
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,260


368
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,260


369
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,260


370
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,920
Oh!

371
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,480
Oh!

372
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,240
Oh!

373
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,080
I love you!

374
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:24,680
All of those flying saucers are my friends, cause there's so much!

375
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,200
I'm gonna see them again and again.

376
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,980
Is that before or after the bob pills?

377
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:44,080
Monsters like to men will be around the all about and gently need to look past a door which should be locked.

378
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,240
and thy sciences will terrify thee and bring thee not the devil,

379
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,560
for thine spirit is locked away inside the white stone,

380
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,600
which my angels have grieved from space.

381
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,520
Where are we, Bob?

382
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,880
The code is broken.

383
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,800
Trouble?

384
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,440
Big.

385
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,380
Security.

386
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,620
I have the lid on tight.

387
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,300
Well, take it off for me.

388
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,540
The message is, Mars needs women.

389
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,140
Oh, God.

390
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,280
This is so wrong.

391
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,200
I love it.

392
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,040
It's moments like that that make me think we're really all going to hell after all.

393
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,600
It's a way of getting back to all the slack you had when you were a little kid.

394
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,420
Remember when you were a little kid,

395
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,060
and you'd be able to do this?

396
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,060
You'd be able to just sit there with your little plastic soldiers.

397
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,260
You'd create a whole fantasy world around you.

398
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,300
This is it.

399
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,640
We've created our own fantasy world around us.

400
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,720
That's what religion's for, right?

401
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,800
To create a fantasy world.

402
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,560
But we live our fantasy world out.

403
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,820
We don't wait until we die.

404
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,360
Oh, man, John.

405
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,620
Whoop her, Andrew.

406
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,360
Whoop her real, Andrew.

407
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,400
I got exactly what I wanted!

408
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,740
I got exactly what I wanted!

409
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,280
I got exactly what I wanted!

410
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,820
All right! Praise Connie!

411
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,840
Bob's a small guy, physically.

412
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,080
I'm pretty convinced.

413
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,540
Uh-huh.

414
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,840
You seen the photographs?

415
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,960
So those are the autopsy photographs that were rearranged to look like choir photographs.

416
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,820
I'd never trust an autopsy photo.

417
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,180
Bob's only got getting back home on his mind now.

418
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:39,980
Hi, Bob.

419
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,120
Right, Bob?

420
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,200
Bob.

421
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,580
Bob.

422
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,700
I came as a visitor, not an invader.

423
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,320
I must get back to my ship, see if I can repair it.

424
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,280
And then I must leave.

425
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,700
No, wait!

426
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,500
What harm is there in hearing them out?

427
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,600
Other than being a salesman, what does Bob do for a living?

428
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,420
Other than being a salesman?

429
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,100
Bob is not on Route 80 with a bag full of brushes on his head.

430
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,120
Who has met Bob?

431
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,560
He seemed extremely paranoid.

432
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,000
He believed in conspiracies.

433
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,400
Uh.

434
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,480
He came on like a Nazi.

435
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,560
I was afraid of him.

436
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,240
Your tricks don't frighten us, neither do you.

437
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,520
We've come a long way in 5,000 years.

438
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,480
But you're still of the same nature.

439
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,320
I could sweep you out of existence with a wave of my hand and bring you back again.

440
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,340
I can give life or death.

441
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,340
What else does mankind demand of its gods?

442
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,820
Mankind has no need for gods.

443
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,060
We find the one quite adequate.

444
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,320
We shall not debate, mortal.

445
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,060
We shall not debate, mortal.

446
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,040
Say we cannot have non-發展面.

447
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:14,040
Next time we'll show you what was and will not be.

448
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,560
ласти

449
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,100
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

450
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,460
At this very moment, there have been stories filtering into the studio

451
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,440
about other sports events being kidnapped and the entire thing taken to another planet.

452
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,000
That's right. These are aliens from another planet kidnapping our American sports teams.

453
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,700
It's not a legal problem. It's not a political problem.

454
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,240
It's an alien problem.

455
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,420
Oh, I've never seen one.

456
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,660
You know, the visits from aliens need not be a painful item.

457
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,300
It can be quite an exciting time.

458
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,300
I don't personally have any desire to have it.

459
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,240
It's like meeting Bob. I don't want to do it.

460
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,740
I just need to get you to understand exactly what's happening here at the Church of the Subgenius

461
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,860
and the organized crime fighting that we're doing here in California.

462
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,660
But as soon as we're gone, you folks who are here unsaved, you folks listening by radio,

463
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,580
you folks listening by record, once the church is gone, there's going to be a cataclysmic judgment

464
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,380
and millions will die in those next few years.

465
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,580
They'll be glued to their sets, watching rockets and jets,

466
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,580
blowing up schools and factories, putting an end to the birds and bees.

467
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,440
It's worth every penny to tune in and see

468
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,260
who wins the Emmy at the ruin of the Academy.

469
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,380
Watch World War III on pay TV

470
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,300
before your television melts away.

471
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,000
It's the end of the world as we know it.

472
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,580
It's the end of the world as we know it.

473
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,320
It's the end of the world as we know it.

474
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,360
I feel fine.

475
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,080
A-O, let's go.

476
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,840
You see them in the back now.

477
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,420
What they want, I don't know.

478
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,100
They're all ripped up and ready to go.

479
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,120
Turn around.

480
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,840
Go back down, back the way you came.

481
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,660
Can't you see that flash of fire?

482
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,420
Ten times brighter than the day.

483
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,720
And behold, a mighty city

484
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,740
broken in the dust again.

485
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,660
Oh, God, private man

486
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,280
broken in the dust again.

487
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,760
It's gonna be me

488
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,220
and it's gonna be you.

489
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,940
We're gonna do everything we want.

490
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,940
It's gonna be now.

491
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,580
And I can't wait.

492
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,840
To say goodbye to fear

493
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,860
and all that pain at hand.

494
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,780
Oh, like a flaming baton

495
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,060
that's burning us, whoa.

496
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,900
Like George Bush on acid

497
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,400
singing into the world.

498
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,440
Gonna be a new world.

499
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,040
Gonna be a new world.

500
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,700
Gonna be a new world.

501
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,440
I will stand

502
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,320
to anyone's last words.

503
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,540
There's nothing left for you to say.

504
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,940
Soon you'll pretend anyway.

505
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,140
Well, no one here is getting out alive.

506
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,720
There's someone really lost my mind

507
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,000
and I don't care.

508
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,880
So close your eyes

509
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,760
and get yourself involved.

510
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,280
It's gonna be me and I don't care.

511
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,860
And think about the times we've been and what they've been

512
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:52,240
To me it's nothing, to me it's nothing

513
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,340
To me it's nothing, to me it's nothing

514
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:05,440
We're only gonna die from our own arrogance

515
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,520
That's why we might as well take our time

516
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:17,500
Stop the traffic, stop the law, stop the law

517
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:23,260
I wanna get off, I wanna get off with you

518
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,440
One more job in the supermarket

519
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,920
One more kick to get me started

520
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,240
Everyone get on board

521
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,980
This ship is sinking

522
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,080
Looking for a way in, searching for the way out

523
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,900
Angels ride free in your mind

524
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,460
But you're never gonna find it if you're never gonna try

525
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,800
Get your eyes on the road and suck the wild

526
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,020
Hey man, get hip

527
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,380
Climb aboard our pleasure ship

528
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,620
Speed boy, we know

529
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,020
You're king of the real, yeah, come and go

530
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,620
You're the king of the real, yeah, come and go

531
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,600
Go Apollo 69

532
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,420
Rock it baby, walk the line

533
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,920
We feed the fire, now's the time

534
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,800
Fly Apollo 69, yeah, yeah

535
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,340
The beginning was the end

536
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,640
Of everything now

537
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,260
The ape regards his tail

538
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,300
He's stuck on it

539
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,280
Three pinks until he fell

540
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,120
Half a goon and half a dog

541
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,200
A man's not made of steel

542
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,020
See the fire sweeping

543
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,920
Our very streets today

544
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,740
Burn like a red coal carpet

545
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,300
Mad bull has lost its way

546
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,580
Born a shielded

547
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,940
It's just a shot away

548
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,040
It's just a shot away

549
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,000
Born a shielded

550
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,180
It's just a shot away

551
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,180
Shot away, shot away

552
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,680
When we were born into this life

553
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,100
We were destined to make it right

554
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,980
And it's predetermined

555
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,560
And this is our fate

556
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,300
We're singing this song

557
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,040
So you can read late

558
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,400
We are going to save the universe

559
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,000
We are going to save the universe

560
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,940
We are going to save the universe

561
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,920
We are going to save the universe

562
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,160
This part

563
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,040
We're all tied between

564
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,260
We made it man

565
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,020
There is no future

566
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,600
In England's dreaming

567
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,080
No future

568
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,180
No future

569
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,840
No future

570
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,800
No future for you

571
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,940
No future

572
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,460
No future

573
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,320
No future

574
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,940
No future for me

575
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,080
No future

576
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,600
No future

577
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,780
No future

578
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,000
No future

579
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,720
What?

580
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:26,080
Of the limitless sex and violence

581
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,460
in the wake of Ragnarok.

582
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,640
Welcome to the slaughter.

583
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,860
What are you going to do?

584
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,540
What will be your epitaph?

585
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,720
When we get done with you,

586
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,300
are you going to cry for your mama?

587
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,700
Are you going to have a good time?

588
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,280
Are you going to be a bohub?

589
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,400
When it's your turn to die,

590
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,260
don't get crazy.

591
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,480
Let them all around.

592
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,040
Anarchy here.

593
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,860
Rural streets in the Ragnarok party town.

594
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,920
Isn't it assumed,

595
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,400
when somebody is these religions suitable for you,

596
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,580
you will come closer to them just like they have to you.

597
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,140
There areumes of each pote,

598
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:21,600
and word curses the 🎄

599
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:21,600


600
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,500
Who says so?

601
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,760
I?

602
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,140
Experience?

603
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:45,020
Just put some bleachers out in the sun and uh, having out on highway 61.

604
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,360
Oh yeah!

605
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,100
Bye.

606
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,920
Bob?

607
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,200
Bob?

608
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,900
Really don't mind.

609
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,620
Bob?

610
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,700
Bob?

611
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,940
Next Day Song Collage.

612
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,860
They're put together by yours truly

613
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,840
with a bazillion different commercial bands.

614
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,780
And before that,

615
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,680
some old, young, glass madness

616
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,640
and puzzling evidence on the radio.

617
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,620
And now, with amino acids in the background,

618
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,580
me doing the credits.

619
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,240
No one is ever safe on this hostile planet.

620
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,420
No way, man.

621
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,800
Because that people will obviously

622
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,700
just look at Pope Black here.

623
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,180
Pope David Lee Black

624
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,380
preaching at the Euro X Day

625
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,980
in London last year.

626
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,180
I'm going to talk to you about the conspiracy.

627
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,280
Now the conspiracy

628
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,180
is that one world, one government,

629
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,980
one taco, one Pepsi,

630
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,140
one goddamn tight-knocky tight t-shirt,

631
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,420
one fucking football,

632
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,300
one football game world

633
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,100
that'll have a fucking Big Mac in your mouth

634
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,640
and a gas pump in your ass

635
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,100
begging you

636
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,900
and you'll beg them to give you a credit card.

637
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,040
But there's only one way

638
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,120
to get rid of it.

639
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,120


640
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,120


641
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,720
to get rid of this conspiracy.

642
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,360
And that is to burn money.

643
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,600
We gotta burn some money.

644
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,280
I want you to get out your money.

645
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,680
Get out your money.

646
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,480
Who's got money to burn?

647
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,320
We got some money to burn right here.

648
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,160
We got more money to burn.

649
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,600
Oh, hallelujah.

650
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,460
More money.

651
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,280
We got dollars.

652
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,040
We got rupees.

653
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,180
We got euros.

654
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,680
We gonna burn some money.

655
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:29,980
Hallelujah.

656
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,660
Smoke that money.

657
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,600
Woo.

658
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,100
Oh, yeah.

659
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,420
Burn money.

660
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:35,960
Burn.

661
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,380
Burn.

662
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:38,740
Burn.

663
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,380
Burn.

664
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:40,920
Evil money.

665
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,780
Burn it.

666
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,060
The dollars and euros.

667
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:43,960
Burn it.

668
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,760
I have a gold nose.

669
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,060
Pleased to meet you, sir.

670
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,340
They shot him in the foot just for his boots.

671
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,140
Well, here's your gold nose.

672
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,440
Thirty dollars cash.

673
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,940
You like this model?

674
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,740
I don't know.

675
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,400
Thank you, sir.

676
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,520
Oh, Paul, thanks a lot.

677
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,580
There ain't nothing better.

678
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,320
Oh, come on.

679
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:03,960
Where is it?

680
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,100
Where is it?

681
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,100


682
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,100


683
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,100


684
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,100


685
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,100


686
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,100


687
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,100


688
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,180
Here it is.

689
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:04,760
It's in the range, we heard.

690
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,400
Mm-hmm.

691
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:05,940
Mm-hmm.

692
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,420
Yeah.

693
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:06,800
Yeah.

694
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,060
Yeah.

695
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,320
But hey.

696
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,040
Hey.

697
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,500
Cash deal.

698
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,320
Cash.

699
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:17,860
It is better to have more and, uh, not need than to have more and, uh, not want.

700
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,560
Uh-huh.

701
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,300
I don't know.

702
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:25,920
We were in a cattle loon on a moonlit night when a group of flying saucers came flying

703
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,540
into sight.

704
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,140
Oh, no.

705
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:27,840
Ew.

706
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,360
Ew.

707
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,580
Let's get out of here.

708
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,860
They're getting too close.

709
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,980
And they're starting to close.

710
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,080
They're getting too close.

711
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,080


712
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,080


713
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,080


714
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,080


715
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,080


716
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,080


717
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,400
Oh, no.

718
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,440
I'm turning up the gas.

719
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,000
Come on.

720
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,480
Let's go.

721
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,440
Oh, no.

722
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,600
See you better.

723
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,620
Let's get out of here.

724
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,080
The heavy anti-magnetic hydrosuper saturated.

725
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,400
Cycletrated, adiopated bottoms that are corrugated.

726
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,700
Electroplated gyroscopic catalytic simulator.

727
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,460
Saucers in the sky.

728
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
Saucers in the sea.

729
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,180
Flying saucers everywhere.

730
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,240
Coming after me.

731
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,580
Slipping in the spite.

732
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,540
Unified saucer rack.

733
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,060
Look, sitting on top, it's a flying saucer rack.

734
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,060


735
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,060


736
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,060


737
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,060


738
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,060


739
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,060


740
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,940
It's a five-photonics tank.

741
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,980
Don't worry, kids.

742
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,420
Everything's all right.

743
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,160
Oh, no.

744
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,000
Ew.

745
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,460
Ew.

746
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,620
Get us out of here.

747
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,980
It's a rock and roll band from the back of the moon.

748
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,640
I don't think I've ever heard a prettier tune.

749
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,600
One, two, three.

750
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,840
Let's get on with the show.

751
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,680
We have anti-magnetic hydrosuper saturated.

752
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,460
Cycletrated, adiopated bottoms that are corrugated.

753
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,760
Electroplated gyroscopic catalytic simulator.

754
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,640
We have anti-magnetic hydrosuper saturated.

755
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:32,640


756
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:32,640


757
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:32,640


758
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,400
Saucers in the sky.

759
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:33,400


760
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:33,400


761
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,040
Saucers in the sky.

762
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,040


763
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,640
Saucers in the sea.

764
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,340
Flying saucers everywhere.

765
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,440
Coming after me.

766
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,760
Slipping in the spite.

767
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,660
Unified saucer rack.

768
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,720
The mutants must hear

769
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,340
The mutants must cry

770
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,460
The saucers will cry

771
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:07,500
And the darlings will cry

772
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:20,520
And that was Gary Gbrogfrag.

773
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:27,360
Mein Führer, we cannot allow like a mind-shaft gap, baby.

774
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,700
Und why not?

775
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,540
I mean, Mr. President.

776
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,000
That's Mrs. President to you, Danny.

777
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,660
I mean, Mrs. Show is.

778
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,920
Ms. President.

779
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,620
Ms. President.

780
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,580
President Princess Wee Ardo.

781
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,360
Presidentress of all the UFOs.

782
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:53,080
As we shall learn when they finally arrive here on Earth Farm 1.

783
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,160
This sunny July 5th, 2003.

784
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,220
Or one of these July 5th.

785
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,200
And I'm waiting for our lovely miss.

786
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,220
And here she is.

787
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,000
One of these 7 AMs.

788
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,080
The Princess of Wee Ardo.

789
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,060
Queen of all.

790
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,640
I'm just taking a look.

791
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,360
I'm taking all of the Bahamas in my ship.

792
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,740
That's all I want.

793
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,160
That's all?

794
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:15,760
Yeah, that's all I want.

795
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,140
Just that?

796
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,780
Just the Bahamas.

797
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,280
I'm taking all the bananas.

798
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,860
The Caribbean Islands.

799
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,800
All the Caribbean Islands.

800
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,780
That's my little chunk.

801
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,100
I'm just going to take that wedge.

802
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,780
I'm taking all the carabaras.

803
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,880
Well, you know, I still have dibs on the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

804
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,520
Grand Canyon.

805
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,820
I'm taking all the treasures of the Iraqi National Museum.

806
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,180
I'm taking all the treasures of the Iraqi National Museum.

807
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:48,960
I'm taking all the treasures of the Iraqi National Museum.

808
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,500
Lost in questions.

809
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,160
Lost in time.

810
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,920
Lost in space.

811
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,460
Lost in a quest for holy grails and grace.

812
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,620
A wild cry cuts through the night sky below.

813
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,200
Another traveler's packed and ready to go.

814
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,700
I can feel more.

815
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,600
I can feel more down.

816
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:24,040
I can see more white, blue, green, and brown.

817
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,480
I can hear the lights of night turn to sound.

818
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,600
I can feel I'm out of town.

819
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,000
I can stop.

820
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,860
I'm falling down.

821
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:48,020
I can see the world spinning around and around

822
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,600
and around.

823
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,800
spinning around.

824
00:40:53,120 --> 00:41:01,100
I'm spinning around spinning around and around.

825
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,340
Spinning around and around, and around.

826
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,280
Spinning around, and around.

827
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,380
сейчас

828
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,880
Chaz Smith, a clip from his new rock opera.

829
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,640
There's more of that coming up, actually.

830
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,320
And, well, surprises in store.

831
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,200
I'm terribly sorry to intrude on your hour of slack,

832
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,140
but I eat plutonium, and subsequently, I fart radiation,

833
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,340
and I thought you ought to know that.

834
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,140
Now back to the end of the world.

835
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,180
Praise God.

836
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,860
And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

837
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,940
This is your last chance.

838
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,960
After this, there is no turning back.

839
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,500
You take the blue pill.

840
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,980
The story ends.

841
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,980
You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.

842
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,720
You take the red pill.

843
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,540
You take the red pill.

844
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,400
You take the red pill.

845
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,280
You take the red pill.

846
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,120
You take the red pill.

847
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,040
You take the red pill.

848
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:44,920
You take the red pill.

849
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,540
You take the red pill.

850
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,560
You stay in Wonderland.

851
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,240
You stay in Wonderland.

852
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,360
And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

853
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,240
Goes.

854
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:51,960
Goes.

855
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,140
And you can get that red pill.

856
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,740
His hands are bloody.

857
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,000
His head is unbound.

858
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,700
For the locals.

859
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,320
I have to take a break for the locals here.

860
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,120
And his brow is furrowed.

861
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,440
For the locals, you can take that red pill.

862
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:10,780
Coming up next week, Thursday night, I will not be here because I will be at Brushwood

863
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,400
awaiting the rupture, my friends.

864
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,300
Sitting in a pile of his own pieces.

865
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,960
Hoping against hope.

866
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,240
The X's will come down.

867
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:28,420
And Dave and Stang and Princess Wee and Legume and Ed Strange and Doc and Froppin and Sister D

868
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,120
and the whole litany.

869
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:31,960
We'll be there.

870
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,140
Beggars and thieves.

871
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,000
We'll be there.

872
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,780
A whole lot of the old timers and a whole lot of the new covers.

873
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,940
One big family of beggars and thieves.

874
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:39,860
X-Day.

875
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,760
The subgenius.

876
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,480
End of the world.

877
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,560
I'm going to grow a crab claw out of my left hand.

878
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,820
And you can get more information if you want to go to that there party.

879
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:54,700
I'm going to grab Legume's and I'm going to take Legume and grab him by the teeth.

880
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,980
Then I'm going to go back to the dinosaur age in a time machine.

881
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,160
I'm going to use that thing to make love to an ankylosaur.

882
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,800
I'm sure this talk of Legume's sex life is making us all bored.

883
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,600
I'm going to take that pussy.

884
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,040
I'm going to take that bit of a kitten ice cream.

885
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,040


886
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,260
I'm going to take that conversation hand and reach for a star and pull it down.

887
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,460
And there's Legume's shock parts.

888
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,080
So, stuck smelling.

889
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,020
Okay, well you can get more information if you want to go to that at...

890
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:29,580
At www.subgenius.com or at brushwood.com.

891
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,880
Hell, just find your way to Sherman, New York.

892
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,300
Ask the locals.

893
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,580
Ask the locals.

894
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,360
You won't even have to ask.

895
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,840
They'll take one look at you and go,

896
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,100
Oh.

897
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,760
You're looking for that.

898
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,800
Bailey Hill Road.

899
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,120
Bailey Hill Road.

900
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:43,720
Go down there.

901
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,800
Turn left at the Amish guy in the cart.

902
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,680
You'll see.

903
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,600
You'll know when you're there.

904
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,800
You'll with it.

905
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,160
The bags on your feet.

906
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,720
When they see those polystyrene bags on your feet and this other strange hazmat uniform.

907
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,080
The boys are going to be the shirts in this game of life, my friends.

908
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,620
And we'll let you gals be the skins.

909
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,560
And by their dudes shall they be known.

910
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,000
Now we're going to have a football game.

911
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,840
Touch football.

912
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,080
Football.

913
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,260
It don't count unless you leave a mark.

914
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,720
Oh, there's a whole special Olympics.

915
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,940
A game of Frick's Ministeria.

916
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,820
We're going to have a game of touch the donkey's foot.

917
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,140
And golf.

918
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,000
We've got like a whole.

919
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,980
Oh, there's a superhero ball.

920
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,160
Jesus is coming as money man.

921
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,280
Some extreme sports.

922
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,300
We'll be making soap out of pink rectums.

923
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,560
Dave, what extreme sport are you partaking in?

924
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,220
The blaster game.

925
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:38,480
It's two 300-pound howitzer or cannons placed at either end of a field pointed directly at each other.

926
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,600
With all of the pink boys and girls all assembled right behind them.

927
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,840
And at one fell swoop, they all expectorated.

928
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,220
Oh, there goes another one.

929
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:48,720
Frick.

930
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,720
And it again.

931
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,860
Bob escaped from hell.

932
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:56,100
He dug his way out using his entrenching tool.

933
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,340
He tricked the devil in a card game.

934
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,120
He cuckolded the devil.

935
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,980
He got kicked out of hell, friends.

936
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,560
Bob still flying that jet plane overhead.

937
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,320
He's protected.

938
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,840
See for your eyes.

939
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,840
You are a disbeliever.

940
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,060
For some genius menace, praise Bob.

941
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:12,780
That's all right.

942
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,380
Sit right down here on this stump.

943
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,200
We won't talk petty games or unusual behavior.

944
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,200
Now, your name is on the dossier.

945
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,000
Very clearly it is pronounced like this.

946
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,820
I know a bit of petty games.

947
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:31,140
We will discuss how you can get out of here in the most efficacious way.

948
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,140
You don't want to pay too much.

949
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,060
You want to be safe.

950
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,280
You want to be bad.

951
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,060
I'm sorry.

952
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,800
Yeah, my pleasure vessel where it's always a stadium concert.

953
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,400
It's a never-ending party in the stadium.

954
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,180
One after another.

955
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,980
I don't think we could describe what our pleasure vessel would be like.

956
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,080
Could we, Princess?

957
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,840
Mine is very, very hard to describe.

958
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,920
It's kind of interdimensional in nature.

959
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,140
You take one step one way and then the next thing you know.

960
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,500
You could lose it there, man.

961
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,640
You know, you could lose it.

962
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,980
Actually, you know what song I want to play since this is the end of the world and all that?

963
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,900
You know, finally, we just have to do it.

964
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,800
Because they always yell it out anyway.

965
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,160
So here you go.

966
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,840
Everybody yells it out.

967
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,740
I remember when they used to yell them all the time.

968
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,720
They would hold their little frustration fingers.

969
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,940
Up with the lighters in them.

970
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,680
Yeah, I remember.

971
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,080
I remember that time.

972
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,300
Do you remember when the bird went down?

973
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,600
It was so sad of day.

974
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,440
Oh, how can you forget those times?

975
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,260
How could you forget?

976
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,660
The whole band was pretty much gone in the one fell swoop.

977
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,300
But the memory keeps going back.

978
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:55,700
Oh, yeah.

979
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,300
Bad memory keeps going back on you.

980
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,340
Oh, yeah.

981
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,440
Sometimes you...

982
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:00,900
Hey, Dave.

983
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,020
Be a simple kind of man, would you?

984
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,500
Stop being so oblique.

985
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,300
Be a simple kind of man.

986
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:07,540
Be straightforward.

987
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,300
Say what you really mean.

988
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,260
Be a simple kind of man.

989
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,800
I want to...

990
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,520
I want to...

991
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:17,700
That's better.

992
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,980
...and in it

993
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,420
When the trumpet calls, X-Day

994
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,880
In a brother and sister band

995
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,240
When they blow the world away

996
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,980
We shall have paradise

997
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,760
Subgenie of the world unite

998
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,980
Alien sex every night

999
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,960
Subgenie of the world

1000
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,620
Subgenie of the world

1001
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,880
Subgenie of the world unite

1002
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,340
Stay in hand

1003
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,960
When the trumpet calls

1004
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:05,960


1005
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:35,920
I'll next time.

1006
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,400
Our coming friends, and you are too.

1007
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,980
They didn't take us seriously last time.

1008
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,200
Hell, half of you didn't take us seriously.

1009
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,400
Didn't take Dobbs' prophecy seriously.

1010
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,140
But this time we've learned our lesson.

1011
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,840
We can't rely on invisible monsters from outer space.

1012
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,880
We can't even rely on Bob.

1013
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,040
We have to learn how to escape Earth

1014
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,300
without being dependent on the conspiracy

1015
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,120
or any extraterrestrials or salesmen.

1016
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,340
Sure, send in your 30 bucks,

1017
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:11,220
but build your own ship!

1018
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,640
You may not have to,

1019
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,160
but just recover your ass.

1020
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,340
Build your own ship!

1021
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,900
Even better, go buy Hangar 18

1022
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,680
or Area 51 or Cape Canaveral

1023
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,260
or Studio 54

1024
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:27,360
and steal your own ship!

1025
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,600
Ah, yes.

1026
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,340
Extract your own fuel.

1027
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,440
And while you're at it, friends,

1028
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,540
let's swab the deck on the spaceship

1029
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,640
that we're already stuck together on.

1030
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,720
We're already riding on the spaceship

1031
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,480
and it's in bad shape.

1032
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,480
And it's high time we cleaned it up.

1033
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,440
Earth, we must get off!

1034
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,840
Whether we leave it or leave it a cinder.

1035
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:56,620
Whether we blow it off or blow it up,

1036
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,540
just don't blow it, friends!

1037
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,280
Do not measure this.

1038
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:13,280


1039
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:13,280


1040
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,760
Info team ever seen the air commentary?

1041
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:16,760


1042
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:16,760

Without asking why

1051
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,980
Footprints in the sand stretch for a hundred miles

1052
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:49,140
And every now and then they're washed away by another tide

1053
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,420
But the world still won't make sense for tomorrow's child

1054
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:01,300
And the wind blows through your hair on the final ride

1055
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:07,280
And you let go of all your cares because now it's time to fly

1056
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:13,420
And your soul is left to bear no more to hide the child

1057

No more to hide the child

1058

No more to hide the child

1059
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:43,860
Have you ever stood and prayed at the altar steps

1060
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:50,160
Looking through steel eyes from an eagle's nest

1061
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:56,660
And watched the waves roll right into the last lost soul

1062
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:01,220
And take a breath and still your heart

1063
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,920
Not to cry

1064
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:04,920

In man's state

1068
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:21,580
But don't function on us

1069
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:24,380
And be afraid of the princely

1070
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,360
Okie, so hear this

No more to hide the child

1082
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,260
To hide

1083
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,400
To hide

1084
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,920
To hide

1085
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,680
To hide

1086
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,540
To hide

1087
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,780
Into the sun

1088
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:27,300
That is the most horrifying thing I've ever heard.

1089
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:31,180
You are trying to sterilize decent pink American humanity.

1090
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:38,040
We're trying to sweep clean the filth and the trash that has ruined this planet.

1091
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:43,820
It's a small project compared to those of our mentors, the exes from outer space.

1092
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:51,060
They would have cleaned up the vermin, which we call humans, long, long ago.

1093
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:58,000
Thousands of years ago had Bob, the first Bob, not intervened and won his bar bet with Satan.

1094
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,500
And that's why we're here now.

1095
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,200
Bob won.

1096
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,280
He won that bet for your sins, brother,

1097
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:04,420
