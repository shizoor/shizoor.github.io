1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,740
I'm from under the walls. This is the suburb where the walls crack.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:27,980
My voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice.

3
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,240
Am I really coming in?

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,400
Crank my voice.

5
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,940
Yes, there we go.

6
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,520
Oh, praise Elvis, dear friends.

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,440
And praise George.

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,520
More sugar, dear friends.

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,200
We're really going to miss George and those mellow oldies.

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,780
You know, after a couple of weeks when he goes on to New York City.

11
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,160
Because we needed that softer sort of carpet underfoot.

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,680
It's a slackless environment.

13
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:12,460
Before we, you know, we needed that before it got trod upon by the sheer ugliness.

14
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,460
The ugliness, dear friends, of the arrr slack.

15
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:19,740
Slack.

16
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,400
The horror of Bob.

17
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,120
Pity.

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,200
Oh, pity the subgeniuses.

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,340
They deserve to be treated with respect.

20
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,400
Right.

21
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,500
Right.

22
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,820
Right.

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:38,560
Right.

24
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,500
Right.

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,220
Right.

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,920
Right.

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,540
Right.

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,020
Right.

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,300
Right.

30
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,420
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

31
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:22,100
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the

32
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,380
subgenius power of switch.

33
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,320
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

34
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,400
Welcome to Subgenius Power of Switch.

35
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,400


36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,400


37
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:53,420
Subgenius radio ministry power of slack sponsored by the church of the subgenius.

38
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:03,000
The subgenius power of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,480
to be played on radio station KNON and only in the City of Dallas Texas.

40
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,840
I don't want to hurt you

41
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,680
Try and understand

42
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,480
That we can't stop now

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,400
I don't want to hurt you

44
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,360
I don't want to hurt you

45
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,360
Come on down to my house

46
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,800
You know it's looking

47
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,220
Bad

48
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,500
We don't want to hurt you

49
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,440
We just want to

50
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,000
Stork you

51
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,060
And we can't stop now

52
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,760
No we can't

53
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,880
Are you ready for

54
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,400
an incredible

55
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,900
story?

56
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,060
Wasted man!

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,260
Wasted!

58
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,700
Oh no!

59
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,680
Slash!

60
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:46,980
Slash!

61
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,280
Oh, hey!

62
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,640
Oh, praise!

63
00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:01,200
Oh, yes dear friends, this is Reverend Gordon Truby.

64
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,200
The end times are near, but there's nothing to fear.

65
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,980
If you just send us a dog.

66
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,380
If you just send us a dog.

67
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:14,380


68
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:14,380


69
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,540
And we get set.

70
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:26,680
Prepare for the launch of the bleeding head of a pulver.

71
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:33,000
Remember the motto, perform the salute.

72
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:39,140
Smack off and study the pamphlets.

73
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,360
And if you should falter, then look to the right.

74
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,360


75
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,360


76
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,360


77
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,540
To the sky.

78
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,940
Cuz Bob's always somewhere nearby.

79
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,280
There's a pipe in the sky.

80
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,740
And the father won't move anywhere.

81
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:07,380
Through the suffolk, the global, eh.

82
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,480
Through a hurricane tide.

83
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,960
That's a Mount Yankee.

84
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:13,960


85
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:13,960


86
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:13,960


87
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,000
Through a hurricane tide.

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,360
That's a Mount Yankee.

89
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,360


90
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,560
There's a pipe in the sky

91
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,880
And I'll follow it anywhere

92
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,660
So, genius people, why, there's a salt of the earth.

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,420
If you'd like to rub elbows with it,

94
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,400
sound him bouncing.

95
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,360
Yes, you rub it between the forefinger and the thumb.

96
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,740
You take the pinch of salt,

97
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,860
you rub it between the forefinger and the thumb,

98
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,700
walk with your shoes around

99
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,060
a burning, decapitated child's head,

100
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,300
and then jump into the grave and say,

101
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,540
hop on my thumb, hop on my thumb,

102
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,100
this is a problem I must overcome.

103
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,860
Play in a dead cat,

104
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,800
or a live cat that's not feeling well.

105
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,680
Then cover with the sod,

106
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,620
and when the birds chirp on the third Saturday after Micklemas,

107
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,340
take a large dill,

108
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,860
pickle, and insert it in the...

109
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,700
That's jumping up to your...

110
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,880
And so, Bob Dobbs founded his church

111
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,680
upon a sandy beach of common sense,

112
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
sense of humor, and...

113
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,180
dollars and cents.

114
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,500
A likely story, you say.

115
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,220
But it's simple, really.

116
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,800
Bob is lucky, not smart.

117
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,300
In fact, by the perverted conspiracy standards of intelligence,

118
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,980
he's gifted with incredible,

119
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,160
incredible stupidity.

120
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,980
He lives in a perpetual state of contracted consciousness.

121
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,440
This enables him to act without thinking,

122
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,760
to effortlessly surf the luck plane,

123
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,440
to float down the fabled path of least resistance,

124
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,780
to, in fact, make a million dollars each time he screws up.

125
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,200
Thus, it is not his wisdom, but his divine follies,

126
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,340
his holy blunders which we emulate.

127
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,620
The miracle is not in what Bob does to you,

128
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,800
but in what he allows you to do to yourself.

129
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,800
He brings the student to the realization that

130
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,780
everything you know is true.

131
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,240
Pull the wool over your own eyes, he admonishes,

132
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,040
and you may finally relax in the safety of your own delusions.

133
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,820
Under the conspiracy, you're being ripped off every day,

134
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,880
but you can learn to enjoy it.

135
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,380
You can choose the way you're gonna get screwed.

136
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,280
Some ways are fun.

137
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,100
Dobbs journeyed to Tibet, and under ancient holy men,

138
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,820
he perfected the arts of glandscaping and acubating.

139
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,860
He also began modeling for hundreds of magazine ads,

140
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,300
leaving early clues of his presence.

141
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,360
These old ads are the only known photos of Dobbs,

142
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,740
for he otherwise remains elusive.

143
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,660
Shunning both the spotlight and the authorities.

144
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,260
In 1979, he recruited two randomly selected nobodies,

145
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,200
Dr. Philo Drummond and Ivan Stang,

146
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,620
to begin a public outreach arm and spread his seed word of slack.

147
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,240
The church is now subjected to constant harassment

148
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,980
and attacks from every corner,

149
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,100
which only serves to illustrate how much they fear his message.

150
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,740
Some call us Satanists, or the Mockers,

151
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,140
as prophesied in the Bible as harbingers of the end times.

152
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,560
Still others dare to deny that Bob exists at all.

153
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,420
But if that were so,

154
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,040
who posed for all those magazine ads in the 50s?

155
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,320
The feminist dupes of the conspiracy charge

156
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,060
that not enough members are women.

157
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,980
Bob would agree to that.

158
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,320
Indeed, he would say,

159
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,440
there will never be enough women,

160
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,580
but at least the ones we have are all women.

161
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,220
And Bob?

162
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,100
Bob is all man.

163
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,640
The James Bond of sin masters,

164
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,520
the most dashing religious leader of his time.

165
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,680
Yes, Bob Dobbs is a sex god.

166
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,820
He has come and keeps coming,

167
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,000
again and again,

168
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,720
not to forgive your sins,

169
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,840
but to rationalize them,

170
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,100
to justify your sins.

171
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:48,920
Let me tell you the story of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

172
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,340
Bread of man and yet he,

173
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,140
he walked with the gods.

174
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,720
He wore a silly grin,

175
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,740
and he smoked a stupid pipe.

176
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,820
He fought the conspiracy every day of his life.

177
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,380
He lived the stench of many a man.

178
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,180
Fathered many children with his mighty glance.

179
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,720
He founded the religion in which we all believe.

180
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,700
Brought us all the slack that everybody needs.

181
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,080
Bob was the greatest sailor,

182
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,880
the world's man the world had ever seen.

183
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,720
He could sell the farms after he ate all the beans.

184
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,020
He could sell a pile of sh-

185
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,660
Bad stuff.

186
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,500
To a lonely fly.

187
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,600
All of us who knew him figured he would never die.

188
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,560
Bob Dobbs.

189
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,660
Bob Dobbs.

190
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,060
Bob Dobbs.

191
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,460
Bob Dobbs.

192
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:10,900
Bob Dobbs.

193
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,960
He was a real man and brave.

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,200
Bob Dobbs.

195
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,260
Bob Dobbs.

196
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,860
Is lying dead in his grave.

197
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,100
Without Bob what are we gonna do?

198
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,900
With the men from Planet X go marching through.

199
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,940
The armed world racist stuck in jail.

200
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,840
But only Bob who has not failed.

201
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,200
But now he's dead.

202
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,640
So we're doomed.

203
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,940
What to do?

204
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,180
What to do?

205
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,860
He founded the city known as Dobbs town.

206
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,460
Deep within Malaysia it was rarely found.

207
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,200
There he studied forbidden science.

208
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,960
Until that fateful day.

209
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,600
When he came unto his flock in the city by the bay.

210
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,980
Few had ever seen him.

211
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,280
Few had ever dared.

212
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,180
And most had no occasion.

213
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,120
Others just plain scared.

214
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,740
Hundreds came to Frisco for the event of the age.

215
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:41,480
When the only smiling one would step out on the stage.

216
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,660
It's a hit.

217
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,320
It's a hurt.

218
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,320
A hurt.

219
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,120
A hurt.

220
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,720
Hopped to the left and he looked to the right.

221
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,440
They stepped out with confidence in two eyes.

222
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,520
But he was a hero.

223
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,780
The cheering fans as he strode up to the light.

224
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,640
It's a hit.

225
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,700
He would have hurt an assassin's bullets.

226
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,480
It's a hit.

227
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,440
He was bold enough to shoot the last one.

228
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,200
The battle was unfair and plain.

229
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,380
The entire race was a spectacle.

230
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,120
The combat went itsmade eerie.

231
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:20,800
He went through a

232
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:20,800


233
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:20,800


234
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,220
работы

235
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,320
Life had no meaning.

236
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,320


237
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,020
Deathraid or death.

238
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,220
Liam ND

239
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:32,660
Theibilities of Ory

240
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,740
To his mane.

241
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,920
We have put in a fear

242
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,620
As we swiftly approach that final year

243
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:48,360
For in 1998 he would have set the record straight

244
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,440
But now he's dead, so we're due to a deer

245
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:02,860
Well, this has been the story of J.R. Bob Dobs

246
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:08,340
Some call him Messiah, others call him fraud

247
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:14,080
I hope that before 98, that the word gets out

248
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,440
That Bob Dobs was the only guy we couldn't do without

249
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,140
The end times are upon us, and things don't look so good

250
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,520
Bob Dobs had the answer, but was seldom

251
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:32,840
But now he's dead, so we're due to a deer

252
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,380
We're in a heap of trouble, our books are in the red

253
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:45,240
There is no joy in Mudville, now that Bob is dead

254
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:53,780
So we pray to Bible Jesus to do battle for Bob's soul

255
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:59,540
To put dog in a peanut, for strengthening our rule

256
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,820
We pray to he who needs the name of Jesus

257
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,220
That we may need no slack

258
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,820
And we pray to God and we send our money back

259
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,300
Bob Dobs, Bob Dobs

260
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,340
Our lives are worth shit without you

261
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:29,600
Bob Dobs, Bob Dobs

262
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,820
Oh dear, what we've done to you

263
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,780
What will we do?

264
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,460
Without Bob, we are in a time fix

265
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,160
When the exes come to kill us, just for kicks

266
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:52,280
If they were not in his grave, all these sub-geni would be saved

267
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,500
But it is, so our chances are nicks

268
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,140
But it is, so our chances are nicks

269
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,700
Oh yes, oh yes

270
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,400
That was Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger

271
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,140
With the latest version

272
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,660
Not my favorite, I don't think

273
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:32,280
But it is definitely the latest version of the ballad of J.R. Bob

274
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,520
Bob Dobs

275
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,120
I've been working on that video all week, you know

276
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,020

00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,000
If this was any other radio show

Oh, yeah.

320
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,120
More from Ralph Ruckus.

321
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,340
Edited by Negative Land.

322
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,680
As you can surely tell by now.

323
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,100
All on the bowling.

324
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,720
It is me darling.

325
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,740
All on the bowling.

326
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,980
The bowling.

327
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,460
Mm-hmm.

328
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,300
Mm-hmm.

329
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:28,320
Mm-hmm.

330
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,020
Oh.

331
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,100
Oh, well, dear friends.

332
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:37,780
And that's what the Hour of Slack sounded like 10 years ago.

333
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Here in 1998 on show Hour of Slack number 656.

334
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,160
We're playing a rerun of Hour of Slack number 88.

335
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,600
From, oh, I reckon it to be about 1987.

336
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,200
Sorry I had to do a rerun, friends.

337
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,720
But first off, I've had.

338
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:58,480
Two.

339
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,600
Or I'd get in even worse trouble with the other realms of church outreach.

340
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,020
And secondly, you know, there's some aspects of these ancient shows that might be better

341
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:11,620
than some aspects of modern day subgenius a-go-go shows.

342
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,340
I don't care.

343
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,660
Because this is the way Dobbs has willed it to be.

344
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,220
And everything is okay.

345
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,680
The new Stark Fist magazine is out.

346
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,860
Both of the X-Day video productions are looking.

347
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,820
Looking great.

348
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,580
We have a devival.

349
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:30,980
Oh, yeah.

350
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:35,060
We've got a devival coming up December 4th and 5th in Austin, Texas.

351
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,900
Where this show is never heard.

352
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,300
With Robert Anton Wilson, Negative Land.

353
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,160
And yours truly.

354
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,240
And Jesus Christ Church and Subgenius crew here.

355
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,140
Reverend Nikki, Deaf Chick, so forth.

356
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,060
Sponsored by Fringeware.

357
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,060
That's December 4th and 5th.

358
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,020
Robert Anton Wilson, Negative Land.

359
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,840
Church and Subgenius.

360
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,860
At Fringeware.

361
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,240
I don't know where, actually.

362
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,960
I don't know where.

363
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,100
See www.subgenius.com for details.

364
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,540
That may be my doctor.

365
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,260
Christ, Bob.

366
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,740
You can say what you want to.

367
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,900
Yeah, you can put her down.

368
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,120
But one thing you better remember...

369
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,160
They were soft and creamy,

370
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,200
and I really couldn't have done better myself.

371
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,320
Oh, me neither, friends.

372
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,040
What you're listening to, by the way, is Mashed Potatoes.

373
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,580
This is a compilation, like a compressed version,

374
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,400
of the entire Potatoes folk music album

375
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,860
from Ralph Records, edited by Negative Land.

376
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,780
Once again, Mark Hosler. Thank y'all.

377
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:48,040
I can see that he has a strong hold on this family.

378
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,620
Who do your wife and children turn to?

379
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,680
Bob.

380
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,920
With their problems?

381
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,320
Always Bob.

382
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,260
They turn to him.

383
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,680
They always turn to Bob.

384
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,300
Don't they?

385
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,040
Of course they do.

386
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,200
They don't trust you.

387
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,840
They don't trust you or Norm anymore.

388
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,620
But they trust Bobby.

389
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,100
You fear...

390
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,900
is that you're not man enough.

391
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,020
You're not man enough, are you?

392
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,520
Are you this family?

393
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,120
Get out.

394
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,620
Oh, Bobby.

395
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,420
Bobby.

396
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,140
Bobby.

397
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,780
Of course.

398
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,040
I'm sorry.

399
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,660
I'm sorry.

400
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:30,880
Uh-huh.

401
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,020
And I'm your friend.

402
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,620
But Bob's my friend too, and he passed her.

403
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,020
Don't make me drive across that creek now.

404
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,820
Not with all that heavy rain.

405
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,660
No.

406
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,440
Well, all right.

407
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,540
Let me in.

408
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,420
All right.

409
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,180
If Jesus said so, I'll...

410
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:53,360
Let's talk.

411
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,360
I'll do it, Mark!

412
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,300
I'll do it, Mark!

413
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:56,400
I'll do it, Mark!

414
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,260
I'll do it, Mark!

415
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,320
Let's talk.

416
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,380
I will talk.

417
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:12,020
And I won't take it off your guard...

418
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,760
mårest mir ط Supreme.

419
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:12,760


420
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,480
paralect

421
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,220
Faithful, doughnut.

422
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:18,860
Fare well to...

423
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:20,660
Peace!

424
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:27,220
patience rifles up to play arrest rookie

425
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,320
No, you can't call that one either.

426
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:28,860
Sorry.

427
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,140
Things we say on the air.

428
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,840
Thank you.

429
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:43,280
But, you know, one thing, friends, is be sweet to your old hometown.

430
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:44,720
Yeah.

431
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:53,220
But, you know, there's no excuse when they tell you not to go across there.

432
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,420
It doesn't matter if Jesus says to or not.

433
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,620
I don't care.

434
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,960
I don't care.

435
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:10,320
As we end another broadcast, let me say that you ain't got nothing and he's got it all.

436
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,600
And your miserable self is against the wall.

437
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,920
The only thing you have not tried is the sport of chumps.

438
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,220
That's suicide.

439
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,720
That's suicide.

440
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:32,720


441
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:32,720


442
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,480
You say there ain't no use in living.

443
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,700
It's all a waste of time.

444
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,920
And you want to throw your life away.

445
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,920
Well, people, that's just fine.

446
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,100
Go on and get it over with then.

447
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,040
Find you a bridge and take a jump.

448
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,700
Make sure you do it right the first time.

449
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,620
Because nothing's worse than a suicide chump.

450
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,620
Oh, yeah.

451
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,200
Oh, yeah.

452
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,200


453
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,200


454
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,200


455
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,200


456
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,200


457
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,200


458
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,380
Oh, yeah.

459
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,460
You say there ain't no light to shine in through the bushes up ahead.

460
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,680
And we're all going to be so sorry when we find out who was it.

461
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,260
So we get rid of now.

462
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,060
Go on and get it over with then.

463
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,020
Find you a bridge and take a jump.

464
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,440
Just make sure you do it right the first time.

465
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,580
Because nothing's worse than a suicide chump.

466
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,480
Oh, yeah.

467
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,580
Now, maybe you're scared of jumping.

468
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,640
And poison makes you sick.

469
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,200
Oh, yeah.

470
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,200


471
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,200


472
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,200


473
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,200


474
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,200


475
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,200


476
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,200


477
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,200


478
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,200


479
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,200


480
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,200


481
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,200


482
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,200


483
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,200


484
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,200


485
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,600
And you want a little attention.

486
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,840
And you need it pretty quick.

487
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,080
Don't want to mess your face up.

488
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,840
You won't know if it's you.

489
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,180
Oh, there's just so much to worry about.

490
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,940
Now, what you going to do?

491
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,100
Go on and get it over with then.

492
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,020
Find you a bridge and take a jump.

493
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,560
Just make sure you do it right the first time.

494
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,560
Because nothing's worse than a suicide chump.

495
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,260
Oh, yeah.

496
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,620
Oh, yeah.

497
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,180
Oh, yeah.

498
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,180


499
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,180


500
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,180


501
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,180


502
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,180


503
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,180


504
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,180


505
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,180


506
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,180


507
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,180


508
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,180


509
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,180


510
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,180


511
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,180


512
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,180


513
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,740
Now, maybe you're scared of jumping.

514
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,920
And poison makes you sick.

515
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,800
And you want a little attention.

516
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
And you need it pretty quick.

517
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,900
...

518
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,640
...

519
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,780
...

520
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:41,860
...

521
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:41,960
...

522
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,500
Hey, tonight's hour of slack is underwritten by the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company.

523
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:05,960
The Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company features Dobbs-approved church wear, including T-shirts and buttons and junk.

524
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,560
And that's the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company, serving the public since God knows when.

525
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,800
The post office box is five...

526
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,500
Not there anymore, unfortunately.

527
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,140
...boxes, 753-59-5148.

528
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:25,600
Thanks, Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company, for supporting K&ON.

529
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,580
Bye-bye.

530
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,520
Oh, and, uh...

531
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,140
We do have a little bit of news to cover here, my children.

532
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:56,820
Just a few places we'd like to invite you to.

533
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:05,340
A few little webs, I mean, parties that we'd just love to have your presence at.

534
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,380
And number one up on the agenda here is Robert and...

535
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:11,800
Well, actually...

536
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,720
Bucknackin' and Robert Anton Wilson at the same time, you might say, but not in the same place.

537
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,100
And actually, not entirely at the same time.

538
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:27,100
On August 7th, 1987, this Friday coming up...

539
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:33,440
You know, it's funny, folks, because even though that was 1987, here in 1998,

540
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:40,680
there is a subgenius Robert Anton Wilson show coming up in Austin, Texas, on December...

541
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,780
4th and or 5th.

542
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,820
Check with www.fringeware.com.

543
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,440
Mr. Robert Anton Wilson, he's a subgenius, it's okay.

544
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:02,760
And as a matter of fact, he's a subgenius without whom there would probably be no defined subgeniuses.

545
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,740
And that's the truth.

546
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,220
I mean, had it not been for the amazing books of Robert Anton Wilson,

547
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,780
you know, I don't know if Bob would have gone ahead and decided to release his...

548
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,580
his word to the public.

549
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,820
But when he saw that the Illuminatis trilogy and some of those other things sold,

550
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,180
why, he thought, well, I guess it's about time.

551
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,400
We will let at least a few of these people into it, if they can take it.

552
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,860
Eight-track stereo, color TV in every room.

553
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,900
The blues are the truth.

554
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:40,420
But friends, I keep having to cut in here in 1998,

555
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,000
over this 1987 subgenius show.

556
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:49,720
If I'd known how much old, specific-to-Dallas crap there was on here,

557
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,620
I'd have just done an original show.

558
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,600
It's taken me so long just to cover up the old useless...

559
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,880
Well, anyway, so it looks like we're going to have some new stuff anyway here,

560
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,640
for at least until we get to 47 on the counter.

561
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,820
Here is Bill T. Miller's beautiful piece,

562
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,700
a TV addict from his new CD.

563
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,020
Color TV in every room.

564
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,700
Rules.

565
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,100
The blues are the truth.

566
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,820
Let's watch something entertaining.

567
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,380
The blues are the truth.

568
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,340
You're not anybody in America unless you're on TV.

569
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,840
So, tell me what you think.

570
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,940
Oh heavens!

571
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,980
It's a beautiful little TV, isn't it?

572
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,380
That open, beautiful TV.

573
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:02,840
It's such a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful room.

574
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,180
It's a lightspeed torture room.

575
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,500
I want to get to have one such thing in my 2000s.

576
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,000
This side, and also pull out a little bit.

577
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,720
People pull out all these gears.

578
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:06,800
Get some out and ustedes,

579
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,160
this is basically a puddle rack.

580
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,880
All about isolationism.

581
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,220
Nosfer 레 .

582
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,280
All right.

583
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,400


584
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,500
Oh yeah.

585
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,060
You have been watching way too much TV.

586
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,480
You know I must confess,

587
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,280
I'm a television addict.

588
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,640
I just need constant stimulation.

589
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,900
Too much is never enough.

590
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,120
You know I'm dreaming in color,

591
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,480
but I'm living in black and white.

592
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,640
And I believe everything I see.

593
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,320
It's gotta be a conspiracy.

594
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,560
Oh, nonsense.

595
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,200
Anyone who looks at a screen

596
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,120
will instantly become a best-buy zombie.

597
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,620
Try to keep a low profile.

598
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,780
Avoid human contact.

599
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,280
Watching my TV.

600
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,460
And playing my guitar.

601
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,920
Oh yeah.

602
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,920
I'll be wearing socks.

603
00:37:48,920 --> 00:38:08,340
And thuicいる.

604
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,340


605
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,340


606
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,340


607
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,340


608
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,340


609
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,340


610
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,340


611
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,340


612
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,700
require�iritual behavior.

613
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:09,700


614
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,180
I'm not mad.

615
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,180


616
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,940
That's not it.

617
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:46,360
So day, so world.

618
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,920
Oh, yes, dear friends, that's the Debo's.

619
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,780
Yes, those rogue subgeniuses, the Debo's.

620
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,840
Oh, what do they call it? Debo, I guess. I don't know.

621
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,620
Why don't you own a copy of that one?

622
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,440
Well, because you're not a subgenius yet.

623
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,540
Because you haven't paid your dues.

624
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,840
I could play this song for you.

625
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,000
But I won't.

626
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,200
Good and bad told me I had to go.

627
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,380
Me and my help.

628
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,780
Me got to go pull the pillow down the bottom.

629
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,400
My Yvonne, sweet as one.

630
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,760
Me and my help.

631
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,940
Son of a gun, well, that'd be fun on the bottom.

632
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,000
Jambo lie in a crawfish pile.

633
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:15,260
I'm the man who's seen my chest fill.

634
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,820
Big guitar, pill fruit jar and became.

635
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:28,820
Son of a gun, well, that'd be fun on the bottom.

636
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,420
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

637
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,540
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

638
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,160
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

639
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,160


640
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:40,780
Ae.

641
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,040
Ah.

642
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,040


643
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,040


644
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,040


645
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,040


646
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,220
Ah.

647
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:44,580
Ah.

648
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,960
Ah.

649
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,780
Ah.

650
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,120
Ah.

651
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,720
Ah.

652
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,500
Ah.

653
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,360
Ah.

654
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,100
Ah.

655
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,560
I just don't know about, you know,

656
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,680
dozens of cheap sound effects

657
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,800
are not going to keep these people away.

658
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,660
They're going to go right down into your back pocket,

659
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,500
and they're going to go right into that wallet,

660
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,060
and they're going to pull out that card,

661
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,780
and I'm afraid that's it.

662
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,740
Look, look, okay, okay.

663
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,380
I've been in the...

664
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:35,840
Now, Doug?

665
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Just keep my daughter out of it if you possibly can.

666
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,040
I can't help it. I can't help it.

667
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,540
They followed you to the boat.

668
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,180
They got photos.

669
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,720
Very consensual.

670
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,700
They know that person never came back with you on the boat,

671
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,860
even though they were seen leaving.

672
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,680
Well, what are we supposed to do?

673
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,780
Just let the older dog...

674
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,460
This is important.

675
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:00,000
You're going to have to come up with a better story than that

676
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,760
when we go before those cameras tomorrow.

677
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,700
Don't you think there's a way to convince them

678
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,240
that these sacrifices really are necessary?

679
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,880
Well, I can't do it without your cooperation.

680
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,800
What do you think you're paying me all this money for?

681
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,700
Well, I'm trying to cooperate.

682
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,000
No one believes us.

683
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,100
You won't even cooperate with me.

684
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,060
I'm your own doctor-lawyer.

685
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,980
Now, what's going to happen when you're up before Senator Hal?

686
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,940
Hello, you're on the air.

687
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,640
I stayed to watch those broken instruments,

688
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,600
and I saw a thing so strange,

689
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:38,100
I should not dare to mention it without more evidence.

690
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,200
But that my own clear conscience strengthens me,

691
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,840
and that good companion that a hold of a man

692
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,780
was in the armor of impurity.

693
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,520
I saw it there.

694
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,760
Is this some sort of a threat?

695
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,580
A body without a head,

696
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,600
that moved along like all the others,

697
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,140
that it spew and spill.

698
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,220
I held that severed head by its own hair,

699
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,360
swinging like a lantern in its hand.

700
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,920
And the head looked at us and wept in despair

701
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,080
and made itself a lamp of its own.

702
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,840
And they were two in one and one in two.

703
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,400
Yes, one of today's troubled Malaga going with it, Tony.

704
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,860
It's a good thing we sealed him up here in this spaceship

705
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,020
and shot him into a permanent orbit,

706
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,380
high above our lost, dark planet.

707
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,340
People moving from

708
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,740
to a span and a sun.

709
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,120
We love you, dear friends.

710
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,280
And stay tuned for Robert Wisdom's

711
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:38,680
