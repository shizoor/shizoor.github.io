1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
OOOOOOOH

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,220
The subgenius hour of

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,300
SWORD

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,640
Listen up, captain told me that there might be some atmospheric disturbance over the next couple of days

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,940
What does that mean?

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,120
Can you interfere with the radio transmission?

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,320
Can you read me?

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,120
Are you there? Hello?

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,460
What we've got here is a failure to communicate

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,360
The subgenius hour of SWORD

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,720
And I don't like it any more than you, ma'am

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,540
My CP is intact

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,420
After a few minutes, Bob joined us

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,140
Oh no

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,540
Bob

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,660
Bob

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,540
Why did you shut up?

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,320
Uh, Bob

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,440
The bottle of...

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,080
The bottle of whiskey disappeared

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,540
Stop it! Stop it!

22
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,980
Haven't you done enough?

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,420
Enough what?

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,280
What?

25
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,460
Enough what?

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:07,980
What?

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,780
Thank you

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,920
When he gets like this, I just gentle him along

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,120
He's sick

30
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,300
He wasn't always like that

31
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,460
Enough

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,620
I don't know what

33
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,020
What?

34
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,500
I don't know what

35
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:26,960
I don't know

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,820
Just keep it inside

37
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,440
I don't know

38
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,920
I don't know what you're talking about

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,460
He's

40
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,680
What?

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,840
Bob

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,700
Is short

43
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,800
And full of blisters

44
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,560
There's a fellow down in Texas

45
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,240
They say his name is Bob

46
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,160
He tells me I should slap Bob

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,760
Thank you

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,440
Thank you

49
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,380
I should quit my job

50
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,680
Well I am a simple genius

51
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,720
And I must have my slack

52
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,880
If I don't live forever

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,080
I get my money back

54
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,580
They said that on July 5th

55
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,480
Of 1998

56
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,480
The earth would meet destruction

57
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,760
Suffer a deadly fate

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,940
That day was long away

59
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,140
Now it is come and gone

60
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,440
There was no fire from heaven

61
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,900
And this old world rose on

62
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,020
Well I am a simple genius

63
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,420
And I must have my slack

64
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,280
If I don't live forever

65
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,540
I get my money back

66
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,780
Poor Stang was made to suffer

67
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,480
A terrible disgrace

68
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,720
Of such humiliation

69
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,600
He feared to show his face

70
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,920
Now Bob may be laughing

71
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,620
Because we are such chumps

72
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,320
But that is no reason

73
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,340
To be down in the dumps

74
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,420
It'll all still happen

75
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,660
No need to curse or frown

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,180
They got all the right numbers

77
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,180
Just got them upside down

78
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,420
Well I am a simple genius

79
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,500
And I must have my slack

80
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,940
If I don't live forever

81
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,520
I get my money back

82
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,760
So if I can't live forever

83
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,960
Then I must have my slack

84
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,580
But that is no reason

85
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,400
To be down in the dumps

86
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,400
No need to curse or frown

87
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,580
No need to curse and frown

88
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,540
There is Bob on your shoulder

89
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,340
Let's praise him

90
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,340
Tonight all rise

91
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,160
There is Bob on your shoulder

92
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,160
Let's praise him

93
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,060
Tonight all rise

94
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,500
There is Bob on your shoulder

95
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,600
Let's praise him

96
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:40,600


97
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,880
We are frozen by dry forces

98
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,940
There is no space

99
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,440
You are bringing a storm

100
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,340
There is Bob on your shoulder

101
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,200
Let's praise him

102
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,140
Tonight all rise

103
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,420
Let's praise him

104
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,660
Tonight all rise

105
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:18,420
There is Bob on your shoulder

106
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:18,420


107
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:18,420


108
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:18,420


109
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:18,420


110
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:18,420


111
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,160
Parra is dead.

112
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,600
Evening.

113
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,580
Was Mrs. Paradine?

114
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,660
Yes, sir.

115
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:22,940
So?

116
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,760
No, sir.

117
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,340
Hmm.

118
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,260
Is that correct?

119
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,360
Yes, sir.

120
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,640
Hey, Bob.

121
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,440
Bob, Bob.

122
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:33,940
Yeah, Bob.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,320
Hey, Bob.

124
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,300
Oh, kiss my ass.

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:35,940
Hi, Bob.

126
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:36,780
Bye, Bob.

127
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,260
Bob.

128
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,040
Hello, Bob.

129
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,580
Hello, Bob.

130
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, there you go again.

131
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,620
That's cute, Bob, okay?

132
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,140
Bob.

133
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:44,620
Yeah, Bob.

134
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,280
Hello, Bob.

135
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,240
Open up your eyes to what's going on.

136
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,960
Goodbye, Bob.

137
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,180
Hey, Bob.

138
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,280
Hey, Bob.

139
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,660
How you doing?

140
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:48,880
Bob.

141
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,180
Bob.

142
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,620
Hi, Bob.

143
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:50,980
Bob.

144
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,480
Hey, Bob.

145
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:51,860
Yeah, Bob.

146
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,540
Hi, Bob.

147
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,000
How you doing there, brother Bob?

148
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:34,140
Just a bunch of brats.

149
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,200
Oh, my God.

150
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,240
You are the only one walking on all these streets with a gun.

151
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,240


152
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,280
Hey lip and something hit chair.

153
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:46,760
Oh, yeah, Bob.

154
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,000
Do you want to stop eating?

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000


156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,560
Hey, Bob.

157
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:47,560


158
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:47,620
Hold your breath.

159
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,420
The

160
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,800
The Psychoskeletons did that unusual instrumental, friends.

161
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,420
Accent on the mental.

162
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:26,220
And now we're going back to that Puzzling Evidence show with Puzzling Evidence and Dr. Howell discussing the holy subject of monsters.

163
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:35,500
And Dr. Philo U. Drummond, who grapples with an existential problem concerning his subgenius film festival.

164
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,260
There they are now.

165
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,520
What's the best way to get more mules?

166
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,340
Come on, sir. This mule looks like it's going to be time to...

167
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:48,980
That mule is...

168
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,040
That's not the mule. That's the...

169
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,600
That's not a Godzilla, but it's the female horse and that male donkey.

170
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,900
Haw, hee, haw, sir.

171
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,060
Oh, they're coming through now.

172
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,900
Oh, there they are.

173
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,800
Well, that was actually sort of anticlimax and relief.

174
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,960
We're actually going to see a huge monster.

175
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,220
Here's a huge monster.

176
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:14,780
I'm afraid.

177
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,860
A flaming token.

178
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,160
Good Lord.

179
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,800
And bullets don't seem to stop the thing.

180
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,700
That was Megagiris.

181
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,880
Uh-oh, wings humming.

182
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,480
Yeah.

183
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,220
See, once we get one monster...

184
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:27,780
Oh, sorry, two roars.

185
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,300
Yeah, they come back.

186
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,540
Boy, the stereo is really good.

187
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,020
Now wings humming.

188
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,960
It's like it's right behind me.

189
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,360
They come back.

190
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,420
They do come back?

191
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,260
They come back.

192
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,520
Oh, there it goes.

193
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,400
Those are the big wings.

194
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,140
Oh, but there they go.

195
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,720
Megagiris.

196
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,320
Spirogyrus, yes.

197
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,900
Flying off over the horizon.

198
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,580
No wonder.

199
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,300
It does seem to get yanked pretty fast.

200
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:44,720
On YouTube.

201
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:45,960
Maybe not.

202
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,440
What's that?

203
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,280
Toho Films.

204
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,000
Toho Films, too?

205
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,540
Thank heavens.

206
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,920
There'd be too many of them up.

207
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,640
Oh, no kidding.

208
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,000
But does that mean there's no...

209
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's not like they're not easy enough to get.

210
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,540
War of the Gargantuas?

211
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,180
Okay, well, maybe I'm just imagining this all.

212
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,060
Is War of the Gargantuas up there?

213
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,340
I thought I saw it there once.

214
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:03,580
Just pretend.

215
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,340
I was just looking through, and the name War of the Gargantuas popped out at me.

216
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,520
I didn't actually pursue it and watch the clip.

217
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,020
I'm having trouble.

218
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,920
I'm having trouble trying to fill my Subgenius Film Fest theme version genre.

219
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,900
The theme park of the future.

220
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,620
Right, it's the zombie subgenre.

221
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,320
The world of the future.

222
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:30,340
And I'm trying to find a TV show that had zombies in it, so I need that to fill out the theme.

223
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,020
There must be a...

224
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,960
I found a cartoon that had zombies.

225
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,380
There must be one of them.

226
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,100
I've got a film with zombies in it that you've never...

227
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,360
A cartoon?

228
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,340
No, it's not.

229
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,860
It's a low-budge, badly made, cheap film.

230
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,420
But it is...

231
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,000
It does have zombies.

232
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,860
Zombies walking along that you can certainly use.

233
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,740
See, that was the thing.

234
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:54,100
I came up with a theme formula for the Subgenius Film Fest home theme version.

235
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,080
I'm afraid the entire zombie thing is rather played out.

236
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,540
Well, no, but this was the...

237
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:58,980
Or visited, as they call it.

238
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,260
It doesn't have to do with...

239
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:00,400
Too much.

240
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,300
The zombie's just one of any number of themes you can choose, of subgenres of movies.

241
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,900
The key to this whole thing working correctly is that you have to have...

242
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,000
The movie night is designed around...

243
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:24,660
Having a cartoon, a TV series, and a feature film all in the same evening, but they all carry the same theme.

244
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:36,500
So if you've got a Western cartoon, a Western TV series, and a Western feature, then you're going to have your heist movie cartoon, your heist movie TV series, and your heist movie feature.

245
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,700
Now I'm having trouble with the zombie subgenre.

246
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,680
I found a zombie cartoon show, believe it or not.

247
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,000
There was a zombie...

248
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,140
Zombie is one of the characters.

249
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,680
I'm having trouble finding a zombie TV series, but there's plenty of zombie feature films.

250
00:12:51,880 --> 00:13:03,700
We can any number, like what you're referring to, those lesser well-known, really poor quality zombie films, all the way up to George Romero's biggest high-budget zombie movies.

251
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,960
The last one that came out, Diary of the Dead, I thought was exceptionally good.

252
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:09,860
Yeah, I did.

253
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,300
I had that one, actually, and it was good.

254
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,820
I was able to get back to the...

255
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,000
I have a...

256
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,000


257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,000


258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,440
I've seen that.

259
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,040
...feeling of the original movie.

260
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,700
Right.

261
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,500
After all these variations have been coming out over the years.

262
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,400
And some of them were just parodies of themselves, you know.

263
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,640
They weren't really...

264
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,340
They were just making a mockery of the whole concept of zombies.

265
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,880
As if you could make a mockery of something as classic as that.

266
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,820
They've been making zombies since...

267
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,320
Zombie movies have been so popular for...

268
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,600
Since the 40s.

269
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,200
Yes, I've got one with Man Tan more like a...

270
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,400
King of the Zombies.

271
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,260
King of the Zombies.

272
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,880
Yeah, that's a...

273
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,820
That one is great.

274
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,780
Man Tan Morgan saves that whole movie.

275
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,280
But did you ever see I Walked with a Zombie?

276
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,820
I think I have seen that one.

277
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,660
So that was the whole point with the Subgenius Film Fest,

278
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:07,220
is take advantage of a collection by forcing everything into this format

279
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,300
that you would have cartoons short and feature.

280
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,520
Boy, I'd be entirely for it.

281
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:13,860
In fact...

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,360
If there was only some way to work a newsreel into that.

283
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:16,800
Yeah.

284
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,960
Now, they have newsreels, but it's very hard for newsreels to follow the theme.

285
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,860
We could say we're going to eschew the theme for the newsreel

286
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,300
because the format needs a newsreel,

287
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,360
even if the newsreel chosen doesn't represent the subgenre

288
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,500
that's trying to follow the theme format for that evening.

289
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,860
You know, I mean, we're going to have to have the whole submarine genre,

290
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:44,860
the Robin Hood genre.

291
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,540
Well, there are too many of them, but there are some good ones.

292
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,820
You've got to have the Robin Hood genre, you know, the spy genre.

293
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,120
That sounds like Phineas Narcos.

294
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,660
It is.

295
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,240
He's playing his new hit, Fad World.

296
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,220
Streaming Outland.

297
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,400
It's just a showstopper, man.

298
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:11,880
It is.

299
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,380
It is.

300
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,980
Well, the show is paying off.

301
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,380
He's paying homage by not walking over his creative...

302
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,780
This cover is great.

303
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,360
I feel like someone stepped on my grave.

304
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:24,980
That's great.

305
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,840
A little shiver will have run for me.

306
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,840
I think I bought this one time because of that cover.

307
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,840
I bought it because they had their song I played earlier at the beginning of the show,

308
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,540
The Sex Made Me Stupid.

309
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,800
The video is pretty funny.

310
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,620
I saw it.

311
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,560
It was a short one.

312
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,280
It was a short one.

313
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,280


314
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,280


315
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,120
No, this isn't the one I thought it was.

316
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:59,920
Ah, that melancholy Phineas.

317
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,280
Oof.

318
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,100
Oh.

319
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,980
Now, we need the callers to call in and fill out their work sheets.

320
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:13,980


321
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:13,980


322
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:13,980


323
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:13,980


324
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:13,980


325
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:13,980


326
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:13,980


327
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:13,980


328
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,260
We're going to have to push off the evaluation form.

329
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,160
Please rate this show with a one to four scale.

330
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,000
Give us a call at...

331
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,800
...in the 510 area code.

332
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,960
That's 848...

333
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,420
...and we'll be right here to answer your questions and to make sure that if you...

334
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,100
Please bring your forms with you.

335
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,120
...any place you have them.

336
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,720
That was a mistake.

337
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,800
That was a mistake.

338
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,100
That was a mistake.

339
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,280
That was a mistake.

340
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:41,940
That was a mistake.

341
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,000
That was a mistake.

342
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,460
That was a mistake.

343
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,240
I shouldn't have done that.

344
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,400
I should have done that better.

345
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,680
I shouldn't have done that.

346
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,820
I should have done that better.

347
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,840
It's not what I intended.

348
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,920
My words got all offended.

349
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,220
It's not what I intended.

350
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,440
My words got all offended.

351
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,040
Another one.

352
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:12,980
Hi, let me help you select the information numbers.

353
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:12,980


354
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,880
They all love me, the thing they don't know me

355
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,240
They all love me, the thing they don't know me

356
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,100
I should have been there, but instead I am here

357
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,600
I should have been there, but instead I am here

358
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,740
One second of stupidity, then years of recovery

359
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,080
One second of stupidity, then years of recovery

360
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,020
One second of stupidity, then years of recovery

361
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,320
Thanks for the time, but now I feel as blind

362
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,780
Thanks for the time, but now I feel as blind

363
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,700
I didn't know what to do, and I couldn't ask you

364
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,220
I didn't know what to do, and I couldn't ask you

365
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,200
I was stupid, I was lame, you wouldn't think I had a brain

366
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,540
I was stupid, I was lame, you wouldn't think I had a brain

367
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,740
I didn't get gas, now my ass is black

368
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,160
That was a mistake, that was a mistake

369
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,520
That was a mistake, that was a mistake

370
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:33,780
That was a mistake, Condoleezza Rice

371
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,160
Condoleezza Rice, that was a mistake

372
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,360
Little Theodore did that, friends.

373
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,140
Can you believe your ears?

374
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,780
He's real, he's alive.

375
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,220
But yes, the great Reverend Little Theodore has a new album out

376
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,020
and even some videos, and you can learn more

377
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:04,860
of this great architect of fear at littletheodore.com

378
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,640
Theodore being spelled F.

379
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,280
Y-O-D-O-R, Fy-O-D-E-R

380
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,840
He is truly unbelievable, and yet I believe in him.

381
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,360
And now, puzzling evidence with Reverend Phineas Narco

382
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,900
of nationalcynical.com, calling in.

383
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,740
It's one of the few songs that the Phineas Narco guy

384
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,760
hasn't made fun of.

385
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Yeah, Phineas Narco.

386
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,100
I can't believe how he just makes fun of all these

387
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,920
He just laughs at the culture like it's a big joke.

388
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,020
He laughs at our culture.

389
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,340
He just thinks the culture's a joke.

390
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,300
I think so.

391
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,580
I think we're going to have a show where everyone talks at once.

392
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,200
Still, I'm down.

393
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,980
Okay, you should.

394
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,340
No, we already beat you to that.

395
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,040
You have to do a parody of a show where everybody talks at once.

396
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,940
Then we'll do a spoof of the parody and then a sequel.

397
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,020
And then a making of the spoof of the parody.

398
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,360
And then it'll turn out to be this big success.

399
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,020
You'll make the movie make all the money.

400
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,000
And then, of course, the watching of the making of the spoof.

401
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,140
And we'll be like, I hear everybody.

402
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,380
And then we were the first guys to do where everybody talks at once.

403
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,140
The director's cut.

404
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,860
The commentary of the watching of the making of the spoof of the sequel.

405
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,880
Everybody talks at once.

406
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,320
And then we'll adapt it for Broadway.

407
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,280
And then we'll have a direct-to-DVD version.

408
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,140
And then we'll convert it back to a movie.

409
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
And then we'll bootleg it and we'll put it on YouTube.

410
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,600
I don't talk to people that go to movies with their dad.

411
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,840
I'm going to see Shrek 4 with him.

412
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,940
You mean the director's abdomen?

413
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,360
The director's abdomen?

414
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,380
The director's abdomen?

415
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:30,440
Yeah.

416
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,740
Maybe he took it a little bit.

417
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,740
The director's abs.

418
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,180
Yeah, the director's cut.

419
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:34,800
That's hot.

420
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,540
Yeah.

421
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,700
That's the new...

422
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,460
It's like 270 a pound, though.

423
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,380
The director's...

424
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,320
Yeah, the director's...

425
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,560
Director's choice cut.

426
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,640
Well, they did have a doctor on the set.

427
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,660
The director's knee cut.

428
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,000
It's sand.

429
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,060
Director's stamped UST.

430
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,620
Have you seen my Filipino flyers?

431
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,200
Yeah, I know where they start out with the Filipino flyers in the director's cut.

432
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,540
That's the way it starts.

433
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,940
In the director...

434
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,320
At first, they start with a...

435
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,320
Just like in the old days, they start with a movie poster.

436
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,660
And if they can get anybody chomping at the movie poster, they make a trailer.

437
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,220
Really?

438
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,480
Yeah.

439
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:05,800
I don't know.

440
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,040
I don't know.

441
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,380
I don't know.

442
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:06,680
I don't know.

443
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:06,680


444
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:06,680


445
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:06,680


446
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,020
The eyeball.

447
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,140
Yeah.

448
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,160
And if the trailer works...

449
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,100
You remember eyeball?

450
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,120
Yeah.

451
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,280
Eyeball.

452
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,740
Did you see eyeball?

453
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,960
It is what you think it is.

454
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,160
Right.

455
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,140
That's the slogan.

456
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,820
It is...

457
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,580
No, the slogan was, it's about just what you think it's about.

458
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,260
I'm still trying to figure that out.

459
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,980
Do you remember The Crawling Eye?

460
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,000
Yeah.

461
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,660
I've got that in my collection.

462
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,720
You have The Crawling Eye.

463
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,560
VHS tapes.

464
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,000
Yes.

465
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,400
Yeah.

466
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,920
I have the making fun of that movie.

467
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,660
The making of The Crawling Eye.

468
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,680
Oh, in the MST3K.

469
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:39,900
The Crawling Eye.

470
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:39,900


471
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,420
Yeah.

472
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:40,540
Yeah.

473
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:40,820
Yeah.

474
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,140
Mistakes.

475
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,140
So they gave that their treatment, huh?

476
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,300
Yeah.

477
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,760
The Crawling Eye they didn't like?

478
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,480
Yes.

479
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:46,660
Yes.

480
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,440
And Zontar.

481
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,900
Man of Planets.

482
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:55,540
Zontar was probably much better in the Mystery Science Theater treatment.

483
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:01,980
What was that movie with the giant spider that was saying, my home, my home as it crawled

484
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,960
back to its cave?

485
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,880
That was it crawled back to its home.

486
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,660
That is, of course, Earth versus Moon.

487
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,260
Earth versus the spider.

488
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,300
Oh, Earth versus the spider, yeah.

489
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,720
My home.

490
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,360
My home.

491
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,460
My home.

492
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,880
You told me to go home and I'm going home to my home.

493
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,900
I'm on my way home.

494
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,540
Hey, who was it who had the bright idea of having a show with everybody talking at the

495
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,120
same time?

496
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:23,860
I don't know.

497
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,920
Was that, was that puzzling evidence?

498
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,220
Mobius rectus.

499
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,220


500
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,680
Mobius rectus in procter.

501
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,200
Underneath the floorboards.

502
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,720
Mobius rectum.

503
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,060
Yeah, I wish you wouldn't say that on the air.

504
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,240
The body beneath the floorboards.

505
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,540
Because everything comes true if you say that.

506
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:36,640
So, what was that movie?

507
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:36,640


508
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:36,740
The body beneath the floorboards.

509
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,740


510
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,740


511
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,740


512
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,740


513
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,740


514
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,740


515
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,080
But what do you have to come visit the show?

516
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,160
Well, I, I, I got a laptop.

517
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,440
I can come up and, you know, we can, we can make some sounds.

518
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,900
You should do that sometime.

519
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,500
Yeah.

520
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,860
We always have an open, an open...

521
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,160
Mix-and-mold the mystic mold...

522
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,640
Studio here.

523
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,280
Well, they're having Santa May in downtown San Jose.

524
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,500
Is that right?

525
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,620
And somewhere...

526
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,700
And, uh...

527
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,180
Santa May show up, right?

528
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,260
Wait, wait, wait.

529
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,620
What are you doing?

530
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:06,620


531
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:06,620


532
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:06,620


533
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,200
Santa may show up?

534
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,880
So there's going to be lots of furries.

535
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,600
Or daisy may.

536
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,260
Furries.

537
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,820
Walking around here.

538
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,480
Flushy world.

539
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,360
Yeah.

540
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,080
So where is that?

541
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,000
Just all over town?

542
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,820
Yeah, it's at the convention center.

543
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,720
Big convention center.

544
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,940
What is it now?

545
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,000
Fanimay Con, I think it's called.

546
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,260
Anime?

547
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,720
Fanimay.

548
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:26,840
Fanimay.

549
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,740
Fanimay.

550
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,380
You get it now?

551
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,940
They like Fanimay loans.

552
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,900
You're going to get a loan from Fanimay.

553
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,560
You'll be alone, all right?

554
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,620
There'll be a loan there.

555
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,440
No, it'll be wild.

556
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,160
You'll be alone with a lot of people.

557
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,460
Yeah, that would be good.

558
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,640
When is that, this weekend?

559
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,300
Yes.

560
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,040
That's not the strong end.

561
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,660
But I'll come up to the show, you know, and do a show.

562
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,240
That's why they're dreary music.

563
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,860
When are you having a long show?

564
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:58,160
A Frank Belknap long show or a Max Freedom long show?

565
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,920
That would be hard to know.

566
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,460
And you're right.

567
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,860
It would be better to drive that far when you know you have a long show.

568
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,540
Yes.

569
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,360
When you're drunk.

570
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,200
Those are sort of serendipitous in terms of the puzzling evidence acquisition aspect.

571
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,960
You confess your car to the man who wears the star in your mind.

572
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,900
And that was true for you, Billy Bob, growing up?

573
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:25,460
It was sort of a combo of Stones and Monkeys and Buck Owens?

574
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,940
I just liked baseball when I was a kid.

575
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,440
And you almost became a professional baseball player, right?

576
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,740
I don't know.

577
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,780
Maybe.

578
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,720
But you didn't love music when you were a kid?

579
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,620
I subscribed to a magazine called Famous Monsters of Filmland,

580
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,840
which the publisher was a guy named Forrest J. Ackerman who passed away recently.

581
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,980
Do you remember what you were listening to musically when you were a kid?

582
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,940
They had a contest.

583
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,560
They had a contest where you could build your own model.

584
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:15,860
And it could be like a King Kong or it could be anything from something that you created yourself

585
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:22,960
to like one of the monsters that was actually in some of the magazines.

586
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,840
It could be Frankenstein all the way to Phantom of the Opera.

587
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:33,180
And they made these plastic models in those days that you could buy and put together.

588
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,220
But this was like a thing you could create.

589
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,600
You could create your own world of it.

590
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,020
You know, build telephone poles, make the railroad tracks and everything.

591
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,260
And I actually did enter it once.

592
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,140
I didn't win anything.

593
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,740
But I gave it a shot.

594
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,300
But it was a big deal for us kids in those days.

595
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,980
And where does the music fit into that?

596
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:01,860
Music?

597
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,060
No, it was a monster magazine.

598
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:05,840
Right, right.

599
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,600
But I'm...

600
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,400
I entered that same contest, friends, and I lost too.

601
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,420
I love that interview.

602
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,860
Classic pink DJ versus natural unsaved subgenius Billy Bob Thornton.

603
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,920
But who is to say who is really the monster?

604
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,900
The man with the beard on top of his head?

605
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,260
Or the man with the mustache on his chin?

606
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,120
Hello?

607
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,760
Yes?

608
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,680
I've seen someone who had a mustache on one side of their face and a beard on the other half.

609
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,920
Somebody says that at one point.

610
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,180
Hello.

611
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,460
You know, you can't say that.

612
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,420
I say hello.

613
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,700
It's certainly obvious.

614
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,300
Yeah, it's right there in the script and one of the characters says it out loud.

615
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:44,720
Hello?

616
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,320
Like, what?

617
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,100
It's pretty obvious.

618
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:47,940
You mean that...

619
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,580
No, it's in Star Trek.

620
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,580
It's in the Star Trek film.

621
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,140
Oh, yes.

622
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,160
I wanted to ask you about the new Star Trek movie and what you thought of it.

623
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,760
Yeah, it was great.

624
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,180
I loved it.

625
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:04,200
And Cracked Magazine has a good article about how the Terminator series makes no sense.

626
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,340
Oh, no.

627
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:05,720
No.

628
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,080
Yeah.

629
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,440
And they split the whole thing.

630
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,360
It really bums me down.

631
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,040
Yeah, that bums me out.

632
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,440
Why, they really know how to hurt a guy.

633
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:10,860
Yeah.

634
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,940
Right where it hurts.

635
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,880
Yeah, I really...

636
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,500
You know, that's one thing I always demand of my Hollywood productions, that they must

637
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,480
make perfect sense.

638
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:18,740
Yeah.

639
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,760
Especially in the time travel movies.

640
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,780
They must always make perfect sense.

641
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:22,880
Yeah.

642
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,640
They don't make sense.

643
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,000
I mean, it's like when I walk in, you know, usually when I get my ticket, I tell the person

644
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,700
selling me the ticket that if this movie doesn't make sense, I'm going to come get my money

645
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:31,940
back.

646
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,260
I actually learned my...

647
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,820
Yeah.

648
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,020
Yeah.

649
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,040
Yeah.

650
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,100


651
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,220
Yeah.

652
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:35,340
Yeah.

653
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:35,340


654
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:35,340


655
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,900
You have to argue with them about certain plot points.

656
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,560
Right.

657
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,800
And they're always saying, no, you can't say that didn't make sense, sir.

658
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,440
And I said, yes, I can.

659
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,980
I can say anything didn't make sense if I want to.

660
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:52,260
And it's like, then we get in this philosophical discussion of what does sense even mean, you

661
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,440
know?

662
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,120
Well, you just want to choke the philosophical esophagus with the roughage of knowledge.

663
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,220
We get special comments by etymological specialists from the future.

664
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,040
And then they have to...

665
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,240
Mayfield, D. Hilden.

666
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,360
They come in to tell us what we know already and how well we know it.

667
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,160
They come in and suspend us.

668
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,660
I don't know.

669
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:18,080
Then we have to fill out the workshop evaluation forms again and rate the instructor and all

670
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,680
that stuff.

671
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,540
It's all like a...

672
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,060
It's a feedback loop.

673
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,880
We can't get out of it.

674
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,600
Fill your heart with love today.

675
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,560
Don't play that game with time.

676
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,180
Don't fill your mouth with chorizo sausage.

677
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:26,880
Hmm.

678
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:33,460
But you start talking about this or that, and the next thing you know, everybody knows.

679
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,880
It'll make you stupid.

680
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,900
But the Terminator bloopers are really about to hit you.

681
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,160
It's gotten some bad notices, but it also got an entire page full of quotable blurbs

682
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,900
of glowing notices and people saying, it'll blow you away.

683
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,100
The one thing I notice when anything comes out is that somebody likes it and somebody

684
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,840
doesn't.

685
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,000
Have you ever noticed that?

686
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,220
About things?

687
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:56,940
Why, yes.

688
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,820
Things happen that some people like them and some people don't.

689
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,960
And there's some people that make a living not liking things.

690
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,880
It's important that...

691
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,940
That audience is listening.

692
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,720
...they don't like it, because if they liked it, then they have to go over to a place where

693
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,920
they don't make as much money.

694
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:17,240
Yeah, and I was just thinking, too, that no matter who you are, there's always someone

695
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,860
in life that doesn't like you.

696
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:24,440
Yeah, if you have to put your happiness in someone else's pocket...

697
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,920
In little voices in a box.

698
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,160
You put your happiness in someone else's pocket.

699
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,000
You have to put your happiness in a little tiny speaker where these guys are talking.

700
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,360
And the bigger the world gets, the more there are people that don't like you.

701
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,180
Absolutely.

702
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,600
And then once they find out who you are, and they actually know you for a little while,

703
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,200
then they don't like you even more.

704
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,380
Yeah, but the good thing is that you can go around and take it all personally and, like,

705
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,900
drive yourself into a nervous breakdown.

706
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:56,080
Right, and then you can get in trouble, drive a car, get road rage, crash into a school

707
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,120
bus full of kids.

708
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,020
I had nothing to do with that.

709
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,720
God, man.

710
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,280
I was nowhere near there.

711
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:01,740
Yeah.

712
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,320
You could be headed, you could drive into the...

713
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,000
I think the better thing to do would be to drive to the shopping mall until you find

714
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,660
that place that's called Beard Papa.

715
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,980
Then shop to the...

716
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,740
There's a beer...

717
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,700
Oh, there's a Beard Papa right downstairs from me.

718
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,680
Oh, those things should be against the law.

719
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,660
They're horrible.

720
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,800
I mean, you can't even eat those things.

721
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,720
Well, I mean, that's the problem.

722
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,940
I can't even do that.

723
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,380
I don't have any problem eating it.

724
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,040
That's why I think they should be outlawed.

725
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,720
Well, you get them all over your clothes.

726
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,080
You get, like, the cream falls out of the cream puff.

727
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,120
You just better just bury your face in Papa's beard.

728
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:36,620
Yeah.

729
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,640
Like in a cartoon?

730
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,560
Come on home to Papa.

731
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,880
I thought it was going to be like a human image.

732
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,900
Come rest in the bosom of Abraham.

733
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,440
You know, you like a big beard and you just, like, go and take the food out of the beard

734
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,320
and eat, you know.

735
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,120
Well, I had a friend whose philosophy was if he ever got real hungry, he would just

736
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,580
make beard soup.

737
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,500
Well, there you go.

738
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,060
Just dip his beard in the pot of boiling water.

739
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,800
And then cook it for a little while.

740
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,340
And there was always enough residual food value left.

741
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,420
Not to mention the protein of a few fleas.

742
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,600
The residuals are in.

743
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,740
And now we get to eat.

744
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:12,980
There are.

745
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,700
And so they think of that change.

746
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,560
Oh, doctor.

747
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,380
The concept was.

748
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,360
Baby.

749
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:18,840
Baby.

750
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:19,740
Baby.

751
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,420
Baby.

752
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,500
Baby.

753
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:21,840


754
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:24,720
Baby.

755
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,560
Baby.

756
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:25,920
Baby.

757
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,240
Baby.

758
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:26,600


759
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:26,800
Baby.

760
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,560
Baby.

761
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:27,680
Baby.

762
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,300
Baby.

763
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:28,600
Baby.

764
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,500
Baby.

765
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,020
Baby.

766
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,160


767
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,160


768
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,500
Baby.

769
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,100
Baby.

770
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:33,500
Baby.

771
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,720
Bab.

772
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,180
Bab.

773
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,420
Bab.

774
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,480
Baby.

775
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,400
baby.

776
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:40,400


777
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:40,400


778
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,080
Jesus rides a Harley Davidson.

779
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,600
Jesus rides a Harley Davidson.

780
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,560
Jesus rides a Harley Davidson.

781
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,940
Listen listen listen.

782
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,240
We don't need Snape oil salesmen.

783
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,280
You're not getting it.

784
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,120
I'm sick and tired of preachers.

785
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,500
strategically.

786
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,720
Their revelation is their brain dead.

787
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,020
Paul said, but...

788
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,000
Now listen, listen, listen.

789
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,560
Now, I'm not lying. I'm telling you the truth.

790
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,860
I'm angry.

791
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,380
There's nothing in the Bible.

792
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,080
I'm mad.

793
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,040
What do I have to do?

794
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,480
Carnal things.

795
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,440
Evils.

796
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,060
We don't need God.

797
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,500
It's the sin of the church.

798
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,540
Listen again, you little...

799
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,180
There's nothing in the Bible.

800
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,540
What do I have to do?

801
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,340
I'm mad.

802
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,560
I'm mad at God.

803
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,340
That is an abomination.

804
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,260
Carnal things.

805
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,020
I'm angry.

806
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,720
You have no control over me.

807
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,920
You're not getting it.

808
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,980
You're not getting it.

809
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:02,980


810
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:02,980


811
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:02,980


812
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:02,980


813
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:02,980


814
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:02,980


815
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,460
Jesus Christ did not die on a cross.

816
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,760
State oil salesman.

817
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,100
Money.

818
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,160
Hungry.

819
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,800
Pride.

820
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,260
It's the sin of the church.

821
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,600
Evil spirit.

822
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:27,360
Your ambition should be self-destruction.

823
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,120
It's another dollar.

824
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,100
It's another dollar.

825
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,060
It's another dollar.

826
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,360
Money.

827
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:31,940
trucule, money.

828
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,800
Now now, I'm not lying.

829
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
I'm telling you the truth now.

830
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,560
True.

831
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:35,560


832
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,700
The anointing.

833
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:36,960
It's a sin.

834
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,520
Does not allow you to be rude.

835
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,800
The anointing.

836
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:39,800


837
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,340
Dee.

838
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:40,340


839
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,560
We..

840
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,720
prostitute the word of God.

841
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,420
Shame on you.

842
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,880
Shame on you.

00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh, yes, bud.

847
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,820
Let's get out there

848
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,160
and have a rally for bo-bob.

Is Bob at home? Are there any more at home like you?

851
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,580
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

852
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,100
Yeah, hello, Bob.

853
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,500
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

854
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,720
Norrell Preff got hold of Bob's answer machine tape.

855
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:20,620
Before that, we heard that killer mix, Jesus Has a Harley, that was by Reverend Cuttlefish.

856
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,700
And before that, Lemur.

857
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:27,740
Now, more puzzling evidence with Philo, Phineas Dr. Howell, and Ima Sumac.

858
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,840
I have many tales.

859
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:31,920
Hello, Connor.

860
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,900
Yes, what's Ima Sumac's real name?

861
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,140
What's the email video name?

862
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,760
Ima Sumac.

863
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,120
Oh, her real name was Ima Sumac.

864
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,920
Ima Sumac.

865
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,500
Spelled with a Y, yes.

866
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,100
No, it was A-Tamu.

867
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,400
No, no, no, that internet.

868
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,120
Backward.

869
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,580
Yeah, yeah.

870
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,340
Oh, nobody thought of that before.

871
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,140
Amazing.

872
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,000
That's pretty clever, Connor.

873
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,260
That's been...

874
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:00,760
It's true.

875
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,760
It's been totally debunked.

876
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,640
I grew up with her.

877
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,720
Yeah, I know.

878
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,000
You're old enough.

879
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,600
Yeah, you grew up with her.

880
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,140
Yeah, I know.

881
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,480
But did you date Kirk's mom?

882
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah, did you date Kirk's mom?

883
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,760
Kirk's mom.

884
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,540
That's the important thing.

885
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,580
A real milk, Kirk.

886
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,940
I didn't like Kirk's mom.

887
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,200
Amy Sumac.

888
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,460
Ima Kamis.

889
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,400
Danger, Will Robinson, danger.

890
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,540
Danger.

891
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,360
Danger.

892
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,220
There's Ima now.

893
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,060
Ah, yeah.

894
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,800
She killed the show.

895
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,160
I like her.

896
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,320
I think she advances the show.

897
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,340
See, no one knows what to say

898
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,260
because we're just listening to this great...

899
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,080
Now someone turned us on this path.

900
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,160
When you mention Ima Sumac pretty soon,

901
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,940
well, that's what's going on here.

902
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,740
Ima Sumac.

903
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,720
Voice of the X-Men.

904
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,900
So where did you guys grow up?

905
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,740
What is it, Mark?

906
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,380
Well, he grew up with Ima Sumac.

907
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,780
I'm trying to do nail polish down at the restaurant.

908
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,580
I like your room.

909
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,100
I'm in the kitchen.

910
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,000
I can't.

911
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,700
There's too much.

912
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,380
Yeah, Bob.

913
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:06,720
Bob.

914
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,020
Bob.

915
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,540
Hello, Bob.

916
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:07,980
Where's Bob?

917
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,560
Hi, Bob.

918
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:08,920
Bob.

919
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,460
Yeah, Bob.

920
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:09,760
Bob.

921
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,500
Hello, Bob, darling.

922
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,000
Bob.

923
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,380
Bob.

924
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:11,940
Hi, Bob.

925
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,120
Bob.

926
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:12,700
Bob.

927
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,020
Bob.

928
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,600
Yes, Bob.

929
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:13,840
Bob.

930
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,320
Is it Bob?

931
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:14,960
Yeah, Bob.

932
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,520
Bob.

933
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:15,780
Bob.

934
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,000
Bob.

935
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,500
Bob.

936
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:16,620


937
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:16,920
Bob.

938
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,300
It ain't worth Jack

939
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,140
If it doesn't give you slack

940
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,440
It ain't worth Jack

941
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,360
If it doesn't give you slack

942
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,660
It ain't worth Jack

943
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,620
If it doesn't give you slack

944
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,880
It ain't worth Jack

945
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,440
If it doesn't give you slack

946
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,520
Could it be

947
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,760
You're on the wrong track

948
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,280
If it doesn't give you slack

949
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,280


950
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,280


951
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:59,620
If it doesn't give you slack, well maybe you need to change tack.

952
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:09,740
If it doesn't give you slack, just perhaps you've got it front to back.

953
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:17,160
If it doesn't give you slack, you need to trust Max.

954
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,000
It ain't worth jack.

955
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,880
It ain't worth jack.

956
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:29,040
If it doesn't give you slack, it ain't worth jack.

957
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,980
If it doesn't give you slack.

958
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,380
Could it be you're on the wrong track?

959
00:37:52,640 --> 00:38:02,240
If it doesn't give you slack, well maybe you need to change tack.

960
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:12,360
If it doesn't give you slack, just perhaps you've got it front to back.

961
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,360
If it doesn't give you slack.

962
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,780
You need to trust Max.

963
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,620
It ain't worth jack.

964
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,480
It ain't worth jack.

965
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,400
If it doesn't give you slack.

966
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,700
It ain't worth jack.

967
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,620
If it doesn't give you slack.

968
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,920
It ain't worth jack.

969
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:42,160
If it doesn't give you slack, it ain't worth jack.

970
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,040
If it doesn't give you slack.

971
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,140
Whenever you got.

972
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,500
It's all sweet.

973
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,540
Cause your mind, your spirit and your soul are free.

974
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,880
There's no substitute for slack.

975
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,700
Believe me.

976
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,440
Whenever you've got slack, living's easy.

977
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,160
It ain't worth jack if it doesn't give you slack.

978
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,380
It ain't worth jack if it doesn't give you slack.

979
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,580
It ain't worth jack if it doesn't give you slack.

980
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:26,760
It ain't worth jack if it doesn't give you slack.

981
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,520
If it doesn't give you slack, it ain't worth jack.

982
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:46,660
Max Slack of MaxSlack.net did that.

983
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,680
That very song.

984
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,120
Max Slack is a great band name, isn't it?

985
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,980
New bands are starting up all the time and they need names.

986
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,180
Gary suggests we start a new band.

987
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,640
Well, don't say what the band's name is cause that will, you know.

988
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,540
He suggested we call it Blood Blisters.

989
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,320
That song was based on a Cro-Magnon skinning chant.

990
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,400
I always wanted to promote the name Blood Bong.

991
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,800
Blood Bong, I like that.

992
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,440
How about this one?

993
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,680
Lazy Head.

994
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,680
Hmm.

995
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,860
I like Fist Witch.

996
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,220
Dark Wind.

997
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,960
Dark Wind.

998
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,720
Well, as long as you have plenty of toilet.

999
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,780
That is a good one.

1000
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,760
How about Brown Smell?

1001
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,800
Well, there you go.

1002
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,500
You see, Philo, the irrepressible.

1003
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,040
He has fountains, wells of humor which can never be capped.

1004
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,540
Can never ever be capped.

1005
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,520
Time to introduce Contrary.

1006
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,780
Motion into the proceedings.

1007
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,700
Even this late in the day.

1008
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,760
We still have to have some eye out for parliamentary procedure.

1009
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:54,500
That's right.

1010
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,820
I'm going to turn the chair over to the floor.

1011
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,140
Now, unless we want to table the motion.

1012
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,140
Turn the chair upside down over to the floor.

1013
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,520
Or we could shelf the...

1014
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,720
Let's just shelf the whole concept.

1015
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,100
Oh, I love those old jokes.

1016
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,780
Yeah, yeah.

1017
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,400
Let's, uh...

1018
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,860
We'll put it in the freezer.

1019
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,360
We'll come back in a hundred years.

1020
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,120
We'll see what's left.

1021
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,100
After a hundred years, who will care?

1022
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,340
We can one up the flagpole and see the salutes.

1023
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:30,120
Did you see the, uh, that new series on the History Channel about, uh, life after people?

1024
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,040
Life after people.

1025
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,920
No, I didn't. It didn't interest me at all.

1026
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,580
Oh, really?

1027
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,100
It shows how the world falls apart after all the people.

1028
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,640
What do I care? I'm not going to be there.

1029
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,160
That's the point, though. I mean, you get to be there without me.

1030
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,960
Maybe you'll be the only one who's left while you get to watch all this stuff.

1031
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,640
I don't want to be there without me there.

1032
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,500
I mean, what fun would it be if I'm not there?

1033
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,920
Uh, well, I don't know.

1034
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,600
See, people forget about that. If you're not there, how do you...

1035
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,220
What do you care about being there for?

1036
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,140
Why don't you just be there?

1037
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,900
You know? Well, that'd be the point.

1038
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,880
Why don't you just be there instead of going through this convoluted process of imagining what it's like to not be there?

1039
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,480
Oh, what about the road? This is about the...

1040
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,720
Well, the show shows that, uh...

1041
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,140
It's all about the road. That's the point. It's about the road.

1042
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,840
Nothing could be better for the world than for the humans to disappear.

1043
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:15,740
But...

1044
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,420
The big, bare part is about the road.

1045
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,280
I think we're gonna see more movies about...

1046
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:20,380
No.

1047
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,640
It all dissolves into gray goo.

1048
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,440
Gray goo.

1049
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,520
This is where I got my bookmarks come in handy.

1050
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:27,920
Gray goo.

1051
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,900
Phylo's miracle cure for assholes.

1052
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,360
The road appears ever, ever on out from the door where it began.

1053
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,960
This elixir has been brought...

1054
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,120
You can't say that on the air.

1055
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,960
No, you can't.

1056
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,440
Oh, yeah. Oh, you can't?

1057
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:43,860
No.

1058
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,120
I think you can. That's not one of the regular words.

1059
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,220
You can mention elixir or...

1060
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:51,720
No, no.

1061
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,460
Elixir.

1062
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,020
You can mention, uh, the, uh, the elixir.

1063
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,740
Yeah, you can mention the elixir.

1064
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,600
Well, what else does he do?

1065
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,600
Spirits.

1066
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:03,880
What?

1067
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,160
Or gods that used to share this earth with man.

1068
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,420
Somewhere. Oh, yeah. The old band name list. There it is.

1069
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,440
So old it is new.

1070
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,540
Gorgons, hydras, and chimeras.

1071
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,200
Everything old is new again.

1072
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,120
Again?

1073
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,720
Again and again.

1074
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,320
Again and again.

1075
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:20,940
And again.

1076
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:21,800


1077
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:27,260
Ghoulies and ghosties and long-legged-y beasties and things that go boom to...

1078
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,000
Uh, is it Bob there, please?

1079
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:29,540
Bob?

1080
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:29,980
Bob.

1081
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:30,480
Bob.

1082
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,760
Yes, is it true that you're well-endowed?

1083
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,440
Yes, it is.

1084
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:32,740
Bob.

1085
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,040
Bob.

1086
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:33,340
Bob.

1087
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:33,880
Oh, yes, Bob.

1088
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:34,300
Bob.

1089
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:34,740
Hey, Bob.

1090
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,180
Bob.

1091
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:35,620
Bob.

1092
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,500
Bob, we love you.

1093
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:36,920
Bob.

1094
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,020
Bob.

1095
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,240
Bob.

1096
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:37,400
Hey, Bob.

1097
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,040
I'd like to request free bird.

1098
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,360
Bob.

1099
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:39,700
Bob.

1100
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:39,880
Bob.

1101
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,700
What's the meaning of life?

1102
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,180
Yes, Bob?

1103
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:45,260
If you've been institutionalized as many times as I have, there are so many forms

1104
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,740
to fill out for these different big vehicles now.

1105
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:52,420
Why don't you win a big car because they know you will go up on the sidewalk and try and

1106
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,560
crush old ladies and stuff.

1107
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,840
And I personally, I'm tired of paperworking.

1108
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,220
That's an American right.

1109
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,160
All right, we got Tara...

1110
00:43:59,160 --> 00:43:59,940
Of course.

1111
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,340
Nowadays, it's all dressed up.

1112
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,240
You have to fill out forms to crush an old lady on the sidewalk.

1113
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:04,980
We got Tara.

1114
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,220
We got Tara.

1115
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,880
But then you have to have permission to do something stupid on drugs.

1116
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,800
We got one more caller here.

1117
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,400
We got one more caller here.

1118
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:15,800
Yes, good evening.

1119
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:16,860
Yes.

1120
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,280
Yeah, I just wanted to just add something real quickly here.

1121
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,940
I think I drive in the safest vehicle on earth.

1122
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,940
The bus?

1123
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,000
No, no.

1124
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,940
I drive a smart car.

1125
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,840
I just never, there are no cell phones allowed in my car.

1126
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,440
Yeah, a cell phone free car is definitely a safer car.

1127
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,120
I truly believe it's the safest experience.

1128
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,720
Smart cars, man, those things are real tough.

1129
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,120
I saw somebody not too long ago checking my cell phone.

1130
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,160
My dad just bought a new car that's part phone.

1131
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,880
It's like a phone car.

1132
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,280
It's both things combined.

1133
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,160
You put your ear up to the exhaust pipe and you...

1134
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,600
See, you may be onto something.

1135
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,480
I think the way to bail out GM and Chrysler,

1136
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,460
is for Apple to purchase them.

1137
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,180
And I think they will end up making the phone car.

1138
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,320
And that will save GM and Chrysler.

1139
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,260
Do you think if we let you get jobs for our car companies,

1140
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,420
that we would be better off?

1141
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,560
I was joking, man.

1142
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,820
I think we would.

1143
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,020
You never know.

1144
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,880
It'd be interesting to see some really,

1145
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,380
some of the more innovative thinkers in the business world

1146
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,500
put in charge of some of these companies.

1147
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,780
One American car company, I would say, in the next couple of years.

1148
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,380
Oh.

1149
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,740
It's like if we bail out the car,

1150
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,220
then we have to bail out the bike industry,

1151
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,960
and then we have to bail out the foot industry.

1152
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,680
We'll have to bail out the entire foot industry.

1153
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,920
People won't even be able to walk unless they have government subsidies.

1154
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,960
You know what would be really cool?

1155
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,720
Where will it end?

1156
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,340
I was just going to add that in Stang's father's case,

1157
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,760
he just talks to himself in the car and he thinks it's a cell phone car.

1158
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,120
He's just...

1159
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,220
And he gesticulates wildly and stuff,

1160
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,280
and he also thinks it's a VidCam car.

1161
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:00,980
It's just a car.

1162
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:01,020
Yeah.

1163
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:01,720
What's with watching?

1164
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,100
What's with watching television in a car?

1165
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,080
I still haven't understood that.

1166
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,440
Am I behind the scenes?

1167
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,300
That's what we call trans-porn-tainment.

1168
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,700
And it's commonly in New York.

1169
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,260
My friend Bleepo Abernathy reported seeing people driving around

1170
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:20,600
in the streets of New York with hardcore porno

1171
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,720
up where their rearview mirror should be.

1172
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,320
And those were religious organizations.

1173
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,460
Right, yeah, but that's New York City.

1174
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,700
I mean, it'll take a couple of years before that kind of behavior filters

1175
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,360
to a place like Cleveland.

1176
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:31,800
I think the only thing...

1177
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,400
People that should have televisions in their cars

1178
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,820
are pizza delivery guys.

1179
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,680
They're the only ones that should be allowed to have that.

1180
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,100
Oh, my goodness.

1181
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,400
That is as if delivery drivers weren't dangerous enough already.

1182
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,820
But that's a whole other kettle of fish,

1183
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,360
and we just might get into that next week.

1184
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,540
I certainly hope you do.

1185
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,720
All right, good night.

1186
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,960
And I've got to say good night to Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

1187
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,080
Reverend Stang, no money, Mark.

1188
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,540
I really appreciate your contributions this evening.

1189
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,660
We'll have to do this again.

1190
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:01,320
Sorry it wasn't more livid,

1191
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,760
but times are desperate,

1192
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,040
so we enjoyed being desperate with you.

1193
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,280
All right, desperate times call for desperate measures

1194
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,120
like WCSB Cleveland.

1195
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:13,380
Which is not the station you're listening to necessarily,

1196
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,240
but the one carrying radio synesthesia,

1197
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,740
from which that was recorded in 2008

1198
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:24,820
with host Dr. Sinister and callers such as Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1199
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,700
It was prophetic, friends,

1200
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,500
like Bob's prophecy of X-Day,

1201
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,840
July 5th, when the world ends,

1202
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,120
right around the corner.

1203
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,980
And if you don't, check out the details at subgenius.com.

1204
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:41,720
If you don't repent, quit your job, and slack off,

1205
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:47,140
then you too will be part of Jehovah's dreadful harvest.

1206
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,880
Ah, yes.

1207
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,060
Well, um, hmm.

1208
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,140
That gives us pause.

1209
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,120
Yeah, just hold on there for a while.

1210
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:57,380
Cat's pause.

1211
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,700
Cat got your tongue?

1212
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,580
Cat eyes?

1213
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,220
Cat eyes.

1214
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,980
That's the tale of it.

1215
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,020
The cat got your tongue.

1216
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,240
And I'm the king of the cats.

1217
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,220
Well, I'll be up there sometime.

1218
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,140
Okay, yeah, come on up.

1219
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,700
Yeah, I'll bring a...

1220
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,760
Come on up.

1221
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,600
We'll bring a bucket of fisher tissues out.

1222
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,420
Yeah, a bucket of chicken.

1223
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,480
Bucket of phlegm.

1224
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,700
No, you can't say that.

1225
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,380
You can say bucket of fisher tissues.

1226
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,320
A bucket of chicken legs.

1227
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,280
And we'll discuss that phlegmish tapestry afterwards.

1228
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,020
I said over and over and over

1229
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:35,580
Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again

1230
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,260
This is gonna be a

1231
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,580
Self-genius

1232
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,940
Power of

1233
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,120
Swag

1234
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,180
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever

1235
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,180
Jealousy, anger, selfishness, rage, whatever

1236
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,280
Entering people.

1237
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,060
Enter, enter.

1238
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,560
They can actually enter and they can actually enter.

1239
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,840
Make you make, make you make.

1240
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,120
You should do this, you know.

1241
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,100
Or why don't you just go sleep with ten guys?

1242
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:57,800
Make some money.

1243
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,720
Your ego.

1244
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,600
She was.

1245
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:00,320
Dark.

1246
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,660
You know, whatever.

1247
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,120
You know, pimps.

1248
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:03,900
Go to Africa.

1249
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,580
It's actually transmitted disease.

1250
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,540
There's tension.

1251
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:07,600
Prostitutes.

1252
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,380
Preachers who are on drugs.

1253
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,260
Reality.

1254
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,100
And I had post-traumatic stress disorder.

1255
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,080
How could that be?

1256
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,100
Pimp, pimp, pimp.

1257
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,220
You have no control.

1258
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,000
Pimp, pimp.

1259
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:16,980
What influences thinking?

1260
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,040
Everything you do.

1261
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:18,640
Your mind.

1262
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,800
Prostitutes and pimps in the pulpit.

1263
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,100
They're all over.

1264
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,020
You know, we're into emo music.

1265
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,020
Where we emote emotional emotions.

1266
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:28,960
Emotions.

1267
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,620
And so, my fellow Americans.

1268
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,760
Ask not.

1269
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,240
How about the celibate satyrs?

1270
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:37,920
That's a good one.

1271
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,060
Ask what you can do.

1272
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:39,720
Ask what you can do.

1273
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,280
That's a good one.

1274
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:40,840
Oh, yeah.

1275
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,260
I know it.

1276
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:42,980
There's nothing left anymore.

1277
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,920
Wait, you know what's gonna happen?

1278
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,460
There's nothing left anymore.

1279
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:45,740
There's nothing left anymore.

1280
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,280
It's not enough to countermand the flow of time.

1281
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,060
You have to change far greater numbers of people acting.

1282
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,240
Then you'll be on your show.

1283
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:53,540
Right.

1284
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,160
Then we'll have the listening of the maker of the probability.

1285
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:56,600
So, what else?

1286
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,420
I mean, is something different?

1287
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,780
The listening of the maker means the sound of the pro.

1288
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,000
Otherwise, you're bringing up the problem.

1289
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:00,640
playing a

1290
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,300
S.E.P.

1291
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:01,640
and his

1292
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,240
bargain song

1293
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,220
on the show

1294
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,940
of K-P.I.

1295
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:05,000
May.

1296
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,780
You can just

1297
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,800
watch it later

1298
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,800
on YouTube.

1299
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,680
You'll be the

1300
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,400
watching of the

1301
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,020
listening of the

1302
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:13,880
making of the

1303
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,100
show.

1304
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,200
The documentary

1305
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,020
of the show.

1306
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:17,760
You know,

1307
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,020
Beard Soup is

1308
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:19,800
not a bad band

1309
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,300
name either,

1310
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,320
but it has to be

1311
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,180
like ZZ Top.

1312
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:22,920
Yeah,

1313
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,120
you have ZZ Top

1314
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,000
and Beard Soup.

1315
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:26,940
Fallen.

1316
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,140
Fallen is

1317
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:28,440
suffering.

1318
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,200
We had a band

1319
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:30,980
called The Cups.

1320
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:31,800
Did you say

1321
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,320
The Cups?

1322
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:33,260
Stalin.

1323
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,120
Oh, Stalin.

1324
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:34,780
I thought you said

1325
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,260
The Cups.

1326
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:35,580
How about

1327
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,080
Fallen?

1328
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:36,960
How'd that happen?

1329
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:37,960
Stalin and The Cups

1330
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,400
don't sound

1331
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,180
anything alike.

1332
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,040
Beats me,

1333
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:41,620
but I said

1334
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,800
Beats me.

1335
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,460
That's a good

1336
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,260
name for a band.

1337
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:44,860
What about

1338
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,420
like Double Bills

1339
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:46,900
of bands

1340
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,580
like Pink and

1341
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:48,920
Hole?

1342
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,020
Yeah,

1343
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,100
that'd be good.

1344
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:51,320
Yeah,

1345
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,040
Interesting Double

1346
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:52,500
Bills.

1347
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:52,680
Yeah,

1348
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:52,880
yeah,

1349
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,140
yeah.

1350
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:54,520
We're going to

1351
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,900
work on that one.

1352
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,220
Interesting Double

1353
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:57,760
Bills.

1354
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,240
I'm going to

1355
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:58,820
do that.

1356
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,180
That's a good

1357
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:00,440
one.

1358
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,540
To the

1359
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,420
gravesite comes

1360
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,180
death's great

1361
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:06,700
retinue.

1362
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,520
Boy,

1363
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,360
you kids today

1364
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,040
are the greatest

1365
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:09,520
and I gotta

1366
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:09,940
tell you,

1367
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,500
I'm behind

1368
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,180
you wonderful

1369
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,080
lovable kids

1370
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,940
100%.

1371
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,060
I don't know

1372
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:14,520
what this

1373
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:16,620
affectation

1374
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:17,380
with Bob

1375
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:17,640
holds.

1376
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,540
Bob is

1377
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,000
our only

1378
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,300
hope.

1379
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:21,840
Bob.

1380
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,460
I know

1381
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,300
Jesus is

1382
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:23,640
our,

1383
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,040
is our

1384
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,060
only hope.

1385
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:26,500
But this

1386
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,080
song makes

1387
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:27,640
me feel so

1388
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,060
sad.

1389
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:28,560
It does.

1390
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,420
It always

1391
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,140
makes me feel

1392
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,400
sad.

1393
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,100
I think it's

1394
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:31,660
something about

1395
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:32,280
that particular

1396
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:32,800
choice.

1397
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,820
A melodic

1398
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,580
structure is

1399
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:34,840
called,

1400
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,660
when they

1401
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,100
check it

1402
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:36,380
out of the

1403
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:36,760
library,

1404
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,280
it's called

1405
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:37,940
sad.

1406
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:38,960
Yeah.

1407
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,460
And you

1408
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,080
just check it

1409
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:40,380
out of the

1410
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:40,980
sound library

1411
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,360
and you

1412
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:41,780
plug it

1413
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,080
into your

1414
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:42,520
song.

1415
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,180
You put

1416
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:43,440
it in your

1417
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:43,720
iPod.

1418
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,280
Okay,

1419
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:44,520
I'm doing

1420
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:44,740
that.

1421
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:44,960
But all

1422
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,260
I'm doing

1423
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:45,480
is that

1424
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:45,780
buzzing.

1425
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,000
You like

1426
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,500
walk around

1427
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,220
downtown and

1428
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,600
just get

1429
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:47,860
really,

1430
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,520
really depressed.

1431
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,140
Yeah,

1432
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:49,880
your tears

1433
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,460
streaming down

1434
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:50,820
your face.

1435
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,040
Depressed,

1436
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:51,400
you're out

1437
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,360
enjoying fresh

1438
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,000
air on

1439
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,340
God's

1440
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,260
green earth

1441
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,020
without even

1442
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:55,660
looking at

1443
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:55,880
this.

1444
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,300
The lights

1445
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:56,860
are changing.

1446
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:57,740
Remember,

1447
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:58,780
the Lord

1448
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,980
only in

1449
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:00,400
his will

1450
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,060
holds you

1451
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,440
up from

1452
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,380
being snatched

1453
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:03,980
down into

1454
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,000
the flaming

1455
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,620
pit of

1456
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:06,140
hell at

1457
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:06,740
any second.

1458
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,460
It's just

1459
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:07,940
that the

1460
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,960
tears streaming

1461
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,580
down your

1462
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:09,740
face.

1463
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,400
The blood

1464
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,100
streaming down

1465
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:13,640
your face?

1466
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:14,000
No,

1467
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:14,480
the tears.

1468
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,380
Because you're

1469
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,020
just crying,

1470
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:16,440
crying,

1471
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:16,680
crying.

1472
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,240
Yeah,

1473
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,280
but the blood

1474
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:18,700
would give you

1475
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,100
something to

1476
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:19,600
cry about,

1477
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,620
waiting for

1478
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,040
the day

1479
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:21,620
that you'll

1480
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:21,900
be in

1481
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:22,160
hell.

1482
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:22,800
Well,

1483
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:23,220
that's true.

1484
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:23,960
You won't

1485
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,240
cry.

1486
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,020
It might

1487
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:25,260
make you

1488
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,340
feel better,

1489
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:28,800
actually.

1490
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:29,800
Bob,

1491
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,120

00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:32,140
I need to

1499
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:32,480
talk to Bob.

1500
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:32,760
Yeah,

Hello,

Yes,

1535
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:42,520
Bob.

1536
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:42,960
Bob.

1537
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,600
W-A-X-U

1538
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,820
W-Z-X-V

1539
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,280
I love

1540
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,060
and I can't help but think

1541
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:53,800
can't help but think

1542
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,540
I want to get involved

1543
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,400
I want to get involved

1544
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,520
probably not substantive

1545
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,660
here's what we feel

1546
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:58,360
here's what we think

1547
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,480
probably not substantive

1548
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,180
moronic

1549
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,520
Florida cancelled

1550
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,940
the Florida government

1551
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:03,860
oh man

1552
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,600
getting all excited

1553
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,360
this is spontaneous

1554
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,240
Dick Army

1555
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,140
Dick Army's face

1556
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,000
Dick Army's

1557
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,760
Dick Army's the guy

1558
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,900
and he is a really

1559
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,880
really cool guy

1560
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,740
I love him

1561
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,620
I love him

1562
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,240
I've been with him

1563
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:13,820
several times

1564
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,640
he's a really

1565
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,440
really cool guy

1566
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,520
I love it

1567
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,140
and so I was there

1568
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,060
talking with Dick

1569
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,380
and he just got this

1570
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,280
grin on his face

1571
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:21,560
Dick

1572
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,160
Monokluinski

1573
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:23,760
everything else

1574
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:26,780
I'd be lying

1575
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,540
on the floor

1576
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,260
in a pool of blood

1577
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,040
with my wife Susan

1578
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,720
Dick Army

1579
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,760
the Dick Army show

1580
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,860
40 minutes of Dick Army

1581
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,020
wasn't this big

1582
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,420
a right wing conspiracy

1583
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,060
I got

1584
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:37,560
conspiracy

1585
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:38,700
yeah

1586
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,100
yeah

1587
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:39,400
oh

1588
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,380
think

1589
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:40,980
think

1590
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:41,200
think

1591
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:41,760
so hard

1592
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,200
so hard

1593
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:42,600
I'm very

1594
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:42,940
very bad

1595
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:43,340
very

1596
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:43,920
buddy

1597
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,300
buddy

1598
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,160
my hole

1599
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,040
my hole

1600
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:46,800
my hole

1601
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,300
so whatever

1602
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:47,720
parties

1603
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:47,980
parties

1604
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:48,180
parties

1605
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:48,840
I love

1606
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,800
Dr. Ballsack

1607
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,680
is in here twice

1608
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,580
and I don't think

1609
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,140
that's right

1610
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:53,120
what's that disease

1611
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,800
that makes you

1612
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,620
sweat blood

1613
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:55,660
out of the pores

1614
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,240
of your skin

1615
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,320
oh that's

1616
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,480
crucifictophobia

1617
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,520
that's

1618
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,780
what Jesus did

1619
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,100
right

1620
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:01,720
in the garden

1621
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,680
of Gethsemane

1622
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,140
Ebola

1623
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:03,980
Ebola

1624
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,160
Jesus did

1625
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,020
weep blood

1626
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:06,760
and then of course

1627
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,540
it was the plague

1628
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,740
against which

1629
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,020
Prince Prospero

1630
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:10,680
shot himself

1631
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,060
up in his castle

1632
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,220
Ebola that's what we need

1633
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:12,980
the red death

1634
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,000
he didn't just

1635
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,280
he sweated blood

1636
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,120
because he was

1637
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:15,940
such intense

1638
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,280
oh no that's

1639
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,940
I sweated blood

1640
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:20,940
when I worked over

1641
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,440
those income tax returns

1642
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,660
I gotta tell you

1643
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,440
how about

1644
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,320
the earnest bastards

1645
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,160
the earnest

1646
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,480
that's a good one

1647
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,340
the earnest bastards

1648
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:29,880
marching society

1649
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,000

00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,880

1655
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,560
the Nazi

1656
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,000
family

1657
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:39,720
misspelled

1658
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,380
it might be a little

1659
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:40,740
violent

1660
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,800
they are partisan

1661
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,340
fighters

1662
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,100
in the woods

1663
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,300

elephant's breath

1667
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,940
somebody open the window

1668
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,400

1669
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,000

buckets and buckets

1671
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,660

1672
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,700
America's favorite

00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,460

of the drive-in theater

1677
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:01,820
screen

1678
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,200
it's kiddy land

1679
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,600
people forget about

1680
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,360
Bud and Sis

1681
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,260

1682
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,000
of the feature

1683
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,480
and the

1684
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,660
short subject

1685
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,900
while they swing

1686
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:10,560
on the trains

1687
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,600
and slide on the slides

1688
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,320
and get out of the

1689
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,320
twist and twiddle

1690
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,000
on the unicorn

1691
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,780
merry-go-round

1692
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,780
after dark

1693
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,320
it's the snack bar

1694
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,120
and total immersion

1695
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,240
in the

1696
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:20,900
Baptist

1697
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,180
tide pool

1698
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:22,900
that's a good one

1699
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,340
all six

1700
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,140
cheers to a carload

1701
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,920
at the

1702
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:27,660
run for

1703
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,140
suicide

1704
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,440
morning drive-in

1705
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,080
theater experience

1706
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,080
in the center round

1707
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:33,460
of the air

1708
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,180
with Rumble Rama

1709
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:34,860
and

1710
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,860
we're still doing shows

1711
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:36,740
somewhere in the world

1712
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:37,200
right now

1713
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,160
the moment you think about it

1714
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,560
I'm twittering

1715
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,480
the show right now

1716
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,320
he's not

1717
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:42,880
he tickles

1718
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,080
I'm perusing

1719
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:46,900
the webpage

1720
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:50,800
www.quiveringbrain.com

1721
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,560
where I can find

1722
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,760
downloads of the show

1723
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,820
in various forms

1724
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:55,580

1725
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:56,460
even back to

1726
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,580
kpfa.org

1727
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,820
where the show's

1728
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,640
archived for

1729
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,940
like two years

1730
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,620
two long years

1731
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,520
Dr. Philo Drummond

1732
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,060
on the puzzling

1733
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:06,800
evidence show there

1734
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,900
with Dr. Howell

1735
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,020
and Phineas Narco

1736
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:09,640
before that

1737
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,380
Norrell Preff

1738
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,400
interspersed two or three

1739
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,140
times with them

1740
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,160
and some lemur

1741
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,880
of which there will be more

1742
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,020
this is

1743
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:16,880
the hour of slack

1744
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,680
from the church

1745
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,340
of the subgenius

1746
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,740
to learn more

1747
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,520
about the church

1748
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,200
our upchucking events

1749
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,000
and so on

1750
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,380
you can check out

1755

417

1756
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,820
Cleveland Heights

1757
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,160
Ohio

1758
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,080
44118

1759
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,040
the music in the background

1760
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,400
is by me

1761
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,220
and now

1762
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,700
the kleptones

1763
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,720
sometimes

1764
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,200
to tell the day

1765
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,120
by the bottle

1766
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,620
that you drink

1767
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:49,400
in times when you're alone

1768
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,520
all you do is think

1769
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,520
I'm a cowboy

1770
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,140
on a steel horse

1771
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,320
I ride

1772
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,880
I'm warning

1773
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,840
warning

1774
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,180

1779
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,360
oh

1780
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:15,180
you're out

1781
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:17,380
man

1782
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,360
you're out

1783
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,080
yee

1784
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:21,600
aah

1785
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,080
killer

1786
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,320
half

1787
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,580
sorry about this kids

1788
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,680
but stay tuned

1789
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,720
we've got some real good

1790
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,680
commercials coming right up

1791
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,420
text員

1792
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:36,420


1793
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:36,420


1794
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,120
Hey

1795
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,260
How is Dolph

1796
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:39,260


1797
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,400
you a dreamer

1798
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:40,820
Chinese

1799
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:41,620
е

1800
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:42,940
Yeah.

1801
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,240
I haven't seen too many around lately.

1802
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,560
Things have been tough lately for dreamers.

1803
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,560
They say dreaming's dead, and no one does it anymore.

1804
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,720
It's not dead, it's just it's been forgotten.

1805
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,940
We've moved from our language.

1806
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,880
Nobody teaches it, so no one knows it exists.

1807
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,920
The dreamer's banished to obscurity.

1808
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,340
I'm trying to change all that, and I hope you are too.

1809
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,560
By dreaming every day.

1810
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,780
The Kleptones, with a K.

1811
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,200
And now, Lemur.

1812
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:35,880
The dreamer is supplemented.

1813
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:49,640
The example and inspiration children can first receive.

1814
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,820
From their dreams.

1815
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:25,280
The family that prays together.

1816
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:31,420
Prays together.

1817
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,120
Prays together.

1818
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:34,960
Hey, Bob.

1819
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:36,300
Bob.

1820
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:36,560
Bob.

1821
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:36,640
Bob.

1822
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,380
Hello, Bob.

1823
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:37,860
Yeah, Bob.

1824
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:38,140
Bob.

1825
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:38,660
Bob.

1826
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,080
Yeah, Bob.

1827
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:39,480
Hello, Bob.

1828
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:39,820
Bob.

1829
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,020
Bob.
