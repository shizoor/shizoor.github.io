1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,920
The Self-Genius Power of Smoking

2
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:59,980
The Self-Genius Power of Smoking

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,380
Don't you ever know, uber women, uber men

4
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,380
Doing everything we can to yell about the word of God

5
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,060
And verbally attack to praise our heavy heritage

6
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,780
And follow in our slack

7
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,660
The Self-Genius Levi

8
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,160
That taps into the high vibe

9
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,880
While simultaneously and successfully manipulating both space and time

10
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,220
I'm a Self-Genius Bar, dammit

11
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,020
I'm the head of the Industrial National Committee

12
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,920
We're blowing psychic snog rockets out of all three tonight

13
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:30,900
13013

14
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,360
I sure ain't human, but I am a Ghanaiite

15
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,940
I can feel the sounds of my farts with the meows of kittens

16
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,820
Kittens for Bob and Catnip and Flop

17
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,080
Kittens for Bob and Catnip and Flop

18
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,680
You get my lot or police bio

19
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,940
You ain't always safe, but we'll make sure you start to ะตะด

20
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,220
I'm Smitho, OMG myself

21
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,240
I'm Smitho

22
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,520
OMG meows

23
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,300
I'm Smitho, OMG myself

24
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:25,720
Umm, there's hi-hats in the dust

25
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,900
I wish something else to come out of this

26
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,580
Oh, yes, dear friends, that was Rubik's Pube.

27
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,060
Rubik's with an X, Pube with a P.

28
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:46,120
A piece called Bob Rant A from their new album, Songs for Time Travel, which is on Bandcamp.

29
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:55,240
A funny coincidence, the other night I just finished re-watching one of my favorite movies of all time,

30
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,180
George Powell's The Time Machine from 1960, which I saw at age seven.

31
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:09,040
And it blew my mind and probably set me off on my journey into weirdness and fun and bulldada.

32
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:16,540
And I'd also watched a kind of making of The Time Machine, including an epilogue to the story.

33
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:25,220
The very next thing I did was check my email, and the first thing up was the promo for Songs for Time.

34
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,120
Time Travel, a new album by Rubik's Pube.

35
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,620
How can such things even be?

36
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,380
They must have been time traveling.

37
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,620
Songs for Time Travel.

38
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:48,140
Anyway, Rubik's Pube is a great mountain-based mutant rock band that has played at many X Days and Devivals and bars and festivals.

39
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,800
In fact, some members, like Lord Rock God, son of Sinfaltimus Ex Mortis,

40
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,220
have been doing...

41
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,000
They've been doing so since they were young teenagers.

42
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:09,320
That lead guitar player and singer, Reverend Ness, incidentally, is as jaw-droopingly beautiful as her sounds are.

43
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,800
As it says here.

44
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,640
Jaw-droopingly beautiful.

45
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,860
Well, that's good.

46
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,360
Anyway, tonight I have two news items, friends.

47
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,880
For the last couple of shows, I've been playing readings from the subgenius mystery.

48
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,520
The agent and Mr. Dobbs.

49
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,140
And I'll play more tonight.

50
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,920
And the book is now finally available.

51
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,780
It's out.

52
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:40,100
It's in our catalog on subgenius.com, but probably not for long.

53
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,760
It's a very limited edition in hardback.

54
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,900
In fact, I announced it yesterday, and about half of the 40 copies are already gone, even though it's expensive.

55
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,240
Here's the ad.

56
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,260
Two.

57
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:03,480
Two brain-gnarling spy thriller mystery novellas starring J.R. Bob Dobbs in one limited numbered hardcover edition.

58
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,980
Only 50 were printed, and the author has three of them.

59
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,540
In the early 60s, this is the plot description,

60
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:21,400
an earnest patriotic and pink agent for the feds is assigned to the seriously insane national security case of Bob Dobbs.

61
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,840
He's drawn by Dobbs.

62
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,740
He's drawn by Dobbs.

63
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,600
He's drawn by Dobbs.

64
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,160
He's drawn by Dobbs.

65
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,340
He's drawn by Dobbs.

66
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,480
He's drawn by Dobbs.

67
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:30,600
He's drawn by Dobbs.

68
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:30,600


69
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:30,600


70
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:30,600


71
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:30,600


72
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:30,980
He's drawn by Bob Dobbs.

73
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:40,120
Bizarre parties with JFK, Hitler, Lee Harvey Oswald, Fidel Castro, Nikita Khrushchev, and Timothy Leary,

74
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:47,780
and unspeakable experiences that make him question what he had mistakenly thought of as reality.

75
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,520
It's like HP Lovecraft, by way of Raymond Chandler, by way of R.

76
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,260
crumb, like a David Lynch movie with a dollop of the Three Stooges, like a Bugs Bunny cartoon

77
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:08,460
guest directed by David Cronenberg, like an S. Clay Wilson comic novelized by Franz Kafka.

78
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,280
Now, friends, this is me talking. I've written two subgenius movie screenplays, but if some

79
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,140
Hollywood hotshot approached me saying, I've got a hundred million bucks for a big subgenius movie,

80
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:25,660
do you have a script? I'd hand him this book. It's really hilarious, and honestly, it's my

81
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:35,160
very favorite portrait of Bob so far. Let us just pray that it is indeed fiction. Extremely

82
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,240
collectible. The forward is signed and dated by Ivan Stang. Don't look for this on Amazon. It's

83
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,860
available only from Subgenius Foundation. Look in our catalog. Actually, the link is

84
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,120
subgenius.com.

85
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:57,940
slash catalog slash books, but just go to the Bulldog of Time Control store or look at the

86
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:04,600
front page, the home page of subgenius.com, and there you will see somewhere, if you read close

87
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,660
enough, you'll see it listed, along with the other three new novels. No, two other new novels.

88
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,020
Oh, by the way, the music in the background is the Empire Jazz Orchestra. Our friend,

89
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,040
Reverend Meckley.

90
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:26,740
Meckley ran that, and this was an album called Out of the Mist. This is a quiet one there in the

91
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:33,580
background. Okay. The other news is about X-Day, where and when, but first, let's hear more Agent

92
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:43,800
and Mr. Dobbs. And now I'm going to read part five of the Agent and Mr. Dobbs, which was brought

93
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,960
to us by Reverend Teeters LaVerge, although it's actually written by this unnamed agent.

94
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,980
Okay. Is everything, everything's running right? Good.

95
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:03,580
After all the monkey business, as Bob called it, he was in a much better mood. I suppose all that

96
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:10,140
man needs is to take a number three and fling a bit of feces around to, quote, even his keel.

97
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,860
His grin was radiant as we walked out into that hot, humid night. We tarried around his car for

98
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,120
a few minutes. They were the most relaxed moments of our lives. We were in a car that was not

99
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,460
used to the time. We had a lot of fun. This is a good example of the moments that I'd had with Mr.

100
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,440
Dobbs up to this point. I offhandedly asked him for a cigarette, and though I had never seen him

101
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:33,260
smoke anything but his infernal pipe, he pulled a pack of my favorite brand of smokes, old tar lung,

102
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,420
from his jacket pocket. It was a needed smoke, one that I had not had since I got rotated back

103
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:47,160
from Korea in 52. Bob smiled at my obvious joy, telling me, those coffin nails sure make a tasty

104
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,660
cancer in you, Binks.

105
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,220
Spread it on my fresh-sliced human pain toast every morning.

106
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,480
Bob then hopped, like a drunken rabbit, into the driver's side of the vehicle and shouted to me that

107
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,740
now we're going to have some real good fun, boy. Get in. Now!

108
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:11,580
He then let out the most outrageously poor simulation of a rebel yell that I have ever heard.

109
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:18,040
It sounded more like the mating calls of those great apes that reside in the deepest, darkest Congo.

110
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,140
It reverberated through the thick night air.

111
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,980
I think I may have heard a call in response, but it could just have been a drunken redneck.

112
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:36,480
We sped off down a semi-hidden dirt road that ran behind his toy and tuna factory, Genetic Aerospace Research Center.

113
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:45,380
The vines and leaves hung low as we whipped down this lane, so low and sharp that my face quickly became a mass of scratches.

114
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,020
Bob would occasionally look over at me.

115
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,460
He would pat me and leer, telling me in an oily voice that you're looking sweeter by the minute.

116
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:01,880
My heart was in my throat, not only because of the insane driving, but I also feared that Bob might have other, more perverted plans for me.

117
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:13,600
This seemed too painfully real of a possibility to me, for Bob started to sniff the air lustfully and play pocket pool again, vigorously.

118
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,860
After a few tense moments for me, Mr.

119
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:29,240
Dobbs was cool as a perverted cucumber the whole time, we finally slid to a halt in front of what I can only describe as the most stinking, run down, decrepit roadhouse that ever sat in the middle of nowhere.

120
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,280
It was a truly ramshackle affair.

121
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,500
Half of the neon signs only had a letter or two lit up.

122
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,240
There was a huge pile of smelly trash out front.

123
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:48,020
I discerned humanoid skulls in the pile, and the peeling paint said it all with the structures sign dangling off to one side.

124
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,020


125
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,020


126
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,020


127
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,460
Ye olde, exest, bar and grill-ee.

128
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,040
If the outside was a shambles, then the inside was worse.

129
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:05,260
It smelled like a cheap brewery that had been forgotten in an open sewer since the reign of Ashurnasalpal II.

130
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:14,340
I wondered why the hell Bob, a man of such wealth who could easily afford to go to any of the finest clubs in Florida, would take me here.

131
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,000
It then occurred to me that this may just be vicious.

132
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,040
I was in the hall of the

133
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,220
When we walked in the joint, the place erupted with drunken shouts of Bob!

134
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,420
And for some reason, Jar!

135
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,780
I stood amazed, for the clientele was astounding by anybody's standard.

136
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,540
I saw John Birch passionately kissing Mousy Tongue in one corner.

137
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,140
Emma Goldman's disembodied head screaming the Internationale.

138
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,940
M blanked out, M blanked out.

139
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:06,120
Stabbing, I was later to learn, our actual non-clone president in the right eye with a fork while Frank Sinatra groveled at her feet.

140
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:12,300
There were also, and the rest of the pages blanked out, and the young folk singer Bob Dylan.

141
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,220
Richard Attenborough was filming it all.

142
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,340
The worst part, however, were the whores in the joint.

143
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:28,360
Greys, greens, mobs, reptilians, anti-reptilians, them, and ones that I did not recognize.

144
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:37,040
They were all gaudily dressed as housewives, construction workers, maids, businessmen, house painters, bee girls, dead astronauts.

145
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,760
The list goes on, and all had horribly cheap bouffant wigs on.

146
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,200
Bob handed me a jar of yellowish fluo.

147
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,320
And a handful of pills, telling me that he would soon be back.

148
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,240
He took a dozen of the whores up with him, winking sickeningly at me.

149
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,600
I swallowed the pills dry.

150
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:03,980
When Bob eventually made it back down to the bar where I'd seated myself, sipping a cheap beer, his face was all aglow.

151
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,240
Literally, it shone green, then red.

152
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:14,640
One of those grey creatures was behind the bar, pouring a jelly jar full of vodka.

153
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,640
For Premier Khrushchev.

154
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,220
Bob sat down between us.

155
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,980
He still had a satisfied grin on his face that smacked of unknowable pleasures.

156
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,200
Bob suggested that we have a drinking contest.

157
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:35,480
The pills were really kicking in at this point, so I found it hard to believe my eyes, but even harder to deny what I was actually seeing.

158
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,820
This is our place.

159
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,120
The real place where things get done, he whispered to me.

160
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,620
Then, speaking directly to Bob, I said,

161
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,100
And then, speaking directly to the Premier of the Soviet Union, he said,

162
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,840
So, Nicky, think you can drink me under the table tonight, eh?

163
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,520
Khrushchev looked at Bob straight in the eye, something I've seen very few attempt.

164
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:02,440
Yes, Mr. Noobs, I drink until you, how you say, blow O-ring.

165
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,120
The grey then passed Bob, Khrushchev and I, a full jelly jar each of vodka.

166
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,440
Both Khrushchev and Bob down there, I was halfway through mine,

167
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,480
had to run outside to vomit.

168
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,660
I swear it was paint thinner, the label on the bottle had paint thinner crossed out and vodka written underneath.

169
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,660
My original guess of it being moonshine was awfully wrong.

170
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:32,140
When I stumbled back in, bleary-eyed, I bumped into no less than Richard M. Nixon.

171
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,820
Even if my eyes were blurred, I could not mistake his voice.

172
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,680
He cursed me as he chased a small dog around.

173
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,040
I made my weaving way back up to the bar,

174
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,480
where Bob and Nicky were now glaring and laughing manically at each other

175
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,740
while pounding their shoes on the bar top.

176
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,440
It would seem that Bob had won the paint thinner drinking contest.

177
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,600
For as I sat down on my stool, Khrushchev's eyes rolled to the back of his head

178
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,660
and he fell off his bar stool onto the sodden floor and into oblivion.

179
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,680
I was horrified and asked Bob if he were alright,

180
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,780
for this could be a potentially world-destructive event.

181
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,520
Mr. Noobs told me,

182
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,020
He's fine, the little guy.

183
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,200
Tyke, you'll be ready for another one in the morning,

184
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,660
but first, young agent, let us have a snack.

185
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,640
I feared that suggestion of food,

186
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,160
for my stomach was still in knots from being sick.

187
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,000
But Bob nonetheless led me to a long table

188
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,540
covered with all manner of edibles, if you dare call them that.

189
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,680
There was a bucket of small red-colored balls of a gelatinous material

190
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,960
that Bob told me were prairie squid caviar.

191
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,780
I had to run back outside to get sick again.

192
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
It smelled like rotten fish bait.

193
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,940
Bob seemed to relish them,

194
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,920
for he ate the whole large bucket full with his grimy hands.

195
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,000
He let out a belch and for some reason rubbed his backside.

196
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,180
I vomited harder at that stench.

197
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,960
When I made it back inside, worse for wear,

198
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,060
Bob told me he wanted to try my luck out at one of the many card tables.

199
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,000
The rest of the evening was a horrible blur,

200
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,540
for not only did he force-feed me pills,

201
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,020
but he kept buying round after round of the local actual ones.

202
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,320
I was a little bit moonshine, thank God.

203
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,820
Mr. Dobbs could hold his liquor well,

204
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,320
though he did seem to flicker bodily on and off like a broken television,

205
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,500
especially when he did poorly at the games of chance.

206
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:30,000
At one point we, Bob, Mal, Churchill, a beatnik type,

207
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,620
Ed Sullivan, a strange alien-looking creature with the face of a cuttlefish,

208
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,160
and I were playing some sort of complicated card game

209
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,200
where the cards themselves represented different currencies.

210
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,740
Worlds and immortal souls.

211
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,240
Bob lost the big hand of the night.

212
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,920
In a rare fit of anger, he grabbed the cards from the alien

213
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,640
and threw them on the floor, cursing,

214
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,680
Well, I do believe that I've been cheated.

215
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,460
He then grabbed, wrong side up it seemed to me,

216
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,140
an IOU written on a bar napkin and squinted his drunken eyes at it,

217
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,600
saying, I guess I'll see you in 1998.

218
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,440
He slurred under his breath,

219
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,080
and then he said,

220
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,680
I'm a fucking fool.

221
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,900
Ah, screw you, you damn cheating squid.

222
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,260
Though it was Bob, I knew who had been the one that was cheating,

223
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,680
for he kept, not very slickly, mind you,

224
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,320
grabbing cards out of my hand when he claimed he needed them.

225
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,460
The whole event, from what I can remember, was pathetic,

226
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,720
but what disturbed me the most was one of the cards had a picture of our planet on it,

227
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,060
and the alien-looking creature seemed to relish the fact that he had won it.

228
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,860
Bob, in a panicked state that I've never seen before,

229
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,320
hustled me so violently toward the door that we knocked over Mr. Nixon,

230
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,660
who was sitting cross-legged on the floor,

231
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,740
grilling skewers of meat over an open fire.

232
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,540
He cursed us, mumbling that he got the taste for dog

233
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,680
while doing some brain massaging during a trip to North Korea,

234
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,420
and how we ruined his meal, though we'd all soon be dancing to his tune.

235
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,240
Nixon did, however, hand us a cheaply mimeographed booklet,

236
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,140
entitled, How to Serve Man.

237
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,560
With that, Mr. Dobbs' face relaxed a little.

238
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,220
He nudged me with his elbow, grinning, and saying in a bit of an oily voice,

239
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,800
Good recipes in this one.

240
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,240
He chuckled to himself as we walked out into the misty morning light.

241
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,620
I can still hear the dreadful sound and import of his index finger

242
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:38,400
tapping hard against that thin manual of evil.

243
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,440
Also agreed.

244
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,380
Good Tiara...

245
00:18:59,380 --> 00:18:59,380


246
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,380
I was tremendous frustrated as best could be 18

247
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:03,380


248
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:03,380


249
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:03,380


250
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:03,380


251
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:03,380


252
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:03,380


253
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,540
Thank you.

254
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,900
Thank you.

255
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,620
Thank you.

256
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:49,440
To urinate, whatever happens, do not urinate.

257
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:16,980
Thank you.

258
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,980
Thank you.

259
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,880
The Rudy Schwartz Project.

260
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,820
Of course.

261
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:16,260
A piece called Granny Trout is Aroused by the Erotic Spatulate Dance

262
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,020
from the album Adjacent to the Latex Gerbil.

263
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,340
Ear-pleasing and killing.

264
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,580
You might check out Rudy Schwartz Project videos on YouTube.

265
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,160
Hurry, though.

266
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,940
They just slapped his wrist pretty hard for the one called Sarah Palin.

267
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,580
I can't say it or I'll get my wrist slapped by the stations.

268
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,960
And now this.

269
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,800
Well, young agent, Mr. Dobbs said to me as we got into his car,

270
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,680
looks like we have to get you back to Washington.

271
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,780
Bob leaned against a large Cadillac and...

272
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:55,840
sighed.

273
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,660
I wasn't sure how to take this turn in his demeanor.

274
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,480
Yes, I had been confused and terrified by his actions,

275
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,020
but I'd yet to see him depressed.

276
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,380
It frightened me in a way that I could not previously have imagined.

277
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,220
Here we go.

278
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,220


279
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,220


280
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,220


281
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,220


282
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,220


283
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,220


284
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,220


285
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,220


286
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,220


287
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,320
Here has stood a man, a thing,

288
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,020
that exuded all the confidence and power that we as a people not only admire,

289
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:23,680
but need if we want to survive this complicated abyss that our species has dug itself.

290
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,720
I could only stand still, sick to the stomach,

291
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,320
for even though Bob probably is insane,

292
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,480
he is our best chance.

293
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:39,200
And after the strangeness and fragile nature of our powers that be that I'd witnessed,

294
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,220
I could...

295
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,040
see that no other human savior could...

296
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,080
redeem our slack, as Mr. Dobbs was wont to say.

297
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,060
I felt like crying for the first time in years,

298
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,260
that is, until Mr. Dobbs stunned me again.

299
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,040
He suddenly straightened his back and became hyper-alert.

300
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,720
My sense of danger ignited as I unconsciously reached for the revolver

301
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,000
that I would usually carry in a shoulder holster.

302
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,820
It, of course, was not there.

303
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,780
Bob had sold it to some street hood in Miami,

304
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,280
for a half-eaten sandwich.

305
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,860
At least that's what he told me.

306
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,500
My eyes darted into the still dim woods around us, fearing the worst.

307
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,980
When Mr. Dobbs yelled in a high-pitched voice,

308
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,000
SHINY! SHINY!

309
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,960
and ran to the edge of the dirt parking lot to pick up a small shard of glass.

310
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,120
There were hundreds of shards laying around everywhere.

311
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,080
He picked it up and purred to himself as if he had found a great treasure.

312
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,540
His smile had returned full force.

313
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:44,820
I could only admire and be disgusted with such a man.

314
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,020
Our drive back to Washington was fast and insane, of course.

315
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,900
We must have made that drive in record time, for Bob never once slowed down.

316
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,540
He breezed through traffic lights, stop signs, over hillbillies,

317
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,800
and every time a patrol car pulled up behind us with lights flashing,

318
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,980
it would either mysteriously lose power and pull off to the side,

319
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,520
or it would suddenly go off.

320
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:09,520


321
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,820
We veered off into a direction that Bob happened to be looking,

322
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,900
sometimes up or down, into the skies or the earth itself.

323
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,180
He was still looking for that skunk ape.

324
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:27,760
We only stopped once, and that was to purchase some overripe peaches at a roadside stand in Georgia.

325
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,680
These peaches Bob would throw at specific cars that passed us by.

326
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,680
I could never figure out the reason, but after he threw one,

327
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,180
he would bounce up and down in his seat in an exaggerated glee.

328
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,120
As much as I would beg him to stop so that I could use a restroom,

329
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,680
Bob would just scowl at me angrily as if I were asking him to do something horrible.

330
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,700
I ended up having to go in my overalls.

331
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,380
It didn't matter, they stank so badly that no one would have noticed the difference,

332
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:01,480
other than Bob, that is, who would punch me on the shoulder, damn hard too, and yell,

333
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:08,820
I spy with my third nostril excrement, or urine, or weakness.

334
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,080
Whenever I would make a mistake.

335
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:19,140
It was in a small, rather affluent Virginia town, not too far from our capital,

336
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,400
that Bob deigned to stop at the safe house that we employ there.

337
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:30,600
As ashamed as I was to enter and see my colleagues while in such a degraded state,

338
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,000
I knew that I had to.

339
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,200
I was long overdue, at least it seemed that way to me.

340
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,260
Once we pulled into the driveway,

341
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,520
Bob graciously opened my door,

342
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,060
and threw me into the lilac bushes that grow out front,

343
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,280
and sternly, frighteningly, told me to stay right there.

344
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:52,880
He had to get some stuff, and the party isn't over by a long shot, boy.

345
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,400
He then burned rubber, pulling out of the driveway.

346
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,660
My first intention was to run into the safe house and clean myself up,

347
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,420
but I feared what Bob might do if I did,

348
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,180
so I sat in the bushes getting stung in the face by bees,

349
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:14,100
until I saw the agents in the house peep through the windows in obvious disapproval.

350
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:20,520
I suppose it was then that I realized I was a slave for Bob.

351
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,480
A most horrible feeling, most horrible.

352
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,280
It was not but a few shameful minutes later that Bob screeched back into the driveway

353
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:35,540
carrying a case of cheap beer and a dirty aluminum bucket of what he called head cheese,

354
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,500
even though it looked more like,

355
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,720
and smelled more like,

356
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,700
rotten fish bait to me.

357
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,400
You beings like this stuff, right?

358
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,520
He asked me.

359
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,460
I could only nod my head.

360
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,860
Bob beckoned me out of the bushes.

361
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:54,640
I stood there in front of him as he flicked a single mote of dust from my overalls.

362
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,620
He then looked me over with a discerning eye and nodded in approval,

363
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,340
even though I stank and was completely filthy.

364
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,480
The key to the safe house, as always, was underneath the welcome mat.

365
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,160
I braced myself for all the humiliations that would be heaped upon me once this assignment was over.

366
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,680
No one was there to greet me, not surprisingly.

367
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:23,580
So Bob, as if he knew the place, led me to the upstairs bedroom where we keep our communications office.

368
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,320
He banged the bucket of chum down on the desk in front of Agent X.

369
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,420
The skinny little bastard almost puked.

370
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,720
I doubt he would have survived a weekend with Bob.

371
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,640
Mr. Dobbs then grabbed six of the beers from the case,

372
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,900
and as he greasily smiled at all of us,

373
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:50,780
he proceeded to pull down his trousers and pop the cap of each of the six beers with the power of his buttock muscles alone.

374
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:58,280
Though I was not astounded, the rest of the pinks, as Bob liked to call folks like that in the room,

375
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,620
stood aghast in disgust and terror.

376
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,540
They all knew the importance of my mission,

377
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,700
so when I did,

378
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,920
I discreetly nodded to them to dig into the bucket of chum and down the so-called ass beers,

379
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,280
as became Agent History after that day.

380
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,440
They did as told like damned sheep.

381
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:24,580
Agent X, the chubby useless one, stuttered that there had been an awful tragedy and,

382
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,180
uh, where the hell have you been?

383
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,900
Bob's smile disappeared, and in two giant bounds he leaped over to the man, glaring,

384
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,900
Look here, little pink boy!

385
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,040
I've been gambling with your future and I lost that!

386
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,920
And I lost a pair of gold cufflinks that Connie's sister gave to me.

387
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,680
So what if one of the clones got damaged?

388
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,320
So what?

389
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,080
We have plenty more.

390
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:53,280
And if you live long enough, you'll be wishing you had pet rats just so you can eat their crap to survive.

391
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,180
So don't whine to me, pink boy.

392
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,640
Mr. Dobbs then gave the man a gentle kiss on the forehead and winked at me, whispering,

393
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,160
We don't need no damn agents.

394
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,300
I understood.

395
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:15,740
And as he left the house, I noticed that somehow, as usual, Bob had made off with their wallets.

396
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,480
Let's go, Pulse!

397
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,840
Don't you touch her neck!

398
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,560
You think you're touching his neck?

399
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,020
Come on!

400
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,480
Let's go, Pulse!

401
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,980
Don't you touch her neck!

402
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,720
What the fuck?

403
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,500
Don't you touch her neck!

404
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,100
Come on!

405
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,320
You're touching his neck!

406
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:27,700
What the fuck?

407
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,660
What the fuck?

408
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,880
Come on, it's your dick!

409
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,640
Don't you touch her neck!

410
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,880
Boy, it's your dick.

411
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,060
Did you notice, young lady?

412
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,480
Your present die is the dressed the dog when he dies.

413
00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:00,300
You gotta make him realize that your god just married as your god to him?

414
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,640
It was bitch shit

415
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:16,640
It was bitch shit

416
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:53,760
It was bitch shit

417
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:27,300
It was bitch shit

418
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,020
Mr. Dobbs was incredibly serene

419
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,940
in light of his last outburst of anger

420
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,740
as we drove through the crowded suburban streets

421
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,040
and out into the countryside.

422
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,440
He seemed to forget everything as fast as it happened

423
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,080
as if he had severe brain damage.

424
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,860
He puffed furiously on his pipe

425
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,260
but with that same oblivious grin that he usually wore.

426
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,860
I popped a few of his pills that I had left over

427
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,480
just to get rid of the shakes.

428
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,800
That plus the beer I had

429
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,600
made the world seem all...

430
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,180
that much more intense

431
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,080
and reasonable.

432
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,160
It all started to make much more sense at that point

433
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,460
and the drive through the countryside was lovely

434
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,220
until Bob made a serious face again

435
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,580
and said that we had best hang low

436
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,060
until things blow over.

437
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,380
I know the place to go.

438
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,460
A little inn I have that I like to call

439
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,000
Shamalot.

440
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,240
It took us a while to get to this Shamalot

441
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,540
for Mr. Dobbs seemed to always forget

442
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,460
where we were driving.

443
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,860
He'd stop off at random diners, trinket shops,

444
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
gas stations, etc.

445
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,200
where he would feel impelled to make a sale.

446
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,080
Then we would drive back off in the direction

447
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,320
we'd just come from.

448
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,960
Bob always had something in the trunk of his car

449
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,460
to sell to these vendors.

450
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,180
It was as if he had a second sense for the sale

451
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,840
and that was what guided him.

452
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,400
Where we ended up was exactly where he wanted to go

453
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,120
in the first place.

454
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,640
We did indeed make it eventually to Shamalot.

455
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,200
It was simply an underground type bomb shelter

456
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,940
that Bob had off the main kitchen

457
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,660
in a sprawling hotel complex in rural Virginia.

458
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,220
I followed him through the venue.

459
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,220
It was a very well appointed hotel

460
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,780
yet the staff seemed lethargic and prone

461
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,520
to bumbling and stumbling around.

462
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,980
I thought at first that they may have all been

463
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,100
overworked or drunk.

464
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,900
Until I noticed that most of them would

465
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,660
shamble off into a dark corner and take a puff

466
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,660
off a smile pipe every chance they could get.

467
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,960
The tobacco they smoked smelled very much like Bob's,

468
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,280
just not as nauseating.

469
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,940
We wended our way through this maze until we got

470
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,960
to a heavy steel door on which was messily painted

471
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,680
a la The Little Rascals.

472
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,500
Shamalot.

473
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,440
No pinks allowed.

474
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,080
I recognized the door.

475
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,080


476
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,220
I recognized Bob's childish scrawl and poor spelling.

477
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,540
So this, then, would be our safe haven.

478
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,580
Well, friends, that is the end of The Agent and Mr. Dobbs,

479
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:21,000
Part 6, translated by Reverend Teeters La Verge.

480
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:28,680
The music in the background is by Speed Cave from the CD

481
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,360
Rocket Ships and Apple Pie.

482
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:39,200
I believe that the correct White Reef Speed Cave is speedcave.com.

483
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:45,020
I'm Bob Teeters.

484
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,020


485
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,060
Bye.

486
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,740
Bye.

487
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,720
Bye.

488
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,620
Bye.

489
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,800
Bye.

490
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,680
Bye.

491
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,180
Bye.

492
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,180


493
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,180


494
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,180


495
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,180


496
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,180


497
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,480
Bye.

498
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:55,480


499
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:55,480


500
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,720
Bye.

501
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:56,720


502
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,340
Bye.

503
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,340


504
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,340


505
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,340


506
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:32,100


507
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,300
Bye.

508
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,020
Bye.

509
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,460
Bye.

510
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,080
Bye.

511
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,080


512
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:09,900
I'd draw the long man watching the valley I'd draw the long man climbing the rise

513
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:21,100
I'd ride the chalk horse over the mountain I'd stack the stones to the summer sunrise

514
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:38,620
You overrate me, you learn to hate me It's all related to the dullness of the night

515
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:44,200
You learn to doubt me, go on without me Ignore the numbers for the rest of your life

516
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:50,620
We will be moving to the higher ground As the clock ticks, as the clock ticks down

517
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:01,760
We're all living in the lost and found As the clock ticks, as the clock ticks down

518
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,060
We're all living in the lost and found As the clock ticks, as the clock ticks down

519
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:21,240
As the clock ticks, as the clock ticks down

520
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,200
I'd draw the long man

521
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,040
I'd draw the long man

522
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,320
I'd draw the long man

523
00:38:43,600 --> 00:39:01,300
I'd draw the long man

524
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:29,760
I'd draw the long man

525
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:59,680
I'd draw the long man

526
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:29,200
I'd draw the long man

527
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,180
I'd draw the long man

528
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,080
I'd draw the serious man

529
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,580
I'd draw the crazy zephyr

530
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,760
I'd draw the real man

531
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,160
I'd draw the overlapping mine

532
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,740
I'd draw the

533
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,280
I guess he'd literally bring out a full dad

534
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,060
I'd draw the widow

535
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,580
I'd draw the little guy

536
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,600
I'd draw the old man

537
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,060
I'd draw the littleๆun

538
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,060


539
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:29,180
I'd draw the shaggy backgrounds

540
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:33,760
humanity popping like a bunch of damn crawfish in a hot skillet.

541
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:38,020
I shook my head and told this thing before me to shut the hell up

542
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,280
and that we may be on the brink of atomic war.

543
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,500
Mr. Dobbs twisted my ear in a most painful manner

544
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,680
and while patting the thing on its shoulder said,

545
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,320
fuck them if they can't take a joke.

546
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,400
Suddenly, a very real and cold fear gripped my heart.

547
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,820
I asked Bob if he knew something I didn't.

548
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,920
Did Khrushchev die of alcohol poisoning?

549
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,960
Did the commies assassinate our president in retaliation?

550
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,400
Were we on the brink of atomic destruction?

551
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,020
Bob just played pocket pool and chuckled,

552
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,080
nuclear war is the least of your worries, young agent,

553
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,740
at least after last night's card game.

554
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,800
It was then that the room suddenly lit up in red lights

555
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,640
and a klaxon started to sound.

556
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,060
Bob jumped up and down like a child on Christmas Day yelling,

557
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,840
that's Connie calling, that's Connie calling.

558
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,080
He skipped, I'm not kidding,

559
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,240
skipped over to a video telephonic device.

560
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:42,080
There he sat down fidgeting on a large leather swivel chair

561
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,160
furiously playing pocket pool.

562
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:49,000
Hi, sweetie spleen, he said to the beautiful image of Connie

563
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,060
on the video screen.

564
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,320
What are you doing in our Dallas compound?

565
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,540
Mr. Dobbs smiled stupidly.

566
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,760
As Connie said, well, dearie,

567
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,160
I had a little party at the compound last night,

568
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:04,160
and, well, it would seem that I made a little joke with Jackie

569
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,040
about pranking the president.

570
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,460
You know what a card he is.

571
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,880
And it would seem that three of the doctors overheard.

572
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,320
Mr. Dobbs just nodded his head,

573
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:18,780
smiling as if he could picture the party in his, quote, mind, unquote.

574
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,420
Well, this morning those doctors got all drunked up

575
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,200
and took some rifles and, well,

576
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,900
in theory it would seem that Dr. Oswald was a tad bit too tipsy

577
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,040
and grabbed some real bullets instead of the rubber kind.

578
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,220
Connie made a gesture and on the video screen appeared Dr. Oswald

579
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,420
looking sheepish and more than a bit hungover.

580
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,520
Sorry, Bob, he said with a hangdog expression on his face,

581
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,760
obviously twisting his foot on the floor in shame.

582
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,280
Connie, as a reward, popped a pill in his mouth,

583
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,380
which he gobbled down like an obedient,

584
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:55,900
dog.

585
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,580
It's okay, Dr. Oswald, Bob said.

586
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,940
We all make mistakes.

587
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,300
Fuck up, man up, man shut the fuck up,

588
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,880
is the motto, isn't it?

589
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,500
I was shocked again at Bob's levity in situations of danger.

590
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,280
Well, fuck us if we can't take a joke.

591
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,960
Bob elbowed me so hard in the ribs that I fell over, gasping.

592
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,960
Have Connie give you a few more pills and 50 cents to go see a movie.

593
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,480
Okay.

594
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,880
I'll call Johnny Boy and clear the whole thing up.

595
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,860
Dr. Oswald nodded obediently and walked away from the screen,

596
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,700
grinning like a reprieved man chewing a big mouthful of pills.

597
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,600
Look, Connie, Bob said, where is Dr. Ruby?

598
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,960
He and the other doctors are down at his strip joint keeping the party going,

599
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,600
Connie replied, looking as radiant as ever.

600
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,860
Well, do me a favor, honey bunch of synapses,

601
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:55,220
and go down there and tell Dr. Ruby that I have a job for him.

602
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,860
I want him to take Dr. Oswald out, Bob said.

603
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,080
Will do, Connie chirped as they jiggled their fingers at their throats,

604
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,360
making a strange noise and hung up their video phones.

605
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,480
Bob then looked strangely thoughtful for a moment.

606
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:24,160
I guess I should have told Connie that the job was to get Dr. Oswald out of the country for a little bit.

607
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,200
Hmm.

608
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,280
He then pulled a folder full of photos from the desk drawer

609
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,640
and started to meticulously cut and paste Dr. Oswald's head onto various figures,

610
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,080
railroad conductors, nurses, dinosaurs, and figures of men holding rifles

611
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:45,340
with crudely painted signs that said, I did it.

612
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:51,740
He sighed a lot during the process until the sighs became a sort of barking noise,

613
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,640
guttural, animalistic.

614
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:54,860
He got up.

615
00:45:54,860 --> 00:46:00,040
He smoothed the non-existent wrinkles from his trousers right before he pulled them down

616
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,820
and sat on a portable chemical toilet.

617
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,780
I averted my eyes until Bob yelled,

618
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,500
Gaze upon me, little pink!

619
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,300
I actually stumbled backwards at the timbre of his voice,

620
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:18,600
yet I found myself obeying his command as I dragged a metal folding chair over to him

621
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:23,360
and sat within a few mere inches from him as he did his business,

622
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,800
which in itself was odd, for as I gazed upon his face,

623
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,800
it turned rather vividly from green to red to blue and back to green again

624
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,500
until, with the sound of a million balloons popping simultaneously,

625
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,540
what was previously a very serious, strained look on his face

626
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:45,400
transformed into the usual moronic and placid visage

627
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:51,640
that I not only would see in person, but in my own mind as well when I closed my eyes.

628
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,780
I suspect that I was going insane.

629
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:00,260
From all the pills and slack, one could only guess.

630
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,480
My feeling of insanity was pretty much cemented

631
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,140
when Bob picked up a girly pink video phone

632
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,500
and called our still-living president.

633
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:15,480
It appeared that the SOB was a dipsomaniac, a whoremonger,

634
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,600
and still at that bordello in Florida.

635
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,620
A grey with a powder blue background,

636
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,360
a bouffant wig came up on screen looking annoyed,

637
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,640
its huge eyes were clouded over and drunk,

638
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,720
as it rolled over and got the president on the phone.

639
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,500
Our president rubbed his red-rimmed eyes

640
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:40,640
and in an irritated, stuttering voice asked first if Jackie were there.

641
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,340
When soothingly reassured by Bob that she was back in Dallas,

642
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:50,800
he calmed down a bit until he was told of all that had transpired in his besotted absence.

643
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,120
The president jumped out of bed.

644
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,800
He was clothed in a, and here it's a blanked out,

645
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,960
uniform, a something uniform.

646
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,020
I lost all respect for him at that point,

647
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:04,780
but could only admire his obvious abilities as

648
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,560
M blanked out, M blanked out.

649
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,980
Some M something, M something.

650
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:15,360
I personally suspect it might be Marilyn Monroe.

651
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:21,460
As the MM and the bouffanted grey kept adjusting the eye patch,

652
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:28,020
which it would seem covered the damage that MM had done to it the night before with a fork.

653
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,960
I listened in as the two of them conversed.

654
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:35,960
Bob kept trying to explain to the whining man that it's all right,

655
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,900
and that he, I'm not sure who he meant,

656
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:42,620
didn't have to worry, and because I've got it all under control.

657
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:46,440
The president threw another fit while Bob explained to him

658
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,080
that his trusted man, Dr. Oswald,

659
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,300
was the one who drunkenly grabbed the rifle,

660
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,720
with the real bullets.

661
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:57,360
The president suggested that they dispose of the assassinated clone,

662
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:01,440
and he himself could explain on TV that he was all right,

663
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,760
and it was just a scratch.

664
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,940
Bob snickered, saying that was a grand idea,

665
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:10,980
but obviously no eye patch is going to fool the necessary amount of people

666
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,820
when thousands saw half your head being blown off.

667
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,920
So just accept the island offer and shut up.

668
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,580
Bob rocked back in his swivel chair,

669
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,280
a smug look, and said,

670
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,820
I'm not going to let you do this to me.

671
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,180
If you're going to do this to me,

672
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:35,360
I'm going to do it for you.

673
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,200
And so Bob did.

674
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,120
He was a little nervous at first,

675
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:39,120


676
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:39,120


677
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,680
I'm going to do it.

678
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,100
And so Bob did.

679
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:42,260


680
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:42,900
I'm going to do it.

681
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:43,380


682
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:43,440
I'm going to do it.

683
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,180
And so Bob said,

684
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,760
I'm going to do it.

685
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,120
Mr. Dobbs chuckled and mentioned that he already had Dr. Ruby on the job.

686
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:00,060
He is going to take him out of the country.

687
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,780
Bob then abruptly hung up the phone.

688
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,220
Did I tell Connie the out of the country part?

689
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,320
He looked serious for a few moments until the thing in the easy chair started laughing insanely,

690
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,040
yelling,

691
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:15,540
When Bob Dunn fucks up, people die.

692
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,600
And when Mr. Dobbs starts farting, the world starts...

693
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,200
I glared at the creature in disgust.

694
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,300
How could you joke at this moment?

695
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,900
I whispered an aside to Bob,

696
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,560
asking what manner of foul creature it was that sat in the corner.

697
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,320
Bob said loudly, ignoring my attempt at privacy,

698
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,160
pointing to the creature and laughing,

699
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,360
That is a mistake.

700
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:47,300
A genetic mistake like the alligator people you saw in my grand moat of happiness outside the factory.

701
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,580
That mistake used to be as pink as the color of the sun.

702
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:50,580


703
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:50,580


704
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:50,580


705
00:50:50,580 --> 00:51:00,080
That was my middle hand man until it decided to retire to a monastery in Tibet with a big bag of my personal stash of frop.

706
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:06,380
The thing we got back from the Yeti monks was no longer human but also not quite an overman.

707
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:13,540
So I decided to graft that pipe onto its face and make it frop up 24 hours a day just to see what would happen.

708
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:19,340
Young agent, what you see before you is the future of failure.

709
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,560
What you see before you is the future of failure.

710
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:20,560


711
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:23,380
What you see is an over-under man.

712
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,520
What you see is an over-under man.

713
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,700
The thing in the corner puffed its pipe and cackled like a madman.

714
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,240
You see, young agent, Bob told me,

715
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,940
that I now need you as my middle hand man.

716
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:42,020
I pondered the gravity of what he told me as he put some atonal rumba music on the hi-fi

717
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,900
and walked over to the classy bar to fix us a drink.

718
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,540
He did a poor job of hiding the spiking of my drink with pills,

719
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,560
Though he obviously didn't want to make a mistake.

720
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:55,940
tried to look innocent and hide his actions. My heart dropped as he started to suddenly

721
00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:04,540
gyrate his hips, hula style, when he glided over with my drink. We were alone, and I had no escape.

722
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:13,300
I feared the worst, but knew that this was my duty. Bob handed me the drink and suddenly got

723
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:20,040
serious, if you can ever call him that. He heartily pffft the stuffy air that hung leaden

724
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:25,960
in the shelter. He told me not to worry too much, that he'd find a way to make a buck out of the

725
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:32,280
whole thing. Without thinking, I drank the cocktail down. The room spun in a pleasant way, and I

726
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:38,500
noticed that the little umbrella that he had put into the drink was topped off with a small plastic

727
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:46,680
bobbly head of the president. The head had what looked like two bullet holes in it. I knew then

728
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,860
that God help us if we cannot get this

729
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:50,020
made.

730
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:55,300
That was the first time I'd seen this man squarely on our side. Bob gyrated around me while my sight

731
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:03,120
dimmed into a fearful tunnel and my mind reeled at the import of this man's powers. Bob stood over

732
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:10,620
me as I slumped in the chair. Boy, I have plans for you. You're going to Dobbs Town for further

733
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:19,480
instruction, and a little itty-bitty operation to open up that other hole. I felt the room

734
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:28,180
whirl as all faded out but his pipe, his grin, and that insufferable soft chuckling.

735
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:38,740
The music in the background was by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang. And now, this.

736
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:44,180
You've been listening to Hour of Slack number 1872.

737
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,280
You can learn more about the Church of the Subgenius and the stuff we play and

738
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:59,100
everything else at subgenius.com. Oh, and we promised news about X-Day. Well, X-Day

739
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:07,080
is somewhere sometime this year. You can see all of what I'm about to read also on

740
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:17,960
subgenius.com under events. Friends, X-Day is July 5th, 1998, of course. But from 24 previous X-Day

741
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,320
drills,

742
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:25,520
we now know that we don't really know when now is. We also don't know where the big party is.

743
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:33,180
After years at the perfect place in Ohio, and then an all-virtual one on Zoom in 2020,

744
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:40,800
for 2021, we found an even more perfecter place in Florida. But this year, the owner,

745
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:47,720
Reverend Santhea, is moving that place, the Land of Id Resort. She'll move it somewhere else,

746
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,040
but it's not going to be ready.

747
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:58,360
Summer. So temporarily, we might call this one DIY Day. It takes place wherever you are.

748
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:04,060
If you decide to host a local drill in the form of a big party with all your subgenius friends

749
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:11,160
and loved ones, great. We'll help you publicize it if you want it public. Or you can join the

750
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:18,080
big virtual party or parties from right in your own home via internet video conferencing. But

751
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,260
really, why not?

752
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,860
Why not both? I'm thinking I may throw a party here at Stang Ranch, but only for people I actually

753
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:34,840
know. No offense. But it's not just that Reverend Xanthea's amazing Land of Id is temporarily closed

754
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:39,740
or that I can't spend a week breaking my back again in Ohio. There's much, much more to it.

755
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:49,120
4X Day, as we belatedly realized, is also Variable Day. V-Day, one might say, as well as DIY Day.

756
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:57,480
We stumbled upon this discovery in the forbidden sciences that blew our minds. What's the letter

757
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,560
in mathematics that indicates a variable? X. Maybe it's X Day because it's variable.

758
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:07,220
We know from prophecy that the media will refer to the advent of the angelic host as

759
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:12,400
X Day. But now that we are less certain about the planet and the year, this day of judgment

760
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,120
is now a variable.

761
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,900
The world ends on July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.

762
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:19,260
The world ends on July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.

763
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:19,260


764
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:19,260


765
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:26,040
But we obviously don't know when that might be, might be. It might be today. Well, maybe

766
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,540
tomorrow, but soon, soon, surely, very soon.

767
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,660
What kind of end of the world will it be? Road Warrior, 1984, Brave New World, Let's

768
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:39,960
Visit the World of the Future, Life After People. That's all variable too, friends.

769
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:45,940
Is today your X Day? Everyone's X Day? Maybe the X Day of someone you haven't met yet or

770
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,120
haven't killed yet.

771
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,260
This X equals X.

772
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,940
X equals variable day concept offers spiritual integrity to the notion that one may have

773
00:56:54,940 --> 00:57:01,520
a July 5th that isn't necessarily the conspiracy calendar's July 5th. Like old Pogo noticing

774
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:09,080
that Friday the 13th can happen on a Wednesday. He was no fool. We prefer the term subgenius.

775
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:13,700
Now, this also lets us off the hook, friends, for having to camp outdoors on the hottest

776
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:19,100
day of the year. And I think I covered all this in that winter

777
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:31,180
star rant. Yeah, I did. I did. So this weird year, we're going to hedge our bets and hold

778
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:38,380
the X Day party where you are, when you want it, and you and you and you. Yes, X Day in

779
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:46,980
place for 2022. If the saucers get to you first, remember the rest of us. Yes, this

780
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:54,100
is a desperate move, but the alternative was to end time in the end times so that all

781
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:59,280
moments would be equally distributed as 7 a.m., but that sounded like too much work.

782
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:09,780
Thus, we are distributing and decentralizing X Day for one year only, maybe. Anyway, X

783
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:16,620
marks the spot. Just to make sure you're synced up, do send in that number of bucks.

784
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:24,900
Re-up your membership and enter to win, win, win, big, big, big prizes to be announced.

785
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:29,740
Throw an insane party. Put a big X on your forehead and hang out at the courthouse.

786
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:35,160
Take a photo of the weirdest thing you can possibly do and post it to the subgenius metaverse.

787
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:42,560
The subgenius who ruptures with the most slack wins. No matter how it pans out,

788
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,640
the church of the subgenius offers the best apocalypse. In fact,

789
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:50,540
the single most compelling reason to join the church of the subgenius

790
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:57,240
is that you'll never be disappointed at its failure to deliver on impossible promises.

791
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:07,100
Praise Bob! And see subgenius.com. Oh, here's a little song.

792
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:15,160
I'll have to turn down the Empire Jazz Orchestra album out of the mix, missed from the mix.

793
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:23,000
Rue Mouse, the poor subgenius, had a very special brain.

794
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:29,160
All of the stupid normals laughed and labeled him insane.

795
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:36,700
Then one sudden X day morned, the X's ships came back.

796
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:42,800
They wiped out all the human race, so subgeni could have slack.

797
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:46,720
Oh, you better not laugh, you better just cry.

798
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:54,020
Death from space is in your skies. Subgeniuses are cutting you down.

799
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:55,800
Praise Bob.

800
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:00,120
And good night.
