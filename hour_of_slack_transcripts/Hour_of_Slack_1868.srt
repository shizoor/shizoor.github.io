1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,480
You'll have to excuse Ivan's manner.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,860
If you behave yourself, he'll hurt you.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,460
Look, what kind of a creep joint is this?

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,780
Place of research, and Ivan.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,800
Oh, yeah?

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,580
That's a genius, Harry.

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,540
A slap.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,180
Perfect.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,760
Oh, yes.

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,520
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,260
No.

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,340
No, no, no.

13
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:27,460
No.

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,180
Oh, yes.

15
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:30,840
Oh, no.

16
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,480
Oh, yes.

17
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:31,880
Oh, no.

18
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,380
Okay.

19
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,040
All right.

20
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,340
Okay.

21
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,480
Let's see how this works.

22
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, I think it might work.

23
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,160
It just might work.

24
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,660
It just might work.

25
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,320
Hello?

26
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,280
Uh, yes, dear friends.

27
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,420
We're live.

28
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,480
Hi, dear friends.

29
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,240
We're live.

30
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:52,760
I'm stupid.

31
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,180
What?

32
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,940
How, how, how?

33
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,640
I've been strange.

34
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,560
Dr. Ivan Strange.

35
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,420
That's me.

36
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,440
String.

37
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,880
Can you hear me okay?

38
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,920
Can you hear me okay?

39
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,160
Yeah.

40
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,720
I can hear.

41
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,320
Okay.

42
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,600
Yes.

43
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,160
Okay.

44
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,380
Okay.

45
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,920
The mute button is off, and the mutes have all been sent home.

46
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,520
The mutes.

47
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,100
Why isn't the mute on?

48
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,140
May I ask you one question?

49
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,020
Yeah.

50
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,900
Why isn't the mute on when they can't say anything to it anyway?

51
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,120
You're going to have to ask that in clearer English, because I'm hard.

52
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:35,020
Why you, why you send the mutes, mutos back home when they don't have any television and

53
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,020
their feet are bound like the lady?

54
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,900
I send the mutos home because they live here.

55
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,160
This is where the mutos live.

56
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,460
They're the ones that are barfing out all the glass and building up all the company

57
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,580
forests and stuff?

58
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,400
Oh, no, no.

59
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,640
I have them out planting flowers in the garden.

60
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,240
Ah.

61
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,480
They're.

62
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,480
That's important.

63
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,100
That's important.

64
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,920
Yeah.

65
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,740
Yeah.

66
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,480
Especially since we're expecting another one of those killer Texas deep freezes in about

67
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,200
four days.

68
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,500
Oh, you're going to get the deep freeze in four days, eh?

69
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,100
Did you see what's happening on the East Coast there?

70
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,980
I saw what's happening where you live in Ashtabula, thanks to our friend, friends Potter and Petal

71
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,540
Nostril.

72
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,480
They had photos out showing their driveway, which was just white.

73
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,520
That's all there was.

74
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,200
It was just white.

75
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,400
Yeah.

76
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,580
Yeah.

77
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:27,580


78
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,340
Plus, a few Eskimos hiding under the garden there, waiting to make their move.

79
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:39,240
As soon as you come out there, they pull up weapons out and have big clamor, big reaction

80
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,580
to everything else that's going on.

81
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,720
Like Zupyr and Zuz and all those guys that have similar names.

82
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,260
Zupyr and Zuz?

83
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,780
Zupyr and Zuz.

84
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,720
And Zuz.

85
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,040
And Zuz.

86
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,220
Want to fight a war in the Metromia.

87
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,220
Or not Metromia, but the Ukraine-ish.

88
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,080
Oh, yeah.

89
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,860
I like that show.

90
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,220
I love Zussi.

91
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,980
He and Hera were always fighting.

92
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,820
Hera is what they named her after, right?

93
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,880
That's what it sounds like.

94
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,540
It could have been Hera's or no Hera's, like in myself.

95
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,840
I've been offered the opportunity, but I've never taken it.

96
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,520
Well, you're locked in.

97
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,200
You're now snowed in to the insane asylum where you live, right?

98
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,280
Yes, I am.

99
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,100
They may wheel out a dead person or go and talk somebody down

100
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,420
or maybe just start using the four-letter word real profusely

101
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,280
and saying you blank, blank, blank and shooting off a gun.

102
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,940
I always liked that, too.

103
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,480
I mean, I don't like it that much, but it's exciting, you know.

104
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,620
Better than watching PBS television.

105
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,420
Just listening to the sounds of fights around you

106
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,260
and your emotions.

107
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,920
Insane asylum.

108
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,500
Yeah, and women screaming real loud.

109
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,120
I knew what you were like when I, you know, this is all your fault.

110
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,940
And the guys sound really crazy, like they might have done time.

111
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,700
I don't know which time, you know.

112
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,060
Old time or ancient times or just time of the time of time.

113
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,320
Do you ever hear one of them say to another one,

114
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,240
shut up, little man?

115
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,780
Yeah.

116
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,700
Oh, you have?

117
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,540
Okay, I know those two guys.

118
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,200
They walked right straight.

119
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,360
Well, she did anyway.

120
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,280
Walked straight up to my penis and said that.

121
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,260
Shut up, little man.

122
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,740
Yeah, as if I had ears and could accommodate her.

123
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,860
I don't know.

124
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,360
I don't know.

125
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:38,840
I don't know.

126
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,060
Well, Dave, it's a study in contrast because here at Stang Ranch,

127
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,780
it's literally 71 degrees and lovely outside.

128
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,840
And I took my first walk for about a month and nothing broke.

129
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,500
Not my toe, not my back, nothing.

130
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,900
Nothing.

131
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,900
And I daily planted flowers all along.

132
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,920
Well, you have been gay for a long time,

133
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,140
so why not plant flowers daily all along the way?

134
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,020
Oh, they're such gay flowers.

135
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,040
I really did.

136
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,520
And hold them to your bosom and do your Fred Astaire dance?

137
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,940
That's what nurturing naturism is the difference about.

138
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,340
Actually, I don't do the planting.

139
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,940
The MUTOs are following behind me doing all that.

140
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,200
Well, they're making plenty of hand movements at least, aren't they?

141
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,760
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

142
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,460
And they have flowers growing out the top of their heads.

143
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,380
It makes them look cute.

144
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:30,760
Yeah, yeah.

145
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,480
There's several different types.

146
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,260
There's red mutants, albinos, yellow ones, blue ones, big.

147
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,420
The purple ones are always really fat.

148
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,640
Yeah, purple fatties, they call them the fecund ones.

149
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,980
I named one of them Fat Pandi.

150
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:51,920
Yeah.

151
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,160
I get to name them, see.

152
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,180
They forget their names when they come after me.

153
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,180


154
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,280
Yeah, they're always the same.

155
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,280


156
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,280


157
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,280


158
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,480
And then after we finish with them, the MUTOs forget their names and we give them new ones

159
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,660
in the cult.

160
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:02,960
Yeah.

161
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:10,940
At least I always ... I just agree with you as usual, 1,000%.

162
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,360
Well, I usually agree with you because I can't really understand half of what you're saying.

163
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,100
But that's not just you, Dave.

164
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,060
That's almost everybody.

165
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,940
You can't understand everybody?

166
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,980
I can't understand everybody.

167
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,240
I need subtitles.

168
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,880
You do.

169
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,460
In Swedish and Italian, you need subtitles.

170
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,520
There's two little layers there in one in Swedish and one in Italian.

171
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,680
You pretend it's 1978 and you're getting first exposure to foreign films.

172
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:48,840
You're learning what a ... Oh, nihilist ... Not like a nihilism, but ... Nevermind.

173
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,560
Nevermind.

174
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,220
Well, you know what's really maddening is ... You've wanted to watch the movie, but

175
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,220


176
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,220


177
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,220


178
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,220


179
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,220


180
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,220


181
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,920
you haven't watched this movie for a long time, and you're going to get to watch it,

182
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,760
but you're on Air Portugal.

183
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,920
It's in English, but they've added Portuguese subtitles to the bottom of it.

184
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,260
Well, by the time the movie's over, you can't remember the movie, but you've learned Portuguese,

185
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,700
or at least a little bit.

186
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,260
Yeah.

187
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,340
Enough to get by in Sao Paulo.

188
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,420
Right.

189
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,740
I mean, I've watched lots of Italian, German, Dutch movies with subtitles, whatever.

190
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,200
I'm not going to get into that.

191
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


192
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


193
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


194
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


195
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


196
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


197
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:31,420
I also watch American, English, and Australian movies with subtitles in English, because

198
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,000
I can't speak the lingo that these kids do these days.

199
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,780
They're too fast.

200
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,660
They talk like you, basically, kind of mumble.

201
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:48,480
And so it's for those of us with crisp, clear diction and microphones, we ...

202
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,660
That's what you call it, eh?

203
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,180
Yeah.

204
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,980
That's what the kids are called.

205
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,720
I got a big diction, baby.

206
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,300
I got a whole bunch of them.

207
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,780
Big ones, big ones.

208
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,520
You got a big dictionary to prove it.

209
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,580
Yes, sir.

210
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,160
I got one of those great big 500-pound ones.

211
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,940
I did, actually.

212
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,480
That's where about half of the subgenius doctrine came from.

213
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:16,140
Philo and I, since Bob wasn't helping, would just open this giant dictionary and put our

214
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,760
fingers down on a word randomly.

215
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,700
E popped.

216
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,520
Hey, that's what Bob is.

217
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,700
In fact, that's exactly what Bob is.

218
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,760
That's where we got his title.

219
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,920
It was just random going through the dictionary.

220
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,120
Put your hand down.

221
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,540
Breaks.

222
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,640
Breaks, yeah.

223
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,400
Some people have bad breaks.

224
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,580
No governor.

225
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,580
No controller.

226
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,460
They can't exist within the circle.

227
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,080
Don't work and play well with others.

228
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:47,220
Haven't mastered the masks of insanity, which you have to have to act normal and get a job,

229
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:47,460
see?

230
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,080
Right.

231
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,540
Because in many dimensions, you couldn't act normally even if you tried.

232
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,680
And they fire you before they hire you.

233
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:53,680


234
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:53,680


235
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:53,680


236
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:53,680


237
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:53,680


238
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:53,680


239
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:53,680


240
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,000
They make to make sure that the deed is done.

241
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,220
You know, like a lot of people that hire you, then they fire you.

242
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,820
It's time.

243
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,140
Yes, it's wonderful.

244
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,400
It's like a barbecue in your backyard with your family that you hate and want to shoot.

245
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,840
And everybody just likes your haircut.

246
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,700
And I never mind.

247
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,140
I'm sorry.

248
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,240
Luckily, I don't.

249
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't have one.

250
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,800
I'm diffused.

251
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,020
I don't have one of those kind of families.

252
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,820
I have a.

253
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,520
I have a.

254
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:23,640
I have a.

255
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:23,640


256
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:23,640


257
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,240
I have a.

258
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,640
I have an idyllic, wonderful family.

259
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,820
Well, except for the murder and the.

260
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,340
Well, you are being attacked by vampires right now to want to.

261
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,440
I know.

262
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:34,940
No, no, no.

263
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,360
They they don't bother me.

264
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,340
I've got the vampire repellent.

265
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,420
It's worked for decades now.

266
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:46,200
I have ghost ghost repellent, UFO repellent, Chupacabra repellent.

267
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,540
And of course, nobody will come near me.

268
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,780
Right.

269
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,620
Including my dogs.

270
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,560
Because they're all made for raw sewage.

271
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:53,620
All made for raw sewage.

272
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,340
Yeah, all of those things combined.

273
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,000
Bear repellent, of course.

274
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,220
Wasp repellent.

275
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,340
Women of St. John's.

276
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:12,560
I used to bring wasp attractant to X-Day just in case we ever needed to target a reverend bastard,

277
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:18,840
one of those guys that you wish hadn't come and they're hard to get rid of.

278
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,120
Well, you put the wasp attractant on them.

279
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,020
There is such a thing.

280
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,840
Well, that's horrible.

281
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,660
It sounds like what the Japanese OSS forces in World War III might have done if they were full of compunction.

282
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,340
You know, like sometimes they would blow farts.

283
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,800
That's the common term anyway.

284
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,380
Blow farts on the enemy.

285
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,440
And they'd be so disgraced by the time they go to that big sales meeting and speak as, you know,

286
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,820
like show their whole doctrine and everything and the different churches they were going to open up.

287
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,960
That's when they come and arrest them, right?

288
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,840
At that very moment.

289
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,780
They send the officers of the law to do their duty.

290
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:06,480
Well, you know, in America today, basically, you can get arrested for anything, literally.

291
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,760
But not if you're wearing swaddling clothes, whatever the hell those are.

292
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,540
Swathering clothes?

293
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,600
Sweltering clothes?

294
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,440
Swaddling clothes?

295
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,280
And a babe would come in swaddling.

296
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,840
That's what Drew—

297
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,900
Our Savior.

298
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,860
The Savior of the Fourth and the Third.

299
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,360
He popped.

300
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,800
Well, not that Savior.

301
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,260
The Avatar Savior.

302
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,500
The Third Ray.

303
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,400
I always thought swaddling clothes were what you wrap drunk people up in so when they vomited,

304
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,480
that would sort of catch most of their vomit and keep it off your nice white couch.

305
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,840
Which, yeah, was referred to as the swaddle.

306
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,120
A lot of people just like save the swaddle in little mason jars or plastic plates

307
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,940
and just like stick them in their room somewhere where the kids can't find them.

308
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,720
But other ones are more, a lot more, you know, a lot more.

309
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,560
Yeah, more.

310
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,680
More.

311
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,220
More on these morons later.

312
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,620
But now, this.

313
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,120
Abstrusia.

314
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,200
Now, when I count to three, your dollar bill will still be there.

315
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,800
Are you ready?

316
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,180
Number one.

317
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,740
One.

318
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,600
Number two.

319
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,240
Two.

320
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:19,940
Three.

321
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:20,740
One.

322
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,720
One.

323
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,440
Four o'clock.

324
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:22,740
Three.

325
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,060
Two.

326
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,680
Twenty.

327
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,280
Rock.

328
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,240
Eight o'clock.

329
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,520
Seven.

330
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:25,760
Eight.

331
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,160
Seven.

332
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:26,920
Rock.

333
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,300
Rock.

334
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:27,760
Rock.

335
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,200
Rock.

336
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:28,500


337
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:28,780
Rock.

338
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:28,860
Seven.

339
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,280
Ten.

340
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,680
Nine.

341
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,380
Ten.

342
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:30,840
Nine.

343
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,060
Nine.

344
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,320
Nine.

345
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,320


346
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,140
One.

347
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,020
Bob.

348
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,480
Oh, that's beautiful.

349
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,460
Yeah.

350
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,240
I say it's beautiful and you trust me.

351
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,100
Yeah.

352
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,800
The time is free.

353
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,120
Woo.

354
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,160
Oh, here it is.

355
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,100
Did you notice the transition I just did where I say, and now this?

356
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,420
That's what you say when you run out of anything to say.

357
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,620
You just go, and now this.

358
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:11,340
Yeah, but I was supposed to concur with you in the good old German, German, German, German way.

359
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,020
Instead, I did my own thing not knowing what I was doing.

360
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,340
So, don't feel sad.

361
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,460
Just feel sorry for me.

362
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,620
Oh, I always feel.

363
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,860
Everybody feels.

364
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,680
Terribly sorry for you, lonesome, because you're so lonesome.

365
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,820
Yeah, that's the way it is today, anyway.

366
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:34,380
I couldn't even go out on my beautiful balcony to look at the Civil War era house across

367
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,660
the street here, which hasn't been painted since the 1860s.

368
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,660
But, that was funny.

369
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,620
Thanks for taking that, for laughing at that.

370
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,980
Well, I had an almost Civil War era house.

371
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,460
It was in Cleveland.

372
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,780
And I was embarrassed at the paint job.

373
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,620
We spent a lot of money getting it painted.

374
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,040
And then it sold for just about nothing.

375
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,800
We really, in the end, we should have just given it away.

376
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,300
Yeah, you could have turned it into a soup kitchen and startled the turtles, you know, so to speak.

377
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,720
No, that's what we were doing out here in Texas with the MUTOs.

378
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,100
We feed them and make them plant for us.

379
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,460
Sometimes they plant each other.

380
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,960
They're good little skull farmers, you know.

381
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:26,960
Yep.

382
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:33,560
Little red beards, little red beards and little, you know, little packages of toast in their

383
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:41,400
back pockets, ready to make the best kind of statement they can make this time of year,

384
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,060
this wonderful holiday season, which is over now.

385
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,460
Well, you know, our skulls are so expensive now.

386
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,960
Because they taste.

387
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,520
So good.

388
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,440
Well, no, no, it's not that.

389
00:14:52,520 --> 00:15:01,220
It's that the fertilizer has like tripled in price because the one big company that made skull fertilizer went out of business.

390
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,900
Thanks to the COVIDs and one of them.

391
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,520
And so now it's all imported skull fertilizer.

392
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,080
And of course, you don't know what you're getting.

393
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,940
And it's all cut with fentanyl or something like that.

394
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,740
Especially if it's from China, it can be cheese.

395
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,640
Or underwear.

396
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,400
It could be anything.

397
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,140
Right.

398
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,760
Yeah.

399
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:28,840
I quit buying anything that comes from most other countries lately.

400
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,800
Unfortunately, that includes almost everything.

401
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,700
Pretty soon it'll be all the food, too.

402
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,080
I'm not sure what I'm going to do then.

403
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:36,960
Oh, yeah.

404
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,060
Farming skulls.

405
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:44,200
But, you know, skulls don't really have, they have a lot of calcium, but it's not like there's a brain in there anymore.

406
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,160
It's not going to.

407
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,700
It's not going to anymore, you know, so.

408
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,480
No.

409
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,440
No.

410
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,080
Well, I'm glad you found it.

411
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,560
I feel that way because we all have to have a motivation in life that gives us fulfillment.

412
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:08,240
Like, if you want to eat the skull packets and you want to feed them and dish them out to the kids and stuff like that after they've been cooked in their own raw natural juices, that is fine with me and fine with you, I hope.

413
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,360
Or else you'd be, you know, schizoid and die-crossed.

414
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,200
Oh, we end up, we've learned how to make skull pie, skull soup.

415
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,980
Skull soup.

416
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,280
Skull.

417
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,840
That's a favorite.

418
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,240
Ice cream.

419
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh.

420
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,740
I've never had skull ice cream, so I didn't answer on that one.

421
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,840
It's like garlic.

422
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,300
I heard it's.

423
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,520
It's like garlic ice cream.

424
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,800
It's really just a gimmick.

425
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:39,700
Just, you know, like, put this label on anything, anywhere and try and sell it for five bucks or something.

426
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,100
I've seen garlic ice cream for sale.

427
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,580
In Gilroy, America's garlic capital.

428
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,260
Capital.

429
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,000
Capital.

430
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,080
Gilroy garlic and Altadena for milk products.

431
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,940
Gilroy, California.

432
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:09,400
Driving through that town and the environs around it, everything smells like the excrement of cows that have been living on garlic their entire lives.

433
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,040
It's not really that disagreeable of a smell.

434
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,780
Great.

435
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,640
Walk and stay.

436
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:19,740
You know, it's herbivore scat in giant masses.

437
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:19,840


438
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,440
But it's garlic scented.

439
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,260
Steak guitar.

440
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,820
Steak guitar with garlic.

441
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,700
I hope at least till tomorrow.

442
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,420
Maybe Tuesday or Wednesday.

443
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,300
Yep.

444
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:32,760
Yep.

445
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,840
This is the gross girl with three children.

446
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,560
She gave up their children.

447
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:39,580
What year?

448
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:41,500
Okay.

449
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,280
Okay.

450
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,860
Yeah.

451
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,180
And doing what I did.

452
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,480
You know, you know, I'd say don't do that.

453
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,920
Having was not.

454
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,400
But I do think because I think but I don't think what three prongs.

455
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,120
And I think a lot of women are uncomfortable.

456
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,160
And I think it's great.

457
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes.

458
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:11,780
No, I think because I think, you know, to think, you know, I think to think.

459
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,040
And you talk a little bit about your mother was blown to bits.

460
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,260
I began to think that's a risk.

461
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,700
I think.

462
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,780
I'm prepared to take.

463
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,500
Right.

464
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,280
Well, our book critic has a book for the first time.

465
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:27,860
Yeah.

466
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,060
Dave, I actually went for a walk today.

467
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,200
You know, I've been bedridden and I try to get rid of my bed.

468
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,920
But I have been stuck there for a couple of months on and off.

469
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,020
And I went out today.

470
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,860
It was sunny.

471
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:49,360
And I got my Muto's coming gaily behind me, throwing flower seeds.

472
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,520
And flowers everywhere.

473
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,320
Banging their heads against trees until they were bloody.

474
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,040
And we just had us a great old time.

475
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,120
Walked all the way around.

476
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,840
And that does sound great.

477
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,760
The the the places that are easy for a hobbling old fellow to walk.

478
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,840
And by golly, I didn't.

479
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,920
Don't want to get his way.

480
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,420
I never felt that.

481
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,740
Well, that's lovers leap.

482
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,840
And in some places, but quarters, it's obviously it really is fornicators way.

483
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,760
They have their own.

484
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:27,460
You know, the problem is that wherever kids go to park and make out, that's where the monsters go.

485
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:39,300
Don't they like to appear over the trunk and over the shoulder shot a little bit over the top of the head and a screaming woman in the face?

486
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,040
What's that noise out there?

487
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,720
What's that noise out there, Bob?

488
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,460
Oh, don't worry about that, Connie.

489
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,760
It's probably just coyotes or something.

490
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,420
Don't.

491
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,160
There's no such thing as monsters.

492
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,340
Don't worry about that, Connie. It's probably just coyotes or something. Don't. There's no such thing as monsters.

493
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,380
Don't worry about that, Connie. It's probably just coyotes or something. Don't. There's no such thing as monsters.

494
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:50,380


495
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,320
Say, how do you undo this little hook back here?

496
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,400
Oh, it ain't got no face.

497
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,960
That's the good part right there.

498
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,460
They're shown to be faceless, but does full of foolish sentiments and desires.

499
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,320
Yeah, you can say that again.

500
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,560
No, I forgot it.

501
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,140
Now it would be hard to do that.

502
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,840
Yeah, I got to push them.

503
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,880
I forget to push the button every time we speak.

504
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,240
Indolently or architecturally.

505
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,000
In real life or fake life.

506
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,380
I always am supposed to go and hit that button,

507
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,760
and it will dutifully record everything that's said,

508
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,700
including the things that aren't funny at all,

509
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,880
and give them back in a gray fondant soup

510
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,920
of our own choosing, and that's the way it is.

511
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,800
Big tittas. Big tittas.

512
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,080
Gray flannel soup.

513
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,580
That's not as bad as it sounds. Yep.

514
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:48,620
That's not as bad as it sounds. Yep.

515
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:53,380
You put, you know, throw some skulls in, and by golly,

516
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,100
you've got your own gray flannel and skull soup.

517
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,880
That does sound good, doesn't it?

518
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,340
It's weird.

519
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,420
Maybe we can get an across the border thing going.

520
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,440
What the hell?

521
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:05,820
What was that?

522
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,780
Oh, it's my phone hollering about some message I probably got.

523
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,800
It's called notifications, Dave.

524
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,700
Oh, great. Noticias.

525
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,840
But I don't have it.

526
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,800
That's what it says on mine.

527
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,660
It says it in Spanish.

528
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,340
It says noticias, which also means news,

529
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,180
which is as well as notices.

530
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,620
News is the funny one.

531
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,260
We should ask our question what it means.

532
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,080
What does it mean, news?

533
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,620
Is it new information or just right hot off the press

534
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,520
or near the clarinet zone where people like to get together

535
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,680
and play three times a week?

536
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,420
No, I say unto you, Lee.

537
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,500
At least I'll try not.

538
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,640
I'll try not to.

539
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:47,640


540
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,520
Okay, then.

541
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:56,500
From PR News in Washington, I'm drawing praise from the LGBTTBG sexual abuse community.

542
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,500
The Trump is offering gay sex abuse in a meeting in Chile.

543
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,640
Pope Francis told him, God made you like this and he loves you because he's gay.

544
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,220
As President Trump said two weeks ago, to protect the American people was not the objective.

545
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,480
President Trump doesn't back down.

546
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,200
He's not a mental douche creator.

547
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,720
Trump said, we are a gang of three.

548
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,100
Drink.

549
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,360
Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee grilled Trump about PR News, Washington.

550
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,920
The Veterans Group is criticizing PR.

551
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,240
Okay, then I say you're cooking something right now, like a foot or?

552
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,000
No, no, no, no.

553
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,220
I had a great breakfast, though.

554
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:40,480
The funny thing was Princess We had already made breakfast, but she made so much,

555
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,640
I thought it was for another family.

556
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,920
So I made my own.

557
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,360
And then she came and yelled and screamed at me and berated me.

558
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,360
And made me eat all of those hash browns that she cooked up.

559
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,800
There was going to be hash browns and skulls.

560
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,360
I'm going to be, oh, I'm sorry.

561
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,580
Yeah, that was it.

562
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,380
That's all.

563
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,320
I was going to be having hash browns and some hummus.

564
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,200
And I was going to walk up and down the hall as many times as I could to get my exercise

565
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,020
because it sucks so bad outside.

566
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,100
I'm not going to go out there.

567
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,940
Hey, I thought of something that we're supposed to talk about.

568
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,320
What is it?

569
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,120
The newly published.

570
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,000
Published subgenius books.

571
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:27,580
Now, of course, we're famous for our nonfiction holy texts, the books of the subgenius and

572
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:33,640
the other 10 that are out of print, Revelation X, Revelation C, and so forth.

573
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:40,020
And the Bobliographon and the Bobliographan and all of those.

574
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:46,160
But we started publishing on our own because, well, Amazon.

575
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,340
Yes.

576
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,960
You don't have to pay anything up front.

577
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,420
It's when somebody wants your book, they just, it's printed right there.

578
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:55,900
Paying behind.

579
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,540
Yeah.

580
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,520
And Amazon keeps most of the money.

581
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:04,000
Anyway, Lonesome Cowboy Dave's book, Neighbor World is out.

582
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,120
I don't know if everybody knew about that.

583
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,900
I mean, it keeps me on it.

584
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,480
It's such a wonderful novel.

585
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,780
It was our first.

586
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,400
Dystopian.

587
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,700
Yeah, it's a dystopian novel.

588
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,140
It's been compared with Brave New World.

589
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,840
1984, 1983, A Merman I Should Turn to Be.

590
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,320
1985, Monster Will Do Hand Jive and a whole bunch of other dystopian novels.

591
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,340
The entire decade, yeah.

592
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,420
Yeah.

593
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,240
What was that one you were telling me about?

594
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,380
The Every, the All, the Nothing.

595
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,480
You did not publish that one.

596
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,260
That is independently published by, I guess I saw it on Amazon thing.

597
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,120
But they are.

598
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,240
Yeah.

599
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,240


600
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,640
These were, these are, you know, they're just books that have been compared to Neighbor

601
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,980
World by Dave DeLuca, also known as Lonesome Cowboy Dave DeLuca.

602
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,060
And yeah, it's a, hey, what can I say?

603
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,500
It's like, isn't it like 200 pages long or something?

604
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,000
That's a lot for your book.

605
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,700
Oh, over 200 pages.

606
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,220
Yeah.

607
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,520
And there's even, it's even illustrated.

608
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,700
It's got pictures of the characters drawn by Dave right at the beginning of it.

609
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,080
So you know what they all look like.

610
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,500
Yeah.

611
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:15,600
They're not, they're not.

612
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,420
They're just kind of scribbly.

613
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:17,780
Yeah.

614
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,520
They look kind of, what do they call it?

615
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:19,920
Sketchy?

616
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,600
Now everybody, how come everyone's been using that term sketchy?

617
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,800
But they are sketchy.

618
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,880
They're sketchy characters.

619
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,840
I know, but that hasn't been used since the thirties, back when they used to have plots

620
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,040
and different things like that.

621
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,300
I mean, you notice in the 1930s, you had a movie and stuff that had to have not just

622
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,880
a leading character or two, but it had to have a story behind it, some kind.

623
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:45,240
Now all there is just like these, these huge car races that blow up everything.

624
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,480
Yeah.

625
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,480


626
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,340
And people shooting guns that have 28 bullets in them, cartridges in there.

627
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,260
Guns that shoot knives and can fly.

628
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,520
Yeah.

629
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,940
And continue, just keep, keep on flying.

630
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,980
I love those.

631
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,440
I love those movies actually.

632
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,320
I eat them up.

633
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,500
I hate them.

634
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,080
It hurts me.

635
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,740
But, oh, and there, and other, in other nerds in subgenius book publishing, Eyelash

636
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,340
by Reverend Nikolai Kingsley, which is the first.

637
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,280
Now whereas Neighbor World isn't specific.

638
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,460
Yeah.

639
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,640
It's not specifically subgenius-y, except in its sort of overall theme that we're all

640
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,260
being turned into skulls by skull farmers of the conspiracy.

641
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:24,680
Yeah.

642
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:30,880
But the, Eyelash has Bob as character at the beginning of it.

643
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:40,100
And then an exist, an actual man from Planet X who happens to be a buxom, beautiful woman.

644
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,720
And then the two subgenius characters.

645
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,460
And, yeah.

646
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:51,200
There's a lot of really, really angry, clumsy, stupid robots that fight constantly.

647
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:59,520
And Alien Squid, who is a veterinarian, who is hired to fix the humans.

648
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,000
And subgenius is on barbecues.

649
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,480
That's Eyelash by Nikolai Kingsley.

650
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:13,620
It takes place partly right at the base of the eyelash of a Yakatizma, which subgeniuses

651
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,320
know are planet sized.

652
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,940
Planet eating robots.

653
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,120
Then there's the latest one.

654
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,760
We got a new one out, Dave, that just came out.

655
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,960
It's hardcover and it's a novella.

656
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,680
So it really, it looks like a little golden book, like when you were a kid.

657
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:35,640
And it's, it's the most perverted and funniest of the, of the three books.

658
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,500
It's called The Agent and Mr. Dobbs by Reverend Teters LaVerge.

659
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,020
I read the entire novella.

660
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,300
I had no idea.

661
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,300


662
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,300


663
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,300


664
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,300


665
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,300


666
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,300


667
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,300


668
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,300


669
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,300


670
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,300


671
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,300


672
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,300


673
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,300


674
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,300


675
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,620
I read it over several hours of slack about 10 years ago.

676
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:55,140
And in fact, Reverend Cosmack liked it so much, he edited all those segments together

677
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,360
into one big 90 minute audio book.

678
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:05,720
So I may be running parts of The Agent and Mr. Dobbs old audio book again, just to help

679
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:13,440
drum up interest in The Agent and Mr. Dobbs, which actually is really funny.

680
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,300
And if somebody was going to make a segment.

681
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:15,300


682
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:15,300


683
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:15,940
I'd say, here's your subgenius movie.

684
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,480
I would no longer hand them my first screenplay.

685
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,260
I wouldn't even hand him my second screenplay.

686
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,780
I'd hand him The Agent and Mr. Dobbs and go, here's your subgenius movie.

687
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,240
And they'll go, but it doesn't really have an ending.

688
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,040
And I'd go, exactly.

689
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,380
Exactly.

690
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,040
Yeah.

691
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,720
Now you see where we're going with this.

692
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:37,660
Yeah.

693
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,460
You want to be able to twiddle your thumbs for the next 20 years.

694
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,020
Yeah.

695
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
Or twaddle them.

696
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,300
Mr. Dobbs was sitting in a large, large, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

697
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,960
and there he was with a large leather armchair with his back to me.

698
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,080
A billow of smoke coming up from his front.

699
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,860
I slowly walked over to him.

700
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,180
He said nothing.

701
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,220
But with his right hand, he motioned me to sit on a folding metal chair adjacent to him.

702
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,740
He seemed to be engrossed in a television program.

703
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,960
It was Leave It to Beaver, a wholesome program.

704
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,500
Suddenly, he began to speak.

705
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,520
I do love this show.

706
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,060
That word cleaver is one relaxed man.

707
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,180
Connie doesn't like me to watch this program.

708
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,860
She thinks it's pornographic, but that's why I like it.

709
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:29,000
He fell into a deep silence, intently watching a commercial and nodding his head in time with the jingle.

710
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,320
When the commercial ended, he turned to me and asked,

711
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,340
What can I do for you, young agent?

712
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,640
I noticed then that even though the upper half of his body was clad in a dark suit with white shirt and dark tie,

713
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,580
the bottom half of his body was clad only in wingtip shoes.

714
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,380
It was very disturbing and put me off for a moment,

715
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:53,740
but I'd been warned by my handlers that this Mr. Dobbs had many tricks up his sleeve,

716
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,720
and I took this as his way of making a person uncomfortable.

717
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,680
We're also about to construct our own metaverse, I think.

718
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:07,700
I don't know what that is, what those are yet, but I'm told that we'll be doing that.

719
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,480
Who gave you the word? Who gave you the go-ahead?

720
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,720
I knew you were waiting for weeks and weeks there.

721
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,200
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

722
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,600
Bob, uh...

723
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,160
Direct from the upper offices, yeah.

724
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:26,460
Actually, this was the AI copy of Bob's brain.

725
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,200
It's still, you could say it was Bob.

726
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,160
You could actually say it was a lot smarter than the original Meat Bob,

727
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,240
who is still around somewhere.

728
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:43,820
The difference is we can dial up the AI Bob 2.0, but we can't.

729
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,120
Nobody knows.

730
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,840
Nobody knows where Bob is unless they happen to be on a fishing trip.

731
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,860
If they're on a fishing trip with him or underneath him in some cheap hotel room,

732
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,080
or topping him in some cheap motel room, or Trump Tower,

733
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:05,840
or trumping Trump in Trump Tower with yellow snow in everyone's mouth,

734
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,580
because that's what I've heard.

735
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,900
You've heard that?

736
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:11,820
Yeah.

737
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,280
Don't ever hear that.

738
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,740
Yeah, as far as I'm concerned.

739
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,960
I discovered an illegal copycat Bob NFT.

740
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,300
I actually own it, or file it.

741
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:25,760
I found it.

742
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,240
File it.

743
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,900
I found somebody selling our trademark as an NFT.

744
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,720
I don't think anyone's bought it, and I don't think you know what an NFT is,

745
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,200
so it doesn't matter.

746
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:40,600
But it does matter to me because I want to stop it before somebody buys it,

747
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,520
but instead I'm doing this stupid show.

748
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,280
And after that, I'm going to do it.

749
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,360
I don't do something else stupid like exercises.

750
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,820
Yeah.

751
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,320
Well, that makes sense.

752
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,420
I follow you 100% on that one.

753
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,940
Yeah, but sooner or later, I have to shut down these bastards with their—

754
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,380
they just decided, oh, well, Bob's Clipart, so we can—

755
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,160
No, Bob was Clipart at one time.

756
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,640
Bob hasn't been Clipart in 40 years.

757
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:13,600
Bob's Clipart is a trademark owned by somebody named Douglas Smith.

758
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,360
I happen to know who that is.

759
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,640
He's the janitor here at the Subgenius Foundation.

760
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,060
He dresses like a woman, and yeah.

761
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,040
Well, we put it in his name so that if somebody kills him for it,

762
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,060
it won't be me that they kill for it, you know, or Bob.

763
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:30,900
Right.

764
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,820
Well, way to go, you know?

765
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,520
I can only offer my own personal kudos.

766
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,100
We're trying to take care of business, but there's a lot of ripoffs out there.

767
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,800
I mean, there really are.

768
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,200
There's a lot of people.

769
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,760
People selling unauthorized, non-licensed Bob Dobbs stuff.

770
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:56,200
We shut them down when we get around to it.

771
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,000
And when I say we, I mean I.

772
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,500
Yeah, there are a lot of commercials that I've noticed lately in this neighborhood,

773
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:10,240
neck of the woods, where a religious cartoon character named Bob endorses a product,

774
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,540
and everybody loves Bob and goes out and gets the product and says,

775
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:19,100
this gives the thumb up to Bob when they close the last shot and stuff.

776
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,000
Well, the worst was that Boner pill.

777
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,480
The Boner pill ads for smiling Bob.

778
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,380
Oh, Prince Boner.

779
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,140
Why is Bob so happy?

780
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,340
Why do the girls love Bob so much?

781
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,340
Well, take these little pills, and if you're a man, you'll find out.

782
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,600
Like Bob.

783
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,880
Just like Bob.

784
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,020
That was a blatant ripoff.

785
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:44,320
Luckily, the guy behind that company and his mom all went,

786
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:44,520
you know, they're going to get a job.

787
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:44,520


788
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,900
They still sold the pills.

789
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,280
But the guy who had the idea of ripping us off,

790
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:59,160
he got his comeuppance or his leave downants or whatever.

791
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,820
He got, he got.

792
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,700
The guy who played Bob.

793
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,880
There was a rumor that the man who played Bob in those commercials died,

794
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,820
drowned in the Caribbean.

795
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,140
But that was just a rumor.

796
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,340
It turned out not to be true.

797
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,940
Well, at least as far as I was concerned, it was all false and full of nothing but vapor slides.

798
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,560
I can't even remember the name of the.

799
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,700
Oh, now I remember the name of him, and I'm not going to say him.

800
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,000
Bob's bathroom decor.

801
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,740
Those box bathrooms that could fit any generation at any age.

802
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:40,320
It's just bringing it covers up the towels and the bathtub and the sink and everything.

803
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,740
It makes it look like an entirely new bathroom.

804
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,140
Is that what you're talking about?

805
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:44,680
No.

806
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,200
Oh, okay.

807
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,180
No, I don't know.

808
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,620
I don't know what I'm talking about.

809
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,080
I know even less about what you're talking about.

810
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:58,440
Well, there's on the local television, there's a Bob guy, a cartoon character whose name

811
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,360
is Bob and everybody.

812
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,080
Oh, they do it, Bob.

813
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,780
Say this and that and whatnot, Bob.

814
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,940
Bob, you.

815
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,960
Is this recent?

816
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,700
And oh.

817
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,220
Yes, it is recent because I, well, within the last two weeks, because I keep trying

818
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,000
to remind myself to remember it.

819
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,500
I tell you that to tell you that there, but it doesn't look like Bob.

820
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,240
It doesn't look like Bob Clippard at all.

821
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,460
Oh, well, that doesn't matter.

822
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,380
Another cartoon.

823
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,720
It's another cartoon face.

824
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,480
Oh, it's Bob again, bringing us plenty of this and whatever Bob brings us.

825
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,700
Well, here's the important thing.

826
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,720
Does he have a pipe?

827
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,820
I think that got me going one night.

828
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,480
I think one of them did, but maybe not.

829
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,340
Maybe no telltale pipe to hang our bitches on.

830
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,700
But, well, I was falling asleep.

831
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,380
What do you expect?

832
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,200
You know, now there's that Bob guy.

833
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,320
Right.

834
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,400
Oh, it puts me to sleep real fast.

835
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,320
Like this show.

836
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,900
This show just usually knocks me right out.

837
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,020
It doesn't affect everybody that way, though.

838
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,500
My daughter wouldn't listen to it.

839
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,740
She liked to contribute to it, but she wouldn't listen to it because she said it gave her

840
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,980
a headache every time.

841
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,980
Imagine that.

842
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:19,240
Our mellifluous voices lapping against the seashore like water make it a headache.

843
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,900
Yapping against the seashore like an ocean.

844
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:31,840
Don't you see how much more discreet and iconoplastic that made her instead of the

845
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,240
old man?

846
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,620
You have to love Bob.

847
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,380
He loves you, but you love Bob.

848
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,620
You have to.

849
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,360
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

850
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,340
He'll kill you.

851
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,160
He'll bob you out.

852
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,540
He'll bob you out, folks.

853
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,420
You heard it here first.

854
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,620
If you don't love Bob, he'll bob you out, man.

855
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:04,360
And that was my baby daughter, Sivit, staying at age six or so.

856
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,240
And here she is, probably around age 12 or so.

857
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,300
So she's actually now about 40 or so.

858
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:14,880
Yeah.

859
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,560
Now Bob, I smell his drop around me.

860
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,560
And when I have no slack, I touch my gland and Bob has found me.

861
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:57,240
On my job, the noddles act like dumb shits.

862
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:04,420
Without slack, the sweat runs down my armpits.

863
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,160
The next day, I'll see the sun.

864
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,020
The sun's coming.

865
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,860
And all I need is Bob and me forever and forever.

866
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:29,580
But until I spend my 30 bucks, I'm just ranting to myself and not to Bob.

867
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:36,280
And although I know that I am screwed,

868
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,220
still I'm still going to be a good boy.

869
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:45,260
I say, there's a day of pain.

870
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:55,220
I love Bob, but when the rupture's over, he'll be gone.

871
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,220
The earth will be in ruins.

872
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,240
Without him, the world around me changes.

873
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,040
The conspiracy is everywhere.

874
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,200
The malls are full of pink boys.

875
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:22,960
I love Bob, but every day I don't spend the 30 bucks.

876
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,140
I'm only just pretending.

877
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,520
Without me, Bob's world will go on burning.

878
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,300
On next day, Bob will have this land that I'll never know.

879
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,600
On this day, I'll be a naked

880
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:43,600


881
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:43,620
On above...

882
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,560
I love Bob.

883
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,700
On above.

884
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,500
Bob love me on my own.

885
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:51,500


886
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:51,580
A love Bob.

887
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:57,240
l'm only on my own.

888
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,960
I don't know.

889
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,140
I'm on my own.

890
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,040
I don't know what's up with that.

891
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,960
Uh, you know, just joined this religion recently . . .

892
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,220
quez near people all over the globe and you know, for debt . . .

893
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,380
If that's what you call a religion.

894
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:17,040
You're one of the newbies from the 1990s.

895
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,080
Well, if you can't be a newbie, what can you be?

896
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,760
Eh?

897
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,680
Eh, Minad?

898
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,600
An oldie.

899
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,660
Oldie too much.

900
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,920
Me too.

901
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,100
Oldie too much.

902
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:35,300
Hold it between your knees and sing in the reptilian songs of our ancestors.

903
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,800
If there are any.

904
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:44,240
I know some of them seem relative, related by family.

905
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,220
Did you hear what I just said or was I mumbling again?

906
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:54,520
I wasn't paying any attention because I was trying to set up Princess We here on microphone two.

907
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,600
I think it is.

908
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,540
No, no, over here, over here, over here.

909
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,360
Okay.

910
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,320
The one on the cushion with its butt on the cushion.

911
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:01,740
Okay.

912
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,160
It had an operation for, you know, pot.

913
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:05,420
Piles.

914
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,820
And it has to sit on one of those special cushions.

915
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,340
It's sad.

916
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,080
It had an operation for its condition.

917
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,460
Does she have a monitor so she can tell if I sound?

918
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,460
There's not much I can do.

919
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,420
She has headphones on, but they're not nearly as good as mine.

920
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,440
I have really fancy new headphones.

921
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,440
Yeah, he does.

922
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,260
Scared the hell out of the dog.

923
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:29,780
Chippy.

924
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,920
Chippy came in and saw me with them on and ran away.

925
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,600
Well, you know, they're kind of sparkly.

926
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,680
They're really shiny and sparkly.

927
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,740
I can imagine that she would get scared at those.

928
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,400
Well, she knows my head.

929
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,960
She knows they are also a weapon.

930
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,460
You know, they have to.

931
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,740
She recognizes that.

932
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,560
No, no.

933
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,120
The microphone.

934
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,120
You're wearing the dog's hat again.

935
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:52,940
Hats.

936
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,440
The dog's hats with a posture here above the eye.

937
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,080
Hey, did I tell you that Buddy's not okay?

938
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,720
Well, he is now.

939
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,440
But he got beat up by the young.

940
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:04,940
Younger male.

941
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,160
Yeah, you told me that yesterday.

942
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:07,900
Yeah.

943
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,560
Or the day before.

944
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,400
Yeah, he, I don't know what.

945
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,700
He, you know, Buddy's the old one.

946
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,300
The old male.

947
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,120
He's been acting all alpha like bossing the other dogs around.

948
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,360
Well, not his sister Claudia so much.

949
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,780
No, but he's been stealing their chews and being real haughty.

950
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,140
Yeah.

951
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,860
Going around taking wastebaskets apart and all kinds of crazy behavior.

952
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,300
Yeah.

953
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,400
The other day he crossed his younger rival Yeti,

954
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,180
who is about four times Buddy's size.

955
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,960
Actually, he's four times everybody's size.

956
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,580
Yeah, he is.

957
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,000
Yeah, he is too.

958
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:45,780
And they got into a, boy, Buddy was being tossed by the neck like a little squirrel.

959
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,780
And I was terrified.

960
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,100
That's horrible.

961
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,020
I'm still traumatized by it.

962
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,920
I don't even know how I'm going to ever get over this.

963
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,880
Yeah, Dave's traumatized too.

964
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,280
The dogs and I got over it.

965
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:54,720
I know.

966
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,040
You just shook it right off.

967
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,140
But I just, I can't stop seeing it.

968
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:01,240
You know, I go through it in my head over and over and I can't stop.

969
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,080
I thought.

970
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:07,940
I thought that Buddy's leg had been broken by a bite because he couldn't walk at first.

971
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:13,220
And he did manage to make it up the stairs and climb into the bed with me.

972
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,460
And he stayed in that bed for 24 hours straight with us bringing him food and water.

973
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,360
And meds.

974
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,600
And meds.

975
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:26,040
And he never peed or anything for 24 hours straight.

976
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:31,140
And finally last night he got up as if he had never been bitten.

977
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,000
And tried.

978
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,460
And potted down.

979
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:32,780
Yeah.

980
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,220
Outside and peed.

981
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,620
Yeah, he wasn't limping or anything.

982
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,080
Yeah.

983
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:37,620
And.

984
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:44,240
But my God, if I had been shaken the way that Buddy was shaken by our big dog, I wouldn't

985
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,020
be back yet.

986
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,020
I'd still be laying in bed trying to heal.

987
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:51,360
It was a whole day at least operation getting yourself together.

988
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,040
I was there because I remember when my dog got beat up that way and just watching it

989
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,520
and not being able to do anything about it.

990
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,880
Pull the other dog off of him.

991
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,860
And just think, well, my dog's going to die from a neck.

992
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,060
Yeah.

993
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:02,060


994
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:02,060


995
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:02,240
Right.

996
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,800
Well, we learned that this will be of interest to dog owning listeners.

997
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,780
Princess, we read that the one way that you break up a dog fight is grab the attacking

998
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,380
dog's hind legs.

999
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,120
It's called the wheelbarrow.

1000
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:16,800
The wheelbarrow.

1001
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,020
Yeah.

1002
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:17,420
You pull.

1003
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,780
Pull them up and out.

1004
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,280
Pull their feet up and away.

1005
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:26,680
Now, then you have to hope that that attacking dog doesn't spin around and attack you.

1006
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,620
The article said that that's generally not what happens because the dog.

1007
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,600
Isn't angry at you.

1008
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,000
He's angry at the other dog.

1009
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,040
They usually don't lash out at the person that's pulling him away.

1010
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:39,460
No, man.

1011
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,460
That time.

1012
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,120
The one time Buddy and Claudia got into a fight.

1013
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:43,520
Oh, I know.

1014
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,980
They were tripping.

1015
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:53,760
I pulled Buddy off of Claudia and he turned around and bit my leg so hard that I had to sit in bed for two days.

1016
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:54,640
Yeah.

1017
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,420
That was bad.

1018
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,700
I'm whimpering and licking.

1019
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,500
That was bad.

1020
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,200
I had to lick my.

1021
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,160
Man, I wore my tongue out licking my leg.

1022
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,140
I'm licking your legs like a little baby.

1023
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,880
Like a dog.

1024
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,400
That's so sweet.

1025
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,380
Like, oh, well.

1026
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,180
Licking my wounds.

1027
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,640
That's what Buddy did.

1028
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,180
Sitting next to me.

1029
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,300
He's still licking his wounds.

1030
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:12,660
Yeah.

1031
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,400
Did you lick your wounds?

1032
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,380
I can't lick the back of his neck.

1033
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,640
I was doing that for him.

1034
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,140
Well, I did too.

1035
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,860
Let's give credit where credit's due.

1036
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,100
I wondered who else was licking the back of Buddy's neck.

1037
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:24,520
The back of his neck.

1038
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,800
It was so scary.

1039
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:26,800
It's all covered.

1040
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,280
I was in the.

1041
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,720
Dead blood.

1042
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,300
Ugh.

1043
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,040
God.

1044
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,420
I was in the meta world.

1045
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,320
So I was there.

1046
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,460
Even if I'm more resembled with Mr. Rogers playing Lincoln.

1047
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,380
I was there.

1048
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,360
Somehow.

1049
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,560
Dave was there.

1050
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,360
Oh, Dave was there.

1051
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,560
And there is here.

1052
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,240
And he returned to there.

1053
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,220
Princess, your voice sounded great just now.

1054
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,800
Here is now.

1055
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,680
Princess, how does my voice sound?

1056
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,940
Do I sound all beat up and crashed?

1057
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,220
No, you sound just like Dave.

1058
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:02,480
Dave.

1059
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:02,900
Okay.

1060
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:03,620
I just wondered.

1061
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,620
Earlier today, he sounded like this.

1062
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,880
Then when I told him about it, then he quit.

1063
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,800
Then he accused me of speaking clearer right after that.

1064
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:16,680
And as I'm telling you folks, it's really hard doing a weekly radio show.

1065
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,080
Especially when you only actually do it every month or so.

1066
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,640
Especially when you're weak.

1067
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,200
Yeah.

1068
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,040
Weak.

1069
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:22,560
Yeah.

1070
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,480
Weekly show.

1071
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,180
That's the way it's been lately.

1072
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:25,900
Weak.

1073
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,400
Weekly.

1074
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,060
Weekly radio show.

1075
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,260
Weekly reruns.

1076
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,300
They were great.

1077
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,020
All the reruns were killer.

1078
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:33,680
Yeah.

1079
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,100
They're even better when they're watered by a part of the langitudes.

1080
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,900
When you get a little bit of extra fertilizer on them, they just jump right out of the skull

1081
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,880
and you're back in bee's knees.

1082
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,080
Back in the bee's knees.

1083
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:47,540
Yeah.

1084
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,440
I wish I had some bees.

1085
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,720
Why don't you guys become bee, what do you call it?

1086
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,000
Beekeepers?

1087
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:53,360
Beekeepers.

1088
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,680
What do they call it?

1089
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,220
Heavy area and pimple bunions?

1090
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,920
What do they call them?

1091
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,000
Yeah.

1092
00:46:59,220 --> 00:46:59,460
Yeah.

1093
00:46:59,460 --> 00:46:59,560
Yeah.

1094
00:46:59,560 --> 00:46:59,640
Yeah.

1095
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,260
Yeah.

1096
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:00,280


1097
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:00,440


1098
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:00,440


1099
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:00,440


1100
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:00,440


1101
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:01,400


1102
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:01,400


1103
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:01,400


1104
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:01,400


1105
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:01,400


1106
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:01,400


1107
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:01,400


1108
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:01,400


1109
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:01,400


1110
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:01,400


1111
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,940
I'm doing that just because I'm a chicken.

1112
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,420
Well, yeah.

1113
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,400
Bees hate chickens.

1114
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,800
I mean, unless they're deep fried in country bread.

1115
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,360
Now, I have several friends that are beekeepers and they love beekeeping.

1116
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,580
Well, they can walk into a swarm of bees and not get stung and everybody who sees that

1117
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,940
goes, what are you?

1118
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,640
Are you crazy or what?

1119
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,220
Does it count if you're a beekeeper?

1120
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,180
I've got that urinal.

1121
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,580
Oh, I've got to empty that urinal up there pretty soon.

1122
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,240
For the.

1123
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:31,600
Dogs.

1124
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,200
Dogs knock it over.

1125
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,660
That would be a real mess.

1126
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,240
Wouldn't be good for the carpet.

1127
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,140
Turn that blue carpet into green.

1128
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,020
It would be green in a splash pad.

1129
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:41,320
Yeah.

1130
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,880
Do you have a bunch of toilets throughout the property that you use as dog dishes?

1131
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,000
Please don't tell me you do that.

1132
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:56,700
We have them in 10 places around the property and they all have bidets and wind chimes and

1133
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,360
little incense and ashtray with always.

1134
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,000
Well, that's great.

1135
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,740
That's fantastic

1136
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:06,760
But no lighter because there's a burn ban on here

1137
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,000
No one can light a fire in Texas

1138
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,560
No

1139
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,320
For now

1140
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,700
Yeah, you have to be 30 yards from the building, yeah

1141
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,700
Oh no, you can't light any kind of

1142
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,620
Just don't light a fire

1143
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,920
Yeah, you gotta vape, no smoking

1144
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,340
Well, I know there's one thing they say, yeah, right

1145
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,640
Right, exactly

1146
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,320
Yeah, don't even ignite any tobacco

1147
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,820
They won't let Dave smoke inside his own room

1148
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,360
What?

1149
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,660
Yeah, the insane asylum

1150
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,400
What?

1151
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,820
They won't let any of those people

1152
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:39,040
Not only that, if he wanted to have a six pack of beer

1153
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:39,260
Yeah

1154
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,540
He'd have to smuggle it in, like in a dorm room

1155
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:42,660
What? Why?

1156
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,320
Because it's that cheap

1157
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,300
Because it's like a hospital?

1158
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,840
No, because it's real cheap

1159
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,480
Because Dave's really old

1160
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,440
And so they have rules like that

1161
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,380
That you can't bring in alcohol and tobacco

1162
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,040
Right

1163
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,720
Low income housing

1164
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,120
Jeez

1165
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:58,740
That's what they call that

1166
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,500
Wow

1167
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:04,820
And people, middle class people are real mad at poor people

1168
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,200
Because poor people have everything

1169
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,980
I've heard this so many times

1170
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,220
Oh, some poor person was lying in a supermarket in front of me

1171
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,480
She was buying steak

1172
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,520
I just had to buy chicken

1173
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,620
It's like, how do you know that's a poor person?

1174
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,920
Well, you could tell

1175
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,060
Yeah, I think I know what our friend means

1176
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,640
But that's not, no

1177
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,960
He's profiling

1178
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,100
Yeah, he was profiling

1179
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,620
He was profiling

1180
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:30,400
You can't tell who's a poor person

1181
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:30,600
No

1182
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,100
I mean, I look rich, don't I?

1183
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,480
But you'd be fooled

1184
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,680
My fancy shoes, my fancy clothes and car that I drive

1185
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,620
I look rich, don't I?

1186
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,660
You'd never think I was rich as Midas

1187
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,880
You'd just assume, well, that guy's on welfare

1188
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,380
They make $35,000 a year, did you know that?

1189
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,960
On welfare, you get $35,000 a year

1190
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,220
Which is not at all true

1191
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,420
I know

1192
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,880
And you also can't stay on welfare forever

1193
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,600
And it's, I was going, well, and they drive Cadillacs

1194
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:11,560
Well, why don't you just get on welfare if you want to drive Cadillacs and eat steak?

1195
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,000
And the answer was, I don't want to live in a cardboard box

1196
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,600
Make up your mind

1197
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:19,720
Which is it?

1198
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,080
Who said this?

1199
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,060
Are poor people rich or are they poor?

1200
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,760
Fair enough, people

1201
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,160
Believe me

1202
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,100
It's a cross-border

1203
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,420
Section of conversations, actually

1204
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:30,680
Yes

1205
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:37,220
I'm not, I try not to just live inside my little subgenius bubble of purity of Dobbs

1206
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,120
I like to see what the idiots are thinking also

1207
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:48,860
So I've been monitoring, I've been monitoring, let's call it the extremists' normals

1208
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,420
The extremist normals for my whole life, practically

1209
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,900
Urban bourbon legends

1210
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,080
Well, I was raised among them, you see

1211
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,580
I'm part Pobucker

1212
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:58,940
Part

1213
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,300
I understand

1214
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,400
I'm also part elite

1215
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,420
In fact, more elite than the richest elites

1216
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,120
Bourbon legends

1217
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:12,260
No, I'm elite in my knowledge

1218
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,280
I have knowledge of Dobbs

1219
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,380
I memorized Book of the Subgenius

1220
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,220
I forgot it

1221
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,420
I didn't

1222
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:18,820
I didn't

1223
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,860
No, I

1224
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:24,440
Heck, I assembled the whole thing on that big table right over there

1225
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,920
When this was Pappy's house

1226
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,920
Because I didn't have a table

1227
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,360
I had that big, my shelf

1228
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,700
And now it's my table

1229
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,540
Thanks, Pap

1230
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,440
Thanks, Pap

1231
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,400
And Mammy

1232
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,720
And Mammy

1233
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,900
And Mappy

1234
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,840
And Mappy and Flappy

1235
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,740
And Pappy and Pappy

1236
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,280
And my brother for doing all the repairs for Pappy

1237
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:43,740
Oh, goodness

1238
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,280
And followed by my nephews for doing all

1239
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,380
That's for doggone sure

1240
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,880
Now I gotta hire my grandson

1241
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,660
Dave's trying to hire his grandson

1242
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,140
But these zombies these days, they don't wanna work

1243
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,980
They just wanna lay around in their grave all day long

1244
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,000
They just wanna creep their...

1245
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,820
When I was a zombie, we used to eat the flesh of a living being every morning

1246
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,700
Before we could go

1247
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,700
And we...

1248
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,860
But, yeah

1249
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,040
Actually, that's an old Jane or Hyperclete's routine

1250
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,340
And I'm not supposed to use that

1251
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,300
No, don't use those

1252
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,980
I'm not even supposed to mention him

1253
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:14,720
Because if

1254
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,760
Every time I do, I owe him another $10,000

1255
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,220
Yes

1256
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,280
According to him

1257
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,920
Well, he claimed that one stick was worth $10,000, huh?

1258
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:22,500
Yep

1259
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,860
Well, he might have been right

1260
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,540
Somewhere

1261
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,060
No

1262
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:26,380
No

1263
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,960
Well, I'd send him the $10,000

1264
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,380
But he's never been able to tell me his correct address

1265
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,800
He's not kidding, even, Dave

1266
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,400
No, I'm not

1267
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:36,880
There's been...

1268
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,500
There's at least two times in a row that we mailed money to Jane or...

1269
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,880
And it bounced back because it wasn't his zip code

1270
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,220
Right

1271
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,240
He could not give us his own real zip code

1272
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:47,500
Right

1273
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:48,780
Huh

1274
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,500
I never met a person who didn't know their own zip code

1275
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,140
Good...

1276
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:55,360
You...

1277
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,760
It's a lucky you that you never met Jane or...

1278
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,040
Why don't you invite him over to your house?

1279
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,100
Well, I...

1280
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:02,480
I...

1281
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,580
No thanks

1282
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:04,920
But I...

1283
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,220
I remember him very very...

1284
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,180
That's whenever somebody goes,

1285
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,140
Man, Jane or Harper Clutes, what's he like?

1286
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,580
I go, why don't you invite him over and find out?

1287
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,440
You'll soon see

1288
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,600
It's like saying, why don't you just jump in this pit of fire?

1289
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,340
No

1290
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,000
Pit of snakes

1291
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,740
Just giving people an opportunity to find out for themselves

1292
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,560
So that I'm not talking about someone behind their back

1293
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,100
I guess

1294
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,440
On broadcast radio

1295
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,280
I guess

1296
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,320
You're talking right at their front, yep

1297
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:37,580
Or on my little living room radio shack radio station

1298
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,280
Tarzan's

1299
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,900
We do have sound effects machine now, listen to this

1300
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,240
When is X day, friends?

1301
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,720
Why it could be tonight!

1302
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,700
Are you ready?

1303
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,000
Sounds like CBS Mystery Theater from 1938 or something

1304
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,720
Have you done...

1305
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,780
I'll join the church of the subgenius

1306
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,660
Hey, guess what?

1307
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,380
We've got a special deal for you

1308
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,960
We just raised our prices

1309
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,640
Wait until you see our excuses for that

1310
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,720
At subgenius.com

1311
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,660
If you are taking the government's...

1312
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,220
No, not the government, but the whole...

1313
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:13,660
And if...

1314
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,860
Right there on the front page of subgenius.com

1315
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,800
It tells you how you can hear the radio show

1316
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,140
Every episode of the radio show for free

1317
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:26,400
It tells how you can get hold of Lonesome Cowboy Dave's book Neighbor World

1318
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,860
And the new one, The Agent and Mr. Dobbs and Eyelash

1319
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,140
And the book of the subgenius

1320
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:37,300
It shows you a link to every place that's playing the subgenius movie

1321
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:41,400
J.R. Bob Dobson and the Church of the Subgenius directed by Sandy Boone

1322
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,420
Woohoo!

1323
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,420
And guess what?

1324
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,900
It's on Tubi for free with ads

1325
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,740
Yeah, yeah

1326
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:47,360
I turned it on

1327
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,060
I was going through...

1328
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:52,040
Tubi is one of those internet TV networks that's...

1329
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,380
You don't have to pay for it

1330
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,240
If you got one of those...

1331
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,860
If you got one service...

1332
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,240
I guess the TV's will tune it in now

1333
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,620
If you got internet

1334
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,900
And it has ads

1335
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,200
But they have all the best bad movies

1336
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,100
And old movies

1337
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,140
And great movies

1338
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,900
Stuff that's kind of old

1339
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,660
I was watching The Good, Bad and the Ugly last night

1340
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,640
While I did my stretches

1341
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,300
But get this

1342
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,300
I was flipping through the recommended for you

1343
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,600
And what title card comes up?

1344
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,020
But J.R. Bob Dobson and the Church of the Subgenius

1345
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,620
And here's what it said on the screen

1346
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:30,780
Starring Douglas Smith, Nick Offerman and Richard Linklater

1347
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,880
And I thought that's the weirdest thing

1348
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,500
Why didn't it...

1349
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,040
It doesn't say Reverend Ivan Stang

1350
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,380
It had the janitor's name instead

1351
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,780
And instead of showing a picture of Bob or Reverend Stang

1352
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,960
It showed Paul Mavridis

1353
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,100
Who doesn't look anything like Bob or Stang

1354
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:47,380
Or you

1355
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,140
Or Douglas

1356
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:48,880
No

1357
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,660
Well can you get this thing with the janitor resolved somehow?

1358
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,220
Well every week I have to hear about

1359
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,520
How he's you know

1360
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,540
Stealing your properties

1361
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:59,920
And taking your values and so forth

1362
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,100
And running them down the toilet

1363
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:01,980
No no

1364
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,700
The worst thing he's ever done is steal our dope

1365
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:07,400
That's it

1366
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,960
He hasn't stolen the turkey and the...

1367
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,100
The last time I was trying to do some plumbing

1368
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,920
And I was looking around for the pipe dope

1369
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,380
You know that stuff you put on the

1370
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,420
Spreads of old metal pipes

1371
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,260
Right you tried to smoke it

1372
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,480
It was all gone and it was Doug Smith

1373
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,680
Had gotten in and rooted around

1374
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,600
Pilfered it all

1375
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:25,960
Yeah

1376
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,900
Wait a minute that reminds me

1377
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:28,720
Where's my pills?

1378
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,820
He pilfered the pills and the pipe dope

1379
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:31,940
No

1380
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:33,300
And the pipe

1381
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,040
Good lord

1382
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,220
Knowing him he's probably stuffed the pipe full of pills

1383
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,100
And burned them up

1384
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,180
And

1385
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,160
Probably did

1386
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,920
And since the pipe is made of you know copper

1387
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,180
Or old cast iron or something

1388
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,800
It probably heated up and burned him

1389
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:53,020
And then he rubbed the pipe dope on the burns

1390
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:55,200
Instead of bag bomb

1391
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,920
Which is the only medicine you need for anything

1392
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,700
Ever

1393
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,440
Yeah you can rub on your titties

1394
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,920
Bag bomb is really a delicious article to wear

1395
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,560
The dogs sure love it

1396
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,200
They do

1397
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,600
They lick it off my chapped hands

1398
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,940
Whenever I'm trying to medicate my chaps

1399
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:14,020
Yeah they smell it and they're like mmm

1400
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,000
My chappy

1401
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,300
How come you don't get hostages?

1402
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,360
Chappy has cracks

1403
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,240
Chappy has fears

1404
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,480
My hand has chappy

1405
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,600
Chappy has fears

1406
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,620
Chappy has fears

1407
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,080
Chappy

1408
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:29,980
Chappy

1409
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,380
Chappy

1410
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:30,380


1411
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:30,500
Chappy

1412
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:30,520
Chappy

1413
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:30,520


1414
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,840
He's a self aware robot

1415
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,160
You'll see someday when he's your boss

1416
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,380
Someday I will see

1417
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,040
What the pee pee pee pee pee pee

1418
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:48,340
I will stand and dance in the dark

1419
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:52,080
When the trumpet calls X day

1420
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,520
In a brother and sister band

1421
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,880
When they blow the world away

1422
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,820
We shall have paradise

1423
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,500
Subgenie of the world unite

1424
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:09,660
Alien sex every night

1425
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,620
Subgenie of the world

1426
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,260
Subgenie of the world

1427
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,300
Subgenie of the world unite

1428
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,120
Make men crazy

1429
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,420
Not to buy

1430
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,600
With through love

1431
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,240
Young and отправsy

1432
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:41,240


1433
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,540
The way of how a man is

1434
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,720
