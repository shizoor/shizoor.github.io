00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:03,520
MYTTinya

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,580
Is someone there?

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,080
You

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,240
Yes

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:11,380
that

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,480
isn't

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,280
a

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,380
question

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:27,940
Slacking.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,800
Okay, kids.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,900
I want you to come to a nice mutual agreement.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,820
You're a slave?

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:38,820
Okay, our...

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,500
Okay, so that's...

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,220
You're a slave.

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,040
Oh, it's not true.

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,500
The figure that just came out...

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,580
I said nicely.

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,340
They don't care about you.

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,120
Uh...

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,640
Slave?

22
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,720
But listen, he brings up a good point.

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,560
I mean, it's free, but come on.

24
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,200
Then why would you say slave?

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,800
You know, what would be the percentage you'd be?

26
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,680
As time goes on, people do need things.

27
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,880
Either you're a slave or you're not a slave.

28
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,660
What are you?

29
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,800
You know, I gotta find this...

30
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,380
Again.

31
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,840
You know, you're gonna start to see...

32
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,360
Right now.

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,240
And then we're gonna get into some more facts here.

34
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,480
I mean, give me a break.

35
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:08,940
Anyway.

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,240
Okay, nice try.

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,860
How do you think the world will end?

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,240
Any of us.

39
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,000
How will the universe...

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,460
Fire, fire, fire.

41
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,120


42
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,420
Fire, fire, fire.

43
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,600
How will the universe end?

44
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,140
Fire, fire, fire.

45
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,040
Will it be a...

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,480
Can I kiss my explosion?

47
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,200
Oh, the universe?

48
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,080
Yeah.

49
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,380
Oh, it can't really end, end.

50
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,200
The world, whatever.

51
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,160
Everything.

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,000
Ah, greasy barking and drooling.

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,160
A little bit of crying.

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,800
Humans, humans.

55
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,380
And some getting...

56
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:57,860
Human society.

57
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:57,920
Human society.

58
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:57,920


59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:57,920


60
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:57,920


61
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:57,920


62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:57,920


63
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,960
What do you mean by the world?

64
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,200
Rolling around and scratching.

65
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,680
The world.

66
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,920
When will the world end?

67
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,320
You know, there's people out...

68
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,280
Guys in the streets.

69
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:06,880
You know what I'm saying?

70
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,000
The world will end tomorrow.

71
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,060
Well, when you close your eyes for the big sleep, that is when the world will end.

72
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,300
Yeah, we're talking about now.

73
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,320
We're talking about now.

74
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,640
We're talking about now.

75
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,160
About the continuance of the magnetic world.

76
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,400
Seems like a pretty big sleep to me.

77
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,620
As we die in our resurrected daily, much in the same way our own foolishness.

78
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,480
As it comes up and goes down.

79
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,800
We annihilated the world before your very ears and utterly destroyed.

80
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,140
Wow.

81
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,980
We have succeeded in opening one of the crisis doors.

82
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,760
The instruments here are going crazy.

83
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,780
I think what we've been suspecting all along may already be happening, Doctor.

84
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,260
I'm almost sure of it.

85
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,240
Get into your choppers and head north immediately.

86
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,000
Don't stop for a thing.

87
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,920
It may be the end of the world.

88
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,440
Invasion.

89
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,160
Invasion.

90
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,160


91
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,620
Now it looks as though we may have planted seeds in the dead soil of a lost world.

92
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:15,060
That sound you just heard could well be the result of a nuclear explosion somewhere down

93
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,760
here at the bottom of the world.

94
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Then time out from invasion for lunch.

95
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,260
I'm sure we'll be able to find a way to get out of this.

96
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,740
Many of you within the sound of my voice will be present at the birth of the 21st century.

97
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,780
Some among us were born a little too early for that.

98
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,600
We'll just have to sit around and guess what life in the 2000s may be like.

99
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,760
We annihilated the world before your very ears and utterly destroyed.

100
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,140
Wow.

101
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,560
Apocalypse Whenever by Norell Preff, dear friends.

102
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,420
Before that, I'm going to be a little more serious.

103
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:57,420


104
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,440
On the air by Rev. Cobblestone.

105
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:11,760
Before that, some ESO and an intro by Fernanda Nande-Lee Murr for this show number 916.

106
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,340
Hours of slack.

107
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,860
916 of them.

108
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:26,720
Now, some ESO radio from WCSB Cleveland from last night.

109
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,820
And last, a Thanksgiving.

110
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,300
We're at the Death's Grip Inn waiting for the clowns to fall.

111
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,200
And it's the first contestants from Old Life and Cherrywood's Hamlet Kirsten's Room at

112
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,840
Pinochet 5.

113
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,140
I would like to start this song with a brief explanation.

114
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,280
Oh, this is one of the philosophical ones.

115
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,700
I'm not going to do that.

116
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:56,700


117
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,740
мощнейшего Jay export

118
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,800
Thank you.

119
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,580
Oh, I'm not going to do that.

120
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,740
Are you already sweet souls in the season of a

121
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,140
Якby made in Dallas.

122
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,140


123
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:13,000
Enough they came from the

124
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000


125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000


126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,440
still

127
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,900
All bans

128
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:20,920
I'm Company

129
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,040
All neglect

130
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,040


131
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,040


132
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,040


133
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,740
S

134
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,760
all

135
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:23,760


136
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:23,780
Everything

137
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:23,780


138
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:23,780


139
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:23,780


140
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:23,780


141
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,260
Pumpkin, right? Like pumpkin pie, right?

142
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,960
Punk, pumpkin, pumpkin pie.

143
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,740
Thanks God for no future.

144
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,600
Thanks God for a rotten fucking mess.

145
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,960
Thanks God for being on the dole.

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,960
It's funny.

147
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,380
Funny thing ain't funny.

148
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,400
I don't think he's funny.

149
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,180
Fucking mess.

150
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,880
I don't think he's funny.

151
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,040
He is the beast of the apocalypse.

152
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,300
Thanks God for a damn industrial nightmare.

153
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,060
And no jobs for the worthy.

154
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,280
I think you sound mean and nasty.

155
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,900
Thanks Lord for coming night.

156
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,260
Maybe this one will lighten the mood a little.

157
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,520
Thanks for college radio.

158
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,040
It's chaotic discord with a song called

159
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,320
Fuck religion, fuck politics.

160
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,200
Fuck the lot of you.

161
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,340
Thanks for religion.

162
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,740
Fuck religion.

163
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:20,740


164
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,680
For religion.

165
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,000
Thanks to Roy's lazy fucking lot.

166
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,920
Fuck politics.

167
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,140
Fuck the lot of you.

168
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,320
Fucking out.

169
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,860
Fucking, fucking money.

170
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,360
And for some of those people out there who have given up the goat.

171
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,900
Punkin, punkin, punkin pie.

172
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,860
Punkin, punkin, punkin pie.

173
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,420
Punkin pie.

174
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,240
You're on my foot.

175
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,380
You got some kind of punk collection?

176
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,560
Is that what happened here, Chaz?

177
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,800
20 years of greatest punk golden oldies?

178
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,540
Yeah.

179
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,080
It's down to 43 now.

180
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,440
Remember these amazing hits.

181
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,080
Yeah.

182
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,260
The Sex Pistols.

183
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,960
The Crabs.

184
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,320
The Clears.

185
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,340
The Fuck You.

186
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,040
Do you remember I Wanna Hang Your Dog by the Sarcomas from Greece?

187
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,720
Teenage Jesus and the Jerks.

188
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:07,900
All these.

189
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,040
Dodgers for Wotan.

190
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,780
Dodgers for Wotan.

191
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,440
Hey man.

192
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,680
The Sarcomas from Greece.

193
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,160
Me and the Poopoos.

194
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,480
There's Slaughter and the Dogs does a version of White Light White Heat.

195
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,060
Let's hear this.

196
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,660
Oh yeah, Slaughter and the Dogs did a good version.

197
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,540
Pooh, Wotan, Poopoo.

198
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,280
Pooh, Wotan, Pooh, Water Towel.

199
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,220
Now that was a...

200
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,040
Pooh, Water Towel?

201
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,740
Pooh, Water Towel.

202
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,480
Pooh, Water Towel.

203
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,140
They were the ultimate nihilistic punk band.

204
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,800
They hated everything so much that they would just destroy all their equipment before they

205
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,820
even did the... started the show.

206
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,560
Like in the truck out back.

207
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,260
That's how nihilistic... so the audience couldn't even see them destroy their equipment.

208
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,720
Then they'd come on stage and just sit there.

209
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,040
That's punk.

210
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,320
That's punk.

211
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,380
They were totally punk.

212
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,280
And they were so punk that they looked kind of like Bob.

213
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,280
Just real normal.

214
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,080
They didn't have tattoos or...

215
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,540
Because they didn't have tattoos.

216
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,740
They didn't have time for that shit.

217
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,480
Yeah, because they didn't have time for that shit.

218
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:55,540


219
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,920
Yeah, because it was like a...

220
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,680
Fuck it!

221
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,700
Fuck the punk scene!

222
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,080
I remember those guys.

223
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,060
I remember them real well, but the problem is...

224
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,780
I remember the kinder, gentler side of...

225
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,100
They don't remember us now because of the implants.

226
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,100
Then everything got kinder and gentler with New Wave.

227
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,060
That was the Bush era.

228
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,920
That was the era of the hairy man, in fact.

229
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,900
It's hip to be square.

230
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,800
It is hip to be square, especially if...

231
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,940
Yeah, spazzy short hairs were in for a short time.

232
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,240
...a Scotland.

233
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,540
An odd thing.

234
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:22,540


235
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:22,540


236
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:22,540


237
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:22,540


238
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:28,720
I actually had girls come on to me during that brief period when Elvis Costello, Devo,

239
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,820
and David Byrne were the sexiest things in the world.

240
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,280
Like blue corn diapers or something.

241
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,580
You know, guys with goofy looking glasses and uncool haircuts and little suits.

242
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,880
The nerd look.

243
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,200
Yeah.

244
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:41,800
I just happened to...

245
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,620
Tiny puss hips.

246
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:42,680
Big knees.

247
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,200
A lot of us happened to look that way for that six month period.

248
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,920
And we're cool.

249
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,960
I remember those days.

250
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,500
That was it.

251
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,440
Back then, it was something else.

252
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,400
Then it was long hair again.

253
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,140
Or bald heads.

254
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,320
Or little goatees.

255
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,400
Or a spike in the nose.

256
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,160
Or a broomstick in the butt.

257
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,500
That's the current fad, I noticed.

258
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,580
Have you ever taken a safety pin and shoved it through your cheek?

259
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,480
Oh, that's so 80s.

260
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,660
For John Dillinger, and I hope he is still alive.

261
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,840
Thanksgiving Day, November 28th, 1986.

262
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,480
Thanks for the wild turkey and the passenger pigeons,

263
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,380
destined to be shit out through all the years.

264
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,560
Thanks for the beautiful, wholesome American guts.

265
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,080
Thanks for a continent to despoil and poison.

266
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,720
Thanks for Indians to provide a modicum of challenge and danger.

267
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,320
Thanks for vast herds of bison to kill and skin,

268
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,140
leaving the carcasses to rot.

269
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,380
Thanks for bounties on wild cows and cows.

270
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:52,380


271
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:52,380


272
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:52,380


273
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:52,380


274
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:59,340
Thanks for the American dream,

275
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:06,320
to vulgarize and falsify until the bare lies shine through.

276
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,440
Thanks for the KKK.

277
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,120
For nigger-killin' lawmen feedin' their notches.

278
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,360
For decent church-goin' women with their mean peeps.

279
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,340
For hench-bitter evil faces.

280
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,220
Thanks for Killaqueer for Christ stickers.

281
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,000
Thanks for the Bordoriers.

282
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,840
Thanks for prohibition and the war against drugs.

283
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,560
Thanks for a country where nobody's allowed to mind his own business.

284
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,060
Thanks for a nation of finks.

285
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,400
Yes, thanks for all the memories.

286
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,740
All right, let's see your arms.

287
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,900
You always were a headache and you always were a whore.

288
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:15,560
Thanks for the last and greatest betrayal of the last and greatest of human dreams.

289
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,020
Make that fool themen.

290
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,880
You think I'd never spare a damn thing of yours.

291
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,060
I'm a grown car wanker.

292
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,160
I'm gonna risk my life for捒u.

293
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,640
I'm gonna rest in peace and takes from me.

294
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,560
It's height and he's sharp as a knife.

295
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:47,960
I'm a Plaid Ant.

296
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,180
Good cause to count.

297
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:48,540


298
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,180
Why did she want to cure his hat?

299
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,080
March their way through the deserts, looking not only for the quicksand, but for the town of Madden.

300
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,860
Why does she want to cure his hat?

301
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,260
The Kennedy? Why did they want to cure Kennedy's hat?

302
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,860
Because he was thinking of bad thoughts. Bad thoughts.

303
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,620
That's why they gave him a new matching necktie and hat.

304
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,780
One that can be worn in any kind of weather, especially in Dallas, Texas.

305
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,440
Reverend, tell us about the area near Dealey Plaza.

306
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,000
It's the greatest album of our time.

307
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,740
Actually, I'd best know the sewers underneath Dealey Plaza.

308
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,060
That's why they called you the silent rat man, or the rat boy.

309
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,140
That's where I was that fateful day, November 22nd.

310
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,080
Now, was that a black hop, or was that purple?

311
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,540
Oh, it's almost two days away from the day.

312
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,180
Is today the 20th, or the 25th?

313
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,960
It's the first.

314
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,400
2-1 is today.

315
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,380
It's the firestorm.

316
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,960
It's the firestorm solstice on Neptune.

317
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,640
Oh, man.

318
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,700
They don't have firestorms on Neptune.

319
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,060
Thank God.

320
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,840
They have ice alcohol storms, though.

321
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,780
But if you were to snap your fingers real high, you'd have a firestorm on Neptune.

322
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,440
Run, run, run, run, run, crazy baby, what do you do?

323
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:04,660
Yeah.

324
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,640
Yeah, man.

325
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,320
Yeah, Dealey Plaza Day is coming up.

326
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,380
It's the 23rd, isn't it?

327
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,320
It's a holiday for subgeniuses, because that was the particular little mini conspiracy.

328
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,760
That is, had the most coolest inside joke potential.

329
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,620
And it's been, there were the Kennedy assassination, JFK.

330
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,640
It's one of the most hilarious events ever programmed into the event psyche of our neighborhood,

331
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,180
speaking in a global sense.

332
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,260
Did you know that there is an assassination convention in Dallas, Texas, every November

333
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,540
around this time?

334
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,000
I used to go and report on the first two or three, and our friend Reverend Susie the floozy

335
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,020
on WREK.

336
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,360
And it was a big one.

337
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,720
And I'm like, I'm gonna go to Atlanta.

338
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,740
Yeah.

339
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,120
I was at the time a Kennedy researcher and connected to all of that sort of thing.

340
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,840
But the Christians are like that too, back and to the left.

341
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,180
Where the Jesus head is going back and to the left.

342
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,520
Back and to the left.

343
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:57,620
Back and to the left.

344
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,040
Back and to the left.

345
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,040


346
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,260
Now here goes the first nail, ka-boom.

347
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,320
Here goes the second nail, ka-ching.

348
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:02,960
Back and forth.

349
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,680
And there were no...

350
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,280
Back and forth.

351
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,300
There were also some plain clothes Roman centurions in the bushes behind my hairs,

352
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,920
and I wore all three that day.

353
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,600
Et tu, Lyndon?

354
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,340
Et tu, Lyndon?

355
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,320
Do you remember when old Paul Krappner and the rest of the Beatles said that he was having

356
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,640
sex with someone's neck?

357
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,760
Or was it with our Lord's neck?

358
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,720
No, it was JFK's neck.

359
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,980
That was a historical fact.

360
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,260
During the autopsy at the Naval...

361
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,140
That's what...

362
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,140
The LBJ did in fact have sex with the...

363
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,920
Change the road.

364
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,460
The exit or entrance, depending on which conspiracy you believe in.

365
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,320
Now do you think he was thinking of Marilyn or Lady Bird when he did the deed?

366
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,860
Now wait a minute, the aliens did this?

367
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,560
No!

368
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,060
Well, they possessed Lyndon to do it.

369
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,380
Lyndon Baines Johnson.

370
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:50,700
Lyndon Baines Johnson.

371
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,720
The Greys did this?

372
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,180
The Greys got into LBJ's brain after the hit went down.

373
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,060
Yeah, these people, I don't believe that they're really brains in their heads anyway.

374
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,660
I just think there's a little grey up there.

375
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,620
No, there's...

376
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,180
It's not grey matter, it's a little grey.

377
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,240
In the case of the Kennedy assassination, you know, he's got like a couple of big rubbers,

378
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,040
you know...

379
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,820
Guys, that's silly.

380
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,400
Everybody knows it was green energy demons at Dealey Plaza that night.

381
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,120
Long, long time.

382
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,040
You need to change the entry.

383
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,780
Hey, I was there.

384
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,800
Oh, you're getting all sexed up.

385
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,360
My parents saw Lee Ho get shot on TV live.

386
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,700
Oh my God, you're as big as a steel.

387
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,320
Imagine that.

388
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,480
And they had been thrown out of Jack Ruby's carousel club.

389
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,020
My parents!

390
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,260
I grew up in an alternate universe.

391
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,720
At that time period, I happened to be living in one of the alternate universes.

392
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:42,200
And in that universe, John F. Kennedy turned around at the last second, whirled around,

393
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,540
shot up,

394
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:50,200
and killed not only Oswald, but three guys in the grassy knoll as well.

395
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,580
Now that's the way it happened somewhere else.

396
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,800
Thank you very much.

397
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,580
I'm glad for that enlightening rippety of another dimensional accident.

398
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,400
And in another one...

399
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,480
JFK is a James Bond kind of guy.

400
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,800
And in another one, John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald meet each other in a gay bar

401
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,420
and are caught by tabloid photographer's French kissing in the bathroom.

402
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,720
Now the one I remember was where like Jackie is going...

403
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,520
They were talking about Maryland and Jackie is going down on the press and he jerks his

404
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,200
head back into the left and the bullet goes neatly through Conway Twitty's life.

405
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,380
See there's a billion different possibilities that all happened.

406
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,480
That was Louis Pasteur's magic bullet.

407
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,120
You think...

408
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,580
Louis Pasteur was the governor of Texas then.

409
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,460
And Marie Curie, I mean...

410
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,880
And Marie Curie was actually Jackie's late grandmother.

411
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,720
So you see how these things keep unfolding.

412
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,920
But David Ferry was the coolest one of all.

413
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,660
David Ferry is actually...

414
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,040
Shall we sing the praises of David Ferry?

415
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,680
He's the subgenius of the Kennedy assassination.

416
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,740
The bald-headed guy had to glue the eyebrows on his...

417
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,280
Fake eyebrows onto his face.

418
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:05,140
I got a wire, reflect what you are, in case you don't know.

419
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,060
I'll be the wind, the rain and the sunset.

420
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,700
That's what David said.

421
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,100
Sit right down next to the listening device and put on the headset.

422
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,040
Now we pencil here.

423
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:23,720
We're using white ink and this is more of a graphite pencil you can use for scribbling

424
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,420
on your tours.

425
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,400
Let me stand to show that you are blind.

426
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,100
Please put down your hands.

427
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,700
Cause I see your...

428
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,220
Chad's having a private moment with Nico right now.

429
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,380
Ah, Nico.

430
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,680
He's doing within the mirror effects.

431
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:41,680


432
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,740
He's doing in a coffee shop in Grandview.

433
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,520
Me and Nico in a coffee shop in Grandview.

434
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,640
I remember to add...

435
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,780
We are through the looking glass now gentlemen.

436
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,680
And you really don't know the beauty you are.

437
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,900
But if you don't let me be your eye.

438
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,960
Enter your darkness so you won't be afraid.

439
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,320
When you think that light has seen your mind.

440
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,660
Let inside you 20 seconds.

441
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:17,820
Let me stand to show that you are blind.

442
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,620
Okay, here we go.

443
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,260
There's something to be said for a liar on a long journey though.

444
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,140
Maybe he would get hanged or scalped.

445
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,380
And write home and tell us all about it and be a hero.

446
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,100
And there he was.

447
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,440
Dangling in the air 20 feet from the ground.

448
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,700
Quicker than lightning.

449
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,200
That was my revolver.

450
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:39,780
Hey.

451
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,080
Chesterfield satisfy women and men.

452
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,200
Chesterfield over and over again.

453
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,340
Milder, much milder, all smokers agree.

454
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,640
Always by Chesterfield's ABC.

455
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:04,540
Now I'll just put down my ukulele and say again that I think this is the best radio program on the air and any independent station or any network.

456
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,100
You don't have to say that to us Arthur.

457
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,320
Alright, we...

458
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,020
We know it, Art.

459
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,340
Sure.

460
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,120
You gonna sing anything today?

461
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,560
Yeah, I would presume as much.

462
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,660
When we have a song?

463
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,560
Uh, thanks for asking me Bob.

464
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,300
We have made a few changes in the studio.

465
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,720
Doesn't it sound different?

466
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,840
You see Bob and I...

467
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,460
You see Bob and I...

468
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,420
We sit here in a large walnut desk.

469
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,820
It's an awful sight in there.

470
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,160
Gargoyle is back at the controls in his own inimitable manner.

471
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,580
How does this little game called radio come out?

472
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,020
Who wins?

473
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,320
Well that's beside the point.

474
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,100
What we're here to mention is that we hope that you've all got a good idea.

475
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,460
You've all got your...

476
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:40,920
Nyeheheh!

477
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,540
Those are pretty important points here in this little game called radio.

478
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,700
Snuffling the show along a sidewalk.

479
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,200
You've been what?

480
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,380
Been what?

481
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,080
Snuffling the show a little bit.

482
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,260
A journey.

483
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,700
By Reverend Cobblestone.

484
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,880
Welcome back to the Red Cross.

485
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,020
I'm Robert Cullinan.

486
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,080
I'm the director of the Red Cross.

487
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,080


488
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,080


489
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,080


490
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,080


491
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,080


492
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,080


493
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,080


494
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,080


495
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,080


496
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,080


497
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,080


498
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,860
They're going to put an actor in the governor's office?

499
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,520
That's silly.

500
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,120
Well, they've never been able to improve on me, Mommy.

501
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,720
I was the original.

502
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,640
I was the first.

503
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,820
Dreamed up with Buzzy Walker.

504
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,280
Does Reagan even have thoughts anymore?

505
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,200
Back in 1949.

506
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,660
If you could be where his head's at, you'd be the...

507
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,260
It's like...

508
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,160
He's creamy, man.

509
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,960
He's creamy smooth.

510
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,580
He's nonstop.

511
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,540
He's jamming right into that spot.

512
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,320
He's in the now.

513
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,180
Totally in the now.

514
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:38,480
Yeah.

515
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,640
He's in the...

516
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,980
The Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is an uptight Rush Limbaugh-like guy compared to Reagan.

517
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,680
We are now giving classes on Ronald Reagan's way of meditation.

518
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,160
They start in different forms.

519
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,160
The exercise and...

520
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,920
The Dalai Lama is Nancy Reagan compared to Ron Reagan.

521
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,060
Wait a minute.

522
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,700
What did you say?

523
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,420
I said the Dalai Lama is Nancy Reagan compared to Ron Reagan.

524
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,440
That's how advanced Ron...

525
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,540
Ron is so close to Dobbs.

526
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,960
He's so close to the consciousness now that he's...

527
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,540
You know, he's almost to the point where Bob is.

528
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,360
He could be, you know, switched with Bob as world overlord at this point.

529
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,400
We wouldn't even know the difference.

530
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,740
Well, hasn't he had this classical terminal disease for like 15 years now, right?

531
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,160
I keep thinking he's dead.

532
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,560
Yeah, I think he's just like dropped from sight and he's had everything he's ever wanted.

533
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,940
Well, I always say that...

534
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,220
Right.

535
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,760
He has no memoirs because he has no memory.

536
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,220
That's right.

537
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,460
Actually, the real Ronald Reagan moved to...

538
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,260
He moved to Argentina about the same time Elvis Presley did.

539
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,860
And married the real Eva Peron.

540
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,260
I don't know about that.

541
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,780
No, that's part of the histoire.

542
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,980
Dobbs arranged that for both of them and JFK also.

543
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,480
He helps the...

544
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,660
JFK isn't doing quite as well as he used to.

545
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,800
JFK is living in a Urenum locker over on...

546
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,000
Actually, he died.

547
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,480
Yeah, finally after living in the Urenum.

548
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,800
After knocking off most of his relatives, his son...

549
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,580
Well, he had emotional problems.

550
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,620
There was a little...

551
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,220
There was a little bit of brain damage when the brain...

552
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,320
When, you know, when the actual shots were fired, they pulled him through.

553
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:14,740
He was the one behind it.

554
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,100
It was his fault.

555
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,400
That was a dummy.

556
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,120
He was the one behind the Kennedy assassination.

557
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,560
Yeah.

558
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,500
John F. Kennedy.

559
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,620
He was behind the scope.

560
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,040
He shut it all up.

561
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,860
He was behind the scope.

562
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,560
Kennedy wasn't even in that car.

563
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,040
No.

564
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,920
It was a...

565
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,220
That wasn't even Kennedy in the car.

566
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,200
And speaking of genes...

567
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,620
That wasn't him.

568
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,700
That was a fill-in.

569
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,160
A walk-in.

570
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,660
Yeah.

571
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,260
They're easy to find.

572
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,620
And they're easy to find now.

573
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,300
Just think of...

574
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:37,960
What's his name?

575
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,320
Kennedy and Jim Morrison.

576
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,740
They're living on some island somewhere down in South Carolina.

577
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,460
And we'll soon be...

578
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,940
No, Kennedy died.

579
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,000
He finally died.

580
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,780
I keep telling you guys.

581
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,240
He died.

582
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,340
Frank, the new CEO, had to answer to the board.

583
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,560
The board was getting...

584
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:09,960
The board was getting anxious.

585
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,720
And the shareholders were on a bet.

586
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,040
Legs in air.

587
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,660
Ass cheeks open wide.

588
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,440
They were about to get fucked.

589
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,400
Like it was their first time.

590
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,940
When one makes 20 million and 10,000 people lose.

591
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,460
What keeps that one from swallowing a shotgun?

592
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,020
Damn.

593
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,000
The company man.

594
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,160
The loyalty to the core.

595
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,100
After 16 years of service.

596
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,120
And a family to support.

597
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,600
He actually started to believe.

598
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,220
The weaponry and chemicals before national defense.

599
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,840
Cause Danny had a mortgage.

600
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,020
And a boss to answer to.

601
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,520
The guilty don't feel guilty.

602
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,820
They learn not to.

603
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,100
Too.

604
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,400
They'll never be guilty.

605
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:27,620
Right?

606
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,720
West Mustang.

607
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,500
Was a commercial enterprise.

608
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:33,780
As you have always understood.

609
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,960
Aira fantasies.

610
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,600
Was a political enterprise.

611
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:38,800
Who breaks it?

612
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:45,080
Helen is living in her car, trying to feed her kids

613
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,000
She got laid off of work, and her house was repossessed

614
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,180
It's hard to think clearly when it's 38 degrees

615
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,880
Desperate people have been known to render desperate deeds

616
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,480
But when she shot that family and moved into their home

617
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,740
The paper rich, he suffered from dementia

618
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,200
You can't say that on the American hairways

619
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,040
It's a fiery, fiery way down

620
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,580
Well, the end justifies the means, that's the important thing

621
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,700
By all means necessary

622
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,000
Right-wing people, of course, are just a little less human than we are, that's all

623
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,900
I'm not bigoted or prejudiced or anything, they're just less human

624
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,020
Remember what Elmer Fudd said, man

625
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,540
I actually heard a guy say that

626
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,260
Remember what Daffy Duck said, man

627
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,340
By whatever means

628
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,280
Necessary

629
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,460
There you go

630
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,080
There you go

631
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,780
From protest to

632
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,340
Of course you know this means war, yeah

633
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,720
From protest to resistance

634
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,900
From protest to resistance, people

635
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,480
Hold hands, brothers and sitters, sitners

636
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,320
Yeah, man, they're still a cat's play

637
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,020
From resistance to action

638
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,540
Coming raining down like rain, blowing our small body parts out into the rain

639
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,760
Gun for gun if we must, we must kill that pig

640
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,020
Gun for gun

641
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,380
Stand again

642
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,460
Did you just say that?

643
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,340
Did you just say kill the pig?

644
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:37,980
That's right

645
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,760
He doesn't know he has to drive home

646
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,980
The racist pigs

647
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,780
Thanksgiving is coming up

648
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,100
Yes

649
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,920
If that man is railroaded, we must kill them pigs, one for one

650
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,120
Gun for gun

651
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,180
He's quoting Black Panthers of the 1970s

652
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,480
There will be revolution in the streets, revolution everywhere

653
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,640
Free Charlie

654
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,600
Free Maximus Clutius

655
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,800
Who are we trying to free?

656
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,220
Charlie Manson, the prophet Charlie

657
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,420
The one man who knew what was happening

658
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:04,740
I kind of forget now what I'm protesting

659
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,140
It was a stud man, Charlie was under the sun

660
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,440
I'm not going to lie to you, I'm not going to lie to you

661
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,060
I'm not going to lie to you, I'm not going to lie to you

662
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,060


663
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,160
And then Oliver Norton

664
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,500
We'll free Oliver Norton from this bondage conspiracy

665
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,760
We'll free Norton and Ralph Cramden

666
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,980
We'll free Emperor Norton from history

667
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,380
We'll free the Emperor of the Norton

668
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,020
Who was Emperor Norton?

669
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,300
Oh yeah, Emperor Norton

670
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,960
He was the Emperor of San Francisco

671
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,780
All of California

672
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,360
All of California, the Golden Bear State, he was the Emperor

673
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,680
And he had a golden throne and a crown of emeralds and thrones, didn't he?

674
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,340
No, that's what they call the sharp stone

675
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,380
A real saint, a discordian saint

676
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:44,580
But was he immolated at the fire by the faint-hearted like the saints usually are?

677
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:44,800


678
00:27:52,840 --> 00:28:00,080
It grew on me like a festering tomb where this terrific dream of immortality, everlasting life

679
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,260
Hey, what's going on here?

680
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,940
What's all this about living forever?

681
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,040
Just imagine

682
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,300
A man with all that time on his hands

683
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,500
Time to kill

684
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,820
And kill

685
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,440
And kill

686
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,720
Hey, what's going on here?

687
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,400
What's all this about living forever?

688
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,560
Just imagine

689
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,740
A man with all that time on his hands

690
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,980
Time to kill

691
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,320
And kill

692
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,020
And kill

693
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,780
Hey, what's going on here?

694
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,440
What's all this about living forever?

695
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:05,880
Doctor, but they, they are very much aware of what we're up to

696
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,320
Doctor, but they, they are very much aware of what we're up to

697
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,020
Doctor, but they, they are very much aware of what we're up to

698
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,480
Their noses are out of joint because of it

699
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,560
And they will stop at nothing, absolutely nothing to prevent us

700
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,280
That and something much more serious

701
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:23,060
It grew on me like a festering tomb where this terrific dream of immortality, everlasting life

702
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,880
A new strength was flowing in my blood

703
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,020
I was immortal

704
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,080
I couldn't die

705
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,840
I would go on living

706
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,400
And living

707
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,100
I would go on living

708
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,100


709
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,320
And living

710
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,320


711
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,320


712
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,320


713
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,320


714
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,320


715
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,320


716
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,320


717
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,320


718
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,320


719
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,320


720
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:36,960
And living

721
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,280
Forever

722
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,060
Just imagine

723
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:46,180
A man with all that time on his hands

724
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,500
Time to kill

725
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,820
And kill

726
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,460
And kill

727
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,220
Hey, what's going on here?

728
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,960
What's all this about living forever?

729
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,480
Nobody here

730
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,860
Who is it?

731
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,440
Nobody here

732
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,940
Who is it?

733
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,480
Nobody here

734
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,880
Who is it?

735
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,440
Somebody here

736
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,660
Who is it?

737
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,460
asta

738
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,820
Tundra

739
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,480
a wonderful piece using these words

740
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:41,720
Reverend Norell Preff. You can find out more about Norell Preff at heavyconfetti.com.

741
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:47,900
But now, let's hear a little bit of the Evolution Control Committee.

742
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:57,260
I've had many people to ask me to put this on recording.

743
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,800
And we're coming to you for all of you that are present here tonight.

744
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:13,860
Dope gambling, women dancing, deuces wild, coon, can and toe.

745
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,280
Many pleasures of life are used.

746
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,500
But I happen to prefer the snatch.

747
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,660
Prestige.

748
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:25,800
Prestige.

749
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,080
All.

750
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:27,460
Water.

751
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,300
Money.

752
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:30,360
Women.

753
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:30,840
Men.

754
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,580
Nothing.

755
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:40,460
I read Laura and Ogal Suits.

756
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:49,860
I have made up in my mind that nothing is going to stop me from making the snatch.

757
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:56,560
You see, I'm not going to fool around here and miss all these women.

758
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:09,500
All these good looking women let me get Laura, let me have Mabel and let me get Ogal Suits, Fannie Lou.

759
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,280
Then all I can find, I've got to make the snatch.

760
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:24,980
I would just get on out there and get with Marvin Gaye, Jackson 5, Gladys Knight and the Pips.

761
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,760
Hey man, Smokey Robinson

762
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,740
And everybody else

763
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,940
And I just had me a time

764
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:37,320
So don't miss that snatch

765
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,640
I'd like to say to the brothers

766
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:03,620
It don't matter how well they are shaped

767
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,720
How long the hair is

768
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,040
They're not worth missing the snatch

769
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,340
Sisters, I don't care how tall, dark and handsome

770
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,640
That man might be

771
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,880
He's not worth missing the snatch

772
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,480
Two will be in the bed

773
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,000
And then one snatch

774
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,100
And then let me go on to the discord

775
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,300
On to the discord

776
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,460
Get the Saturday Night TV

777
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,780
Let me go on to the discord

778
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,860
To the discord

779
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,240
And let me just have me a good time

780
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,360
And then let me go on to the discord

781
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,560
On to the discord

782
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,960
Get the Saturday Night TV

783
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,540
Saturday night.

784
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,000
Let me go to the discord.

785
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,680
Let me just have a good time.

786
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:22,060
Let me just have a good time.

787
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,180
Go to the discord.

788
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,740
Comforting and buffing.

789
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,200
Come on to the discord.

790
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,400
Get the Saturday night people.

791
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,860
Come on to the discord.

792
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,340
Pimping and pimping.

793
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,800
Come on to the discord.

794
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,160
And let me just have you a good time.

795
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,340
There have been other lives now.

796
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,420
Before the big ones.

797
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,780
See there have already been some.

798
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,880
There will be some more after the big ones.

799
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,660
If you miss the big ones.

800
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,760
Then don't plan on getting involved.

801
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,260
If you miss the first one.

802
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,000
The snatch is imminent.

803
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
The snatch is at hand.

804
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,100
The snatch could come any day now.

805
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,700
We got to be ready.

806
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,260
When she does come.

807
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,620
Evolution Control Committee friends.

808
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,240
You can find out more about them.

809
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:20,480
At www.evolution-control.com

810
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,740
I got a question.

811
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,580
I got to remember to clean up the rat tails.

812
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,100
After eating those candied rats.

813
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,080
I got to remember to go home.

814
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,260
And take the contents of the kitty litter box.

815
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:30,860
In the basement.

816
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,320
And pack them into a mighty meaty sandwich.

817
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,680
Put it in my lunch box.

818
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,360
Go to work with a smile on my face.

819
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,860
And give up these stupid ideas.

820
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,340
Of trying to change this country.

821
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,520
Because we need to eat shit and die.

822
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,340
As we have been told.

823
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,420
Things haven't changed in a thousand years.

824
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,060
They never will.

825
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,360
I've learned.

826
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,340
I've learned my lesson.

827
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,720
I've learned my lesson.

828
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,580
Nothing ever changes.

829
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,020
It's been the same.

830
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,300
Satan has always had the art stick.

831
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,460
He's always had the writing.

832
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,580
War. War. War.

833
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,480
Kill. Kill. Kill.

834
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,860
Blood. Blood.

835
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,080
America is your blood call.

836
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,180
Oh yeah. Sail right in the heart.

837
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,080
Sure you're doing the next thing you know you're doing.

838
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,140
Like all the rest of you.

839
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,980
The United States is run by a blood call.

840
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,000
It's been going on for 200 years.

841
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,240
I'm sure I like owl poop.

842
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,080
But who wants to know the wisdom of the owl with a gun?

843
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,560
No.

844
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,200
No.

845
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,140
Who wants to be in it?

846
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,900
No I don't.

847
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,660
Who wants to be in it?

848
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:25,800


849
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,260
But.

850
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,400


851
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,920
Yeah we're insane.

852
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,520
That's right.

853
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,340
We're just a bunch of crazy radio people.

854
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:31,300
It's so dark.

855
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:31,720
Don't worry about it.

856
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,780
We're just voices on the air.

857
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,260
We're gone.

858
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:33,440
We're gone.

859
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:33,580
We're so dark.

860
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:33,920
Just words.

861
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,820
It's all just words.

862
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,000
Gone as soon as you hear them.

863
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:36,700
That's it.

864
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,320
You do.

865
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,740
But you do.

866
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,620
Because you want to.

867
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,560
Look Sarge.

868
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,680
We're like blown off man.

869
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,280
What I do.

870
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,760
Am I going to walk again?

871
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:42,900
Goodbye.

872
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,360
Tozy.

873
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,580
Tozy.

874
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:43,900
That's funny.

875
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,800
I never quit before.

876
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,780
Oh my god.

877
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:14,780


878
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,020
I think he's gone.

879
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,280
He's not gone.

880
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,680
That's the whole point.

881
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,040
He's never gone.

882
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,120
Is this some radical move therapy?

883
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:23,920
You see.

884
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:35,160
A sentence about a center for dentists at the frontal edge of the continent by the Atlantic Ocean.

885
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:42,900
A sentence about a center for dentists at the frontal edge of the continent by the Atlantic Ocean.

886
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,620
This is Sam and Bob.

887
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,760
Sam is wearing gloves.

888
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,520
He is wearing a white T-shirt and a black vest.

889
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,980
He is wearing blue jeans.

890
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,060
He has blonde hair.

891
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,140
He has blue eyes.

892
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,920
He is saying hello to his friend Bob.

893
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,300
Bob is Sam's friend.

894
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,560
Sam is wearing a yellow sweater and blue jeans.

895
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,900

This is Sam and Bob.

898

He looks really good today.

899
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,540
Can a cat man a catamaran?

900
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,840
Can a cat man a catamaran?

901
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,080
This is Saab.

902
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,500

I'll tell you straight.

I...

911
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,680
I don't like...

912
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,980
Rock month if you want to see this long video because it is

00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:34,820
And now, friends, Dr. Howell at the Indie Vival in Indianapolis.

922
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,900
All right.

923
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,460
Well, this is a very general one.

924
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,760
What shall become of the subgenius octopus?

925
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,960
The subgenius octopus will have to adapt to other conditions.

926
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:50,480
What's an octopus?

927
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:51,580
Yes.

928
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,620
We're not talking about the prairie squid.

929
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,800
Let's examine that separately.

930
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:04,740
You know, the prairie squid has been projected by educational TV as a future inhabitant of North America.

931
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,400
Did you ever see that one, Doug?

932
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,660
They...

933
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,120
They had a TV show about animals of the future.

934
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,340
And one of these was the tree-dwelling octopus.

935
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,920
Did anybody see that show?

936
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:17,700
Yes.

937
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,220
Thank God for educational TV.

938
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,100
Save me a tank.

939
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,700
Well, the future of the subgenius octopus is to grow more and more tentacles.

940
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,260
Until it is not an octopus, but perhaps a dodeca-puss.

941
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,360
Or even an infinitopus.

942
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,640
It is scheduled...

943
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,720
It is scheduled and destined to reach into all corners and realms.

944
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,060
All countries, cities, nations, planets, and spaces.

945
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,580
And only then will Bob's mission have begun truly.

946
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:58,260
Am I Samuel Delaney's interdimensional slave boy?

947
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,100
It's not science.

948
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,740
Well, let's just say in your mind you are.

949
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,080
In your mind you are.

950
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,500
But that's not necessary.

951
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,360
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

952
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,340
You have an identity.

953
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,760
A secret identity to which you can retreat.

954
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,340
Just remember to go out and get the groceries every now and then.

955
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,840
Buy a new roll of toilet paper every now and then.

956
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,360
Then you can be whoever you want to be.

957
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,580
So have we come to the end of the stack of questions?

958
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,560
One...

959
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,640
One remains.

960
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,760
And I think this is a question of physics.

961
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,040
How is it hanging?

962
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,720
How is it hanging?

963
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,500
I think this has something to do with gravitation.

964
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:37,540
I think this has something to do with gravity.

965
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,300
Yes, I think so.

966
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,520
Unified field theory.

967
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,940
The pendulum hanging, swinging between heaven and earth.

968
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,660
The angle of the dangle is equal to the mass of the azimuth.

969
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,580
How is it hanging?

970
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,380
As it should be.

971
00:41:54,580 --> 00:42:00,080
Until gravity goes out of whack and the world shuts down.

972
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,740
Until further notice.

973
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,960
Praise X Day!

974
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,240
Dr. Howell at the Indy Bible in Indianapolis.

975
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:15,000
And now, just a bit of Reverend Jarto and Reverend Cobblestone.

976
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,100
Come on, you. Cough up a...

977
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,180
Cheap bastard.

978
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,100
And they're like, you know my husband and I...

979
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,800
No, no, every man.

980
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,800
Alright, every man.

981
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,120
And if you can figure out how a woman can...

982
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,140
Where she goes to get that...

983
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:32,560
I don't know.

984
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,660
Don't touch it. It's smelly. It's different.

985
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:41,600
I please him. I say, what do you like? What do you want? Let's do something crazy and different. You know?

986
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,140
Snarl. You know that mean snarl?

987
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,500
I won't do that.

988
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:46,700
Boy.

989
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,540
Okay. That mean snarl look. When you're...

990
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,740
You know, it was hard to get over the don't touch, don't...

991
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,520
Let's don't do any of it.

992
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,240
I love the taste. I love the smell. I love it.

993
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,020
So that's good.

994
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:07,420
Naughty, naughty. You are the best. I... I'm pleased myself. Everything down there is dirty.

995
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,700
You can sense that sexual chemistry. You can...

996
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,420
Fucking good.

997
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,820
Call me daddy.

998
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:19,980
Yeah!

999
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,060
It's like having all three stooges in here together at one time.

1000
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,320
It's like having the...

1001
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:27,900
Spread out.

1002
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,660
It's like having the Marxist brothers and the strokers.

1003
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,820
It's like having the three stooges in here.

1004
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,680
Do you remember the rich brothers and the...

1005
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,520
And one person. The trinity all in one.

1006
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,060
Yeah.

1007
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,280
That's the way it's supposed to be.

1008
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,200
He's the three stooges god.

1009
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,340
It's all wrapped up in one thing.

1010
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,960
Dave is the three stooges...

1011
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,140
God.

1012
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,460
...unified field theory.

1013
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,860
Are you sure you three gentlemen have moved furniture before?

1014
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:59,980
Well, we here at Larry Curley and Mohamed know how to not only move the furniture around, we can move the interspacial dimensions in your psyche around, buddies. Just sit down in the chair there.

1015
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,460
And pay attention to the lights.

1016
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,240
Open your mouth.

1017
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:03,860
Open your mouth.

1018
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,520
Here comes the drill.

1019
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,560
Allah says good, God says good, God, God, God. Got something for you now. Swallow, swallow, swallow.

1020
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,800
There you go. You're drilling on your front.

1021
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,520
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1022
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:20,080
Excuse me. I just want to tell you, man, I just saw the show and it was like so intense, man. And I...

1023
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:27,300
Oh, man, I was... Wow, man. And I was wondering, like, can I ask you a question, man?

1024
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,640
Well, like, I've been taking this course on performance. What's the difference between...

1025
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,460
I'm from Willem Dafoe, right?

1026
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:43,240
Actually, from this woman who used to work with Willem Dafoe. And I was watching you up there tonight, man. And, like, she's been teaching us about breathing and stuff. And, like, you breathe so great, man.

1027
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:49,720
And I was just wondering, man, like, could I buy you a cup of coffee? We could go, like, rap for an hour or two. Is that possible?

1028
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:58,540
Cool, man. Cool. I understand. No, no. Look, I'm amazed I'm even, like, talking to you, man. Like, it's unbelievable. Like, just thanks for talking to me, man.

1029
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,200
I just want to tell you, man, I love your shit.

1030
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:06,740
I think, like, you and Gary Oldman and Steven Seagal are doing, like, the only interesting shit out there right now, man.

1031
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:11,560
And I just want to tell you, man, I think you're a fucking genius, man.

1032
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:18,080
And me, I'm a performer, you know, like you. Well, not like you, you know, but...

1033
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:25,380
Well, like you, you know, actually a lot like you, man. Some of the stuff you do, man, it's like you've been to our shows, you, like, stole my stuff and everything, you know.

1034
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,260
I mean, I know you didn't, you know.

1035
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,060
But, oh, man, I wish you could check our shit out, man. I know you'd like it, man.

1036
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:39,220
It's like me and this other guy, he, like, plays music, you know, because you got to have music, you know, for marketing reasons, MTV, all that stuff, you know.

1037
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,660
I mean, you don't have to worry about that shit. You're old and everything, you know.

1038
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:55,080
But, like, last week we did this one show, man, and I did this thing where I took this human skull, right, and I covered it with cheese food and I stuck it on this stick and I put the stick on this, like, thing on my back, this spring, right.

1039
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,000
And, like, it could have wobbled back and forth.

1040
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,120
And when I was on stage, I'm, like, going, like, dancing around and, like, the head was, like, popping next to my head.

1041
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,820
It was like, oh, a head, shit.

1042
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,060
And I grabbed it.

1043
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,980
I started biting the face off of it and, like, the flesh was, like, hanging out of my mouth, man.

1044
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,480
Oh, man, it was so weird, man.

1045
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,560
So weird, man.

1046
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:14,860
Oh, man.

1047
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,940
Yeah, I smoke pot, yeah.

1048
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:20,940
No, no, man.

1049
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:26,980
But, like, we did this other thing, man, where we went down, the best thing we ever did, we went down to the meat market.

1050
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:26,980


1051
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,520
And we got all these, like, pig's guts and blood and everything.

1052
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,860
And we filled up these, like, Ziploc bags.

1053
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,860
And then we gaffers taped them to our skin underneath our clothes.

1054
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,740
And the audience didn't even know they were there, right.

1055
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,500
Like, we're just doing the show, right, me and the guy.

1056
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,520
And all of a sudden, we just pull out these straight razors.

1057
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,980
We slit our stomachs open.

1058
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,400
All the blood is, like, hanging out of the intestines and shit.

1059
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,940
We're, like, slipping on the blood and everything.

1060
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:47,880
I, like, slipped.

1061
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,940
I fell down and then I cut my eye right there, see.

1062
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,320
Four stitches, man.

1063
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,760
Like art imitating life, you know.

1064
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,920
Yeah, that's what everybody says.

1065
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,560
Yeah, that's what they say about us.

1066
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,580
Intense, man.

1067
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,060
Yeah.

1068
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:10,760
But it's kind of frustrating, too, you know, because we, like, play all these gigs and we can't get any, like, agents or managers to come and check us out or anything, you know.

1069
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,540
Try to make our career move forward and everything, you know.

1070
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,060
It's frustrating, yeah.

1071
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,220
Must be great to play in a place like this, man.

1072
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,040
The Knitting Factory.

1073
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,160
Whoa.

1074
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,680
Fucking Knitting Factory, man.

1075
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,360
You must have had somebody, like, set this up for you and stuff, yeah?

1076
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,940
Like an agent or something.

1077
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:36,860
You have an agent, man?

1078
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,100
Who's your agent?

1079
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,000
William Morris.

1080
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,020
Cool, man.

1081
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,600
I want to be a William Morris, too, man.

1082
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,700
I want to do what you did, man.

1083
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,080
I want to destroy the system from inside the system, man.

1084
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:51,880
Just like you and Johnny Depp and Pearl Jam, man.

1085
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,160
All you guys, man.

1086
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,740
So cool, man.

1087
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,980
You know, it's weird you should bring up your agent, man, because I'm like, man, I'm not going to do that.

1088
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:56,980


1089
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,620
I'm going to be a man, man, because I happen to have a video of some of my performances right here.

1090
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,860
And I was wondering, man, if you could...

1091
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,120
Yo, yo, yo, man.

1092
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,420
Man, I was just talking to you, man, and I was going to give you the...

1093
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,880
Man, yeah, but you just walked away from me while I was talking, man.

1094
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,680
I feel like an asshole here, you know?

1095
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,480
I know you have someplace to go, man.

1096
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,820
I have some place to go, too, okay?

1097
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,740
And I'm taking the time out to talk to you right now, okay, man?

1098
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,120
I mean, the least you can...

1099
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,060
Okay, it's cool, man.

1100
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:22,400
It's cool.

1101
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,120
I understand, man.

1102
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,280
I mean, you're a big deal and everything.

1103
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,980
And I'm nobody, right?

1104
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,560
I'm just like a, you know, like, piece of fucking shit, right?

1105
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,720
So it's cool, man.

1106
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,220
No, just...

1107
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,380
No, no, I understand, man.

1108
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,040
No, man, it's all right.

1109
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:35,800
I understand, man.

1110
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,980
You know, like, you got your thing, I got my thing.

1111
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,360
I just want you to understand something, okay, man?

1112
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,660
I mean, just because you get your name in the paper and people come to see your shows and everything

1113
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,200
doesn't mean that your shit's better than my shit, okay, man?

1114
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,560
Our shit is the same shit, okay, man?

1115
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,200
And, like, you know, people must have helped you out when you were starting out, man.

1116
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,780
Anybody ever help you out, motherfucker?

1117
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,540
Cool, cool.

1118
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,000
What's this?

1119
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:01,860
This is your agent?

1120
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:03,460
Thanks, man.

1121
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,800
Oh, man, you're so cool, man.

1122
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:05,680
I knew you were cool.

1123
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,300
Thank you, man.

1124
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,160
Oh, that's great.

1125
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:08,960
Thanks so much.

1126
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,620
That's really great.

1127
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,780
So I can just drop this off at him and it's...

1128
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:12,740
Great, man.

1129
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,000
Great.

1130
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:13,620
Thank you, man.

1131
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,040
Hey, listen.

1132
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:20,040
Listen, before you go, man, I'm gonna be performing next week and I'll get in touch with your agent.

1133
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:20,920
I'll put your name on the list.

1134
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,300
You can just get right in on the door, man.

1135
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,040
You should come, man.

1136
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,760
And, like, bring your agent if you want, you know, and have some fun together, you know?

1137
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:26,980
I'm gonna be performing next week and I'll get in touch with your agent.

1138
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:30,520
I was talking to Harvey Keitel on the street the other day and, like, he might be coming

1139
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:36,460
and I wrote a letter to Christian Slater and, well, he was gonna come but I guess he can't

1140
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:40,440
now but you should come, man, you know?

1141
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,740
It'll be good for you for your career.

1142
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,900
You can, like, network and stuff.

1143
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:43,740
Cool, man.

1144
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,220
Okay, man.

1145
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:44,480
Yeah.

1146
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,440
Hey, listen, man.

1147
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,900
I got, like, voicemail and stuff.

1148
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,840
I'll leave my number on the card.

1149
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,980
I'll leave with your agent if you ever need any advice or any help or anything.

1150
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,720
I got a homepage, man.

1151
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,840
So okay, man.

1152
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:55,920
All right, man.

1153
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:56,300
Okay.

1154
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:56,660
All right.

1155
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:56,920
Okay.

1156
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:57,260
All right.

1157
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:57,480
Okay.

1158
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:57,760
Okay.

1159
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,080
All right.

1160
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:58,660
Love it.

1161
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,680
Amazing, dear friends.

1162
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,440
So horribly true to life.

1163
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,600
A little piece there by Eric Boghossian.

1164
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,440
There's no answer yet.

1165
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:12,880
It's God's own boy.

1166
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,960
It's a mo company, you won't.

1167
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:14,720
Somebody.

1168
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,200
It's gotta be somebody.

1169
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,120
There's gotta be some reason, some way, some, some...

1170
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,420
Monster, everything is prepared for Saturday.

1171
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,960
I told you never to call me here at the office.

1172
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,080
Yes, master.

1173
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,120
Everything is prepared.

1174
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,600
Oh, I just said the same thing that he said.

1175
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,060
Well, it's catching.

1176
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:40,000
November 29th in Detroit at the Magic Stick at the Majestic.

1177
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:40,700
Another one.

1178
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:45,880
A devival that you guys weren't invited to because there was five local bands there.

1179
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,900
Oh, we were not invited.

1180
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:47,920
That's why you weren't invited.

1181
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,520
We don't rate.

1182
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:53,920
And I was because I don't play anything and they didn't have to worry about competition

1183
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,520
from me.

1184
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:58,500
But it's a whole bunch of offensively named bands.

1185
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,080
Well, I think to any musician...

1186
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,660
The Jesus Punchers, the God...

1187
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:02,520
Jesus Punchers?

1188
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,260
The Cross Punchers, the God Killers...

1189
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,380
Both the Cross Punchers and the Jesus Punchers and the God Killers.

1190
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:07,900
The Father Rapers.

1191
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,120
Yeah, the Amino Acids, which are the subgenius band.

1192
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,200
Well, what are they?

1193
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,680
Are they just like kind of lackluster erudition flotsam that comes from here and goes to there?

1194
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,600
You just have to go to there and find out.

1195
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:19,760
Find out?

1196
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,440
Yes, friends, find out.

1197
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:24,040
November 29th, the Magic Stick in Detroit.

1198
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:28,920
Friends, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1199
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:37,120
And you can find out more at www.subgenius.com about the word of Bob and the church of the

1200
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:38,660
subgenius.

1201
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:49,040
And now, let us go back finally to close the show and hear Dr. Howell at the Indie Vival.

1202
00:51:54,040 --> 00:52:05,640
And now, as I close off my segment, I will conclude with a psychic message from an early subgenius, Bill Blake.

1203
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:22,120
I traveled through a land of men, a land of men and women too, and heard and saw such dreadful things as cold earth wanderers never knew.

1204
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:32,500
For there the Bob is born in joy that is conceived of in dire woe, just as we reap in joy the fruit which we in bitter tears do so.

1205
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:44,920
And if the Bob is born a boy, he's given to a woman old who nails him down upon a rock, catches his shrieks in cups of gold.

1206
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,940
She binds iron thorns about his head.

1207
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,560
She pierces both his hands and feet.

1208
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,080
She cuts his heart.

1209
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:57,180
She cuts his heart out at its side to make it feel both cold and heat.

1210
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:02,140
Her fingers number every nerve just as a miser counts his gold.

1211
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,980
She lives upon his shrieks and cries.

1212
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,480
And she grows young as he grows old.

1213
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,060
Till he becomes a bleeding youth and she becomes a virgin bright.

1214
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:20,260
Then he rends up his manacles and binds her down for his delight.

1215
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:20,920
Woo!

1216
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:27,240
And he finds himself in all her nerves just as a husbandman his mold.

1217
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:33,480
And she becomes his dwelling place and garden fruitful seventyfold.

1218
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:45,700
An aged shadow, soon Bob fades, wandering round an earthly cot, fulfilled all with gems and gold which he by slackfulness had got.

1219
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:51,440
For these are the gems of the human soul, the ruby and pearl of the lovesick eye.

1220
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,180
The countless gold of the aching heart.

1221
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,080
The martyrs groan.

1222
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,540
The lovers sigh.

1223
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,500
They are his meat.

1224
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,760
They are his drink.

1225
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,120
He feeds the beggar and the poor.

1226
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:07,360
And the wayfaring traveler, forever open is his door.

1227
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,600
His grief is their eternal joy.

1228
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,120
They make the roofs and walls to ring.

1229
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:18,040
Till from the fire on the hearth a little female bob does spring.

1230
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,420
And she is all of solid fire.

1231
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:29,600
And gems and gold that none his hand dare stretch to touch her baby form or wrap her in his swaddling band.

1232
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:33,380
But she comes to the man she loves.

1233
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:39,500
If young or old or rich or poor, they soon drive out the aged Bob.

1234
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,040
A beggar at another's door.

1235
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,940
He wanders weeping far away.

1236
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:50,420
Until some other take him in, oft blind and age-bent, sore distressed.

1237
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:54,790
Until he can a maiden win.

1238
00:54:55,090 --> 00:55:00,650
And to allay his freezing age, the poor man takes her in his arms.

1239
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:03,350
The cottage fades before his sight.

1240
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,670
The garden and its lovely charms.

1241
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:08,170
The guests are scattered through the land.

1242
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:11,610
For the eye altering alters all.

1243
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:14,310
The senses wrap themselves in fear.

1244
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:16,770
And the flat earth becomes a ball.

1245
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:19,730
The stars, sun, moon all shrink away.

1246
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:22,330
A desert vast without a bound.

1247
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,410
And nothing left to eat or drink.

1248
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:27,570
But a dark desert all around.

1249
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:30,330
The honey of her infant lips.

1250
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:33,610
The bread and wine of her sweet smile.

1251
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:36,410
The wild game of her rosy eye.

1252
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:39,890
Does him to infancy beguile.

1253
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:44,410
For as he eats and drinks, he grows younger and younger every day.

1254
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:49,350
And on the desert wide they both wander in terror and dismay.

1255
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:52,550
Like the wild stag she flees away.

1256
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:55,250
Her fear plants many a thicket wild.

1257
00:55:55,490 --> 00:56:01,010
While he pursues her night and day by various arts of love beguiled.

1258
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:04,290
By various arts of love and hate.

1259
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:09,410
Till the wide desert planted o'er with labyrinths of wayward love.

1260
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:12,770
Where roam the lion, wolf and boar.

1261
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:16,970
Till he becomes a wayward youth and she a weeping woman old.

1262
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:19,710
Then many a lover wanders.

1263
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:22,970
Here the stars and sun are nearer rolled.

1264
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:26,230
The trees give forth sweet ecstasy.

1265
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,290
To all that in the desert roam.

1266
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:30,330
And many a city builded here.

1267
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:33,030
And many a pleasant shepherd's home.

1268
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:36,650
But when they spy the grinning bob.

1269
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:39,410
Terror strikes through the region wide.

1270
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:42,410
They cry, the bob, the bob is born.

1271
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:44,730
And flee away on every side.

1272
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:48,050
For who dare touch that grinning face.

1273
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:50,390
His arm is withered to the root.

1274
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:54,210
Lions, wolves, boars all howling flee.

1275
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,650
And every tree does shed its fruit.

1276
00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:01,270
And none dare touch that grinning form.

1277
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,830
Except it be a woman old.

1278
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:08,190
She nails him down upon the rock.

1279
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,670
And all is done as I have told.

1280
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:12,930
Thank you.

1281
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:19,390
Been sitting here a long time.

1282
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:21,350
And no one's come to our rescue.

1283
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:26,370
I'm just wondering about those few soldiers left over by the gymnast war.

1284
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,130
Guarding the erectile building.

1285
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:30,430
They're the National Board of Healthiness.

1286
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,170
And of course the artifacts museum.

1287
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,510
Look there's another picture of Saddam Hussein coming out of there.

1288
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:36,750
Everyone is cheering and laughing.

1289
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:38,790
Till next week.

1290
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:43,530
Back to the wind.

1291
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,550
Her hat on tight.

1292
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:51,870
And your snack firmly seated in the sand.

1293
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:52,510
Ow!

1294
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:56,910
It is one of the five pillows of WCSB.

1295
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:58,830
I always land on that saddle horn wrong.

1296
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,790
And you like it that way son.

1297
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:02,270
Oh!

1298
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:03,630
Come on get closer.

1299
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:05,230
This time we're going to ride the donkey.

1300
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:05,730
Ow!

1301
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,370
I'm going to strap you.

1302
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:07,650
Ow!

1303
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,410
This is the end.

1304
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,970
Get your little friend.

1305
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:22,290
This is the end.

1306
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,170
My only friend.

1307
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:27,410
The end.

1308
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:31,830
It hurts to set you free.

1309
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:36,190
But you'll never follow me.

1310
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:45,810
Cleveland is the reason why I live in Texas.

1311
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:48,030
Okay now comb your hair.

1312
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:49,510
Okay.

1313
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:54,890
Let's go ahead and take a look at white men.

1314
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:56,750
Paid for by Cleveland.

1315
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,490
Myこんにちは

1316
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,850
Poss curtains

1317
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:26,550
Asiatic

1318

1319
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:33,810
Thank you.

1320
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:58,210
Thank you.
