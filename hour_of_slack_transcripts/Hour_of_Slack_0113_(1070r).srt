1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:10,580
Oh, they're so big! Oh, they're big, big, big, and now they're gone, and this is, uh, and this is the big sound.

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,720
Big! We're big, big, big, big!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,460
Big! Huge! Big ones!

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:25,060
It's size, friends. You get size. If nothing else, you get plenty of size with this radio station.

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,620
As soon as we are able to transcend the time problems inherent in life on Earth...

6
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:36,080
And gain control of the situation, we will return you to your previously scheduled conversation.

7
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:02,760
Big! Big! Big! Big! Big! Big! Big! Big! Big! Big! Big! Big! Big! Big! Big! Big! Big!

8
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,820
In essence is now part of unregistered inner subconscious mind.

9
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,700
We are controlling transmission.

10
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:18,260
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation to provide programs which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

11
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:24,780
I assure you that this network will continue to adhere to the eye standards we have maintained

12
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,680
through all the years.

13
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,260
Thank you.

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,180
You are about to experience

15
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,460
the awe and mystery

16
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,500
which reaches from the inner mind

17
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,840
to the subgenius

18
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,020
hour of slack.

19
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,900
No!

20
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,460
No!

21
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,520
No!

22
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:46,260


23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,120
No!

24
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,220
It hurts so bad, dear friends.

25
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,700
This is the most painful show

26
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,880
I'll ever have to do.

27
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,240
Because I haven't smoked a cigarette

28
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,840
in four days.

29
00:01:59,340 --> 00:01:59,800
No!

30
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,860
Happy birthday to Tevis.

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,600
Wow.

32
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,480
You mean that's why my brain

33
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,880
has been coming up with all that stuff?

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,700
Yes.

35
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,580
Afraid so, kids.

36
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,580
The Navigator.

37
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,060
And I am

38
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,180
the spaceship.

39
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,920
Oh, yeah.

40
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,720
Oh, yeah.

41
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,520
Oh, yeah.

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:32,780
Oh, yeah.

43
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,160
Oh, yes.

44
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,500
Dear friends.

45
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,480
This is

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,900
Hour of Slack

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,720
1070

48
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,940
technically, but it's really a

49
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,900
rerun of an ancient

50
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,100
Hour of Slack

51
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,740
number 113

52
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,660
from the year of

53
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,360
1987.

54
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,040
1987.

55
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,540
We're doing reruns

56
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,680
for the next few shows

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,280
of very ancient shows

58
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,000
because we're delving into

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,740
the ancient history of the

60
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,480
ancient Church of the Subgenius

61
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,780
for an online

62
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,040
course in such things.

63
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,900
And later on, hopefully

64
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,120
I'll turn it into some sort of a book

65
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,800
and DVD

66
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,400
project. But

67
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,600
in the meantime, we're digging up

68
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,660
the olden stuff.

69
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,380
And we're going to talk about

70
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,380
the olden truth and lies

71
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,780
from the olden days.

72
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,720
This particular show

73
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,480
is one of

74
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,900
what turned out to be several

75
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,460
I have just quit smoking

76
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,060
shows.

77
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,720
I did not actually succeed

78
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,140
in quitting smoking cigarettes

79
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,260
in 1987.

80
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,260
But I did after the 1997

81
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,240
I'm quitting smoking

82
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,620
show. Actually, I might not have done one.

83
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,260
And maybe that's why that one worked.

84
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,220
Anyway, friends,

85
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,040
let us now go 20,

86
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,980
well, 19 years

87
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,100
into the deep, deep

88
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,280
past.

89
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,400
Grace Bob.

90
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,900
Activate good affection recording.

91
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,660
Activate all radiation surveillance

92
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,880
consoles 1, 3, 20. Switch control

93
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,700
monitor to automatic.

94
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,080
I'm having a hard time keeping control

95
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,060
of this show tonight, dear friends.

96
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,360
Because it ain't

97
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,260
every day that a person quits

98
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,240
smoking four packs of cigarettes

99
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:24,860
a day.

100
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,780
Oh, please help.

101
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,500
Come in.

102
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,720
Gentlemen,

103
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,180
sure are everything

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,800
hurts.

105
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,160
But it's a hurt that seems

106
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
more mental than physical.

107
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,180
A hurt that comes from the

108
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,800
inside and moves out.

109
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,820
It hurts to do

110
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,880
anything, especially this

111
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,620
horrible show.

112
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,020
It hurts to think

113
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,120
or say. Go ahead

114
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:54,560
and do it.

115
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,860
I just want to get out of here.

116
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,580
Only cigarettes would help me now.

117
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,620
Come on.

118
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,300
Oh, my lungs.

119
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,800
I hate the

120
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,680
feel of cleanliness.

121
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,160
It just gives me the

122
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,600
worse.

123
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,640
It's the way it feels.

124
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,360
It's making it worse, friends.

125
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,340
No, it won't.

126
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,940
Only smoking cigarettes will make it better.

127
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,660
I don't think we can do this.

128
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,560
It's worse. It's worse.

129
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,600
You're making it worse.

130
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,980
You're just making it worse.

131
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,360
You want it to be worse.

132
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,160
You want it to be...

133
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,460
Everybody wants it to be worse.

134
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,980
Oh, they're laughing. You're out there laughing at me.

135
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,160
Aren't you? You think it's real funny.

136
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,160
You think it's funny

137
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,140
that I'm trying to break a habit of

138
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,060
16 years.

139
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,940
But if I can't quit after

140
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,760
a few shows, if you hear me...

141
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,720
If you hear me

142
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,120
smoking again, then it just proves that I'm

143
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,520
human.

144
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,680
And if I can quit smoking,

145
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,800
it'll prove that I'm beyond human.

146
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,900
Greater or less than

147
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,700
human.

148
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,280
Quit laughing!

149
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,020
It hurts! You're just trying to

150
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,140
make it worse!

151
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,520
Oh, it's no big deal, though.

152
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,840
Everything's just like normal.

153
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,780
...or nature, whatever you prefer.

154
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,540
But whoever or whatever it is,

155
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,640
it's certainly innocent to you.

156
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,500
The gold has gone back

157
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,560
to where we found it.

158
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,400
Oh, real funny!

159
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,460
Oh, everybody laughs. I think it's

160
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,380
real. You non-smokers!

161
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,480
You don't know! And you don't

162
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,180
care, either. Oh, they can't care.

163
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,360
No way. I think it's just like a headache.

164
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,740
I've screamed! I've cried!

165
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,800
And you're laughing!

166
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,980
Suffering and labor, this joke is.

167
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,600
Ten months of suffering and labor, this joke

168
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,300
is, friends.

169
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,680
Ah, go ahead and laugh.

170
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,760
Non-smokers,

171
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,800
giggling away.

172
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,640
No!

173
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,280
I don't think both of you need to be in bed.

174
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,320
No!

175
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,720
No!

176
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,560
Sir, this is

177
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,400
the best the supreme

178
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,500
being can do.

179
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,540
Ha ha ha ha!

180
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,280


181
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,200
Ha ha ha ha!

182
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,980
Ha ha ha ha!

183
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,500
Ha ha ha ha!

184
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,400
Ha ha ha ha!

185
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,380
Why do you keep blowing me up all the time, huh?

186
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,180
I don't know. It's so fun!

187
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,120
My purse is off!

188
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,200
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to

189
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,180
pull a pin on that collar.

190
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,480
When it comes to covering the United States,

191
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,140
subgenius tradition calls for propagandistic hack work.

192
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,640
Ha ha ha!

193
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,480
Ha ha ha!

194
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,360
Is that our job, or is that...

195
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,480
Yes, we've taken over this station

196
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,280
in hopes of subverting your mind.

197
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:55,940
All right.

198
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,680
Marching into your head now.

199
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,080
Isn't it cute? They have those little powdered wigs on

200
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,740
and three-cornered hats. They're almost harmless

201
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,180
as they march up your spinal cord.

202
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,360
But when they reach your brain, a deadly conflict

203
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,540
ensues. Really? Well, that's very interesting,

204
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,300
Dr. Howell. And now, back to breakfast hour

205
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,020
here on the show. Well...

206
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,340
I guess it'll work for the show anyway.

207
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,680
...and of course...

208
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,560
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Dr. the Bofram

209
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,060
and his surgical mind-trip.

210
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,440
Look at him go, that flashing steel.

211
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,900
Only one pair of hands in the country

212
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,660
could possibly perform with such

213
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,440
consummate skill.

214
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,760
It is a ludicrous sight to see

215
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,580
not only his hands but his feet to cut the cadaver

216
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,520
on the table into an unrecognizable part.

217
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,160
Whoo!

218
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:41,680
Whoo!

219
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,200
You must be from the Little Hill tribe.

220
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,140
Yes, country. You must move forward.

221
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,900
To a new frontier

222
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,840
of subgenius

223
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,280
radio programming.

224
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,000
Whoo!

225
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,480
Whoo!

226
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,000
But this promise was to be shattered

227
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,300
when on November 22, 1983,

228
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,100
Bob was shattered

229
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,420
in both weekends

230
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,220
by a terrorist-thrown bomb.

231
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,640
He could never play golf again. It was very sad.

232
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,540
Look at him go on his little cart. Look at him split.

233
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,460
I know. He kept trying to play golf for years

234
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,480
after all. It was embarrassing to be out there on the course.

235
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,780
This little torso would go by

236
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,880
in an automated golf cart.

237
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,840
Ha, well, ha, ha, ha, ha,

238
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,060
boy, that's a killer.

239
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

240
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,220
It's a killer.

241
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,620
But he was young once.

242
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,840
He had a mummy who tucked him in at night.

243
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,880
And an adorable little puppy

244
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,940
called Puddle, the perplexed poodle.

245
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,800
The Sousers probably were a Nazi secret weapon

246
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,160
but that was back in the 40s

247
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,740
when only kids had contact with the enemy.

248
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,340
Too many UFOs piloted by

249
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,380
Nazis like Errol Flynn from the center of the

250
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,120
United States were the reason that the government

251
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,960
withdrew its plans.

252
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,180
Maybe I'll duck in this disco.

253
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,460
Look at that little dog

254
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,300
go through those doors.

255
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,200
Not as good as a human though.

256
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,920
Everybody laughs at him, but it just goes

257
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,360
right and straight away.

258
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

259
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,040
Oh, they're still laughing.

260
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,580
Oh, fuck. Oh, Bob, let me smoke.

261
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,460
Well, I'm all

262
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,040
fixed as far as I'm concerned as a medicine man.

263
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,420
I'll have three meals a day, five if I want them,

264
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,460
a roof over my head to drink every now and then to warm me up.

265
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,560
I'll be worshipped and fed and treated

266
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,500
like a high priest for telling people things they want to hear.

267
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,420
Good medicine men are born, not made.

268
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,300
Come and see me some time, my boy.

269
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,840
Even you'll take off your hat when you see how respected I am.

270
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,920
That's box 140306.

271
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,520
They want to make me their legislature,

272
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,200
their whole legislature. I don't know what that means,

273
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,740
but it must be the highest honor they can bestow.

274
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,340
That was

275
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,720
J.R. Bob Dobbs,

276
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,920
dear friends.

277
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:38,900
Dad,

278
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,420
what have you done?

279
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:43,840
It was Bob.

280
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,200
Bigfoot?

281
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,760
No, not Bigfoot. Bob.

282
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,720
Bigfoot?

283
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,840
No, Bob. It was Bob.

284
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,220
Bob, let me smoke. No, I won't listen to the devil.

285
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,140
I won't listen to the devil.

286
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,420
I won't. I...

287
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,940
That's what it feels like inside.

288
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,600
Me!

289
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,780
The tobacco demons are chasing me.

290
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,140
They're trying to get me.

291
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,480
Please, callers, callers,

292
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,680
help, pray for...

293
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,680
...to get ready to

294
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,460
maybe start to

295
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,760
think about perhaps

296
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,340
going even on about it.

297
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,260
Much less

298
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,420
taking a big ol' hit.

299
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,320
Do you think women find you attractive?

300
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,360
Well, I ain't bragging.

301
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,260
It's understood.

302
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,720
What did you say when the London critics voiced their opinion of your show?

303
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,740
I know

304
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,400
that I...

305
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:42,640
...

306
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,580
...should leave.

307
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,980
Well, Jerry, here's a question

308
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,880
rather important to our audience.

309
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,140
Were the conservative Britons very shaken over your behavior?

310
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,660
Oh, life ain't

311
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,280
all...

312
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,160
But look to the skies.

313
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,060
The saucers will always be there.

314
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,700
Always be there.

315
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,860
Goodbye, Earth people.

316
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,920
He's Bob.

317
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,780
Bob don't ever change.

318
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,080
He's Bob.

319
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,020
Always will be Bob.

320
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,160
His face is the one big assembly

321
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,640
of dots that shine in the dark.

322
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,840
His grin is the one that looks friendly.

323
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,940
But so does the grin of a shark.

324
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,820
He's Bob.

325
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,840
Bob don't ever change.

326
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:37,840


327
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:37,840


328
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:37,840


329
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:37,840


330
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:37,840


331
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,960
He's Bob.

332
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,880
Always will be Bob.

333
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,900
His hair is the one with the highlight

334
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,640
that shines on the pompadour.

335
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,040
That glimmers and gleams in the twilight.

336
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,900
It's clear he knows what it's for.

337
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,180
He's Bob.

338
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,420
Bob don't ever change.

339
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,340
He's Bob.

340
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,160
Always will be Bob.

341
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,840
He's Bob.

342
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:07,840


343
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:07,840


344
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:07,840


345
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:07,840


346
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,060
His pipe is the one with the darl

347
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,080
that rains on the roofs like fire.

348
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,380
His neck is the one with the wattle

349
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,040
inflaming folks' desire.

350
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,100
He's Bob.

351
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,440
Bob don't ever change.

352
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,480
He's Bob.

353
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,800
Always will be Bob.

354
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,260
Bob.

355
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,780
And pain.

356
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,080
Cleanse her, my Bob.

357
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,840
And cleanse her, my Bob.

358
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:37,840


359
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:37,840


360
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:37,840


361
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:46,240
Cleanse her, my Bob.

362
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,960
Cleanse her, my Bob.

363
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,540
Cleanse her, my Bob.

364
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,460
Cleanse her, my Bob.

365
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:49,920
Cleanse her, my Bob.

366
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,480
Cleanse her, my Bob.

367
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,720
To keep the artistic integrity

368
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,160
To keep the artistic integrity

369
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,980
of the formula of this show.

370
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,060
I haven't smoked any cigarettes

371
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,060


372
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,480
in 72 hours or more, Bob.

373
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,820
But Bob,

374
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,700
where's my reward,

375
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,820
what do you get for me, Bob?

376
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:22,300
Oh, friends, if you need to know more about the nicotine withdrawal clinics of J.R. Bob Dobbs, I'm not worried about sounding like a fool.

377
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,640
I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. Don't care. Don't care.

378
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
I've had enough.

379
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,820
What you're hearing in the background here is from Hinton Templar.

380
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,780
The China White Heroin Phoenix Program.

381
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,300
The case in the Bible.

382
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,720
And the minds of Theodore Schlafly, Salvador Allende.

383
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,060
The waffle of American democracy.

384
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,140
And the nicotine was not going to continue their effort.

385
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,760
Americans murdered by acorn.

386
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,060
7,300.

387
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,040
Children and teenagers murdered by acorn.

388
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,200
3,346.

389
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,100
Richard Secord was made.

390
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,240
Under George Bush.

391
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,080
Frank Kirk was a case in the Bible.

392
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,880
Adult re-education subgenius centers destroyed.

393
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,760
2,840.

394
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,240
6,236 children left without slack by the conspiracy.

395
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,860
The CIA.

396
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:34,960
Bill Casey.

397
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,760
The first national security in the U.S.

398
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:46,380
Richard Allen. By June of 1981, they had resolved the strange and the mysteries of falsehoods.

399
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:56,160
The secret team. Hush money. Hush money. Hush money. In the bowels of our government

400
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:07,080
for 25 years, we have been blackmailed. What we are dealing with is a cancer deep in the

401
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,300
chest of our body politic.

402
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:57,400
As my old buddy Mark Twain said, he asked, what is the chief end of man? Why to get rich?

403
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:05,080
And in what way should he get rich? Well, dishonestly if he can, honestly if he must.

404
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:14,120
There are times when one would like to hang the whole human race and finish the farce.

405
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:20,400
And just light up another cigarette. Come on, Bob, let me have one.

406
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:30,140
Adam was the first great benefactor of our race, friends, for he brought death into the world.

407
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,680
Oh, Lord, our father, our young patriots, idols of our hearts,

408
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:45,220
go forth to battle. Be thou near them, O Lord, our God. Help us to tear their soldiers to bloody

409
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:52,980
shreds with our shells. Help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their

410
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:59,400
patriot dead. Help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded,

411
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:05,360
writhing in pain. Help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire.

412
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,060
Help us to ring the bell of the world with the sound of the gunshot. Help us to bring the fire

413
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:14,300
to the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief. For our sakes, who also adore

414
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:21,680
thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage,

415
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:29,580
make heavy their steps and water their way with their tears. Stain the white snow with the blood

416
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:37,060
of their wounded feet. We ask it in the spirit of love of him who is the source of our suffering.

417
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,060


418
00:18:48,220 --> 00:19:07,060
Bless the rest of humanity with the strength and좀

419
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,060


420
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,060


421
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:13,960
And those of you who haven't brushed up on your twain, I heartily, listen to the pain, the pain of others.

422
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,340
You know, when you're, that's Hel Swami Satellite Weavers being electrocuted there in the background.

423
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,520
That's how we made him quit smoking.

424
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,520
It was easy for him.

425
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,520
All he had to do was die.

426
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,240
One last word here before we go on from Mark Twain.

427
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,680
This is from an essay concerning the Jews, actually.

428
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,800
Twain said, I'm quite sure that bar none I have no race prejudices,

429
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,120
and I think I have no color prejudices or caste prejudices nor creed prejudices.

430
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,500
Indeed, I know it.

431
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,420
I can stand.

432
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,360
I can stand any society.

433
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,860
All that I care to know is that a man is a human being.

434
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,680
That is enough for me.

435
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,380
He can't be any worse.

436
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,940
Shoot the natives.

437
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,740
Any more natives around here?

438
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,820
Not after that.

439
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,780
Ha! Got that one.

440
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,180
Obnoxious radio promoter.

441
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,060
We have to keep firing because it's important.

442
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,440
We have to keep firing.

443
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,500
We have to keep firing.

444
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:28,500


445
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:28,960
We have to keep firing.

446
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,120
We have to keep firing.

447
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,120


448
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,040
Get that one.

449
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,120
That's right.

450
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,580
More bullets for us means more dollars for you.

451
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,820
I'd like a couple of dum-dum rounds.

452
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,660
Thank you.

453
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,240
You've got them.

454
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:36,700
You've got them.

455
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,860
Okay, we've got a lock and load.

456
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,260
Wait.

457
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,180
There's another little dum-dum round.

458
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:42,880
Okay.

459
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,380
Cue it up.

460
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,680
I'm not going to tell you which one it is.

461
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,040
I'm not sure we ought to give away our precious secrets to these negative beings out there

462
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,700
and negative plans.

463
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,540
Hello, Nipi caller.

464
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,280
How are you doing?

465
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:53,860
Okay.

466
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,700
Hi, Nipi.

467
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,220
We'll play the nipple call.

468
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,160
Just crawl right up here, Nipi.

469
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,320
Nipi, we know that since you've talked to us last time, you've developed limbs and you've

470
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,540
got probably a solid backbone.

471
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,140
Look at that spinal cord.

472
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,700
Noto cord.

473
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:13,180
And I regurgitate all the dogma and I deal with them and my little friends, they used

474
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,040
to laugh and gather around me.

475
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,100
Caution.

476
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,040
Mouth-to-mouth regurgitation is illegal in certain sectors.

477
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,460
But now, now they just start looking at me.

478
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,860
Up now, the distractions bear me down to earth.

479
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,540
I stand.

480
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,060
It's permanent and I'm off to the side.

481
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,520
All right.

482
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,960
I think maybe you better go.

483
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
Look, I'm sorry.

484
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,600
I didn't mean that.

485
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,600
I don't know what I mean.

486
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,740
I don't either.

487
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,140
I mean, he's not like you or me, but he is a man.

488
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,280
And contact with a woman just might bring him out of himself.

489
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,300
Might lead to something.

490
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,020
Something new.

491
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,040
It could save Bob.

492
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,320
Come on, girls.

493
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:55,860
Call in.

494
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,420
Oh, listen to him.

495
00:21:59,440 --> 00:21:59,980
He needs you.

496
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,920
He needs you.

497
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,140
Call in, ladies.

498
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:03,780
Call in.

499
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,720
Yeah.

500
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,560
Go.

501
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,040
Oh, my God.

502
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,620
Dad!

503
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,520
Dad!

504
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:23,680


505
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,120
Dad!

506
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,280
Dad!

507
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,620
Dad!

508
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:26,940
Dad!

509
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:26,940


510
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,700
I want a cigarette!

511
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,360
I'm going to have one, please.

512
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,880
Happy birthday, Tavis.

513
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,000
I want you!

514
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,540
I want you!

515
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,120
I want you!

516
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,880
I want you!

517
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:47,940


518
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,840
I want you!

519
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,940
Oh, you wouldn't believe what we had to do to get that acting job out of that child.

520
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,020
Grand tell me.

521
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,860
But maybe no child is ever too young.

522
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,640
A wolf may be more than he seems.

523
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,040
He may come in many disguises.

524
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,000
What's that?

525
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,680
The wolf that ate your sister was hairy on the outside.

526
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,360
But when she died, she went straight to heaven.

527
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,860
The worst kind of wolves are hairy on the inside.

528
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,200
And when they bite you, they drag you with them to hell.

529
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,660
What do you mean?

530
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,920
Hairy on the inside.

531
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,280
Like a furry coat.

532
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,940
Hush now, foolish child.

533
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,160
Listen.

534
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,380
Once upon a time, there was a woman in the village.

535
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,240
She married a traveling man.

536
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,980
With whose eyebrows met in the middle of his face.

537
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,740
Never trust a man whose brows meet in the middle of his face, dear friends.

538
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,540
For he's either a werewolf or a tobacco demon.

539
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,420
Or puzzling evidence.

540
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,220
And Bob doesn't seem to care.

541
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,740
No, come on, Bobby.

542
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,040
Help me out.

543
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,300
You're going to get me through this show.

544
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,860
The world is still haunted by ghosts and demons.

545
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,660
And how much do they affect the policies of this country?

546
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,960
What about the elders of Wotan?

547
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,940
And the tobacco demons.

548
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:14,900
Wotan.

549
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,880
All sound effects stop with the name of Wotan.

550
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,180
Wotan is our great god.

551
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,480
Wotan is our worship word.

552
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,340
Wotan.

553
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:26,880
Wotan.

554
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,520
Oh, we're way down south in the land of Wotan.

555
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,820
Even animals can Wotan.

556
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,720
Okay.

557
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,300
It's occasionally accurate news.

558
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,400
Live from inside a diseased beef taco.

559
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,960
Look at that.

560
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,200
As we get closer, we see these crawling, mutilating animal fuels.

561
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,880
Chemical breakdown of what's in the food around us.

562
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,180
Tiny maggots writhing through meat.

563
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,700
Well, isn't life wonderful?

564
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,280
Even though it's full of unending agony and pain that mars all consciousness.

565
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,860
There are some nice things about life, too.

566
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:55,920


567
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:55,920


568
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,380
Like the beam of sunlight on a baby's behind.

569
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,180
And as we get closer and closer, we see...

570
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,520
Every week, the baby's behind.

571
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,360
We've got to stare at this thing at five in the morning.

572
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,180
It's getting larger.

573
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,660
It's getting through the gate.

574
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,540
Quick, recite the spell or it'll be too late for humanity.

575
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,780
Why, I think it's kind of beautiful.

576
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,600
It's pink and...

577
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,600
Our entire planet will be changed into a paradise.

578
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,820
It's like a rotten orange.

579
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:20,840
Too late.

580
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,060
It's an alien baby.

581
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,500
Concentrate the photons.

582
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
Maybe we can burn a hole through that baby's back.

583
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,420
Okay, let's get started.

584
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,380
As it seems, ladies and gentlemen, turn away from the monitor, please.

585
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,260
That's okay.

586
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,820
It's your baby, not ours.

587
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,600
I'm not taking child abusers out of me.

588
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,480
Pulled off the air.

589
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,560
The baby doesn't feel it.

590
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,320
It's just a rotten orange.

591
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,600
Come on.

592
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,320
Ah, yes.

593
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,100
The cast...

594
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,780
The cast...

595
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,700
Shouldn't have pulled the stem off.

596
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,980
Y'all ever have a grandma orange sandwich?

597
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,860
Orange juice all over everything now.

598
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,420
It's orange-colored ink.

599
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,540
Look, everything's orange.

600
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,180
Oh, yeah.

601
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,580
Quick, back up.

602
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,220
It needs to be painted.

603
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,460
Everything in front of my eyes.

604
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,320
Orange, orange.

605
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:55,680
Orange.

606
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,160
Take it.

607
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,300
I'm going crazy.

608
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,360
So, Hal jumped off the ship.

609
00:25:59,680 --> 00:25:59,940
Ah!

610
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:01,780
Splashed.

611
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,720
Orange, you're dead?

612
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,480
I didn't know what to do, so I went normal.

613
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,220
Hi, Gary.

614
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,800
Gary got a haircut.

615
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,200
No beard.

616
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,040
No feet.

617
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,680
How does Gary's hair cut itself off like that, Philo?

618
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,080
Yes, caller.

619
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,640
But it grows as fast as we can cut it.

620
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,340
Okay, stand back.

621
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,780
Now he's three feet tall.

622
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,320
Back.

623
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:19,820
Back.

624
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,580
I created you.

625
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:20,900
Back.

626
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:22,880
Back.

627
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,120
I don't want to go back.

628
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:25,820
Caller.

629
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,360
There's no back.

630
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,420
Let's go over that again.

631
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,780
I saw a sunset.

632
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,560
There's no back.

633
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,280
Too real.

634
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,020
We switch you now to our on-the-spot reporter, downtown.

635
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,620
Come on, baby, let's go downtown.

636
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,600
Take it away, John Cameron Cameron.

637
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,440
This is John Cameron Cameron, downtown.

638
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,580
Pardon me, madam.

639
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,420
Would you tell our audience what would you do if the saucer were to land?

640
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,940
Thank you.

641
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,340
And now the thin gentleman there.

642
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,920
What I'm going to do is hard to tell.

643
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,320
The gentleman with the guitar.

644
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,440
What would you do, sir?

645
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,700
Take a walk.

646
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,340
Thank you.

647
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:57,980
We're returning now.

648
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,280
This is Black, your outer space.

649
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,000
This is Johnny with a request for Earth.

650
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,080
Earth Angel.

651
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,740
Earth Angel.

652
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,660
That was the Pelican's outer space recording Earth.

653
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,280
I've just been handed a bulletin.

654
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,900
The flying saucer has just landed.

655
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,400
We switch you again downtown.

656
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,800
Here we are again.

657
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,400
We have with us Professor Cecedric Finting-Moles of the British Institute.

658
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,540
The professor is approaching his saucer to see if there's possibly any sign of life aboard.

659
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,040
Well, I'm sure something.

660
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,380
Are you there?

661
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,080
I hear you knocking.

662
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,800
But you can't come in.

663
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,580
That was Laughing Lewis's record.

664
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,460
Knocking.

665
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,020
And he's done Cameron Cameron on the spot.

666
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,560
And now I believe we're about to hear the words of the first spaceman ever to land on Earth.

667
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,780
La-ba-ba-la-ba-ba.

668
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,300
Well.

669
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,440
Harvey C.

670
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:00,800
E組.

671
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,340
Gravel.

672
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,640
Indecency.

673
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,300
Vulgarity.

674
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,260
Obscenity

675
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,500
These are strictly confined to man

676
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,200
Said Twain

677
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,820
In his letters from the earth to aliens

678
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,220
Man invented these sins

679
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,620
Among the higher animals there's no trace of them

680
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,100
They hide nothing

681
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,220
They are not ashamed

682
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,840
Minute by minute crawls by, friends

683
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,580
This is the longest, the longest show

684
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,540
Can blue men sing the whites?

685
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,800
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

686
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,720
You know the first time God came down to earth

687
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,100
He brought life and death

688
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,100
But when he came the second time

689
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,080
He brought hell

690
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,720
And when he came the third time

691
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,820
He brought slack

692
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,380
The third time was Bob

693
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,140
Third time's a charm, you know

694
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,460
And old Bobby

695
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:31,180
His buddy Twain further suggested

696
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,620
That the human being, like the immortals

697
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,240
Naturally places sexual intercourse

698
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,180
Far and away above all other joys

699
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,040
And yet he's left it out of his heaven

700
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,480
The Bible is full of interest

701
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,260
It has noble poetry in it

702
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,640
And some clever fables

703
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,020
And some blood-drenched history

704
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,380
And good morals

705
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,120
And a wealth of wisdom

706
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,000
And a wealth of obscenity

707
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,120
And friends upwards of a thousand lies

708
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,760
Anybody got a light?

709
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,180
This is what it feels like inside my head

710
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,540
Being hollowed out cell by cell

711
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,560
From the inside

712
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,360
Says Michael Pepe

713
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,160
The Unified Field Chair

714
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,280
To unite all forces

715
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,480
Because the cosmos is not unified

716
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,780
But profoundly chaotic

717
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,860
Well ladies and gentlemen

718
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,020
We're having quite a party down here

719
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,720
We are experiencing interference

720
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,260
With our transmutation

721
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,500
I'm gonna back up the show here

722
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,860
And adjust to conspiracy

723
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,120
The way we were supposed to

724
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,240
Turn up the light and crank up the genocidal

725
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,980
There's not a lot of you tuned in

726
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,420
To hear conspiracy facts and factoids

727
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,280
Let's just all go around

728
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,820
Here we are stuck in the same old dumb show

729
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,500
I bet they're really running the show these days

730
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,740
Some of the greatest thinkers of man

731
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,320
Have been in there in the last 24 hours

732
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,160
And no one's noticed

733
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,620
Yes, the thunder of the Athanasian Creed

734
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,480
Is no longer heard on Trinity Sunday

735
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,200
And few are the Parsons

736
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,400
Who expound from the pulpit

737
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,920
The central dogma of the church

738
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,960
On that day

739
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,280
Well, Collin, what do you think

740
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,420
Of the sixth bullet theory?

741
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,940
I think of the

742
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,900
If you're going through the one

743
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,800
It's bound to get you

744
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,200
Did you think

745
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,040
Did you believe that that sixth and last bullet

746
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,580
Which is conjectured to be

747
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,480
Reagan's butt plug

748
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,380
Was actually present

749
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,400
At the Kennedy assassination?

750
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,160
Please, please

751
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,480
On this program we say champion

752
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,920
Well, I believe that the champion

753
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,960
Was always in Ronald Reagan's

754
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,260
But the news

755
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,400
Scientists extracted a large card

756
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,320
From Reagan's

757
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,380
Whatever you do

758
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,540
Don't push that button

759
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,440
No, no, this is non-card

760
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,420
Don't push that non-card button

761
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,320
It was picked up by an FBI agent

762
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,220
On the north side of Main Street

763
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,720
I'm non-pressed by this nonsense

764
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,540
Okay, we'll repeat on the card, huh?

765
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
There he goes

766
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,080
Rising to the sky

767
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,020
In a fountain of debris

768
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,960
Look at that expanding cloud

769
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,920
Expanding at 65 feet per second

770
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,780
Buildings knocked over

771
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,880
Cars melted into puddles of metal

772
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,880
An incandescent shockwave

773
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,720
Traveling outward

774
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,020
At an extraordinary speed

775
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,520
Destroying all that it meets before it

776
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,680
And right in the center

777
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,100
Bob Dobbs' face

778
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,400
Yes, Bob Dobbs

779
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,680
Bad little show

780
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,920
Staying in the air

781
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,060
Yes, we're the Sense of Humor Radio

782
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,680
Okay, so you're driving down a country road

783
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,400
Far from anywhere

784
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,020
And it's the wee hours of the night, right?

785
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,080
When you call, Bob, does anyone hear you?

786
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,760
Suddenly you run out of gas

787
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,100
There's nobody around and everything is deserted

788
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,920
It's all dark and lonesome

789
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,980
So you get out of your car and start walking

790
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,200
Right?

791
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,560
Right, right, right

792
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,420
I wouldn't

793
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,160
See, maybe your gas tank got a hole knocked in it by a rock

794
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,660
So all your gas drained out

795
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,960
And maybe you'd heard there was a gas station

796
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,280
Up ahead

797
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,260
And that's why you get out and start walking

798
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,680
Okay, now you're walking along this road

799
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,600
And you see off to the side

800
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,980
A rotten, tumbledown, deserted farmhouse

801
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,560
You decide to go in there

802
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,620
And look around, right?

803
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:05,720
Right

804
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,540
And you pull out a small penlight from your pocket

805
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,560
That you've forgotten you had

806
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,700
And you start shining it around

807
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,060
To see if you can find a can of gas

808
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,540
Yes, it is, Gary

809
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,020
Okay, okay, you don't see any gas

810
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,900
So you go in

811
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,180
There's a flight of steps to the cellar

812
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,140
And you flash the dim light

813
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,300
Before you start walking down

814
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,860
Welcome in there

815
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,700
And just as you get to the bottom

816
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,700
What do you see looming out of the darkness?

817
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,120
A naked kitty cat

818
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,820
The joint chiefs of staff

819
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,980
Plotting an intensification

820
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,060
Of the bombing in Cambodia

821
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,040
No, no, it's a body

822
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,860
Hanging from a rotted rope in the ceiling

823
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,360
And you look around some more

824
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,700
And you see their bodies all over the floor

825
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,160
Some have their hands cut off with axes

826
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,500
Others look like they've been shot and stabbed

827
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,220
And then Mark Lane walks out intact

828
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,040
Well, ladies and gentlemen

829
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
Well, if this was true

830
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,380
Wouldn't you feel horror?

831
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,660
Wouldn't you want to get away from those bodies?

832
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,480
No, you'd want to go down the start

833
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,720
Undressing them and playing with them

834
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,860
If you were a necrophiliac

835
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,440
But you'd probably turn and get out of there

836
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,480
As fast as possible

837
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,160
That's you, crawler

838
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,180
Hello, guys

839
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,780
Hello?

840
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,980
My point is

841
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,840
Even you feel supernatural horror

842
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,440
Even the cold, hard-core

843
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,800
He just gets scared when he sees

844
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,620
The eerie sight of the dead

845
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,400
Sprawled all over the cellar floor

846
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
As a creaking house in the middle of nowhere

847
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,020
And if you feel supernatural horror

848
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,020
Then there is supernatural

849
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,240
And if there is supernatural

850
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,060
There is, or could be, God

851
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,300
And here he comes now

852
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,980
She was the best of her

853
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,700
Hey, God, give the keys to the car home

854
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,600
She didn't even have to touch you, did she?

855
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,460
On my belly shalt thou go

856
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,380
And dust shalt thou eat

857
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,120
All the days of thy life

858
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,460
Look at those guys

859
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,020
Beating the bejesus out of God

860
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,420
Now they're honking at him

861
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,100
And running up and running

862
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,720
Jump, God, jump

863
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,900
See, God, jump

864
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,960
I believe it's something God puts in us

865
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,460
Yeah, hey, you ever notice

866
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,280
How DDT only strikes down the evil ants?

867
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,840
The evil empire

868
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,180
What's going on?

869
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,120
Yes, that's the way it is, Hunter

870
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,440
Turn the page, caller

871
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,240
If you can manage to find your way through the sludge

872
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,180
There's an important lesson in this somewhere

873
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,560
That needs to be learned

874
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
That lesson is?

875
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,440
Better to throw the food in the street

876
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,680
Than give the kitties too much to eat

877
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,380
But better belly burst than good meat spilt

878
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,880
In the street on St. Smithen's Day

879
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,140
Don't think, but don't talk

880
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,280
Interrupted the man, Adam

881
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,120
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater

882
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,460
Into the street over that pile of reeking meat

883
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,620
So you ask

884
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:30,640
I can't hear you

885
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,940
I can't hear anything

886
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,840
I refuse to hear anything

887
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,520
I refuse to acknowledge anybody else

888
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,300
What'd he say?

889
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,700
Did he say?

890
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,060
Hear how the devil's chuckling

891
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,280
During the show

892
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,240
It's the show

893
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,400
Rockin' away

894
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,260
Rockin' away

895
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:50,480
Rockin' away

896
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,040
Rockin' away

897
00:35:51,480 --> 00:36:19,760
Rockin' away

898
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:50,840
Rockin' away

899
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,060
Rockin' away

900
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,600
Rockin' away

901
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,200
Because you know

902
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,500
There's never been an intelligent person

903
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,960
Of the age of 60

904
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,880
Who would consent to live his life over again

905
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
His or anybody else's

906
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,220
That's what Mark Twain said

907
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,140
This is a Mark Twain night

908
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,100
He used a fake name too

909
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,520
Madness without any doubt

910
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,180
The most interesting fool there is

911
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,340
Also the most eccentric

912
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,740
He hasn't written a single law

913
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,200
In his Bible or out of it

914
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:21,460
So he's not the most eccentric

915
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,560
which has any but one purpose and intention,

916
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:31,860
which is to limit or defeat a law of God.

917
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,120
And I believe that we know just what to say about that.

918
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,140
Don't pray to God to solve your problems.

919
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,880
Pray to that part of God within you.

920
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,440
You have the guts to fight for yourself.

921
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,420
God wants brave souls.

922
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,280
He wants winners, not quitters.

923
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,760
He wants non-smokers.

924
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,340
You can't win. At least try to win.

925
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,240
Try to smoke.

926
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,820
I love dryers.

927
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,580
Oh, you love smokers.

928
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,020
Is that right, Robin?

929
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,060
Right.

930
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,000
Yay, God.

931
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,880
Brother Woodrow, lead us in a closing prayer.

932
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,340
Whether you're going to do it or not, it's missed.

933
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,720
Welcome to Big Day.

934
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,040
Don't you know that Big Day is brought to you by...

935
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,080
That's right, new...

936
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,240
What is it?

937
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,340
New snake milk.

938
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,140
Yeah, that's it.

939
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,340
And don't you know that snake milk has a shelf life of about 2,000 years?

940
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,160
And why?

941
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,660
Well, it's because every quart of snake milk,

942
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,200
it has at least 200 milligrams of reconstituted whale jism.

943
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,640
That's right, reconstituted whale jism.

944
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,160
But anyway, welcome to the Big Day.

945
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,940
Yes, it's been a very large day around here, as usual.

946
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,640
Big day.

947
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,200
I got up this morning.

948
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,560
I had a very long, large...

949
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:04,880
Yeah.

950
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,600
Well, you know, now that I've quit smoking...

951
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,440
Of course, if I haven't quit smoking, y'all can laugh.

952
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,960
Oh, laugh all you want.

953
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,120
But if I have, then...

954
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,300
Then I'll probably contract lung cancer now, now that I've quit.

955
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,280
And then y'all can freeze me.

956
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:23,800
That's it.

957
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,720
Just a minute.

958
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,780
The earth behind us looks like a giant balloon.

959
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,440
Freeze old Reverend Stang in a cryogenic tank.

960
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,380
I left my wallet in the leather suit.

961
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:33,940
What?

962
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:41,660
And worship my corpse like you worship Bob's today

963
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:46,680
as we bow down before the frozen body of Bob,

964
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,760
embedded in that huge ice cube.

965
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,160
Come on.

966
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:51,940
Immortality.

967
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,480
What extended life?

968
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,660
Greatly extended.

969
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,340
You know what we're looking for?

970
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,480
Cryo-protective.

971
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,640
You know why?

972
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,900
I'm gonna freeze everyone with cancer and bring them back when there's a cure.

973
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:01,540
Yes.

974
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,860
Then what are you gonna do with them?

975
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,100
I don't think that's the main issue, Shepard.

976
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,420
Yeah, they won't know a living soul.

977
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,440
Their relatives are gonna spend all their money.

978
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,560
Man, are we gonna have waves of freeze-dried old folks living in Miami Beach?

979
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,920
No, I mean, who are you kidding?

980
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,440
There are too many people in the world right now.

981
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,860
Death is nature's way of making wrong.

982
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,500
It's a game for someone else.

983
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,600
Einstein, Bertrand Russell.

984
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,920
Einstein could have finished his theory.

985
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,980
Hitler could have finished his.

986
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:21,600
Mozart.

987
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,020
Jung.

988
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:22,600
Stravinsky.

989
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,180
Genghis Khan.

990
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,280
Charles Larkin.

991
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:24,760
Mao.

992
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,200
Shakespeare.

993
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:25,660
Gandhi.

994
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,940
Fatty Arby.

995
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,020
All right, so who's to live?

996
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,520
Everyone?

997
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,740
And who's to decide?

998
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,960
Guys with the money and the power?

999
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,760
They'll stay and keep everything.

1000
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,580
I mean, they eat better food, they drive better cars,

1001
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,800
and now they're gonna live longer, too.

1002
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,000
Shepard, someday paramedics are gonna carry cryotanks.

1003
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,340
Someone's dying, you freeze him.

1004
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,800
You stop everything until you've got the blood of the surgeon,

1005
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,960
and the organs of the spare parts you need.

1006
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,480
This is worth much more than any one man, even him.

1007
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,700
If we were gonna hurt him, which we're not.

1008
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,720
He's a man, not a specimen.

1009
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,680
A 40,000-year-old man who can teach us about ourselves.

1010
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,380
Tell us how we evolved.

1011
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,160
Now, that is much more important than trying to figure out how to preserve people.

1012
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,320
I mean, he's alive, you're forgetting that.

1013
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,260
You can't take him apart, punch him full of holes, and drain all his fluids.

1014
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,220
That's our best chance of keeping him alive.

1015
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,420
We have to study him in order to save him.

1016
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,080
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1017
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,700
We have to study them in order to save them, you know?

1018
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,800
There's really no reason why not to believe in that.

1019
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:37,340
We've got to study in order to save the animals, including man, the highest animal.

1020
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,280
We've got a song about animals coming up from the swinging love corpses

1021
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,740
who are in the background right now.

1022
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,820
As twain...

1023
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,040
As twain said, of all the animals, man is the only one that is cruel.

1024
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,040
He's the only one that inflicts pain for the pleasure of doing it.

1025
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,660
It's a trait that's not known to the higher animals.

1026
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,240
The higher animals engage in individual fights, but never in organized masses.

1027
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:09,280
Man is the only animal that deals in that atrocity of atrocities, war.

1028
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,880
The pitifulest thing out there is a mob.

1029
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,020
That's what an army is, a mob.

1030
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,380
But they don't fight with courage.

1031
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,360
They don't fight with courage that's born in them,

1032
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,140
but with courage that's borrowed from their mass and from their officers.

1033
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,200
But a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness.

1034
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,960
A man is a religious animal.

1035
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,040
He's the only religious animal.

1036
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,280
He's the only one that has the true religion.

1037
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,640
Several of them, thousands of them.

1038
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,120
He's the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself

1039
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,280
and cuts his throat if his theology isn't straight.

1040
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:45,820
Oh.

1041
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:46,800
Yes.

1042
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,620
Mind the machine.

1043
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:54,220
Well, the Swingin' Love Corpses got to where they were really feeling sorry

1044
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,460
for the animals, our four-footed brothers out there,

1045
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,160
and they did this song.

1046
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,000
This is a protest song for animal liberation

1047
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,960
because I know that you don't care if a thousand people get killed tomorrow

1048
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,520
or read about that in the news tomorrow,

1049
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,700
but if you read about one panda who can't,

1050
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,080
you know, have babies,

1051
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,740
or one rabbit whose grandchildren have all been sent off to be used in experiments,

1052
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,660
then you'd really be upset,

1053
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,080
and this song is for you.

1054
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:26,820
Thank y'all.

1055
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,280
From the Swingin' Love Corpses.

1056
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:34,920
Oh.

1057
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,020
Oh.

1058
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:36,760
Oh.

1059
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:37,800
Oh.

1060
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,400
Oh.

1061
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:38,500


1062
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:38,500


1063
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:38,500


1064
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:38,520


1065
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:38,520


1066
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:38,520


1067
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:38,540


1068
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:38,540


1069
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:38,540


1070
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:38,540


1071
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:38,540


1072
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,520
me

1073
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,620
Oh

1074
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,180
in the name

1075
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:55,440
of

1076
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,200
Meeting

1077
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:02,620
M kidnapper

1078
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,660
living

1079
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:03,840
here

1080
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,800
was

1081
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,380
attracted

1082
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:07,380


1083
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:07,380


1084
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:07,380


1085
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:07,380


1086
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,520
And they played them a demonstration here in New York.

1087
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,140
Let it sit

1088
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,740
On the animal

1089
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,140
Of chance

1090
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,520
To feel the sunshine

1091
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,140
On

1092
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,580
Our animal brothers

1093
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,760
That sacrifice their lives

1094
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,420
Every day

1095
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,540
In the name of

1096
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,200
Medical science

1097
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,640
I fall for the brothers

1098
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,740
They're giving their lives

1099
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,920
Every day

1100
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:58,480
Every day

1101
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,180
They're cutting them open

1102
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,800
What it includes

1103
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:08,500
It's

1104
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:08,500


1105
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,680
Putting those doors on their sides

1106
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,580
All kind of

1107
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,940
Experiments

1108
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:19,780
And

1109
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,460
They do it in the name of

1110
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,220
Medical

1111
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,600
Science

1112
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,300
I fall for the brothers

1113
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,260
They're giving their lives

1114
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,460
Every day

1115
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,920
In the name of

1116
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,980
Medical science

1117
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,400
With God as fast way

1118
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,120
As I live between

1119
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,640
My eyes and kidney

1120
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,400
My eyes and kidney

1121
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,500
My eyes and kidney

1122
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:18,320
So remember, the very next time you eat some turkey, drink some wine,

1123
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,100
there's a friendly four-footed furry animal that gave his life

1124
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:27,680
to find out whether or not you die when you ate that stuff,

1125
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,140
or drank that stuff, or smoked that stuff,

1126
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,620
or whatever else you had to do.

1127
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,920
But your four-footed brothers

1128
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,460
are laying down their lives

1129
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:54,640
for you every day, for you every day, for you every day!

1130
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,260
Subjective intersection, subjective intersection,

1131
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,900
subjective intersection, subjective intersection,

1132
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,600
subjective intersection!

1133
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,700
Our four-footed brothers are subjective intersection.

1134
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,300
In the name of medical science,

1135
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,620
for you, my friend,

1136
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,480
for your life,

1137
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,380
for the lives of your fellow man.

1138
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:36,160
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

1139
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,820
Ah!

1140
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:46,180
Your four-footed brothers are laying down their lives.

1141
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,880
Little doors on the side.

1142
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:00,500
Two running out of little docks.

1143
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:00,820
Two.

1144
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,000
Two.

1145
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:03,740
Two.

1146
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,160
Two.

1147
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:05,860
Two.

1148
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:06,660
Two.

1149
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:07,800
Two.

1150
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,500
Two.

1151
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,500


1152
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,500


1153
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,500


1154
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,500


1155
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,500


1156
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,500


1157
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,500


1158
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,500


1159
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,500


1160
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,500


1161
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,500


1162
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,500


1163
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,500


1164
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,500


1165
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,060
Two.

1166
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:09,260


1167
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:09,820
Two.

1168
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:09,820


1169
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:09,820


1170
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:09,820


1171
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,580
Subjective intersection, subjective intersection,

1172
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,480
subjective intersection, subjective intersection,

1173
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:15,700
subjective intersection, subjective intersection.

1174
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,740
Our four-footed brothers are subjective intersection.

1175
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,400
Oh yes, dear friends.

1176
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,480
Well, that was the swingin' love corpses talking

1177
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,260
about our four-footed brothers.

1178
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,880
And Dr. Philo Drummond on vocals there.

1179
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,660
And friends, you need to write in for information.

1180
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,400
I know a lot of you are very curious.

1181
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:52,320
I'm going to finally read that P.O. box to write in for information about Bob and the Church of the Subgenius and what all can be, just how many brain cells you can lose by writing.

1182
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,020
Got that pencil?

1183
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,560
Bob at P.O. box.

1184
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:06,280
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 www.subgenius.com

1185
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,920
Oh yeah, Swingin' Love, of course, is going out.

1186
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,620
I have to play this.

1187
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,520
Dear friends, we need that money.

1188
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:26,460
I believe that you know how little money this station has to run on.

1189
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,720
I know because I've seen it.

1190
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,500
I've been in the temple.

1191
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:37,580
I took the thing that Bob made me drink and I saw, I saw you in the spirit, in the vision.

1192
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,300
I saw it coming.

1193
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,540
Hey, your check coming in the mail.

1194
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:41,400
Oh yeah.

1195
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,860
Oh, this is Timothy Larry reminding you that just as you need slack, Bob needs your help.

1196
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,220
Send in those pledges and praise Bob.

1197
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,080
I believe you can make this world a better place to live in.

1198
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,940
People really don't listen without pain, do they?

1199
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,320
They must be bad people.

1200
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,420
See, the problem with the believers is they think we're loaded already.

1201
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,260
And we are, but we don't have any money.

1202
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,480
So few are ready to put their beliefs on the line.

1203
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,140
The line where you sign your name on that check.

1204
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:20,840
Oh, I don't, I don't have a spare $10 because I'm going to spend it on cigarettes and liquor.

1205
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:29,100
Or even worse, by pretending to be a subgenius and pledging but never even actually sending the check.

1206
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:29,740
Huh?

1207
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,460
Get on the stick, man.

1208
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,160
Promising ain't enough.

1209
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,000
Faith.

1210
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,080
Is not enough.

1211
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,000
But your paid up pledge is enough.

1212
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:50,840
So reach down deep into that most sacred organ of your body, your wallet, and let there be slack.

1213
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:11,780
Ah, we're already out of here, Bob.

1214
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:15,020
This is what it sounds like to crash off a cigarette habit.

1215
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:15,780
Friends.

1216
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,280
We made it.

1217
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,400
Okay, Wally.

1218
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,680
No, one last one, please.

1219
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,860
Just one last one.

1220
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:28,540
Oh, ah.

1221
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,060
So what, Mr. Dobbs?

1222
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,100
We're in shape for the finals.

1223
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,940
No, really, Mr. Dobbs.

1224
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,940
And by the way, Bob, just where is that long?

1225
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,720
promised bucket of pills. And tell me, Bob, what's this slack business? Shouldn't the hierarchical

1226
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:50,540
slack holders be getting unearthly dividends on a regular basis by now? Or is it just really

1227
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:57,120
too much fun, Bob? Well, there is a war on here, Bob, and whatever happened to too much is always

1228
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:01,940
better than not enough. Has there been inside trading in the Sol's repository in Dobstown?

1229
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:07,320
Oh, come on, Bob. Remember us? Remember the old guys? We used to sell froth mixture for you back

1230
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:12,120
way back in the good old days. We've heard the old Dobbshead snake oil routine before, Bob.

1231
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:17,640
We know all about the bleeding head of AP. But when will it come is what we want to know. When

1232
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:24,620
shall the fabled luck plane tilt? And when shall things at last begin to flow to all, all, all of

1233
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:29,720
us who, despite the perilous times in which we do live, cleave unto you still, oh, Bob?

1234
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:33,980
Next day's coming closer, Dobbs. You haven't got all the time to the end of the world, have you?

1235
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,600
Hadn't you better just get cranking, Mr. Dobbs?

1236
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:37,840
Ooh.

1237
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:40,480
Ow!

1238
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,340
That's me.

1239
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,560
That's me,oned.

1240
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,640
That's me,oned.

1241
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,700
I'm turning.

1242
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:52,340
Ooh.

1243
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,900
Ooh.

1244
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:54,080


1245
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:54,260


1246
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:54,660
Ooh.

1247
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:55,440


1248
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:56,500
Ooh.

1249
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:35,540
Ooh, lovely from Michael Pepe.

1250
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,340
And this from DK Jones.

1251
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:34,280
And this from DK Jones.

1252
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,080
Yes, there is one.

1253
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:38,700
I'm sure of it.

1254
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,460
Yes, yes, please.

1255
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:42,900
Yes, why not?

1256
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,540
Yes, that's right.

1257
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,000
So, why not?

1258
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,540
Why not kill Ramtha?

1259
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,920
Why not take the New Age creatures

1260
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,600
and kill them because

1261
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,220
those stupid,

1262
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,360
non-smokers?

1263
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,400
I've always hated non-smokers.

1264
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,420
Now,

1265
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,220
now I'm...

1266
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,500
Let's kill Ramtha.

1267
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,940
Yeah, let's just do it.

1268
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:31,980
Now, if he just happens to be occupying

1269
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,700
some instant bystander's body,

1270
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,520
our misnomer,

1271
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,600
I'm gonna kill him.

1272
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:38,440
I'm gonna kill him.

1273
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,500
There's not much we can do about that in the Azur.

1274
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,880
That's just, that's beside the point.

1275
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,080
That's, that's

1276
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,240
ex facto.

1277
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,680
That's, that's just

1278
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:48,860
beside it.

1279
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,740
No you of beings

1280
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:53,640
that are riding pickup trucks.

1281
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,880
No ye of beings

1282
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,060
that have come up here to kick your ass.

1283
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,620
No ye of

1284
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,340
those who would destroy

1285
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,300
all channeling entities.

1286
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,520
I am joyfully,

1287
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:05,740
I am enjoy.

1288
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,180
I am outrageous.

1289
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,860
I am bruised.

1290
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,860
Really would make friends with

1291
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,040
Aryan Nation people.

1292
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,220
People that get riled up on,

1293
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,340
they're just as active in politics as

1294
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:21,120
Nicaragua protesters and people that go to

1295
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,660
nuclear sites, I mean they're,

1296
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,480
they're political kind of him,

1297
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,480
but they're just on that other

1298
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,700
side totally.

1299
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,140
I mean they would fly somewhere,

1300
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:34,420
make a protest, march and be devoted to a thing.

1301
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,520
It just so happens to be wanna do something else.

1302
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,300
be the annihilation

1303
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,300
of certain races.

1304
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,280
Yeah.

1305
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,940
What I'd rather annihilate would be Boy George.

1306
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,300
Just make

1307
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,020
friends with him and go up to Seattle

1308
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,080
and just have him all over again.

1309
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,200
Do you know of beings which try to

1310
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,280
exterminate other races?

1311
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,080
I think you call them Nazis.

1312
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:00,620
But I just

1313
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:03,200
could. If I could, just

1314
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,140
get a bunch of them riled up

1315
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,200
and they would just go and kill her.

1316
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,240
I would just do that.

1317
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,780
If I could just do that,

1318
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,960
then I'd probably be charged.

1319
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:13,480
Well, you know,

1320
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,140
after that song

1321
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,700
Do You Really Want to Hurt Me

1322
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,120
came out, Doctors for

1323
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,340
Bob and Janet Huckley's

1324
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,080
Rick Maverick comedy troupe

1325
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,520
just recorded this

1326
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,020
rebuttal. Oh, yeah.

1327
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,720
I want to hurt him real

1328
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:31,800
bad.

1329
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:33,960
I just

1330
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,900
Oh!

1331
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:37,020
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1332
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,020
I want to, oh!

1333
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,860
Oh, God!

1334
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,420
I just want to

1335
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,680
hurt him real bad!

1336
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,060
I just want to

1337
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,760
Give me a ticket to London

1338
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,940
and a tax account.

1339
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,460
Oh, please! Oh, God!

1340
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,900
Just for a second, if only I could just

1341
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,260
for a second just

1342
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,140
be hurting him real,

1343
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,020
real bad!

1344
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:02,460
Oh, God!

1345
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,480
Oh, God!

1346
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,520
I could die happy if I could just

1347
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,740
Oh, God! I want to hurt him!

1348
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,700
Let me live five more minutes

1349
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,600
but let those five minutes be

1350
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,260
hurting him real bad!

1351
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,380
Real, real

1352
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,240
bad!

1353
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,600
If I could just one molecule

1354
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,060
of his being, if I could just

1355
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,980
slash it with a razor and just

1356
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,900
if only it would hurt

1357
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,020
real, real bad!

1358
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,900
I mean, I'd go to work in a

1359
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,740
coal mine for the next 40 years

1360
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,840
if I knew somehow the money was being

1361
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,960
used to hurt him

1362
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,460
real bad!

1363
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,940
I guess we'll have a

1364
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,300
lynching!

1365
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:47,720
