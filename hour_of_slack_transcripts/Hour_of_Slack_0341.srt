1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
uh, plays the show in other towns, and everyone who, uh, pays money to the station here in Dallas

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:19,460
to keep us on and on and on and on. Well, I guess it's time to do show now. Ah, yes.

3
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:33,020
Ah, it's so relaxing to do a nice religious program like this. Why, all you really need is your background Christian music,

4
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,660
even though we make a mockery of such things. Isn't it terrible?

5
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,660
And, uh, and your, your, well, your script, whatever that may be.

6
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,260
In this case, I've got this book called The Great.

7
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,220
The Great Thoughts. Ah, so, so relaxing, isn't it?

8
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,160
Yeah, relaxing. Well, that's pretty boring, too, isn't it?

9
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,500
Okay, let's just...

10
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,040
There. Is that it?

11
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,400
Is that it?

12
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:48,680
Well, that's boring, too. I don't want to hear that. Someone called and said that my voice sounded, uh, sounded thin and crackly.

13
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,700
No, it didn't, it really wasn't.

14
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:59,000
And, oh, I hope using add voice effects didn't even not let that happen because they're a little unusual is important, but...

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,600
It's all about sound effects.

16
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,120
M giàa...

17
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,660
John, just come in here.

18
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:08,660


19
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,860
Oh, my hitting with it again now.

20
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,140
How do you say

21
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,520
Why are you beat?

22
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,900
High.

23
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,620
Oh, oh, oh.

24
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:14,900
Oh, your bornэير me!

25
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,100
There's no place for me to play it in Dallas.

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,740
Nobody, none of the other clubs.

27
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,420
Shut up, Will.

28
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,080
Don't laugh.

29
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,840
It's not funny.

30
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,660
None of the clubs here in Dallas seem to have any, any, uh...

31
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,840
I guess it's just, you know, subgenius do small time for Dallas.

32
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,000
Of course, I haven't gone to any of those clubs looking,

33
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,540
trying to get, to get show, but...

34
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,080
I don't know.

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,300
Have you ever felt this way, friends?

36
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,100
Have you ever felt like, like, say you had this social setback

37
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,480
or a slight humiliation, and on top of that,

38
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,980
you have a certain sensitivity to any kind of external contacts

39
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,400
and a tendency towards asocial withdrawal of some kind,

40
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,940
not to mention a certain amount of subjective preoccupations

41
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,060
that you have with your friends.

42
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,920
It's just, you know, very, very individualized sort of eccentric interests.

43
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,180
Typical subgenius so far, we're describing.

44
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:31,240
By the way, you're listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,140
I knew that I was forgetting something.

46
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,920
Didn't even do the title music.

47
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,040
Can you believe it?

48
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,860
Came in here to do a show without the title music.

49
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:41,980
Yeah.

50
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,260
But I'm not, you know, it's because of the illness.

51
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,060
That's what it was.

52
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,400
It's the illness that's been making me just, I don't know,

53
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,660
it's hard to keep on top of things.

54
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,200
Have you ever had the feeling of hypochondriasis,

55
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,920
which is the search for medical verification of an illness,

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,460
but failure to find it?

57
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,140
Or you're convinced you're sick, but the doctor keeps going,

58
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,700
no, there's nothing wrong with you.

59
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,100
Nothing wrong?

60
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,840
It's all in your mind.

61
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,620
And then...

62
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,700
That's followed, of course, by increased concern,

63
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,100
even obsession with bodily functions.

64
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,240
Not like the subgenius church lately or anything.

65
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,660
But it makes me...

66
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,740
That kind of thing just gets to you.

67
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,160
You know, it eats away at you.

68
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,900
I keep wondering.

69
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,800
And that's another thing.

70
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,440
Have you ever started to have increasing worries?

71
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,060
Like, why?

72
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,100
And what?

73
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,400
What?

74
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,900
And above all, when?

75
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,040
When?

76
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,580
When am I going to get it?

77
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,220
When are they going to do it to me?

78
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,600
And finally, you come up with this irrational sort of revelation.

79
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,900
I know I do.

80
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,580
Which is the formulation of a manufactured insight

81
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,840
into how this illness or whatever your problem is happened.

82
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,960
Which, of course, can then...

83
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,300
That one thing leads to another.

84
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,240
And next thing you know, you've got somatic delusions

85
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,420
and retrospective falsifications of the origins of the physical complaint.

86
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:27,500
In other words, well, it's not because I tried to carry that bathtub up the stairs

87
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,460
that my back hurts.

88
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,240
It's because...

89
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,780
It's because that UFO abduction.

90
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,540
Yeah, that's it.

91
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,300
And David Ferry and those UFO guys, they did something to me.

92
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,360
They put something in my mind.

93
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,780
And pretty soon, you...

94
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,080
You...

95
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,280
You...

96
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,280


97
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,780
You experience projection or the belief that the illness is caused by an external factor.

98
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,900
Such as...

99
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,020
The conspiracy.

100
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:50,660
Hmm.

101
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,240
Hmm.

102
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,340
A systemization of that delusion,

103
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,180
and then a clarification of it,

104
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,120
will help you shift your anxiety, dear friends,

105
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,860
and consequent reintegration of the personality.

106
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,060
You see, we're trying to reintegrate the personality

107
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,560
so that you realize that all your problems,

108
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,460
really are caused by a...

109
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,740
A huge and complex conspiracy

110
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,300
of those who are out to get you.

111
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,040
Uh, what we call in the business here,

112
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,360
conspiracy logic,

113
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,820
or interpretation of events as links in a conspiracy.

114
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,140
And of course, the circle of persecutors gets wider and wider

115
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,260
until it's like worldwide.

116
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,180
The conspiracy's everywhere.

117
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,260
And then you start wondering why the persecution has focused on yourself.

118
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,120
And of course, uh...

119
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,520
The only way to explain that is,

120
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,400
gee, I must be really important.

121
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,760
So those, uh, delusions of grandeur and increasing grandiosity occur

122
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,520
to the point where you become like a...

123
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,080
Maybe a radio show host.

124
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,460
Blabbering crazily about conspiracies that are out to get you and your friends.

125
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,200
Finally, there's a recognition of an important mission.

126
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,240
And that mission is to...

127
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,240


128
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,240


129
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,240


130
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,820
To save the world.

131
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,680
To be a messenger of God.

132
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,780
Can you imagine that?

133
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,200
And finally, and this is the part that...

134
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,600
This is my favorite part.

135
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,140
But it usually only happens late at night.

136
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,380
Cosmic identity.

137
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,840
The belief that you are the universe.

138
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,640
Or that you are God.

139
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,300
Uh, yes, well that was actually a description of the, um...

140
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,700
Oh!

141
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,220
I didn't put that in there.

142
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:40,220


143
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,480
That sound of that black cat screeching and fighting

144
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,360
or whatever they're doing back there in the mix.

145
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,760
Somebody else must have.

146
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,540
You know, they put codes in that show.

147
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,460
They put special sounds in that show that are subliminal,

148
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,860
that make you paranoid.

149
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,360
They're...

150
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,580
The subgenius thing is the CIA.

151
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,100
They're fronted...

152
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,040
They're like a...

153
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,000
They're sponsored by the CIA.

154
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,620
They're doing, uh, experiments.

155
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,120
Sort of like Jonestown was.

156
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,300
Jim Jones was a CIA provocateur.

157
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,500
They were doing an experiment on belief systems.

158
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,600
You see.

159
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,580
And that's why the Church of the Subgenius is here.

160
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,480
It's just a more sophisticated one.

161
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,580
Rather than trying to talk you into committing suicide

162
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,040
by drinking the stupid Kool-Aid.

163
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,380
Well...

164
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,120
We're just trying to talk you into parting with that

165
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,500
which has enslaved you.

166
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,760
Your pathetic little wallet, dear friends.

167
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,960
Ah, yes, it's a...

168
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,000
A civilization of succ...

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,600
Wait a minute.

170
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,300
This...

171
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,400
Ah...

172
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,720
One must center oneself

173
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,640
in order to do a proper subgenius show.

174
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,200
And that often requires nice, soothing background music.

175
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,980
As we study the, uh...

176
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,620
Tonight...

177
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,200
As we study the, um...

178
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,700
Effects of paranoia...

179
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,640
Uh...

180
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,200
The evolving system of paranoia...

181
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,260
Which we, faithful subgeniuses, know as the true...

182
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,560
The true belief in Bob.

183
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,020
The...

184
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,780
The, um...

185
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,320
The quest for slack.

186
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,740
Ah, yes.

187
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,920
Praise be.

188
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,240
We're gonna do a song...

189
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,440
That you never heard before.

190
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,880
The torch has been passed...

191
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,040
To a new generation of Americans.

192
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,720
Lesson 3...

193
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,960
Got to have soul!

194
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,180
Got, got, got to have, to have, got to have soul!

195
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,340
Let's dance!

196
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,500
Let's dance!

197
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,700
Let's dance!

198
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,640
Let's dance to the drummer's beat!

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,800
Let's dance!

200
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,740
Let's dance to the drummer's beat!

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,960
Let's dance!

202
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,900
Let's dance!

203
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,840
Let's dance!

204
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,260
Let's dance!

205
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,420
Let's dance!

206
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,520
Let's dance!

207
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:13,520


208
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,160
The message is...

209
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,520
Mars...

210
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,560
Needs...

211
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,240
Women.

212
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,740
We interrupt this record to bring you a special bulletin.

213
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,920
The reports of a flying saucer hovering over the city have been confirmed.

214
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,740
Time to get on up now!

215
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,780
Gonna dance to this key word, uh-oh!

216
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,920
Time to get on up now!

217
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,120
Hip Hop!

218
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,200
Hip Hop!

219
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,260
Hip Hop!

220
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,060
Hip Hop!

221
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,240
Let's dance!

222
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,040
Let's dance to the drummer's beat!

223
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,760
Let's dance!

224
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:06,760


225
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:06,760


226
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:06,760


227
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:06,760


228
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:06,760


229
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:06,760


230
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:06,760


231
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,000
Let's dance, let's dance to the double beat.

232
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,140
Let's dance, let's dance cause it's all so sweet.

233
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,080
Let's dance, let's dance.

234
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,800
I know a dark, deep-rooted place.

235
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,920
A place where no one knows your face.

236
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,860
A glass of wine, a fast embrace.

237
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,480
It's called Fernando's Hideaway.

238
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,380
Olé!

239
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Here's Johnny!

240
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,140
Yeah, yeah, we know, we know.

241
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
出来 item

242
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,100
Capriccio

243
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,100


244
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,100


245
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,100


246
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,840
Snow

247
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,840
Administrator

248
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,500
This is the part of this song you got to watch, ladies and gentlemen.

249
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,660
You don't have to say anything and you don't have to do anything.

250
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,780
Oh, maybe just whistle.

251
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,700
You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve?

252
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,540
You just put your lips together.

253
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,200
You just put your lips together.

254
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,880
Let's dance to the devil's beat.

255
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,960
Let's dance.

256
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,780
Let's dance to the devil's beat.

257
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,100
Let's dance.

258
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,020
Let's dance because it's all so sweet.

259
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,140
Let's dance.

260
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,160
Let's dance.

261
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,820
I could dance with you till the cows come home.

262
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,700
On second thought, I'd rather dance with the cows than you come home.

263
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,460
Let's dance.

264
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:03,820
Let's dance.

265
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,280
Let's dance.

266
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,960
Let's dance to the devil's beat.

267
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,140
Let's dance.

268
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,200
Let's dance to the devil's beat.

269
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,300
Let's dance.

270
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,220
Let's dance to the devil's beat.

271
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,220


272
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,140
Let's dance if you're a big fat freak.

273
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,300
Let's dance.

274
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,200
Let's dance.

275
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:18,420


276
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,480
And say, children.

277
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,180
What does it all mean?

278
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,840
What does it all mean, dear friends?

279
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,900
Why does God allow pain and death?

280
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,820
I asked Dr. Fowler.

281
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:41,920
drumming that and he asked Bob and we found that indeed God allows pain and

282
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:53,180
death in order to evolve a great man truly good or women great beings must be

283
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,960
evolved by survival of the fittest who are able to analyze the reason for the

284
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,240
suffering and the greater message behind it and be able to appreciate it have I

285
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,540
already preached on this before I can't remember friends it's been so hectic but

286
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,420
oh I didn't want to get away from the point which was the meaning of life all

287
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:20,000
of mankind suffering basically is what has existed all of all of life's

288
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,020
existence up until until this moment existed for the specific purpose of

289
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,100
Korea of creating us at this moment basking

290
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:41,480
in this in this meditation upon our own true greatness and luck to be at this

291
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:48,280
moment alive and able to appreciate why the world is the way it is and why so

292
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,580
much crap is going on all the time and why so much crap happened all those

293
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,040
millions and millions of years it was just so that we'd be able to sit here

294
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,940
right now and think back and just appreciate it all isn't that pleasant

295
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,080
isn't that what religion is all about isn't that what religion is all about

296
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,180
but you think the subgeniuses are crazy my friends there have been entire

297
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:14,900
civilizations of suckers the the best illustration of all of that of religion

298
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:22,480
gone hog wild is Easter Island because you know once people get it into their

299
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:31,000
heads that their gods want them to do something my god and and so if as we

300
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,080
gaze down upon Easter Island we'll see that there's a lot of people who are

301
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:48,160
bound to this world ending up with being created byşarishaj's evil and

302
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,160


303
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,280
work that's been done so long for them out there in the so called survival

304
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,260
Ismael I told you that he had go to rif

305
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:52,260


306
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,660
Minoan and the Highland people they lived with all the Boron do do a which

307
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:59,760
odds look like the next but on his own

308
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,900
However, they chopped down all the trees on the island in the process of doing this and

309
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:13,440
wrecked the ecosystem, which they interpreted as a further sign of the gods' displeasure

310
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,760
with the other cult, which in turn drove the constant fighting.

311
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,240
So it became a vicious circle.

312
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,660
And finally, they decimated each other in starvation.

313
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,940
But boy, were their gods impressed.

314
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,100
Their descendants reverted to the Stone Age.

315
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,380
You know, the current inhabitants, or the people who lived on Easter Island when it

316
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:41,880
was sort of rediscovered, didn't remember who had built the heads or why any of that

317
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,440
had happened.

318
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,480
They had reverted to the Stone Age and were living in caves and essentially were nocturnal

319
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,980
people afraid to come out in the daytime because they were afraid of the long-vanished religious

320
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,480
nuts who had driven them into the caves and destroyed their...

321
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,080
Eventually, that's the most wonderful thing.

322
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,080


323
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,240
The wonderful thing about it, they ended up completely ignorant of the gods that started

324
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,500
it all and what it was all about in the first place.

325
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,860
And long after the religious nuts had killed all of each other off, their poor, wimpy victims

326
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:20,320
were still hiding in caves, forgetting their entire history, forgetting the whole point

327
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,920
of the battles.

328
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,280
It's the most horrible thing that can happen to a civilization.

329
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,240
And that describes what happened also to the descendants of Mutantus.

330
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,500
Yes, it happened to us.

331
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,760
The Yetis are the children of the Yeti.

332
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,860
And furthermore, it will continue to happen on a worldwide scale as this planet keeps

333
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,700
getting too crowded.

334
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:47,160
You know, one has to imagine eventually it could become just a battle between two types

335
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,100
of fundamentalist idiots, each trying to retain their nationalism to the point where they

336
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,340
destroy the whole world, including their nation, and the survivors won't remember the cause

337
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,480
or even the origin.

338
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,340
But, you know what, dear friends?

339
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,360
War is heck.

340
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,180
War is just heck, isn't it?

341
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,860
Too darn bad.

342
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,580
But what we're trying to…

343
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,160
Hold on.

344
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,320
I'm sorry to have to keep interrupting you.

345
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,520
I'm not just…

346
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:28,100
I just don't feel like doing one of those spiffy, edited, carefully prepared shows that

347
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:35,580
we normally do for you, as you're so familiar with, with all the nice, clean segues and so

348
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:35,860
forth.

349
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,200
Just been too busy and just don't care.

350
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,820
Guess that's what it comes down to, ain't it?

351
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,040
Just don't care.

352
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,860
Ain't it grand, ain't it grand?

353
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,180
But you know, the substance of all of our lives is woman.

354
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,640
Well, I'm speaking for the guys here.

355
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,600
And you gals should appreciate this.

356
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,080
As it says here, woman.

357
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


358
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


359
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


360
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


361
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


362
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


363
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


364
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


365
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


366
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


367
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


368
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


369
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


370
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


371
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


372
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,080


373
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,000
And the great thoughts.

374
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,900
And these are the great thoughts of George Moore, who also said, I don't care how the

375
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,520
poor live.

376
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,700
My only regret is that they live at all.

377
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,080
But he said, the substance of our lives is woman.

378
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,540
All other things are irrelevancies, hypocrisies, subterfuges.

379
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,220
We sit talking of sports and politics, and all the while our hearts are filled with memories

380
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,660
of women and the capture of women.

381
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,560
That is a great thought.

382
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,500
I'm sorry.

383
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,620
I'm sorry.

384
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,720
It is a truly, truly great thought.

385
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,000
I hope that wasn't one that I read last week.

386
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,760
You know, my mind has been destroyed by the paranoia.

387
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,060
Because the foundation of irreligious criticism is this.

388
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,340
Man makes religion.

389
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,000
Religion does not make man.

390
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,180
Religion is, in fact, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of a man who has either not

391
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,380
yet gained himself or has lost himself.

392
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:57,480
I'm sorry.

393
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,480


394
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:16,140
You're the prophet of Rohit and I'm just saying, if we were to go back in time and

395
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,260
look at the Iran conflict difficult chronology, would you do that?

396
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:16,920
You know, you might be my maiden800 medical point of reference in one way or the other,

397
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,600
but when it comes to the response to your mausoleum weirds were so brave to speak up, I wonder

398
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:19,600


399
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,400
How manyули are turning on myach learnt?

400
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:24,580
Yours?

401
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,080
I don't know what he's trying to tell us there, friends.

402
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,900
You never know with these communists.

403
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,240
The theory of the communists may be summed up in the single sentence,

404
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,040
abolition of private property.

405
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,920
What a great idea!

406
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,560
Gee, just think how many zillions of wimpy intellectuals went for that one.

407
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,780
And how many pinks went along with it because,

408
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,200
well, somebody else said it was a good idea.

409
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,520
I'm not capable of, I don't know if I should,

410
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,220
I don't know who to vote for.

411
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,740
I don't, I, well, whatever they say must be best.

412
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,560
Actually, Bob believes in the abolition of private property of yours

413
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,600
and making it into his own through chaos or education.

414
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,960
But our bourgeoisie,

415
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,180
not content with having to live in a city of private property,

416
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,180


417
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,320
not content with having the wives and daughters of their proles at their disposal,

418
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,860
not to speak of common prostitutes,

419
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,300
take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's wives.

420
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,340
That's what old Carl said about the bourgeoisie.

421
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,720
That they, what an embittered old crank.

422
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,360
Now here's another great embittered old, old crank.

423
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,280
Charles Fort, one of my heroes.

424
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,600
Charles Fort was the guy who practically invented UFO,

425
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,120
UFO-ology.

426
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,340
And I didn't know this about my hero,

427
00:22:59,420 --> 00:22:59,960
but apparently,

428
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,260
this all sounds sort of familiar.

429
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,680
As a young man, Fort traveled around the world

430
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,300
with the definite purpose of accumulating experiences and impressions of life

431
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,160
so as to become a writer.

432
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,720
And after a few years, he settled down and began to write.

433
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,660
He was briefly hailed as a new and rare literary star in 1905,

434
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,200
but his ambitions went largely unrequited.

435
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,240
By 1906, he was harboring intense feelings of bitterness and hatred.

436
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,920
This is when Bob Dobbs usually hires writers, dear friend.

437
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,320
But months passed without Bob showing up or his being able to sell any of his work.

438
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,180
And he got suicidal and he wrote some novels that weren't any good.

439
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,420
And this was the surprising part.

440
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,460
Any of you who are Charles Fort fans,

441
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:54,180
little is known about the next few years because he destroyed his notes and writings.

442
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,180
We use the word, the word, the word.

443
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,060
We do know that he wrote a crank work called X,

444
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,380
which revolved around the idea that Mars invisibly controlled all life on Earth by means of rays.

445
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,280
Sort of as a light in a movie camera controls the images on film.

446
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:16,020
Rarely do you see projection taken quite so literally, it says here.

447
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,480
Fort followed this with another excessive work called Y,

448
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,680
the letter Y, around 1915.

449
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,160
It apparently involved a sinister civilization

450
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,120
at the South Pole from which Caspar Hauser,

451
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,580
the mysterious boy who showed up in Nuremberg in 1828, had hailed.

452
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,300
Fort supposedly says that Hauser was murdered

453
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,980
to prevent him from revealing the truth about Y land.

454
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:49,420
Well, yeah, he apparently burned, got rid of, burned those books because I think, you know,

455
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,540
the good Dr. Fort, who wasn't a doctor,

456
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,980
but a great subgenius certainly,

457
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,940
had sort of lost his mind, you know.

458
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,900
He'd gotten off into the total paranoia of it all.

459
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,440
And that is fun, you know, to dwell in the hate,

460
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,960
to dwell in the hate.

461
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,320
But you shouldn't, you shouldn't waste your hate

462
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,520
on individuals or nations, friends.

463
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,300
Your hate should be pure.

464
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,080
It should be an all-encompassing, like Bob's hate,

465
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,920
a hate that swallows up everything.

466
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,340
But at the same time, and if you do that,

467
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,140
if you follow in the path of Charles Fort, say,

468
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,620
or myself for that matter,

469
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,580
I rank myself up with these gods, cranks, crackpots.

470
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,960
In fact, I got a list just the other day,

471
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,060
a list of cranks and crackpots and visionaries,

472
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,280
and I was on there.

473
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,640
I guess, I guess it was because I'm a visionary.

474
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,060
Certainly they wouldn't put me on there as a crackpot.

475
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,020
But, oh, I can't find the list.

476
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,180
Gosh, I was on there with Lenny Bruce

477
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:58,860
and Joseph Smith, who invented the Mormons and so forth.

478
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,680
It's a set of trading cards,

479
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,900
crackpots, kooks, and visionaries.

480
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,380
And imagine the pride I felt

481
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,900
in seeing myself on that list right next to,

482
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,460
well, next to Lenny Bruce

483
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:17,720
and several other famous drug addicts and ranters.

484
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,540
Where is that little list?

485
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,820
It was such a great list of kooks.

486
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,540
I didn't even know who half of them were.

487
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,780
Oh, here it is.

488
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,840
Yeah, Terrence McKenna.

489
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,820
I'm going to be in the same trading card set, dear friends.

490
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,180
An ugly caricature of me drawn by Hal Robbins

491
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,420
will be in this set with Al Goldstein,

492
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,440
the editor of Screw magazine.

493
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,580
Brother Theodore, you've heard him on this show.

494
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,760
Were it not for his madness,

495
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,420
he would have gone insane long ago.

496
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,520
Mary Shelley, who wrote Frankenstein.

497
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,840
Dolly Dimples.

498
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,920
Lizzie Borden.

499
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,540
Forrest Ackerman, editor of

500
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,300
Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine.

501
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,640
Amy Semple McPherson.

502
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,440
Cicciolina, of the Italian stripper senator.

503
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,860
Captain Beefheart.

504
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,140
Spike Jones.

505
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,020
Busby Berkeley.

506
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,780
Raymond Scott.

507
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,800
Nikola Tesla.

508
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,000
Hmm.

509
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,020
Saint John the Divine.

510
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,220
I think that's the one that wrote Revelation.

511
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,620
Charlie Starkweather.

512
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,280
It's nice to be in that list.

513
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,500
John the Baptist and Charlie Starkweather,

514
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,520
they sit next to each other,

515
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,200
only on a list of crackpots, visionaries,

516
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,760
and subgeniuses.

517
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,680
And, of course,

518
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,320
Criswell.

519
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,560
Not the Dallas Criswell.

520
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,160
The late visionary Criswell.

521
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,340
I predict that an all-embracing world economic theory

522
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,280
that's also a general field theory of the universe

523
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,960
can be created

524
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,860
by graphing income from subgenius types

525
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,800
against gravitation of animals.

526
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:58,500
And, of course,

527
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:58,500


528
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:58,900
most important

529
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:58,960
is that

530
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:58,980
the

531
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,300
world's

532
00:27:59,300 --> 00:27:59,800
most important

533
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,600
is that

534
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:00,620
the

535
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:00,740
world's

536
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,560
most important

537
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,500
is that

538
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,300
the

539
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:07,460
world's

540
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,140
most important is that

541
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:21,280
the world's most important is that

542
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,320
our

543
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,480
You're really hungry.

544
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:44,020
Well, you'd get 100 phylos of slack from that first hamburger,

545
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,620
but from the second hamburger you might only get 75 or 50 phylos.

546
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,920
By the third hamburger, it'd be only down to 25,

547
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,400
and eventually it would be negative satisfaction.

548
00:28:53,700 --> 00:29:00,140
The fourth hamburger would be stangs of pain rather than phylos of slack.

549
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,200
So it's like in the supply-side theory in economics.

550
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,080
The more labor you throw at it,

551
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,640
eventually you'll reach a point where there's diminishing returns.

552
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,040
So you must find an equilibrium, and that's what we're trying to do here,

553
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,780
an equilibrium between our incipient paranoia

554
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:22,360
and the fact that there really is a conspiracy of normals.

555
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,180
I mean, that part of the conspiracy is definitely real.

556
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,080
I mean, even a normal could probably admit that,

557
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,760
but yet they wouldn't feel it like we do.

558
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,380
You know what I mean?

559
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,020
Oh, yes.

560
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:42,600
And there really is a secret government of basically the same families

561
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,320
that made so much money off of weapons way back in the Civil War.

562
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,200
Isn't America beautiful?

563
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,920
And they're still running things today.

564
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,060
Doesn't matter who you vote for.

565
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,660
You know, if Perot got in, they'd have to kill him.

566
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,760
They wouldn't do it like Kennedy style.

567
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,960
They'd do it, they'd use the cancer thing,

568
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,180
the heart attack medicine.

569
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,620
You know, they've got all that stuff.

570
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,780
They'd have him out of there.

571
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,940
He'd be on a machine within three months, and he'd be dead.

572
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,180
And one of their boys would be back in there.

573
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,440
At least with George Bush, you know it's one of their boys.

574
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,440
He's been there from the beginning.

575
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,280
Ah, yes.

576
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,740
And it's time to go now to side two of your subgenius radio ministry,

577
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,700
our Slack show, for more speculation.

578
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,100
And meanderings by your good, good, good friend and prayer partner,

579
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,460
Reverend Ivan Stang.

580
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,000
Ah, yes.

581
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,820
Ah, yeah, okay.

582
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:57,940
Yes.

583
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,780
Yes, yes, yes.

584
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,220
Yes, the church.

585
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,140
Of the subgenius back.

586
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,260
Back again.

587
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,780
Well, it's too relaxing.

588
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,440
Let's go over to the subgenius show in Berkeley

589
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,760
and see if they're being clever right now.

590
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,740
I don't even know because I haven't heard this tape yet myself.

591
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,740
That's true.

592
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,680
That's true.

593
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,720
Not where little children will find them.

594
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,240
Yeah, don't let the kids find them.

595
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,400
Where little children can read specially crafted children's stories.

596
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,320
Guaranteed to warp and twist their mind in pleasantly unusual ways.

597
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,440
Oh, lordy, lord, lord.

598
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:44,920
Let's ignore that.

599
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,920
We like to twist minds.

600
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,680
The flies!

601
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,880
Get them off me! Get them off me!

602
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,480
Baby, quit spreading that honey all over your face.

603
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,800
No chemicals, no pesticides, no electricity.

604
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,520
The Fly Eater, world's best fly trap.

605
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,360
Works continuously day or night, outdoors or indoors.

606
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,780
Shovel away buckets, gallons of flies, lures flies inside and they cannot escape.

607
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,300
Works automatically 24 hours a day.

608
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,100
Cleanest and most effective fly trap you've ever seen or your money back.

609
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,920
Plastic lid, fits standard size, fruit jar, mayonnaise, pickle jar.

610
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,300
Yeah, the show stinks all right, but at least it keeps the flies off this watermelon.

611
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,080
...flowers of flies and storm leading in hours of fun watching us explode.

612
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,600
No electric bill.

613
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,060
No competition.

614
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,680
Well, that doesn't sound like a very good California show.

615
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,960
Let's try another one here.

616
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,340
They're just fiddling with flies there.

617
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,840
Let's try this show.

618
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,620
...lead of smooth, finished metal.

619
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,320
Uh-oh.

620
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:45,860
At their feet, the ledge dropped away into a chasm so deep they could not see the bottom.

621
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:53,120
Beyond was only a glare so bright that their eyes could not stand to look into it.

622
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,000
The King's Soul.

623
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:00,440
Broadcasting live from Bob's Country Bunker in Weott, California.

624
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:06,740
I'm brought to you by the worldwide radio outreach ministries of the Church of the Subgenius

625
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,080
and the supporters of KHSU.

626
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,700
And KHSU.

627
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:12,640
What?

628
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,600
...flashing a message.

629
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,520
Bob?

630
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,680
Oh, we've heard all this stuff before.

631
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,360
Unfortunately, you're listening to what I normally do before the shows.

632
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,420
Normally, I go through the text.

633
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:30,420


634
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,700
I go through the tapes before the show and listen to them to see if they're any good.

635
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,620
That's why the show is often so good.

636
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,100
Sorry about this one.

637
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:38,920
What?

638
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,500
...and say to your genitals, in your mind, relax.

639
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,240
...baby, baby.

640
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,040
Baby, baby.

641
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,860
Baby, baby.

642
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,480
Baby, baby.

643
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:52,840
Baby, baby.

644
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,020
Three, two, and one.

645
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,920
...and one, one, one.

646
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,840
Two, two, and one.

647
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:01,840


648
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:01,840


649
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:01,840


650
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:01,840


651
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:01,840


652
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:01,840


653
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:01,840


654
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:01,840


655
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:01,840


656
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,640
Superior Mutants, repent.

657
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,400
Quit your job.

658
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,880
Slack off.

659
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,100
Yeah, you've heard that one before, too.

660
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,760
The world ends tomorrow.

661
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,820
And you...

662
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,040
Oh my god!

663
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,240
That's good enough to...

664
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,340
I can't, can you believe those...

665
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,300
Well, no problem.

666
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,600
Everybody's heard that old subgenius saw a million times.

667
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:29,380
Okay, okay, why am I even bothering trying to queue up tapes?

668
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,080
while doing the show.

669
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,540
Man, it's not that I don't value the time on the air.

670
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,480
It's really not that.

671
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,400
It's simply that we've been so damnably busy, you know?

672
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,760
Too much emergentile and not enough rewardian.

673
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,460
And, you know, for the rewardian type of subgenius,

674
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,600
he only has to know that he can accomplish something,

675
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,980
and that alone is enough.

676
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,220
It's better than achieving it, than actually doing it.

677
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:08,320
But depending on the balance of emergentile that that rewardian might have in him,

678
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,820
you're not just all rewardian or all emergentile.

679
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,980
Well, Bob may be all rewardian,

680
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,900
but nobody could survive being all rewardian.

681
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,560
But depending on the balance of how much emergentile a person might have in him,

682
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,140
the amount of phylos that he accrues by procrastinating

683
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,800
could be offset by the number of stangs he suffers

684
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,120
through guilt or punishment.

685
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,060
It's the dynamic tension between guilt and blow-off

686
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,500
which marks the true life of the subgenius

687
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,700
as opposed to the false life of the pinks.

688
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,700
The pinks.

689
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,380
I love to say that word in the most demeaning and derogatory way.

690
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,100
The pinks.

691
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,340
You know, and that's not even derogatory enough, dear friends.

692
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,560
I'm trying to get out of the habit of calling the normals, the mediocritans,

693
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,540
those...

694
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,180
you know, those things

695
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,100
the pinks

696
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,600
or the pink boys.

697
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,980
For one thing, people get the wrong idea lately.

698
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,440
They've been...

699
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,320
In England, particularly, they were going,

700
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,920
man, people think you're talking about gays.

701
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,640
Or they thought, they'll think you're talking about commies.

702
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,840
You know, like Pinko.

703
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,640
Pink boy as if pink.

704
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,120
And it's a no, no, no, no, no.

705
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,600
We are talking about the pinkness of the...

706
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,220
their spirit, dear friends.

707
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,800
A lackluster...

708
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,640
just sad, sad, pathetic...

709
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,200
The pink.

710
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,900
That is a much more derogatory way to say it.

711
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,160
From now on, I think we're going to try to say...

712
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,020
We'll refer to the faults of the pink...

713
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,140
as him.

714
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,020
Instead of saying what's wrong with them,

715
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,500
we'll say what's wrong with him.

716
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,180
The pink.

717
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,980
He is...

718
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,720
The pink is a...

719
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,640
but a...

720
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,180
well...

721
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,280
he is...

722
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,480
he is but a but

723
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,440
of the great joke of the conspiracy

724
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,380
which he, the pink himself,

725
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,860
has put in place there to lord it over him.

726
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,440
It's the natural inferiority of the pink, man.

727
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,440
There's going to be a chapter in the new book called

728
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,260
Man and the Subgenius.

729
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,080
So people get...

730
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,880
know that there's a difference.

731
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,260
The first time Dr. Philo Drummond and I...

732
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,700
were ever on a radio talk show of any kind.

733
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,140
It was the first time we were ever on the radio.

734
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,240
It was Mr. Opinion's show on KFJZ way back when.

735
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,200
I remember it must have been like down to 1980.

736
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,040
And Mr. Opinion was a guest host.

737
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,020
The regular host never would have had us on.

738
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,340
But we talked about our religion, Bob's new religion,

739
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,360
and the message of slack,

740
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,640
how people weren't getting enough of it.

741
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,860
And this old...

742
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,800
Caesar called up and said,

743
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,780
well, this is just the sickest...

744
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,820
This is terrible.

745
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,240
I'm not ever going to listen to KFJZ no more.

746
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,920
He goes,

747
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,480
he goes, this is just the sickest thing.

748
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,400
And the host, Mr. Opinion,

749
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,460
said,

750
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:19,040
what, sir, you don't think people should start their own religions?

751
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,640
And the man said, and I quote,

752
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,020
oh, people, yeah, people, sure.

753
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,240
But this,

754
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,960
this is the sickest, sickest, sickest thing I've ever seen on KFJZ.

755
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,420
And at least he caught on, dear friends,

756
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,380
on what we were saying,

757
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,500
that we were saying we're not people.

758
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,740
We consider people to be a disposable commodity,

759
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,060
whereas we are a non-disposable life form.

760
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,780
That's all it is.

761
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,660
It's as simple as that.

762
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,220
And for that matter,

763
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,820
I mean to get on to something with you folks now.

764
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,560
Subgeniuses, it says right here in Book of the Subgenius,

765
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,140
you subgeniuses should be...

766
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,340
fruitful, fruitful and multiply instead of wimping out.

767
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,700
Oh, I wouldn't be a fit parent.

768
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,380
I'm from a dysfunctional family.

769
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,920
I don't want to bring a child into this awful world.

770
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,440
Oh, there's overpopulation.

771
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:15,780
Subgeniuses that say that are proven they don't have the true Yeti blood.

772
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,780
It's been tainted somehow and they probably shouldn't have kids,

773
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,600
but not for the reasons they're thinking.

774
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,760
They shouldn't have kids because they've been tainted by the human, by the pink.

775
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,740
And they lack the instinct.

776
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,180
That's where they're not subgenius.

777
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,120
They lack instinct.

778
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:36,380
At least they're subgenius enough to recognize that their genes are not fit for the master race.

779
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,780
The race that comes...

780
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:44,620
that is the master race because it comes in all sexes, all colors, all races and creeds.

781
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,140
And these people have sullied, you know.

782
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:54,580
Well, at least they've declined from providing their watered-down genetics.

783
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:54,920
So, what are they?

784
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,300
They're just a stock of genetic stock to the future of the subgenius race.

785
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,160
For the mark of the subgenius is its vitality.

786
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,940
Its vitality and its urge to procreate.

787
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:10,280
Because the instincts run more pure in the subgenius.

788
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,800
They're maybe closer to the animal,

789
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,700
but they're more beneficial in the long run to the subgenius species.

790
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,860
You see, it's not this cold bloodless intellectual thing.

791
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,560
That's why we can't help being politically incorrect.

792
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,760
I mean, I'm sorry, we can't stop and intellectually moralize over what we're doing.

793
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,180
Because, dear friends, here in this church,

794
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,520
we like to follow our glands instead of the man in blue.

795
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,500
Get my meaning?

796
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,880
You know, this is a great song, but this isn't the one I was gonna play.

797
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,440
What a shame. That would have been such a dramatic, uh...

798
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,260
That would have been such a dramatic little segue.

799
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,640
It would have meant, been almost like I meant to do it, but...

800
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,600
Like I say.

801
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,300
It's the vitality, dear friends. It's the urge.

802
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,800
That makes you a subgenius, so...

803
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:21,840
I'm sorry.

804
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:21,840


805
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:21,840


806
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,980
Don't, don't, um, don't ignore that, okay?

807
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,760
I can make you go snap, snap, snap.

808
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,640
Lovin' can be an act.

809
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,100
I can make you go crack, crack, crack.

810
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,840
Lovin' can be an act.

811
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,460
I can eat up your treats like this.

812
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,200
Gonna feel healthy, gonna feel fine.

813
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,520
One metachronism's by my mind.

814
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,720
Don't worry about me, there's plenty of time.

815
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,440
There's plenty of time for everything.

816
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,260
Gotta feel healthy, gotta feel fine.

817
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,480
Got metachronism's by my mind.

818
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,600
Hopefully everything.

819
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:19,620
Ch strategy.

820
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:19,960
It's just fine, it's fine forever.

821
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,580
Don't steal my food, don't steal my food.

822
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:21,620
Look here, here...

823
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:21,620


824
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:21,820
Only topic is the subject of the interview.

825
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:21,820


826
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:21,820


827
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,960
Well, that's all well and good.

828
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,140
That's, um, what is that, KMFDM.

829
00:43:54,060 --> 00:44:00,140
But, and I just, I realized I wanted to spend this last 15 minutes sharing with you the mail.

830
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,900
See, this is another thing I normally don't do on the show is answer, read the mail.

831
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:14,020
But I happen to open, we do occasionally get stuff sent to the station rather than the subgenius post office box,

832
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,540
which number I will give in a little while.

833
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,260
So have that pencil ready.

834
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,980
Um, but we did get, oh, this is good, good Bible music.

835
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,740
We'll put Bible music behind this.

836
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,200
Is this, we got a piece here.

837
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:31,900
Bob, maybe I shouldn't give the real name of this dear listener in the colony, Texas.

838
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,160
The colony, an hour of slack fan.

839
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Oh, oh, that's who sent it.

840
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,340
Reverend Dave.

841
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,360
Let's call him Reverend Dave.

842
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,500
I recognize the name from the pledge list.

843
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,880
You know, you're the only listeners that mean a damn.

844
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,880
Thing to us.

845
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:55,240
You know that the ones that pledge and that send us nice things.

846
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,760
And this is from the Denton County association for rational morality.

847
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,260
And I think I should give you the, their address later at the end of this too.

848
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,700
And this little pamphlet is titled.

849
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:12,420
The Bible is a horrible book to use as a moral foundation.

850
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,060
I just got to looking through this.

851
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,700
Some of our well-intentioned neighbors are trying to impose.

852
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:23,460
Fundamentalist biblical morality into our schools, libraries, and governments.

853
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,420
Some of our well-intentioned neighbors.

854
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,620
Yeah.

855
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,720
Most of them, unfortunately.

856
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,080
Most of them seem to go along with the religious.

857
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:33,560
That's what.

858
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,720
Why must you Republicans kowtow to the religious nuts?

859
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:40,940
That just don't.

860
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,100
God, that just makes me sick.

861
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,740
You'd think.

862
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,800
You'd think that Republicans would.

863
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,540
You know.

864
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:52,320
I mean, they're heartless rationalists that they're supposed to be, right?

865
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,480
Oh, God.

866
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,180
Well, anyway.

867
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,520
As it says here.

868
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,820
Well, this guy just pointed out certain.

869
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:03,120
Because the Bible, you know, is to be taken literally.

870
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,680
It is all literally true.

871
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:11,140
And as such, in Deuteronomy 22, 12, it says you must sew tassels on your clothes.

872
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,480
You must tassels friends.

873
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,680
Maybe get that needle and thread ready.

874
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,500
Women are not to wear men's clothing.

875
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,300
Okay.

876
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,200
No paint.

877
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,680
I don't want to see no more subgenius women wearing paint.

878
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,700
Eunuchs cannot go to church.

879
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:32,100
And as Pope Bob Wilson has pointed out so many times, you cannot be a priest unless

880
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,240
you have a willy.

881
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,620
Only a person who possesses a willy can be a priest in the Catholic Church.

882
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,380
Because in the Catholic Church, women are not human.

883
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,940
In fact, most hardcore Christians don't believe women are fully human.

884
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,780
They cannot have short hair.

885
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,860
Men cannot have long hair.

886
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,960
Man, I am just really going to be in a lot of trouble here.

887
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,180
Wet dreams are a sin.

888
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,260
Bastards and his descendants are not to go to church.

889
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,720
What a loving.

890
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,920
And this is the word of the Lord, friends.

891
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:12,080
This is transcribed exactly by old men of great integrity, I'm sure.

892
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,820
Oh, that was Corinthian.

893
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,260
1 Corinthians 11, 15.

894
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,760
Women cannot have short hair.

895
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,040
Men must not wear hats while praying or prophesying.

896
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,780
Well, I'm okay there, because I don't pray, and I never wear a hat when I prophesy.

897
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,120
You know why I don't pray?

898
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:34,080
Because I figure that the, well, number one, nobody's listening.

899
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,560
But on the other hand, you know, what is listening?

900
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,100
I don't want to attract its attention.

901
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,180
It's bad enough already, man.

902
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,300
Anyway.

903
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:45,820


904
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:49,720
Let's go to Leviticus 19, 19.

905
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,280
For all I know, this might be Leviathan 19, 19.

906
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,540
Leviticus 19, 19.

907
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,320
Must not crossbreed farm animals.

908
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,940
Don't crossbreed farm animals.

909
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,000
And don't crossbreed.

910
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,500
It doesn't say anything about crossbreeding with farm animals.

911
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,820
And do not wear clothes made with mixed fabrics.

912
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,440
Hear that, Pope S. Cecilia?

913
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,760
You've been making subgenius shirts that are 50-50.

914
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,580
50% polyester, 50% cotton.

915
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,060
It's non-biblical.

916
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,260
Women are not to braid their hair or wear any jewelry.

917
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,340
Now, what does Tammy Faye Baker have to say about that, hmm?

918
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,860
You must not trim your sideburns or beard.

919
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,520
Okay, I'm in trouble on that one.

920
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,600
You must not eat rabbit, ham, bacon, oysters, clams, or shrimp.

921
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,680
I guess he ain't going to be at that rabbit supper with us, is he?

922
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,080
That's Leviticus.

923
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,260
Leviticus 14, 35.

924
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:42,200
Alert the priest if mildew forms in your house.

925
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,660
Leviticus 19, 13.

926
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:49,200
You must pay your employees at the end of every work shift.

927
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,260
Oh, no, I wish Will hadn't heard that one.

928
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,440
Leviticus 19, 26.

929
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,360
Must not eat rare steak.

930
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,520
My daughter's going to go to hell for eating that rare steak.

931
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,860
Tattoos are a sin.

932
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,820
Couples having sex during the menstrual flow are to be exiled.

933
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,620
Exiled, dear friends.

934
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,240
My red wings for the first time.

935
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,160
Okay, real estate.

936
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,740
That was sold reverts back to its original owner every 50 years.

937
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,200
But the original owner's dead after 50 years.

938
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,040
And if biblical moralists don't...

939
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,660
How great thou art, dear friends.

940
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,320
If biblical moralists don't follow the Bible, okay?

941
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,640
Why the volume control on this?

942
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,420
You know, they tell us not to refer...

943
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,140
When you're doing a radio show, the rules are done.

944
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,540
Don't criticize the station equipment.

945
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:48,180
Don't gripe about the microphones falling apart.

946
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,600
Don't be unprofessional.

947
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,900
Unless you really are so professional, then you can do it.

948
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,060
Sort of like Picasso, you know?

949
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,680
He had to learn how to draw first before he could break all the rules.

950
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,480
That's what they always say.

951
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,040
Personally, I wonder if he ever learned how to draw.

952
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:06,760
But I'm not qualified to critique modern art.

953
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,520
I guess I'm just missing something.

954
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,300
I guess I'm just missing something.

955
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,460
It must have gone by me.

956
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,180
Must have gone right by me.

957
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:13,960
Okay, let's see.

958
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,080
Back on the biblical thing here.

959
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,080
I love the Bible.

960
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,040
Samuel 13.

961
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,360
A tale...

962
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,160
Oh, these are just bits in the Bible.

963
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,660
Tales of rape and revenge.

964
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:28,240
Let's see.

965
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:34,800
Extramarital intercourse can be resolved by paying the woman's father 50 silver shekels.

966
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:38,380
That's no problem, except they don't make shekels anymore.

967
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:43,100
A barren wife can offer her handmaid...

968
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,000
...to bear a child.

969
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:48,220
See, they were ahead of their time back then as surrogate wives and things.

970
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:50,380
Um...

971
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:59,200
David cut the foreskins off of 200 dead Philistines and used them to buy a wife.

972
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:03,740
See, a woman is worth 200 foreskins.

973
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:08,200
There's a section in the Bible called the Hill of Foreskins.

974
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,720
Abraham pimped his wife to Pharaoh.

975
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:18,600
A childless widow's brother-in-law is required to marry and impregnate her.

976
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,220
That's Deuteronomy.

977
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,480
Genesis.

978
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,280
Abraham's wife was actually his sister.

979
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:37,300
Lot offers his daughter in an attempt to appease his neighbor's lusts in Genesis 19.48.

980
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,200
Well, that's...

981
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,940
He couldn't help it, though, because they were going to kill everybody if he didn't.

982
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,760
But, I mean, really, can you imagine that?

983
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,720
In Judges, an old man offers his daughter and visitor's wife to appease his neighbor's lusts.

984
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:59,040
In Samuel, homosexual love passing the love of women happens between David and Jonathan.

985
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,300
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

986
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:09,460
And I thought that they all were clean hetero guys like that blonde, blue-eyed Jesus picture, you know?

987
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,420
According to Exodus,

988
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,880
fathers may sell their daughters into slavery.

989
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,160
You hear that, Sivit?

990
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,180
Um...

991
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,220
Oh, here's how to test a woman for adultery.

992
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,180
Okay?

993
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,460
According to Numbers,

994
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:29,340
if a woman gets sick after being forced to drink floor sweepings,

995
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,640
then she is guilty.

996
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,900
Women cannot be teachers,

997
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,500
cannot have any authority over men.

998
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,100
See, my wife's out of a job.

999
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,380
Uh,

1000
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,540
you can take and dispose of captured women as wives.

1001
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:45,380
Uh,

1002
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,620
women who do not bleed on their wedding night can be put to death.

1003
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:54,280
They don't have to be put to death, but you can kill her if she, if it doesn't hurt her.

1004
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,700
In other words, if she doesn't scream, you can kill her.

1005
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:03,380
No one will gainsay you if they're a true believer in the word of God as written in the Bible.

1006
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,060
That's all I'm saying here, friends.

1007
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,060
If you're gonna...

1008
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,660
Well, really, I shouldn't be doing that.

1009
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,760
I mean, it's not like I'm...

1010
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,820
There's not any believers listening, probably, anyway.

1011
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,760
And if they are, they're just, you know, nasty, just hate...

1012
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,620
Just waiting to catch us doing something.

1013
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,520
It's sort of...

1014
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,640
I guess it's sort of like the reason that I enjoy listening to preachers.

1015
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:29,400
On the radio, for real Christians, I'll listen to that stuff.

1016
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,020
I just...

1017
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,180
I'm...

1018
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:34,600
It's like the most entertaining thing in the world.

1019
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:39,380
You sit there, and it's just so enjoyable to listen to them and think to yourself,

1020
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,960
some people are dumb enough to believe this guy.

1021
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,680
He probably doesn't.

1022
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,200
And I'm sure that there are people listening now who are like going,

1023
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,260
I just enjoy listening to this guy dig himself deeper and deeper into hell.

1024
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,860
Well, you're gonna have the last laugh.

1025
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,640
But what if there's no hell, man?

1026
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,400
Your whole life's been based on a fairy tale.

1027
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,880
All those things you could have done but didn't do.

1028
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:08,580
You're gonna wake up, up to your neck, in false religion, friend.

1029
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:13,000
False slack, false jobs, and false sex.

1030
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,780
And you're gonna go, I could have had slack.

1031
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,820
And I'm so old, I'm about to die.

1032
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,040
I blew it.

1033
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,560
I'm a dumbass.

1034
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,540
That's what you're gonna do.

1035
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,740
And I'm gonna agree with you.

1036
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,400
It's a great thing.

1037
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,340
It's a beautiful thing.

1038
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:29,020
And you can write for more information on how stupid everybody else is,

1039
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,820
and how clever and wonderful we are.

1040
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,240
See, this is the way all religions work.

1041
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,900
Understand, we're getting to the meat of it.

1042
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,560
The sense of delusion of grace.

1043
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,560
The grandeur of persecution.

1044
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,220
The paranoia.

1045
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,880
And the Bible.

1046
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,740
Dear friends, you got it all right there.

1047
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:55,820
Write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1048
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,080
I'm gonna give that number again.

1049
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,780
How many times have I said this?

1050
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:05,980
Post Office Box 140306, in Dallas, Texas.

1051
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,920
Zip code 75214.

1052
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,800
And that's the number to write for free information about the Church of the Subgenius.

1053
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,400
Amen.

1054
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,880
But, by the same token,

1055
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,160
I'm gonna give off the address for the Denton County Association for Rational Morality.

1056
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,340
And you can get this little booklet I've been reading from

1057
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:35,960
that explains all the things that you can be killed for.

1058
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,040
According to the Bible.

1059
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:48,560
That number is Post Office Box 560834, The Colony, Texas.

1060
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:51,800
75056.

1061
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,260
75056.

1062
00:55:54,660 --> 00:56:00,740
The death penalty is, according to Exodus, mostly,

1063
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,900
you can be killed for striking one of your parents,

1064
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,540
for stealing a slave,

1065
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,460
for cursing one of your parents,

1066
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,600
for being a rebellious son,

1067
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,260
for being a homosexual,

1068
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,960
for adultery,

1069
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,920
for witchcraft,

1070
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,980
and I'm not sure how they define that, dear friends,

1071
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,700
for following other religions,

1072
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,660
aside from the one that this was written for.

1073
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:32,440
By the way, this is Judaism, not Christianity, originally.

1074
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:33,580
So, are you...

1075
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,540
Man, I just don't see how people can...

1076
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,720
And blasphemy, that's the other thing.

1077
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,500
Oh my gosh, blasphemy.

1078
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,180
That's the only sin I've ever done.

1079
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,580
And they'll probably kill me for it.

1080
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,980
And I've done plenty of that.

1081
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,900
I dare God to strike me dead right now.

1082
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,800
I shouldn't do that.

1083
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:51,680
Now, people have...

1084
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,220
A preacher once did that and died.

1085
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,760
Lightning struck the guy.

1086
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,860
But, some...

1087
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,020
And the tape's running.

1088
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,380
This is the perfect time, man.

1089
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,540
Go ahead.

1090
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:05,000
If all my...

1091
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,240
Lord, Lord, strike me dead if you're offended by anything I've said

1092
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,940
about you, to you, or whatever.

1093
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,100
Uh-oh.

1094
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,580
The little light flashed.

1095
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,620
But that just means the next show is here.

1096
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,840
Well, it's been a different kind of a show tonight.

1097
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,120
Not much background.

1098
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,120
Same old background music, if any.

1099
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,260
No tapes queued up.

1100
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,280
Tried to queue them up while the show was on.

1101
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,080
But they just...

1102
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,940
I don't know.

1103
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,980
But I have these three clippings in front of me.

1104
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:40,700
It's the last two minutes here.

1105
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,240
I want to get this out.

1106
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,600
Now, it says here...

1107
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,980
This is all from the Dallas Morning News, by the way.

1108
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,640
This is not from some kooky thing.

1109
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,880
But according to the newspaper, um...

1110
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,600
Bush wants more CIA data on the nation's economic policies.

1111
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,840
They don't want the budget chopped in peacetime.

1112
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,300
Did I talk about this last time?

1113
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,300
But...

1114
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:04,040
When you read between the lines on these news things, it's so wonderful.

1115
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:13,200
Well, the Russians aren't around to do battle with, so how are they going to...

1116
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,220
Did I do the talk about this?

1117
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,620
Did Dr. Gordon and I...

1118
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:26,480
Mr. Gates did not elaborate, but Russia, China, France, and Japan, those bad guys, cheaters, not like us,

1119
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,820
they are among those suspected of attempted economic espionage.

1120
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:36,520
And that's what the CIA is going to do, is strictly work on economic espionage.

1121
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:40,600
Now, they're not going to work for American companies against their foreign competitors.

1122
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,300
Oh, no, no, no, no, never, never.

1123
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:50,760
But the role of U.S. business, plainly put, is to size up foreign competitors' trade secrets,

1124
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,140
marketing strategies, and bid proposals.

1125
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,960
Now, of course, they wouldn't sell these to American companies,

1126
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:00,340
the CIA wouldn't, if they found out.

1127
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,120
Why would they want to know this stuff, then?

1128
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:10,920
You know, and the second one here, Schultz and Weinberger are being queried about the Iran-Contra thing

1129
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:18,060
and the October surprise, when they may, may, possibly, nobody's going to say for sure, you know,

1130
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:25,300
but possibly, maybe, those hostages were kept the extra day or so,

1131
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:26,020
so that...

1132
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,760
Reagan could be elected, Carter would look bad, you know,

1133
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:34,040
I mean, it was just another few weeks for the hostages, and my gosh, you know, all of that.

1134
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,620
But, this is the punchline.

1135
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,720
This, the third clipping.

1136
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,800
Bush tops Clinton in poll on trust.

1137
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:49,120
President Bush is considered trustworthy, most or all of the time, by nearly half of Americans surveyed.

1138
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:56,200
Because he ran the dirty tricks department of the CIA for all those years, and has, I mean,

1139
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:01,540
all of his best buddies have been at least dirtied pretty bad.

1140
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:08,840
But, no, no, they, but President Bush is a, he wouldn't go running around on his wife like Clinton might have.

1141
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:17,760
Oh, jeez, you know, so, overall, 49% thought that Mr. Bush has done a good job of maintaining honesty

1142
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:25,880
and integrity in his administration, whereas Mr. Clinton got caught in the backseat or someplace,

1143
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:35,240
with this little chippy, and, well, I'd much rather have somebody who knows all the guys that killed Kennedy

1144
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:43,720
and got away with it as leading my country than somebody who can't even get away with, you know, a quickie and,

1145
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,960
oh, friends, what?

1146
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:54,580
It's sort of like that world where heroin is legal on every street corner, but coffee,

1147
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:58,700
it'll put you in jail for 50 years for having a cup.

1148
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,600
Praise Bob.

1149
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,240
There's plenty of time for everything.

1150
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:34,140
I'm gonna feel healthy, gonna feel fine.

1151
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:42,560
I'm gonna love the time you're in for, it's my, my, my, love it, love it, love it, love it.

1152
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,540
Don't worry about me, there's plenty of time.

1153
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,260
There's plenty of time for everything.

1154
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:08,380
I'm gonna feel so well.

1155
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:14,040
I'm gonna feel so well.
