Yowl Slack!
Yowl Slack!
Uh, yes, dear friends.
Well, as you can probably tell from this horrible music in the background, it's going to be a Suzy the Flusie show.
Yes, you're in luck.
And I'm out of time and town.
And Reverend Suzy the Flusie, for her incredible show, Bob's Slap Time Funhouse on the Atlanta station, WREK, greatest college radio station in the universe.
She put together one of her special collages.
In fact, this one is so special that it's a two-parter.
And we're just going to barely get through part one tonight.
Friends, it's Suzy the Flusie's treatment of Michael Jackson.
And O.J. Simpson.
It's the Michael Jackson, O.J. Simpson Hell Spree Show from Reverend Suzy.
Suzy the Flusie.
The listener should be prepared for an almost unremitting scathing indictment of what took place in this case.
Sure.
And how people can twist.
The truth.
Twist.
Twist.
Twist.
Twist.
The truth.
Every time he said anything was twisted around his town in Basilica.
And how.
The conduct of virtually everyone associated with this case was deplorable.
Now listen, I'm bringing you to stay with Michael Jackson for a few days.
Isn't that cute?
He heard of you.
For some, it may be a warm meal.
For some, it may be just a little bit of love.
I promise you, if you come along, it will make you feel good.
And it will be so much fun.
Can we go, Dad?
Can we, can we, can we?
Take a lease, can we?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
A child would know that publicly treating Michael Jackson like forbidden fruit could only serve to titillate a child's interest in it and get them to buy it.
Thank you, Mother.
Yay!
I look forward to working with you children.
Fasten your seat belts, kids.
He comes from a place.
Beyond the stars.
To take them to a world beyond their dreams.
This Saturday, for one night only, your life will be changed forever.
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Springfield Speedway, Speedway, Speedway.
More stories of car crunching, fire breathing, prehistoric insanity.
From his soul comes the music.
From his heart comes the beat.
Now, from the imagination of Michael Jackson.
One night only.
One night only.
One night only.
Springfield Speedway.
This Saturday.
You've missed this.
You'd better be dead.
And if you're in jail, free.
Now.
One night only.
One night only.
One night only.
One night only.
One night only.
One night only.



Jackson.
Nothing could prepare you for Moonwalkers.
You don't know it now, but I started you on the road to somewhere very special.
I always wanted to be a celebrity.
I love you with all my heart.
Well, it doesn't matter.
I mean, they're blaming you anyway.
When I was your age, I had six gold records.
You know, my dad says you're going to end up dead.
I'm with your father.
What?
Betty Jean, I'd like to help you.
Yeah, I wouldn't have a problem with it.
Amen.
Watch it.
This one, this one, this one, this.
Here, this one.
And this one.
God, I think I blew this one.
This one.
What a cute little...
Little body he has.
Who the hell are you?
Michael Jackson.
The Michael Jackson?
No way.
It's true.
You are Michael Jackson.
This is his sister.
When can I get a diaphragm?
He knows you're looking at her.
My mind doesn't run that way.
Can I come, Betty Jean?
No, it's not for sex.
But I love miniature golf.
Please, can I stay with you?
I'm sorry.
It's not where my heart is.
I will slit my wrist first.
Why?
Because he's a fucker.
That's how I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I always talk like that.
Oh, honey, don't be so naive.
That's how the world works.
Who's naive?
I didn't say anything.
Betty Jean would do it just the way you know.
I'm done.
Send him home.
All right, girl.
Get on your feet.
Come on.
Ow!
Ow!
Watch your hands.
Bring in the children.
Yay!
Let me in.
Come on, open the door.
Bart, think.
What happens to you when you turn eight?
I'm only ten.
That's good.
When I was ten years old, I used to go on these tours with my brothers to Jackson 5.
And I'd hear these crazy stories that these girls would claim my brothers had relationships with them,
which they didn't, and that they were going to have their children.
And I thought that to be so strange and so crazy.
Now, don't you worry.
We all get scared once in a while.
Maybe I can help you.
The two of us need look no more.
We need...
We both found what we were looking for.
With a friend to call my own.
I'll never be alone.
And you, my friend, will see.
You've got a friend in me.
Just leave me alone.
You'd be amazed how often I hear that.
Uh-huh.
Bart.
Oh?
Manhandle me very roughly.
Maybe that'll help.
No way.
Look, Bart.
Don't you ever feel that way?
You just want to just let it all out?
No, thanks.
Why not?
Don't you want everyone to see what a responsible babysitter you were?
Of course.
If you want me, you gotta catch me.
Almost.
Oh, so close.
Prepare for a funeral.
Hey, Bart.
Hey, you.
That's really overdoing it.
Oh, no.
I'm going to preserve the evidence until Mom and Dad get home.
What should I be wearing?
And you'll never babysit?
I'm afraid not, Bart.
How do you like the smell?
Is it good?
I'm going to die.
Well, what's wrong with sharing your bed?
Make me.
Suffer, little children.
You kissed me.
I said, you have to climb a tree.
That's part of boyhood.
You just got to do it.
Wait, wait.
Make me.
Sometimes the only thing we can do is scream.
Bart!
Hello, you fucker.
I'm going to stay alive.
Your body starts to shiver.
For no mere mortal can resist the evil of the thriller.
Ah!
What the hell?
I wish they wouldn't scream.
We don't need no molestation.
Come here, Macaulay.
I want to share my bed with you.
We don't need no pedophiles.
Here, drink this wine and take these sleeping pills.
No child abductions in the bedroom.
This will be our little secret.
Don't tell mom.
Michael, leave them kids alone.
No, don't press charges.
Here, I'll give you 25 million.
Hey, Michael, leave them kids alone.
I'm going to sleep.
Oh!

Don't tell mom.



All in all, you're just a prick who has that song, off the wall.
All in all, you're just a broken pukileks doll.
If you don't drink this wine and sleeping pills, you can't have any pudding.
How can you eat my meat, and then put on the charges.
I got real depressing.
The W threadil mom, got me brain Rashows.
Rememberation.

I just loved becoming a monster because it gave me a chance to pretty much become someone
else.
It was just fun hiding behind this mask, just really letting this part of your body out.
And it was just thrilling for me to make that.
And the dance and all the morphing and all the fun things that we did.
It's so memorable.
I'm afraid you'll hurt me again.
Why not?
The love of children is the root of all evil, as you know.
Yeah, right.
When I see children, I think sex.
That's why I love them so much.
If you're going to be a pedophile, why not?
It's all right.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I was such a jerk last night.
What's the big worry?
I don't know.
Even if I did do anything sexual to a child, it's okay.
They enjoy it in a pure, loving, fun way.
What?
Woo!
I love you, man.
If they have a sick mind, yeah.
Do you have any food?

Do you have any corn here?
Of course.
Of course.
This one's on me.
Maybe later I can get on you.
Sure.
Who?
When I first saw him, no eyebrows, no eyelashes.
You're knocking me off of my feet now, Debbie.
He was totally fast.
He keeps me from sleeping at night.
So you know what I give?
Gift him?
Absolutely, yeah.
That's happened many times.
He never gave me a list.
What are you going to do?
I can't quite say, but it has to do with money.
Yeah, right.
Bread.
Bread.
Bread.








Oh.
Come on.
Go nuts.
What time is it?
Can you just give me a spanking?
Call the parents.
Send them home.
Hey, what's the rush?
Oh, my special little guy.
Are you okay?
Uh-uh.
Please make sure he doesn't tell anybody.
Oh, for crying out loud.
Oh, Tyler.
















I firmly swear I will not tell another living soul.
Sucker.
There's no such thing as a soul.
It's just something they made up to scare kids, like the Boogeyman or Michael Jackson.
Hello.
Millhouse?
Can you keep a secret?
No.
Oh, well, who cares?
Michael Jackson?
Michael Jackson!
Meanwhile.
This is one of me.
Throughout my life, I have dissected and manipulated thousands upon thousands of children, cancer
kids, leukemia kids.
Oh, no.
I'm not a cancer kid.
I'm a child.
Okay, if you say so.
But I will never stop helping and loving people, the way Jesus said to us.
He said,
You've got to be crazy enough to do it, kid.
It was as if he felt that this one little messy incident shouldn't be held against him.
After all, he was still Michael Jackson, wasn't he?
And that'd be your happy hero, cause you'd be happy.
That would make a difference in the lives of those you didn't love and crackers.










Ah, a little .



Hot straight about.
I'm annoyed, Brother said to me.
I'd be so hot, yeah
For the sale price of a press release
Success can still be bought
I'd sit so tall
They'd plug me in a wheelchair
And they'd push me down the hall
I'd play a song for dying kids
Your eyes would start to tear
That would be the tip
To bolster my career
And I'd be your happy hero
And I'd sell another song
And after viewing my big heart
You'd have me going strong
I'd play a gentle lover
In a movie for TV
So I'd deserve your pity
When my wife divorces me
If someone told, no
Accused of f***ing teenage boys
And beating others cold
You'd side with me
And enough of you would doubt it
Which would likely set me free
And enough of you would doubt it
You'd say I didn't do it
And that anyone could tell
Cause he's smooth and smart and pretty
And he reads his lines so well
And to be your happy hero
I'd just sing another verse
The more I sang
The more you would
Relieve me of my curse
Release me from your conscience
And I'd bring down the floor
I'd sell you Pepsi from the stage
And get extreme for more
And I'd sing another verse
And get a war.
Hey Barch
Barch?
Oh I'm getting forceful
But gay you wouldn't
I've never seen him like this
He has the demented melancholy of a Tennessee Williams heroine
Don't you think I know that?
He thinks you're gay
He thinks I'm gay?!
Ahh!!
Gay?!
Hot stuff coming through
Get him out of his closet
Out of his closet
Closet
Everybody back down
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Give me the new life
That's so gay
Oh, be nice
Give me the new life
Everybody back down
There goes the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality
Everybody back down
Why would anybody want to touch a girl's butt?
Seems kind of gay, kind of gay
That won't my mood
Gay again?
He prefers the company of men
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
It's camp!
Hold on, Bart
Everything's gonna be just fine
And by this time tomorrow we'll all be a happy family
Happy, happy, happy family
911
Hello
Oh my God
You shank
Oh
How could you tell on me?
Hold on, Bart
Oh
I'll let you ride the lawnmower through the house
Did you stop because I said to?
This is all like a bad dream
Oh, yeah, I see
Uh-huh, goodbye
I'm not saying that nobody likes the boy
I cherish a fond affection for him myself
Thanks
Funny
Please refrain from testing the knob
But that doesn't mean to say
What, what, what, what, what, what, what?
My son and I don't get along real well
And he knows he can screw me
Yes, sir
I believe he did
I would have liked to seen that
The Jacko has once again been accused of child molestation
An eerie deja vu
It was almost as if it was deja vu
As if it happened yesterday
Michael Jackson
Michael Jackson
Michael Jackson
Michael Jackson
Jack Jackson!
Michael Jackson!
Jack Jackson!

The yeah?
Are you kidding me?
What in the hell are you doing?
$2,000
Why would they lie?
What would they have to gain?
Hello, this is Michael Jackson
I know you're lonesome
But listen
You are not alone
So take the telephone
Call me every time
Oh, baby, hold the line
Oh, you are not alone





and to tell me everything to the little answering machine
after the hee-hee, hee-hee.
You awful man, stay away from my son.
You know, Lanshan, it's your word against my son's.
We're going to have a little arrangement, a layaway plan.
You think this is all a game?
Your money lets you get away with anything.
It's right down your bill, ma'am.
Damn near killed him.
$608.
That includes parts, labor, paint, and cash.
I'm going to have your ass burnt.
Your name dragged through the papers for so many years.
Everyone will know what a fake you are.
Bet you drive them boys crazy, don't you?
With your little smile and your little teeth.
Boy, I'll see you in jail.
Your monkey bit my kid again.
Bubbles, it's going to be a long night.
They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get.
His word against a bunch of crazy kids.
He's going to lie.
It's all his fault.
You think just because you act young,
why you can walk in here and make off with whatever you like.
Let me tell you something.
You're a fake.
You're no jive, kid.
You're just scared to act your age.
Buy yourself a mirror sometime and take a look in it.
Won't be many years now before you're counting the gray hairs.
Have you got any left?
And what'll become of you then?
You'll end your life in the gutter and it'll serve you right.
Because the gutter's where you came from and the gutter's where you belong.
Oh!
Oh, Marie, shut your mouth!
Allegations of improper conduct on my part are totally false.
You're just putting that in because it's commercial.
If kids are so innocent, why is everything bad named after them?
Acting childish, kidnapping, child abuse.
Good touch, bad touch, no touch at all.
Child sex abuse, is that for us all?
No.
I'm somebody's child.
Please respect my feelings.
Don't use me, abuse me, or lead me astray.
I'm somebody's child.
Please respect my life.
Cause the youth of today are our leaders tomorrow.
Remember there's danger in dealing with strangers.
If it's someone you don't know, it's best you say no.
It might be your relative, it might be your friend.
But when those strangers come, it's best you say no.
Oh, oh, feelings come, my little feet want to run.
The Michael Jackson child molestation civil lawsuit two years ago was tried there.
Your honor, my client has instructed me to remind the court how rich and important he
is, that he is not like other men.
I should be able to run over as many kids as I want!
Okay, fine.
How many yeses in innocent?
No.
And my reaction is, it's L.A.
Let's pay back Whitey and give Michael Jackson a couple of freebies.
We want Michael!
We want Michael!

Here he is!
Here's the guy you want to see!
That is why I need you.
I need your help.
Let us reach out to those children.
It is I, only I, speaking to you children and sending you a few little gifts.
If you help me, maybe we will sing together.
Let us think big.
Let us find many children to join our efforts.
He not the army, you of the general.
He not the army, you of the general.
He not the army, you of the general.
As far as you can see, we may not know what sort of people you love.
sólo that you know but him is不是 словаην

If you love him, Monday for Wednesday,
May the day be getting dark and final.
MAY THE DAY BE GETTING��
Still in love.
As far as I know, money means money!
Just beat it, beat it
See me ya, see me ya, tell me who me favor
See me ya, see me ya, tell me who me favor
Cause, live and dream because they make it over bro
Some jive game double under a card
When me come and they say me favor boy jaw
See me ya, see me ya, tell me who me favor
See me ya, see me ya, tell me who me favor
Cause, cause you love man and I know freezo
Cause, inna the church you say the apostle
But when you come to woman I know freezo
They say that me move like Michael Jackson
See me ya, see me ya, tell me who me favor
See me ya, see me ya, tell me who me favor
What time is it?
Time for my afternoon nap, wanna join me?
I asked him if I could stay in the bedroom
Well, I'm always more cautious
Come on
And I was like, Michael you should sleep in my bed
I'm afraid
I'd like to be the meat in your sandwich
Sorry, you can't even get up the stairs to my bed
The room is totally trashed
And he's like
No, no, no, I used to sleep in the bed sleeping
We were like, no, no, no, it's not a good idea
Come on, I've been practicing kissing on my dog
And then he finally said
It's your choice
Okay, if you love me
Beat it
Raise your heel a bit
Put a little pressure on the ball of your foot
I was like, oh man
And so I finally slept on the bed
Most people turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
I don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like
Put me in a certain position
Knowing that it's going to hurt my back
I thought you were a lesbo
He's a lesbian
He's a lesbian
He's a lesbian
He's a lesbian

well jay simpson murdered nicole simpson and ronald goldman
he stabbed both of them to death with a machete
he was arrested on two state murder charges
o.j. simpson was taken to jail
o.j. simpson
o.j. simpson
o.j. simpson


o.j. simpson
o.j. simpson surrendered was at eleven a.m.
he was arrested by the los angeles police department at nine o'clock p.m.
outside the walsh's simpson estate
members of o.j. simpson's family hugged each other
they cried after word of the arrest came out
o.j. simpson
o.j. simpson
o.j. simpson
o.j. simpson



o.j. simpson
ha chick
Ivanka
Oak
when I thought I ate a nitratin
still likes Simpson. How's O.J. doing? You know, O.J. this, O.J. that. Well, he's no longer O.J. to me.
He's Simpson. Someone who carves up two human beings like signs of beef forfeits his right to
any endearing nicknames, at least in my view. The incessant jokes and tasteless comedy routines on
TV and radio about the case should only serve to subliminally trivialize the murders of the victims.
There's this rumor that the Florida Orange Juice Association are hiring O.J. Oh yeah, they're gonna
pay him a million dollars a year for the rest of his life. What for? He's gonna change his name.
Oh. He's just Snapple. I think I'm way ahead of the game there. I think if all American families
were like my family, the country would be a lot better off. And we all know what happened here.
Simpson committed these murders. I didn't do this thing.
It's loose and I feel like going. Loose juice as they call it.
Don't mind me if I start growling a little bit.
Ready.
Let's go.
You just gotta get your space in if you're working out with the wife, if you know what I mean.
You can always blame it on her.
The very thought of you.
See, I knew it was gonna happen.
And I forget to do.
Let's go. Better take them both right here. Right here.
Oh yes.
You don't give his left hand up.
Come right here, me.
Okay, come on you two. Start with this hand. Here we go. Here, here, here, here.
Hey, watch your little jammy.
You guys, this is not gonna cut it.
Come on. This hand, ready. Let's go.
Boom.
What we're doing here is just getting the blood flowing.
That's it. That's it. Keep that high and right on the chin.
Easy.
Now get used to this. This is just to kind of get that blood flowing, right?
That's it. Just hold her nice and still. That's it. Bring her down hard.
Let's see that jam. Let's go.
You're just trying to get the blood flowing.
Exactly. That's it. Feel the lats for the shoulder.
Good.
That's the whole point of this, son.
That's it.
Get the blood flowing.
Exactly.
Just pull her back real tight.
Here.
Into the side of the ribcage.
Every time.
Let's go.
Here.
Come on, Elijah.
Way up on the toes.
Whoa.
Elijah on, right?
Whoa.
Do it again.
Yes.
Hard now.
Whoosh.
Okay.
Get that blood flowing, huh?
Yeah.
Let's go right into the back.
Ready?
Here.
And down.
That's it.
Whoa.
Yes.
Whoa.
Oh, I need it harder.
Let's go.
Okay.
Very nice.
Now, try to get some blood flowing, huh?
And let's give her a turn.
Ha.
Okay.
All right.
Again, OJ.
Hey.
Good.
You're breaking the park.
Oh, yeah.
Hey.
Woo-hoo.
Okay, let's hold her right here.
Let's take a walk.
I love it.
Think how good I'm going to feel tomorrow, huh?
Yeah.

Wrong.
You know what I wasn't going to tell him, but I'm going to tell him.
And you know what?
You're a lot ahead of you.
And down.
No problem.
No shame here.
It's so hard of minding broke a thousand times.
I'm still singing.
You know?
I'm going to put a softer back.
Hands up.
Whoa.
Just like that.
Real simple hands up, man.
But if you look at it, I'm beginning to sweat a little bit here.
You know?
Now, hands up.
Both arms.
Now, OJ, I'm warning you.
You got this.
Come near me, man.
Hey.
Just take a nice simple walk.
I got one to protect that little knee problem.
Let's get going here.
Customer service.
Is this the customer service for the OJ line?
Yes, it is.
Okay, I got my tape.
Uh-huh.
And it's defective?
Uh-huh.
I mean, he says he didn't do it.
That's your opinion.
Well, the tape's defective.
He says he didn't do it.
Have a nice day.
If there is someone who isn't satisfied even by this,
I would suggest that this tape is perhaps not for you.
But you think about pursuing more appropriate intellectual pursuits,
such as comic strips.
I didn't do this, man.
This, of course, is just too insane to talk about.
I just didn't.
It wasn't in me to do it.
You know?
I mean, you can't make somebody try to be something
or do things that they don't have a calling for.
It wasn't in me to do.
I'm 100% guilty.
What?
What?
What?
I'm as innocent as anyone else out there.
Whether you did it or not, we still love you, OJ.
Oh, Christ.
This is true.
This is absolutely true.
What?
In fact, Simpson cut himself while killing Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown in self-defense.
Either Ron or Nicole, or both together, unleashed a deadly assault on Simpson.
And he either took out a knife he had on his own person,
or wrested Ron's or Nicole's knife away and stabbed the two of them to death.
And that's what really happened.
Yeah, I see.
Uh, everybody can't be Martin Luther King.
Hey, Macko, what a line.
Ugh, the idea that you would compare yourself to Mahatma Gandhi.
Martin.
This man is obviously a psychotic.
And?
How?
I got screwed.
Wow.
Oh, yeah.
They gave me, I guess, a fine or penalty.
They gave me, I had to do community service.
Oh, man.
I did it all.
Okay, okay, we'll talk to you later.
I got totally screwed.
Relax, Mr. Angry Slacks.
I'm mugged to have to talk about it.
He comes off as being defensive, and when Mr. Simpson breaks through that cage, it's like holding a force back, and then allowing it to come through.
And when it comes through, it comes through with more power than the force actually wishes.
You just want it to exhibit.
How amusing.
I know her more affectionately as juror number seven.
Kato?
Good to see you, buddy.
129, including chemicals, out the door.
Stop friggin' following me.
Ah!
Woo!
You will never believe where we are.
We are at the Neverland Ranch, the home of the one and only Michael Jackson.
Okay, and we just received word he is about to make way out here and do something really, really special.
In just a few minutes, I'm gonna throw it over to JoJo, who is up our stage.
And, uh, this is happening right here at the Neverland Ranch.
We are here live at Michael Jackson's house.
All right, you guys.
To get this thing started.
Look who's here, y'all!
Michael Jackson!
Thank you all for coming tonight.
For, in my opinion, it's a very special cause.
And the cause is our future, and the future is our children.
And me!
Tommy Mottola, I love you.
Thank you.
Uh, the party's going all night long.
Michael Jackson just got up and, uh, got into a food fight with JoJo.
JoJo just went and took a shower in his guest house.
It's nuts, man.
And Tommy Mottola is a dad.
What just happened?
You got into a cake fight or a bed.
Of course, I said something about it on the microphone.
Everything got kind of crazy.
Michael turned around and I said, hit me, Michael.
He goes, are you sure?
I'm like, swing it!
And he hit me with like a, like a foot square piece of cake about seven inches thick in my face.
And you wanna hear something crazy?
After we partied for a while and the cake was flying, they took me to Michael Jackson's guest house to take a shower.
You're early, Kato.
A little nervous, a little nervous.
You know, I'm not used to being judged by more than 12 people.
Kato!
Kato!
OJ's house is now Kato's home.
Kato live with Nicole.
OJ say live and free.
OJ say live and free with me.
One night he hit them on the AC.
Daylight come the LAPD.
Come Mr. House for take the witness stand.
Make me late for, for no movie.
Did you see cut on OJ's hand?
Tonight on guest host on MTV.
Kato!
Mr. Kato.
OJ's house is now Kato's home.
I'm Kato OJ, dim with flunky.
Hunger come and we eat french fries.
Mush say we coke and junkies.
Medium drink and two homies sides.
Kato!
Kato!
OJ's house is now Kato's home.
And the aspiring but none too successful at that point after Kato saw also a career wise move that was very good for him.
Because in the defendant he could have a connection.
Some may say that.
But I wasn't trying to do comedy actually.
It was, that was me.
I think I'm very funny.
How about you crowd?
Disgust even me.
Oooh.
How was that one dude?
You showered at Michael Jackson's guest house.
What the heck?
That was like the, this is like a crazy, crazy night.
Much love to Michael Jackson and his whole crew.
Neverland Ranch, amazing.
Hey, listen to this.
Where are you Billy Jean?
This is your station.
Waiting for you Billy Jean.
Meanwhile.
It's one of my favorite things to do when we're on tour.
Yeah?
It's like lots of throwing stuff at each other.
There's a beauty of feces thrown all over the walls, the floor, the ceiling and it stunk so bad.
Maybe it's just a lot of fun.
Come on.
What way?
I'm trying to get laid.
I am not going to do anything sexual because you totally took advantage.
Oh, you're turning me down, that's a laugh.
That's happened many times.
Well, can I at least rub up against your legs?
Mmm.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
My penis, my buttocks, my penis, my buttocks, my penis.
I am particularly upset by the handling of my penis, my buttocks and my blotches.
You pig.
That this is what I have to endure, gaining innocent ass.
So be it.
I don't even know what a pig you are.
Or to keep my mouth shut or maybe for a few minutes in your room up stairs.
How much is that worth to you?
All that I have to have.
All that I have to give.
What about our lessons?
What were you going to teach me?
It was a nightmare, a horrifying nightmare.
You said I was gonna laugh.
I love being touched by a man like you.
It was the most humiliating ordeal of my life.
Goodbye.
This is the one step too far.
Alright, what's the problem?
Um, to call somebody. I need some help.
What's the matter?
What's the matter? Hello?
What's my math?
What's your math?
No, it's my math. I have to do it.
What's your math?
Will you help me?
Sure. Where do you live?
No, it's my math.
Yeah, I know it. What's your math?
No, you have to help me with my math.
Your math? Okay. How old are you?
I'm only four.
Four?
Yeah.
Uh-huh. What's your math?
Will you help me?
Yeah.
Um, darling, what are you doing?
Uh, yeah.
What did I do?
I told you not to put it on the bag.
You called that bag. I didn't mean to put it in the bag.
An arrest warrant for Mr. Jackson has been issued on multiple counts of child molestation.
Liar! She wouldn't do that!
She didn't.
Touche.
The bail amount on the warrant has been set at three million dollars.
Seems that Jacko has once again been accused of child molestation.
Yet another 13-year-old boy has stood forward to accuse a pop star of swapping spits and a little mutual masturbation.
A second allegation, you say?
A moron indeed.
But Michael isn't the only one.
I do not think I've gotten enough children's jocks the last time.
Anybody who lives in L.A. knows that.
But I can't see him doing something illegal. He's in show business. He's a celebrity.
Let's roll, guys.
Hi. Welcome to Cox.
Here, all suspects are guilty until proven innocent.
Here, all suspects are guilty until proven innocent.
Oh, we're on the progress here of the 420 in progress.
And, uh, we're going to see what the situation is.
We got a call tonight from the neighbors.
This guy's in the basement doing drugs and having a bunch of friends over and getting out of control.
So, uh, we got to see what's going on here.
Damn, I can smell it now.
Yeah, it's over there, out of the house.
Hey, yeah, man, what's going on? Can I help you?
I, uh...
Okay, okay. We was just talking about picking up broads.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
That midwife.
She's totally hooked on drugs. She's totally broke.
Debbie Reynolds.
Been doing cocaine for two days with Pedro Guerrero, who just got arrested.
And I'm trying to get her to leave her house and go into rehab right now.
Elizabeth Taylor.
Oh, man, look at her in those pants.
Well, I'd like to get it hurt.
But she's so stupid.
Man, I don't care how stupid she is. Look how she looks in them jeans.
I know you're looking at her.
Guy you got a smack in the kitchen?
Man.
No!
I'm sorry, folks. I'm not used to acting.
Juicy or go?
Let's put all our haters on the floor.
Stop, Harvey!
Juice go.
OJ Simpson.
Hey, woo-hoo.
Thug.
Ah.
What is it?
I love a cupcake. And that coffee smells great.
You don't know what hard feelings are. This ain't my first time at the rodeo.
How charming.
Anything else?
Nope.
You're gonna get it, baby.
I hope that I get a chance to sit down with you after the party.
Well, at that alleged party.
Forget it!
If you are not taking sides.
Please convey my regrets to your wife.
My kids don't have a mother.
Sword cuts both ways.
So that makes sense at all.
You think your life's a mystery.
Yeah.
There isn't a dirty cover-up in this entire business that I don't know about.
And your hand is in every one of them. You reek of it.
So that makes sense at all. I disagree with you totally.
Don't mess with me, fella.
You got me started.
I'm just beginning.
And you got me riled up.
I've fought worse monsters than you for years in Hollywood.
I know how to win the hard way.
Get my blood pressure going.
Is that a threat?
That is the bottom line, but...
You are not mad if you haven't the guts.
Take it easy if I were you.
Yeah, subconscious racism.
Now you're trying to stab me in the back?
Yeah, thank you.
Oh, .
No!
I heard a thump.
OJ went ballistic.
Go, go, go!
Picture Simpson with his sharp knife viciously stabbing and tearing a nine-foot gash in the bunch's skin.
While imagining the festive party girls laughing and enjoying themselves.
Can you imagine the smiles, jokes, and celebratory toasts that took place?
Here, here.
And so goddamn obscene, there are no words for it.
Did you hear OJ's new URL?
Oh, I didn't know he had one.
Oh, yeah.
In his mouth.
HTTP colon slash slash backslash backslash backslash game.
It's just too coincidental, this.
Oh, man.
Oh, my God.
Damn you!
Now, you got the wrong number.
This is 912.
What?
Welcome to the Beverly Hills Police Department.

911 emergency, find a gate.
Can you get someone over here now?
It's OJ Simpson.
I think you know his record.
Fucking going nuts.
Wait a minute, what's your name?
Nicole Simpson.
Simpson, look, we've already been out there tonight for a cysterectomy, a case of severe butt rot, and a leprechaun butt.
How dumb do you think we are?
Billy Jean!
Call the police.
It's not a good idea.
Attention Neverland wretch, this is the police.
Elephant Man, Tinkerbell, Elizabeth Taylor, come out with your hands up.
Come on, Tinkerbell.
That little kid is not my lover.
He's just a boy who claims that we had some fun.
Hi, Elephant Man.
So I'll pay him to shut up.
We told cops we're coming.
We've done.
Not true.
So I'll give him ten million.
Just ask Elizabeth Taylor, am I right?
And the Elephant Man.
That little kid is not my lover.
That little kid is not my lover.
You can see it all.
And I see OJ.
I see OJ, man, and he looks scared.
And I would be scared because there's cops.
I'm a cop, you idiot.
Can't we all just get along?
Oh, come on.

It's no joke when a meeting runs late, you've got to catch a plane.
Well, there's my ride.
Hiya, Frank.
Good to see you, buddy.
Come on.
We're going to go for a joy ride.
Dad, why is that so important?
Well, quick.
Get in.
Hey, how did he get tickets?
It wouldn't look right.
OJ.
Nothing's right anymore.
Go on, fight slow down.
Let's hit the freaking road.
You hear about OJ Simpson's new limousine service?
I hear about the limousine service.



No, tell me about it.
Guaranteed to get you to the airport with an hour to kill.
Oh!
Suspect wanted for a Dabble 187 in West LA Division.
Suspect named Orinthal James Simpson, OJ Simpson.
Suspect may be driving a white or light-colored Ford Bronco.
Suspect was last seen wearing a yellow golf shirt,
faded blue jeans, and white Reebok tennis shoes.
Suspect is possibly armed at use caution.
The day OJ took L.A., it was the story of the day.
Crowds all gathered on the overpass.
He lost a wife to the knife, said that he would rather die.
And all that I could do was laugh.
I switched from channel 12 to 4.
Don't know what I was looking for.
Closer look or just a love of you.
Traffic stopped, he waved him on.
He didn't see then he was gone.
But here in my room I saw in a new.
When heroes fall, from 8 miles wide to TV tall.
When heroes fall, no one can read the writing on the wall.
Doesn't matter what they said or done.
Their feet of clay will bring them down.
When heroes fall, it reflects on us all.
That's how hero's badass is gonna end up.
How does that make him a hero?
Well it's more than you did.
Let's BREAK!
I'll BREAK ANYTHING THAT MOVES.
IIUP
Out the Bronco. Over the driveway.
Into the house, out the backyard, down the street.
Into the Condo. reserves, not the business.
No, that's wrong.
Shut the freak up!
I don't want emergency.
Can you just send somebody over here?
He's in a white Bronco, the poor.
Mrs. Simpson, I'm sorry, but your husband suffers from a persecution complex,
extreme paranoia, and bladder hostility.
My ex-husband, he's bad.
Good luck!
O.J.'s sister was a no-good jerk.
He is a fucking asshole.
He had no business killing his ex-wife, Nicole, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.
O.J.'s sister played on the naked gun in Roots.
But answer now.
He is a hardened criminal.
O.J. Simpson!
O.J. Simpson!
O.J. Simpson!
I have a few line and directs on the scene of the shooting.
Police have not yet made a statement, J.J.,
but an all-points bulletin is already in effect,
and an arrest warrant is in effect.
This is expected, sir.
Matt Taylor, I think we're forgetting something very important in all of this.
Okay, sure, he touched some children,
but the man is a great singer, and he has entertained us for so many years.
What are you talking about?
Michael Jackson.
All this bad-mouthing, putting the man down.
Maybe he did touch some children down there,
but come on, it's Michael Jackson!
Michael Jackson!
These men were chasing a girl right over here,
and then all of a sudden, she splashed right through the fountain
and wrapped this man down the escalator.
He kept pushing me to point out the celebrities,
and to help me handle them coming out of the kitchen a couple of minutes later,
and there he is mopping up the floors with them.
I never figured he was the guy that was looking for trouble.
What do you think about this, Billie Jean?
She's a rebel, you know.
I think they're picking on her because she's a girl,
and I think that's disgusting.
Well, there you have a woman's perspective.
Many still feel Billie Jean's a fine young woman.
At least one person disagrees.
In terms of heinousness and brutality,
on a scale of 1 to 10,
these Michael Jackson, O.J. Simpson,
and innocent murders were a 10.
A veteran LAPD detective,
one of the first officers to arrive on the scene, said,
It was the bloodiest crime scene I have ever seen.
How do you know that?
How do we know that?
How did it come to pass that someone we know,
not believe, but know,
committed these two savage murders,
is now enjoying life with a smile on his face,
out walking among us?
I never thought he was cracked.
I thought it was awesome.
Billie Jean went running up that escalator right there.
This guy grabbed me.
I got ahold of her backpack,
and she turned around and kicked him right in the nuts.
He kept on running.
It was hilarious.
Billie Jean, wherever you are, I love you.

You're a whole new generation.
You're dancing through the day.
You're grabbing for the magic on the run.
You're a whole new generation.
You're loving what they do.
I put a picture in the motion.
And that choice is up to you.
Hey.
All right, slow down.
Relax, Frank.
We got plenty of time.
All right, where do you want to go?
We may all be killed.
It will only take a couple of hours.
You'll be home in plenty of time to make dinner.
When you're always running here and there
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
You've got a place to go
I don't suppose anybody would give me three million just for you.
Oh, Frank's here.
Come on.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Hey, Raymond.
Hiya, Frank.
Did you get enough beer for Ben, too?
No, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts.
And put some beer on ice.
What kind of beer do you like?
Um, I'm a vegetarian.
And I don't drink.
Drink that crap!
Half-blue ribbon!
Man, this was one hell of an explosion.
You still don't get it, do you?
Hey, look, you're asking me a question.
Oh, ha!
See, I'm in charge here.
And they pick your friend up with a sponge.
Got it.
It's gonna be a long night.
Let's drink!
I'm Paul.
What's your name?
Michael Jackson.
Boy, have you heard of MTV?
I'm a TV host.
I'm a TV host.








Well, let me ask you a question.
What appeared out of the blue and applied to me?
Critics.
There are some artists out there whose white vysts are剸ing and
are distinctively non-fascinant.
I cling to
Master David Wright,
You know, you really get pissed and I start thinking about stuff.
There you go.
Thanks, man.
Ugh.
Drink up.
You are so freaking suave, man.
The question was if I'm worried that he could go from France to France from Britain.
It's L.A.
What?

It's Michael Jackson's European tour.
Victoria, this is Michael.
Don't say anything.
Just listen very carefully and do exactly what I say.
I want you to go to my closet.
Inside you'll find a brown suitcase.
Inside the suitcase is a silver sequined gown, a fur coat, a nice little purse and a wig.
And a passport for Diana Ross.
I want you to bring those to me.
I'm going to be flying to Paris disguised as Diana Ross.
Bubbles is going to come along with me.
He's going to be disguised as Barry Gordy.
Don't challenge anybody.
Especially not that bitch Janet.
Don't you know?
Gee, we can't be trusted at all.
What else is fine?
We're going to be playing in Paris.
At the home of Roman Polanski.
Owen R. Kelly, he's going to love me.
Creep!
Don't you look at me, creep!
Don't challenge anybody.
Don't try to call.
That's dark.
Creep!
Creep that crap!
Oh, but while we're at it, why don't I give out the contact info for Subgenius Productions?
Yes.
If you'd like some information on the Church of the Subgenius and all the insanity that
it encompasses, why don't you drop a line to Bob, the Church of the Subgenius at Post Office
Box 204206, Austin, Texas 78720.
And have a good night, Seekers, if you can after absorbing this.
Oh, and good night, Al.
