1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Your T-Zone is your true proving ground for any T-Zone.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,360
Yes.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,980
Each week at this hour, the strange and unusual...

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,840
So Genius, Our Role Swatch!

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, that such a thing could have happened here.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,260
Here in my own house.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,120
Oh, what a pity.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,060
But I never dreamed such a thing could happen here to us.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,160
Yes, I remember saying distinctly...

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,980
Oh, oh!

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,460
Yes.

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,120
Oh, yes.

13
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:31,920
Oh, yes.

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,400
Oh, yes.

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,500
Oh, yes.

16
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,180
Dear Diary,

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,360
It has occurred to me today that my dearest human has never sniffed my backside.

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,700
I must bond with him in different ways.

19
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,740
Like my father always used to say,

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,620
if you want someone to look you in the eye,

21
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,620
make sure that your mouth smells exactly like your butt.

22
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,700
It's difficult to argue with that logic.

23
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,560
And so I have eaten some rotting earthworms in preparation for my dear human's return,

24
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,140
as well as one of my friends.

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,580
And I have a pair of his socks.

26
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,340
Bob says, too much is always better than not enough.

27
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:14,420
The sad weekly self-denial preached by the New Age movement is pure conspiracy pabla.

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,740
The true son or daughter of Bob knows that our universe is no laid-back, home-chanting cosmos,

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,140
but an active, tumultuous, squirting universe bent on rampant reproduction and easy-going.

30
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,880
He grins.

31
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,280
The false cults may try to teach personal transformation,

32
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,400
psychic development,

33
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,560
human potential.

34
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,040
But Bob goes straight for the glands and seeks to amplify the self,

35
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,920
to bloat the abnormality potential of his pupils.

36
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,040
Only through excess can one contact the lower self,

37
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,260
where the real decisions are made.

38
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,220
Don't just eat a hamburger.

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,680
Eat the hell out of it.

40
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,240
The advanced initiate, once freed from conspiracy programming,

41
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,420
as well as the worldly goods that had enslaved him,

42
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,720
makes his pilgrimage to Dobbs Town,

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,080
the church's fabulous walled encampment deep in the jungles of Malaysia.

44
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,860
There, the initiate's third nostril is surgically opened by psychic surgeons,

45
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,660
allowing him or her to whiff-read the psychic stench

46
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,660
of those around him.

47
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,860
He masters the mystic sciences of schizophreniatrics and memory editing,

48
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,680
creating a clean slate on which Bob may write.

49
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,980
The art of excremeditation is taught,

50
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,200
whereby the mind is voided upon the great throne of relief.

51
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,240
What is it that truly sets Bob apart from other would-be holy men and self-appointed gurus?

52
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,560
Everything.

53
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,020
Everything.

54
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,160
Bob has always existed.

55
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,980
There have always been Bobs.

56
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,680
Every epoch of man's history has had its Bob.

57
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,880
Most were what we would call good Bobs.

58
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,240
Others?

59
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,240
Well, we didn't dwell on that.

60
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,160
Dear diary, it's not so much that I miss my testicles.

61
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,280
I know it's a rite of passage in our pack,

62
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,400
and I'm sure that my dearest human has had his removed as well.

63
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,520
But when that one bulldog comes to the dog park,

64
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,120
and parades his testicles around,

65
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,720
I can't help but notice how Ginger looks at them.

66
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,320
I love Ginger.

67
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,120
To be fair, I will admit,

68
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,140
he has a fine-smelling butthole.

69
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,740
Oh, yes, dear friends.

70
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,460
This one's not exactly a rerun.

71
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,960
It's partly made from episode number 139,

72
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,860
which was itself culled from shows numbers 4, 5, and 6,

73
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,520
with lots of G. Gordon Gordon,

74
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,180
back when he was living in Bolivia but visiting Dallas.

75
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,960
Incidentally, he now lives in Porto, Portugal,

76
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,220
which is a port where they ship out lots of port.

77
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,860
And he's the second oldest subgenius we know.

78
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,280
He turns 80 in a week.

79
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,440
Only Reverend Zaphod is older, and only by one month.

80
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,560
And let me tell you a true fact, friends.

81
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,440
80 is the new 80.

82
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,500
It's also the same old 80.

83
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,920
Which is pretty dang old.

84
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,580
We did a birthday song for G. Gordon Gordon,

85
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,920
but we can't play it this week,

86
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,000
because we don't want to spoil it for his birthday next week.

87
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,000
Anyway, the young Gordon is on this episode a lot

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,880
from back in the days when we thought 45 or so was really old.

89
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,800
Doctor, doctor, here.

90
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,720
Take some more of this.

91
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,520
Have some of that.

92
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,420
Maybe the show will finish,

93
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,500
and we'll get to make another one.

94
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,540
Oh no, more prescriptions again.

95
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,520
I don't know if I can keep up with all these prescriptions

96
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,280
and all these callers and all these fake shows.

97
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,280
Oh my God, this subgenius thing.

98
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,280
It's more than acting.

99
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,500
I can't.

100
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,040
I mean, man, I don't think I can keep up with it.

101
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,100
I mean, it's like there's too much of it.

102
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,940
There's all these letters that come in the mail,

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,500
these weird magazines, these characters that show up.

104
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:27,500


105
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,220
They're all in the door.

106
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,360
These bobbies.

107
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,600
They want to know things.

108
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,540
They want to know how to run their lives.

109
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,560
What should I do?

110
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,660
Everybody's saying about this, about my girlfriend.

111
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,220
My girlfriend doesn't want me to worship God.

112
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,920
What should I do?

113
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,180
What should I do, man?

114
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,320
That's what I want to know.

115
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,820
I'll tell you what you should do.

116
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,220
It's like, doctor, you should do this.

117
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,080
No head launching, doctor.

118
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:55,860
Oh.

119
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,900
Take the pills.

120
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,680
Oh.

121
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,340
Light the fire.

122
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:00,360
Oh.

123
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,460
Try some of this false slack.

124
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,500
But we can't talk about that because it would leave this station open to libel and slavery.

125
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,300
That's our lawyer now.

126
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,220
Oh my God, he's here.

127
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,440
Gee, I feel much better now.

128
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, man.

129
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,140
That's because Bob sent this for you.

130
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,080
God.

131
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,660
You're a normal soul.

132
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,680
You're amazing.

133
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,460
You can drink them.

134
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,340
You can smoke them.

135
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,520
You can eat them.

136
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,980
I don't know.

137
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,500
Who knows what you can do.

138
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,760
You can even snort, don't you?

139
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,660
I'm rubbing one up under my gums here.

140
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,640
I'm going to try a line of this human soul here if you'll excuse me now.

141
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:48,780
Oh.

142
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,280
Oh.

143
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:50,660


144
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,320
Now that's what I call soul.

145
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,400
Oh.

146
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,500
Let me try some of that.

147
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,960
Oh.

148
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,560
Jesus.

149
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,900
That must have been a fairly intelligent normal.

150
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,020
Oh, no.

151
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,220
That wasn't a normal.

152
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,980
That was some of the...

153
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,840
God, I think I got some of his memories off of that.

154
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,440
Wow.

155
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,840
Yeah.

156
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:20,800
It's like I'm seeing this little woman in the 40s just for a second.

157
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,480
It's probably the guy's mom.

158
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,560
Yeah.

159
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,360
God, you can snort their souls.

160
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:26,720
Yeah.

161
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,440
And these little primal memories come back.

162
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,180
You've just got to give them final unction and dry them out first.

163
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:33,700
Okay.

164
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,500
God, how long have you guys known about this?

165
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,140
I mean, was this something the Indians had down there?

166
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,420
Yeah.

167
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:39,660
Yeah.

168
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:51,980
It's too rainy to light a fire to smoke a soul a lot of times, so they just dry it and keep it with volcanic rock as an absorbent.

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,720
Oh, absorbent.

170
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,700
And they just grind it up and snort it through huge, huge canes.

171
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,320
But they didn't have the technology to extract souls.

172
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,300
I mean, how'd they get them under pressure?

173
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,780
How'd they get them into the canisters?

174
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,680
They don't do it that way.

175
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:11,280
They just feed them the right amount of herbs and plants, and the soul just drips out of the nasal and anal and...

176
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,480
You're kidding.

177
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,480
No, it just...

178
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Why can't we do that?

179
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,240
We can if we've got the right pills.

180
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,440
But...

181
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,220
It's kind of, you know, it's all organic.

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,400
What?

183
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,920
I mean, you know, there's two ways you can extract.

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,480
You can go high technology, or you can go with just kerosene and a couple of guys with...

185
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,580
Why did Bob set up these extraction machines?

186
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,120
I mean, what's with these immaculate...

187
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,680
Well, all you gotta do is you dig a little pit.

188
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:40,720
You dig a little pit in the ground, you line it with plastic, peg down with wood, and then you put the body in.

189
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,880
A normal, right?

190
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,240
Yeah.

191
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,360
Any normal?

192
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,860
Any normal.

193
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,600
Any normal that isn't dead yet.

194
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,100
The stole is still in him, right?

195
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:48,480
Uh-huh.

196
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,240
Okay.

197
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,640
Then you cover him with kerosene and acetone.

198
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,060
And then you just jump up and down on him until it turns kind of green and thick.

199
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,840
Then you remove him, strain the liquid, then you boil it, and you add sulfuric acid.

200
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,300
But then there's some kind of ritualistic...

201
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,080
I mean, what actually causes the transmutation?

202
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:18,020
Well, there's a group of people around the pit adding a psychic element of the alchemy, you see.

203
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,640
They concentrate.

204
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,580
Oh, yeah, because they don't have the soul amplifier.

205
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,100
Right.

206
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,020
So it's just done with psychic methods.

207
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,520
Oh, man.

208
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,000
And then after it's boiled...

209
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,700
God, that's incredible.

210
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,960
After it's boiled, they add...

211
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,760
A bunch of Brazilian tribal jungle people...

212
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,480
Ambulibians.

213
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,280
Ambulibians.

214
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:34,660
Both.

215
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,660
They both do it.

216
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,020
In the lowlands on both sides there.

217
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,020
And then you boil...

218
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,680
They boil the soul.

219
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,600
They actually boil the soul.

220
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,700
Little combo souls.

221
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,200
Yeah.

222
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:43,960
They boil...

223
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,600
And little coya souls, too, you know?

224
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,960
And they boil them.

225
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,000
And then when it starts to boil, they boil the soul.

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,800
When it starts to thicken, they add another liquid.

227
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,040
It's some kind of corrosive, I believe.

228
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,060
And then it turns into a thick white paste, and they just spread the soul out into the

229
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,600
sun, and it dries.

230
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,320
And then you just have to chop it up.

231
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,660
They'd probably think we were idiots for crystallizing them and compressing them.

232
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,340
Yeah.

233
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,540
I mean, it's...

234
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,660
It probably doesn't cost them...

235
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,160
It costs them a couple of necklaces or a taper.

236
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,900
Well, they don't need electricity to do it.

237
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,880
Their pet taper.

238
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,540
Yeah.

239
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,880
Well, it's...

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,300
It's the most expensive they've got.

241
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,320
And it would cost us a hundred grand a year to keep these things pumping.

242
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,980
Well, you see, we use a lot of...

243
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,700
And not to mention the bodies and the souls and getting rid of them and storing them.

244
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,800
See, the body dissolves.

245
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,500
The body dissolves in the solution completely.

246
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,280
Well, do you do up the body, too?

247
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,980
No, they just strain it out with a solid waste.

248
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,840
What do they do with that?

249
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,320
With that?

250
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,260
They put it on the...

251
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,560
They press it into little cakes and burn it, like for fires and stuff like that.

252
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,980
They usually give it back to the guy's family.

253
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,300
How come the...

254
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,080
How come they...

255
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,120
How come that this was...

256
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,720
Like...

257
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,020
How come the...

258
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,760
The western civilization didn't discover that?

259
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,440
Well, you see, it's because...

260
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,540
How come they haven't been ripped off yet?

261
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,840
How come we didn't rip them off?

262
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,320
Well, because we can pay for soul and get it a lot cheaper from them than doing it up

263
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,300
here, because, you know, like down there, nobody complains if you go through four or

264
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,260
five hundred bodies in one night, you know?

265
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,960
You can sit around and smoke all of a sudden and get a lot of money, and you know, and

266
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:17,960


267
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:17,960


268
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:17,960


269
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,600
you can't sell soul you want to.

270
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,280
Yeah, I guess it would be kind of questionable to...

271
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,820
They got a lot more soul...

272
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,140
...to be digging pits in your backyard and throwing normal bodies in there.

273
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,500
Well, it's just little pressed cakes.

274
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,120
Trampling them.

275
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,380
Noisy, if nothing else.

276
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,300
It's just little pressed cakes.

277
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,380
Most people barbecue on them later, you know?

278
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,080
Well, the senator got indicted.

279
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,320
Bob never forgot him.

280
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,640
You see?

281
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,140
Well, and then we've got to give half of them away to the...

282
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,140
Whatever, wherever they're taking on Jupiter...

283
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,480
Well, of course...

284
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,220
Well, here's the thing.

285
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:47,780
I have to...

286
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:47,940
I have to...

287
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:47,940


288
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:47,940


289
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:47,940


290
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:47,940


291
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:47,940


292
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:47,940


293
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:47,940


294
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,620
I have to cut in there on that.

295
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,440
I can't play the rest of that because there's no...

296
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,000
You really shouldn't know about the...

297
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,460
Where the canisters go.

298
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,900
That was an old show.

299
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,280
That was Hour of Slack number four.

300
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,060
Or, no, it was number six.

301
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,260
Hour of Slack number six.

302
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,460
I doubt if any of our current listeners heard that.

303
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,080
It's about two and a half years old.

304
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,660
Or two...

305
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,040
Less...

306
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,180
Around two years old.

307
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,880
Something like that.

308
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,180
And you are listening to the Hour of Slack.

309
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,360
The radio ministry of the Church of the Subgenius.

310
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,560
We've had a couple of people call up and say, what is...

311
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,280
What...

312
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,100
What are you?

313
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,640
That's always the question.

314
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,620
What are you?

315
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,300
They don't say who.

316
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,440
And is this on all the time and why?

317
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,000
And yes, we've been at this...

318
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,660
Place on the dial.

319
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,000
89.3 FM for about two years.

320
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,020
Nine o'clock Sunday night.

321
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,160
You tune in.

322
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,540
Learn the Word of Bob, dear friends.

323
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,400
The Word of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

324
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,660
The master of Slack.

325
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,480
The salesman of the universe.

326
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:15,360
The one man qualified to sell the universe and to invest your soul wisely.

327
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,920
Because we don't smoke or otherwise consume the souls of true subgenius listeners.

328
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:30,020
Those of you who are true subgeniuses, who really comprehend Slack,

329
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:38,440
those of you who truly understand the power of Slack and your need for Slack,

330
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:51,120
Slack, your souls are kept, are saved in canisters, but never sold by us and never used or in any way abused.

331
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:57,820
Only those of the, oh, those pathetic, those fashionable,

332
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,300
those who want to join the church of the subgenius just to be fashionable,

333
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:08,280
those who run down and buy the book of the subgenius so they can leave it on their shelves

334
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,360
so everybody can see it, but they never read it.

335
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,580
And if they do read it, they don't see nothing between the lines.

336
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,060
Not a thing. Uh-uh. Nope.

337
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:26,060
Or those who buy subgenius tapes or T-shirts or whatever just to show off like they were cool,

338
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,660
like they knew what was happening, baby.

339
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,060
Those are the ones who will fry, fry.

340
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,600
Where? In Bob's pipe, my friends.

341
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,260
In Bob's pipe.

342
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,840
Bob's part. Yay.

343
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,520
Shut up! I'm not done talking to you!

344
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,180
Wait.

345
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,700
The triple keyboard operates an echo chip.

346
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,940
Resonating bars make a phone.

347
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,160
It's something that rather resembles a mercury xylophone.

348
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,940
I'm getting tired. I don't know if I can keep up.

349
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,440
But I believe I actually enjoyed it.

350
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,640
To the last mutant, mutant, mutant.

351
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,020
That's me!

352
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,340
Civilized men were so frightened by talking AIDS.

353
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,220
Let it get away, doctor.

354
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,160
But how does one control?

355
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,520
A 400-pound gorilla.

356
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,720
I'm a doctor, not an animal trainer.

357
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,160
I'm a doctor, not an animal trainer.

358
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,140
That thing's got the balls as long as my middle finger.

359
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,280
Oh, no!

360
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,180
You think the unthinkable.

361
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,840
This radiation is beautiful.

362
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,900
Yes, doctor's beautiful.

363
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,020
Please, please, please, cover your faces.

364
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,160
That's the doomsday bomb.

365
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,880
Do you know what that means?

366
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,540
Do you know what that means?

367
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,380
Do you understand?

368
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,180
Do you understand?

369
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,460
Illusions!

370
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,380
Illusions!

371
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:13,740
Oh!

372
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:19,600
...who tended so much so that young Master Shemmy on his very first aboutch at the very dawn of proto-history,

373
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,380
seeing himself such and such, when playing with thistle words in a garden nursery,

374
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,920
Griefer Trophio at Fig Street, 111 Shovel in Old Holland.

375
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,880
Would we go back there now for sounds, pillens and scents?

376
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,640
Would we now for annas and annas?

377
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,000
Would we for full score eight and a loretta?

378
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,300
For twelve blocks one bob?

379
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,320
For four testas one gross?

380
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,580
Not for a deaner!

381
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,900
Not for Joe!

382
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,280
Dictated to, of all his little brethren and swisterines, the first riddle of the universe.

383
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,000
Asking, when is a man not a man?

384
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,600
Telling them, take their time, young friars, and wait till the tide stops,

385
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,260
for from the first his day was a fortnight,

386
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,760
and offering the prize of a bittersweet crab,

387
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,880
a little present from the past,

388
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,900
for their copper age was yet un-minted, to the winner.

389
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,960
One said, when the heavens are quakers.

390
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,700
A second said, when Bohemian lips.

391
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,620
A third said, when he know, when hold hard a jiffy,

392
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,300
when he is agnostic and determined to.

393
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,480
The next one said, when the angel of death kicks the bucket of life.

394
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,500
Still another said, when the wine's at wit's end.

395
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,760
And still another, when lovely woman stoops to conk him.

396
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,980
One of the littliest said, me, me, sen, went to conk.

397
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,020
Papa, papa, the harbour.

398
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,960
One of the wittiest said, when he yate ye yablekooken,

399
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,920
and he's mere zee self soo-sooken.

400
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,240
Still one said, when you are old, I'm grey, fall full with sleep.

401
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,740
And still another, when weed dead a walkner.

402
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,660
And another, when he's just only after having been semi-sized.

403
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,960
Another, when, yea, he hath no mananas.

404
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,120
And one, when those pigs, they begin now that they will,

405
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,580
flies up into the luft.

406
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,640
All were wrong.

407
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,800
So Shem himself, the doktator, took the cake,

408
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,620
the correct solution being,

409
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,260
I'll give it up,

410
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,320
when he is a, yours till the rending of the rocks,

411
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,000
sham.

412
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,240
Shem was a sham, and a low sham,

413
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,400
and his lowness creeped out first via foodstuffs.

414
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,640
So low was he that he preferred Gibson's tea-time salmon,

415
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,500
tinned, as inexpensive as pleasing, to the plumpest roe-heavy lax,

416
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,520
the miskiest par of smoked trout that there ever was gap between Leaslip and Island Bridge.

417
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,780
And many was the time, he repeated in his botulism,

418
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,920
that no jungle-grown pineapple ever smacked like the whoppies he shook out of Ananias's cans,

419
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,200
Finley and Lansdon's corner-house England.

420
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,060
So many great things, it just goes on and on and on and on and on.

421
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,280
That's, um, cool, groovy.

422
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,720
That's from Finnegan's wike.

423
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,380
Heavy stuff.

424
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,740
And it's, um, it's a big book.

425
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,300
Yeah.

426
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,200
It's a big, big book. People read it.

427
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,440
Yeah, that's right.

428
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,000
They get lost inside of it.

429
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,920
I did.

430
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,720
And we've got special signals attached to the tapes that we play on this show

431
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,780
that will reach out and lock onto your mind.

432
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,880
That was funny, isn't it?

433
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,700
Dear diary,

434
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,300
The cat is a curious, magical creature.

435
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,000
It's as if a teddy bear mated with a cactus,

436
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,720
and it's much less fun to play with than it would appear.

437
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,860
And yet it poops delicious candy into a box of pea-flavored sprinkles.

438
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,500
Dearest human guards these treats jealously,

439
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,600
often harvesting them into a barrel.

440
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,560
But I will admit that I sneak one from time to time.

441
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,140
They are delicious. Forgive me.

442
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,300
And now, with the, uh, the dog's permission...

443
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,140
Oh, sorry about that, you guys.

444
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,200
I'm gonna read from, uh, the new Dobbs...

445
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,860
Dot Town Mirror, or Dobbs Town Mirror.

446
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,560
This one doesn't have the period in it.

447
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,180
But you can go to Dobbs.Town and know things.

448
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,480
All dressed up.

449
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,380
Perhaps the theory of karma is true,

450
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,960
but operates backwards in time instead of forwards.

451
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,920
We're not challenged and blessed by what happened in the past

452
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,140
as an opportunity to learn.

453
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,660
We're challenged and blessed by what'll happen in the future.

454
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,840
And that's why the wicked person

455
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,680
is the one who's gonna prosper and the just suffer.

456
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,160
It'll all make sense at the great time reversal

457
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,940
when the universe implodes.

458
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,060
You can be there then.

459
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,000
Now!

460
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,160
The journey of a thousand leagues

461
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,640
begins with arriving at your destination instantly,

462
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,680
without effort or error.

463
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,340
How would your life be different

464
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,460
if incremental change were allowed?

465
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,280
Good God.

466
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,480
I hope they don't kill each other on mic.

467
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,020
Convenience personified.

468
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,540
Why do chefs wear chef hats?

469
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,700
Most people will try to come up with some kind of functional reply

470
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,540
and an origin story.

471
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,840
But the answer is to identify themselves as chefs.

472
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,440
The teleological heritage of chefs,

473
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,720
heresy, creationism,

474
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,740
is everywhere when you know how to look for it.

475
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,760
When someone you don't like does something you don't like,

476
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,980
it shows how evil they are.

477
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,120
When they do something you like,

478
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,100
it shows how clever they are.

479
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,200
Anything, as long as you get to retain your chef hat

480
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,320
that identifies to everybody else who you like and who you don't like.

481
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,360
I do not argue for hatlessness,

482
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,140
but I suggest there's more slack to be had

483
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,360
so you can switch out those hats now and then.

484
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,720
Instead of identifying the good and the wicked,

485
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,140
say, I prefer it, and see what happens.

486
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,420
As Charles Fort said in Wild Talents,

487
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,600
I conceive of nothing in religion, science, or philosophy

488
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,360
that is more than the proper thing to wear for a while.

489
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,160
Thank you, Dobstown Mirror.

490
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,840
Dear Diary,

491
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,820
This is the 733rd day that I have tried to test what Kat swore to me was true,

492
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,540
namely that if you hump anything long enough,

493
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,880
you will find a vagina.

494
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,240
So far, the results have been mixed.

495
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,260
My dearest human's leg vagina has not revealed itself.

496
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,340
However, I'm almost certain that I felt something on the brown teddy bear.

497
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,960
More tests are needed.

498
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,580
From PR News in Washington,

499
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,040
I'm somewhat surprising.

500
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,200
President Trump says if everything goes well next week,

501
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,660
he will visit the United States.

502
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,700
Trump spoke.

503
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,940
We signed a regional agreement.

504
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,920
And the big butt.

505
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,420
But Ryan.

506
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,760
The Dow 76553.

507
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,760
The Labor Department shows 15 and a half low-income tenants

508
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,860
may be forced to pay PR News.

509
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,960
You know, people tend to take things for granted.

510
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,540
They really do.

511
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,140
They forget how resilient their minds are.

512
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,580
And unfortunately, dear friends,

513
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,160
that's one of those processes

514
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,640
that snowballs and by which even the most privileged people,

515
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,160
despite getting every opportunity to become self-reliant,

516
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,000
and they nevertheless,

517
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,440
they can degenerate into big pink boy crybabies.

518
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,380
If people are less alive these days than they used to be,

519
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,080
it's only because for them there's less to being alive.

520
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,640
The line between life and death can become blurred and indistinct.

521
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,140
A truly dedicated work.

522
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,140
A worker can keep making an income or cooking dinner for the family

523
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,440
long after his or her mind is dead.

524
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,360
Any sensible belief in life after death should include the hideous plausibility

525
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,400
of becoming a sick invisible ghost that keeps shuffling back to the office

526
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,800
or the kitchen or the church.

527
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,780
What else happens to quote dead unquote people

528
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,740
whose instincts are so ruined

529
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,840
that they can no longer differentiate between the so-called light

530
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,440
and the so-called darkness?

531
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:30,920
Huh?

532
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,720
It might not.

533
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,120
Just on a off chance.

534
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,380
Might not that light thing,

535
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,620
that aliveness of yours,

536
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,320
get overdrawn just as easily as its body's checking account?

537
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,260
After all, for most of you,

538
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,820
the checking account was probably,

539
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,940
would have probably been your top priority in life.

540
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,280
It's all too easy.

541
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:00,040
For us to desoul ourselves by overdoing just what we thought might save us.

542
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,020
Work, drugs, religion, so forth.

543
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,840
Yet we can continue to plan and calculate.

544
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,320
Those things don't take many brain cells.

545
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,380
But we cease to feel, dear friends.

546
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,760
And that does take some brain cells.

547
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,540
In trying too hard for things that turn out to be unsatisfying,

548
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,480
we wreck the very instincts we need

549
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,180
for walking that thin, thin line

550
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,440
between self-lobotomizing lethargy

551
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,860
and neurotic burnout.

552
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,680
Oh yes.

553
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,640
So, get up off your butt, man!

554
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,120
That's what we're saying.

555
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,960
Get off your butt.

556
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,240
Give yourself a good butt kick.

557
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,700
By the way, what we're saying is,

558
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,760
this isn't necessarily the opinions of KNON or its management.

559
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,980
These are strictly the opinions of the, uh,

560
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,460
self-outspoken subgeniuses of the Church of the Subgenius,

561
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,160
uh, schisms of various kinds of Dallas, Texas,

562
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,960
uh, exercising our freedom that we have in this country

563
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,840
and practically no other.

564
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,440
We want to save your soul.

565
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,520
We don't want this country to be more like Russia.

566
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:17,220
Uh, like your, uh, your reactionary right-wing people

567
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,340
or your liberal left-wing people

568
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,980
or your middle-of-the-road fools, simp,

569
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,880
dupes, nay-nay.

570
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,020
We're subgeniuses, friends.

571
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,900
We don't fit into any of the categories

572
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,440
you're trying to fit us into right now.

573
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,020
You're listening to this stuff going,

574
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,920
what the heck are these guys talking about?

575
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,840
Where are they coming from?

576
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,780
Oh, friends, if only you knew where we're coming from.

577
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,680
If only you knew.

578
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,560
See, the whole thing about this creationist stuff

579
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,580
is, uh, God, you know, these people are saying,

580
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,700
God made all people in only six days.

581
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,300
Friends, the only ones that God made in only six days

582
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,720
were the subgeniuses.

583
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,100
That's right.

584
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,420
It took millions of years for the rest of the pinks,

585
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:09,780
the humans, uh, to, to, uh, to evolve up from monkeys.

586
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,900
But, but, uh, God only made the subgeniuses appear

587
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,420
suddenly out of nothing.

588
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,260
And, uh, for that matter, it wasn't really God anyway.

589
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,960
It was Jehovah One, the alien space god

590
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
from some corporate sin galaxy,

591
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,800
some UFO type of thing

592
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,180
only a thousand times more powerful

593
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,760
than your pathetic human conception of a UFO.

594
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,280
And besides that, friends,

595
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,220
when the humans evolved, so to speak, evolved,

596
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,020
this is the one thing that's really wrong

597
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,060
with the evolution theory.

598
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,000
It was a step down.

599
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,100
There's some old ranting from, uh, something I wrote

600
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,560
for an old stark-fisted removal magazine

601
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,920
called the bomb rant.

602
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,860
Coming up, an exclusive interview

603
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,700
with the swinging love corpses.

604
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,580
It's like, it's like a, a vortex funnel

605
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,320
sucking me down to the bottom of the ocean.

606
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,380
I was getting sucked down.

607
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,500
And you know, as much as I hate to admit it,

608
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,220
it felt pretty good.

609
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,760
It felt pretty good getting sucked down in that vortex wave

610
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,960
all the way down to the bottom of the ocean.

611
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,980
But God, I hate to admit it.

612
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,160
But God, I hate to admit it.

613
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,940
Whew, it felt pretty good.

614
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,820
But I hate to admit it.

615
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,880
Going on down to the backside of reality

616
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,540
My bad four, nala, son

617
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,380
Riding in the wave and stoking on my five things

618
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,580
Going on down to the backside of reality

619
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,800
Riding in my bad four, stoking on my five things

620
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,960
Mojo can really play the drums.

621
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,960
He was stuck down in this group thing.

622
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,300
He was laying down on the backside of reality on those tracks.

623
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,080
Now, how about the song Backside of Reality?

624
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,060
Our audience here is very familiar with that song.

625
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,400
We play it every week.

626
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,720
It was back in our acid days.

627
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,980
Back when we used to consume a lot of LSD.

628
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,520
Yes, I know that might be...

629
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,480
The Swingin' Love Courses at one time was a hippie LSD band.

630
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,180
Yeah, we don't really like to brag.

631
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,820
We don't talk about it.

632
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,200
We don't really advocate...

633
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,940
We did expand our consciousness.

634
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,180
But I thought that you condoned contracted consciousness.

635
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,840
We condone contracted consciousness.

636
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,040
Yeah.

637
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:19,700
Expanded.

638
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,340
Expanded consciousness.

639
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,000
Expanded consciousness.

640
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,500
Ness.

641
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,060
Ness-ness-ness.

642
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:30,180
Uh, well, so some of your music actually has been LSD influenced.

643
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,540
Right, and that is...

644
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,200
Like, what is the similarity here?

645
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,860
Like, I'm reminded of the 60's garage band.

646
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,620
That's like LSD, lollipop sugar donuts.

647
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,080
LSD lollipop...

648
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,080


649
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,020
We got high on high doses of sugar.

650
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,700
So, yeah.

651
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:49,700


652
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:49,700


653
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:49,700


654
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:49,700


655
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,180
That's what it was.

656
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,020
White sugar.

657
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,760
And, uh...

658
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,920
And we called it LSD just to cut of a joke.

659
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,900
And you would have visions and get into the back side of reality.

660
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,500
You would actually drive the curl into the back, into the vortex.

661
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,680
Right, it's like the molecule...

662
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,400
Oh, this is my favorite, uh...

663
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,240
This is beautiful.

664
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,580
These vicious junkies and...

665
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,400
Full territory.

666
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:14,800
This is the end of the show.

667
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:14,800


668
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:14,860
Bye.

669
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,200
Bye.

670
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,440
Bye.

671
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:16,860
Bye.

672
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,500
Bye.

673
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:17,620
Bye.

674
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:17,700
Bye.

675
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,000
Bye.

676
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:19,960
Now, we will be at the start of the movie.

677
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,080
I said...

678
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,220
In the Dobstown mirror.

679
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,280
We shall leave the world as foolish and wicked as we found it.

680
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:34,000
Only the church of the subgenius can guarantee to leave the world far, far more foolish than

681
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,760
we found it.

682
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:41,160
If the sole function of language was to communicate, then we'd have one language.

683
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,720
We have more than one language, therefore we have more than a sole function.

684
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,700
But what other functions might there be?

685
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,680
It's not...

686
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,580
To exclude, to not communicate.

687
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:59,800
This explains many languages, and within languages, dialects, and within dialects, slang,

688
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,420
so that young people and old people can exclude each other.

689
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,620
Now, is the sole function of the Internet to communicate?

690
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,120
Is the sole function of your religion to get commune?

691
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,600
This is the golden age of literacy.

692
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,340
Never before have so many written and read for their own pleasure.

693
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:30,980
It just turns out that for many people, their pleasure is sermonizing, scolding, tattling, bullying, and cats.

694
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,360
Lots of cats.

695
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:33,900
Cats are fine.

696
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,780
My pleasure is reminding the reader to join the Church of the Subgenius.

697
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,060
Boy, Dobbs.town is a long one this time.

698
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:54,560
I'm going to skip ahead to this story by Dr. Philo Drummond.

699
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,660
But first, here's a quote from Prescriptures 55-58.

700
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:06,180
The devil cannot seize up a bald man by the hair, but God will put food in the beard of a man.

701
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,060
And that man would be Dr. Philo Drummond, who wrote this song, I mean this story.

702
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,920
It's a very short story.

703
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:15,980
It's a very short story.

704
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,800
Mystical Birds.

705
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,400
The Browse Intro stuns itself into self-awareness.

706
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,820
Then, the show powers up to a new level where everything is fresh again.

707
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,620
Hal knows it all, and Puzzling knows everything else.

708
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,180
New band names come and go.

709
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,380
Doug has to sit on Hal to keep him quiet when Mom gets home or she'll freak.

710
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,240
More Bob.

711
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,700
More time movie yakking.

712
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,040
And tonight's show is a meteorite.

713
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,040
It's a storm in the bacon freakout desert of reality.

714
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,880
Show crashes the feces book.

715
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,540
23 seconds ago.

716
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,960
That equals the good old days.

717
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,360
Is that your internet?

718
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,820
Test of time cliff notes.

719
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,280
Punch him in the sack.

720
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,280
Change the show's diaper and put it to bed before dream fluff.

721
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,460
I am here because I want revenge.

722
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,900
Hal bellowed in a noble tone.

723
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,160
He slammed his face against Dee Atwell's fist.

724
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,040
With the force of 2,000...

725
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,880
796 badgers.

726
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,940
I frigging hate you Dee Atwell Woodman.

727
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,580
Dee Atwell sneered back.

728
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:29,300
Even more smarmy and still fingering the massive blade.

729
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,560
Hal, look at these three words.

730
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,380
He replied.

731
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,460
They looked at each other with ecstatic feelings.

732
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:43,240
Like two disgusted different donkeys boating at a very scheming accident.

733
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,120
Which had rockabilly music playing in the background.

734
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,040
And two disgusted different donkeys boating at a very scheming accident.

735
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,340
And two disgusted different donkeys boating at a very scheming accident.

736
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,980
And two tactless uncles chatting to the beat.

737
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,440
Dee Atwell regarded Haliland's scrawny eyebrows and greasy toenails.

738
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,080
He held out his hand.

739
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,080
Let us not fight.

740
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,420
He whispered gently.

741
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,380
Humph, pondered Haliland.

742
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,580
Please, begged Dee Atwell with puppy dog eyes.

743
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,760
Haliland looked jumpy.

744
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,880
His body blushing like a tired teeny tiny teapot.

745
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,040
Then Haliland came inside for a night's sleep.

746
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,040


747
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,820
And he took his glass of whiskey.

748
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,320
The Browse intro is a coded message to all losers.

749
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,900
Reminding them of the myth of success and the futility of existence.

750
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:36,820
For as to non-losers, the message inspires a truer, more real greatness than could otherwise be achieved without its wise guidance and brave counsel.

751
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:45,740
Then at 1 hour 12 minutes, Hal, Pseudo-Philo and Puzz begin the deconstruction of the pink soul.

752
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,300
Well, no, that was G. Gordon Gordon in deconstructing the pink soul.

753
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:07,800
But this story, Mystical Birds of Nature, is actually the typical blurb that Philo writes to describe puzzling evidence shows, which he posts like reruns.

754
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,420
Dear diary, I have yet to see my dearest human poop anywhere.

755
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,440
I suspect he may not know how.

756
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,480
I have resolved to try and teach him.

757
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,980
When we patrol the neighborhood each day in search of men with hats and beards.

758
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,500
It is embarrassing to do in public, but he must learn somehow.

759
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,940
I fear he will die of constipation if I don't succeed.

760
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,680
Fortunately, my dearest human seems to show some interest and is now collecting my feces in a small bag.

761
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,800
Soon.

762
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,540
Oh, man.

763
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:36,920
Ah.

764
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,200
Ah.

765
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:40,460
Ah.

766
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,360
Oh, I got a, uh...

767
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,460
Bring the upper lip down below the upper lip.

768
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:46,920
Upper teeth.

769
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,060
Be sure to keep it down until the fingers are in position.

770
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:51,620
Ah.

771
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,460
Ah.

772
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:52,840
Ah.

773
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,600
Ah.

774
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,720
Ah.

775
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,360
Ah.

776
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:55,720
Ah.

777
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:55,980
Ah.

778
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,140
Ah.

779
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,220
Ah.

780
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:56,380
Ah.

781
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:56,600
Ah.

782
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:56,940
Ah.

783
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:56,980
Ah.

784
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,060
Ah.

785
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,060


786
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,400
Ah.

787
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:57,760


788
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:57,840
Ah.

789
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,380
Ah.

790
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:58,960
Ah.

791
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,380
Ah.

792
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,340
Ah.

793
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,620
Ah.

794
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,960
Ah.

795
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,160


796
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,380
Ah.

797
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,120
Ah.

798
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:08,900
Ah.

799
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:14,700
Uh.

800
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,640
Oh..

801
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,260
Uh..

802
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:21,340

807
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,660

808
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:47,880
yeah I can hear the hiss the air noise we're still on the fringes of the

00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,160
atmosphere you know it's just a few molecules what happens if I push this place

00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:55,020
they were fixing the show and nobody knew exactly where it would be.

839
00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:00,020
Now, Subgenius Publishing guides you through this intriguing realm and unique and spectacular family library,

840
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,920
The Book of the Subgenius.

841
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,900
Here we go.

842
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,000
Visit Landry's.

843
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,360
They'll get mystery and magic.

844
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,720
Up there went the mystery and the magic.

845
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,320
Right there.

846
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,560
Why did you have to say that?

847
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,700
Well, Gary, we just thought we'd say it.

848
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,080
There went the mystery and the magic.

849
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,360
Yeah, it's all you.

850
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,780
Ah, yes, dear friends.

851
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:24,500
Welcome back to the show, The Subgenius Divival, our friends.

852
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:29,960
This is Dr. G. Gordon Gordon and Reverend Ivan Stagg.

853
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,540
We're sitting here to bring you the word of God.

854
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,400
Don't you feel divived now?

855
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,240
Don't be afraid.

856
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,880
It's just a little radio show.

857
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,840
Sometimes it gets scary.

858
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,360
It's a scary show.

859
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:04,100
It could get scarier depending on whatever parakeet mixes we drop in.

860
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:04,920
That's right.

861
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,020
But remember one thing.

862
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,620
It doesn't matter what life cycle you're on.

863
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,600
Over and over again.

864
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,980
And whether your basic metabolism is carbon, silicon, or plasma,

865
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,500
we're broadcasting to you because this is the first intergalactic show.

866
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:18,500


867
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,740
The Church of Dobbs.

868
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:25,480
Yes, friends, this is the church for every form of life that knows how to snicker.

869
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,500
Yes, indeed.

870
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:32,800
Every life form that can enjoy and appreciate slack, dear friends.

871
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,200
Yes, and the mysteries.

872
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,300
Those who appreciate the mysteries.

873
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,180
Ah, the mysteries, yes.

874
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:44,420
That sweet, sweet burning mystery of slack.

875
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,500
Yes, and when finally they learn the answer,

876
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,480
to the mystery of why on that great day,

877
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,640
that one day,

878
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,620
the sound of the slack goes rippling.

879
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,480
This is what it sounds like, friend.

880
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,560
Yes, listen to that slack rippling along.

881
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,220
Isn't that a lovely sound?

882
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,280
Oh, yes.

883
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,500
Receive the splendor of that slack sound, friends.

884
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,460
Ah, yes.

885
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,100
Ah, doesn't it drip through your frontal lobes?

886
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,340
Or depending upon your metabolism, of course, sometimes your back lobes.

887
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,680
Sometimes it just runs down their spine and dribbles out.

888
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,440
Sometimes it just dribbles through their cells and oozes through the pores.

889
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,660
Oh, this is slack.

890
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,520
But we know that somewhere out there you're listening to the sound of slack.

891
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,180
We can't give you too much of this air slack because...

892
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:38,620
Nay, nay.

893
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,460
No, no.

894
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,680
We can't let you get all hooked.

895
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,960
You'd just be sitting by your radios from now on.

896
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,840
You wouldn't be able to do anything.

897
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,460
We'll be waiting until next week.

898
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,020
That's right.

899
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,940
The subgenius hour of slack comes back.

900
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,100
Ah, but...

901
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:58,220
So that you can soak up some more of the healing power that can be mysteriously broadcast.

902
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,360
That's right.

903
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:07,520
So put your appendage, your pseudopod, your flipper, your hand, your manipulator, your chela, your mandible,

904
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,260
whatever you got, friends.

905
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:15,920
It doesn't matter if it's a scaly, horny carapace or a squamous, drooling mollusk-like.

906
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,480
You could secrete...

907
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:18,280
It's not a skin.

908
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:26,160
Just place your little sensory appendage upon your transmitter-receiver unit.

909
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,060
And you will receive the benefit of the slack, this air slack.

910
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:37,320
And when finally you discover the mystery, the answer to the mystery of the slack,

911
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:47,140
why, on that day you will be killed and re-killed and re-killed again in the scalding and scathing acid love.

912
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,100
Of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

913
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:50,640
Hallelujah.

914
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,400
Praise Bob.

915
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:51,960
Hallelujah.

916
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,480
E-I-E-I-E-I.

917
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,980
Ah, yes, friends.

918
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,000
Well, well, Dr. Stang, I think perhaps we ought to...

919
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,500
We ought to...

920
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,600
Turn the slack generator down a little bit.

921
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,020
Let these poor...

922
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,180
Just soothe them out with it.

923
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,520
Don't drop them off sudden now.

924
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,980
Just there you are.

925
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:08,800
Yes, friends.

926
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,920
Just a rug.

927
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,840
A rug of slack underneath.

928
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:17,060
That little tiny layer that separates you from the hard, cold floor of reality.

929
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,000
Well, we...

930
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,320
We'd love to get you hooked, but we wouldn't be able to supply it.

931
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:21,920
And that's right.

932
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,080
It'd be like Dawn of the Dead all over again.

933
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,840
Shambling zombies for Bob.

934
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,340
Trying to get some more of that great stuff that they...

935
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,820
That beautiful, that beautiful essence.

936
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,120
That vital secretion of the heart, soul of Dobbs.

937
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:45,420
That one thing that he possesses more than any other entity in the universe.

938
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,840
And, friends, we're talking about...

939
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,100
Slack.

940
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,120
Don't you wish you had it?

941
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,760
Don't you wish you had that sound with you all the time?

942
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,780
Don't you like to wrap yourself up in that slack?

943
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,640
That big, warm, fuzzy, woolly slack.

944
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,600
And just snuggle into it and say, ah.

945
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:09,260
If you had just one Bob pill, like this one in this little vial.

946
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,540
And we have one, listeners.

947
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,540
We have one.

948
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:17,040
And this one pill would be enough to impart...

949
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,640
Into you the essence of the stark fist of removal.

950
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,840
You would become Vishnu, the destroyer, friends.

951
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,700
That's right.

952
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:31,420
You would dance upon the helix of the ever-changing quantum universe,

953
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,340
shifting your eigenstata.

954
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:41,320
Dogs have always been my friend.

955
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,940
Dear diary, I must be more careful when licking my genitals.

956
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,640
My dearest human seems...

957
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,480
Sensitive about it.

958
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,380
Most likely because he's incapable of licking his own.

959
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,960
As always, I am in awe of his ability to be so noble.

960
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,780
Despite what I can only imagine are filthy, filthy genitals.

961
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,760
He hides them every day.

962
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:08,600
The dog clips are from Sad Dog Diary by Zee Frank.

963
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,560
Zee Frank.

964
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,780
Found on YouTube.

965
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,760
But the background barking you might hear...

966
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,280
Is real dogs.

967
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,920
We have four dogs here now.

968
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,580
Buddy the hound dog, Claudia the pit bull,

969
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,360
and two German shepherd puppies named Yeti and Chupi

970
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,980
who are battling in the background.

971
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,880
Dogs has always been my friend.

972
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,600
You know, when you do that, dogs will always be your friend.

973
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,160
They've always been my friend.

974
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:05,560
And we've had many dogs during these years.

975
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,640
Now we have Yuki.

976
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,700
And I think she...

977
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,820
I think they saved the best for little Yuki.

978
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:17,820


979
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:23,840
Yuki is the most loyal dog in the world.

980
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,800
He is the friendliest and the smartest.

981
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:40,080
And the most kindest and the most attentive of all the dogs that I've known.

982
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,520
Yuki has been here ever since.

983
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,360
He loves the world.

984
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:47,540
But he loves his family.

985
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:52,060
And I'm sure that if the owner ever asked about him to direct him here...

986
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:56,660
But I'm glad that the owner never missed him.

987
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,820
Because I surely would if he left me.

988
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:04,780
Me.

989
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,160
Well if you don't get...

990
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,320
Give him some flea powder.

991
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,980
If you don't get some flea powder in the bath, he wants to go in the car.

992
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:15,820
That's a fact.

993
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:16,960
You want to go on the ride?

994
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,040
you want to go to see the cattle you want to go see

995
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:19,560
me

996
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,240
oh

997
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,920
Oh, friends, that's Hinton Templar.

998
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,520
Hinton Templar.

999
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,460
Available only on the...

1000
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,820
our Slack, I'm afraid, so far.

1001
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,220
And here is a sermon.

1002
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:15,640
A sermon by Uncle Dr. Onan Kanabai.

1003
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,620
The Sermon of the Brains.

1004
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,940
This is a sermon that might not sit well with every listener,

1005
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,060
but having joined the Church of the Subgenius,

1006
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:31,260
you've demonstrated that you're ready for the uncomfortable truths of life.

1007
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,200
All I can say is, listen to this sermon,

1008
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,980
let it roll around in the back of your mind for a while,

1009
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,200
and then try preaching it in your own words.

1010
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,400
Not to me, I just said it.

1011
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:46,240
But say it to yourself in your own words

1012
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,620
when you have the feeling that the time is right.

1013
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,580
Ready?

1014
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:51,920
Okay.

1015
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,780
The subgenius must have slack.

1016
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,120
You've known that for a while, and it's a fact.

1017
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:03,920
The fact of the matter is, having something is a duality.

1018
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:08,240
There's the one who has, and there is that which is had.

1019
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,380
The fact of the matter is, in this world controlled by the conspiracy,

1020
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,540
you've been had.

1021
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,740
The subgenius and slack are not always one and the same.

1022
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:23,780
There are subgenii who have slack in the form of complaining,

1023
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,900
or getting themselves into trouble.

1024
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,280
And while their slack is foreign unto me,

1025
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,580
it is, in fact, their slack.

1026
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:38,200
This sermon is for the subgenius who does not, at this very moment, have slack.

1027
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,640
If you are that subgenius, then this sermon is specifically from me to you.

1028
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,800
And if you're not, well, you can think about the sermon

1029
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,020
and say it in your own words.

1030
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,660
But I'm not going to be saying the same words to some other subgenius

1031
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,640
who needs to hear it.

1032
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:52,580
Sometime.

1033
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,940
Not me, unless it is me.

1034
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,200
This is a sermon for the subgenius who does not have slack.

1035
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,540
You did all the right things.

1036
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,780
You didn't do any of the wrong things.

1037
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,980
You didn't bring this on yourself.

1038
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,980
And you sure don't prefer things to be as they are.

1039
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,220
Even if you don't have a sense of life being fair,

1040
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,020
you're kind of wondering if things might be a little less.

1041
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,120
Not fair.

1042
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,840
It feels like playing a game where somebody cheated,

1043
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,740
but there's nobody else there and you're not even playing.

1044
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,120
I don't want to go on too much about this darkness.

1045
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,120
You know that beat down well enough.

1046
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,880
You know what I'm talking about.

1047
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,840
This sermon is for the subgenius who does not have slack.

1048
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,880
It's for that subgenius.

1049
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,900
Maybe you.

1050
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,520
If it were in my power, I'd make it better.

1051
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,340
I'd make those who put you down pay.

1052
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,580
Even if you put yourself down.

1053
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,840
Especially if you put yourself down.

1054
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,220
But put me down as someone not in power to make anybody pay.

1055
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,000
That's a salesman's job.

1056
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,340
And we have a salesman who is walking that beat even as I speak.

1057
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:12,980
What is in my power to do is offer a little explanation for what is happening

1058
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,920
and a few ideas that might help.

1059
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,500
This is a sermon that might not be enough.

1060
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,060
It might not sit well with every listener.

1061
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:24,200
The plain truth is that the Elder Gods feed on mortal suffering.

1062
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:28,120
And that's the sum total of why these things happen.

1063
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:34,400
The non-scientific, more poetic soul subgenius doesn't want the plain truth, though.

1064
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:40,880
The religious and not spiritual subgenius wants it couched in some kind of parable.

1065
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,260
Well, here it is.

1066
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,040
But it also might not sit well with you.

1067
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,320
The subgenius brain is not like the human brain.

1068
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:56,320
The subgenius brain is not even like the subgenius brain that sits next to that first subgenius brain.

1069
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:03,760
The subgenius brain is, for some, what sits in between that subgenius and slack.

1070
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,580
That subgenius brain isn't a bridge to slack,

1071
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,000
or a lens for interpreting slack,

1072
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,500
or a pipe to suck up and hold that slack through.

1073
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,980
That subgenius brain, for some,

1074
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:24,780
is the very obstacle that makes the subgenius and slack a duality instead of being as one.

1075
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:29,140
If that sounds like you, then this sermon is for you.

1076
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:34,380
It is within my power to offer a little explanation for what has happened.

1077
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,640
And the explanation is,

1078
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,660
that's just the way things turned out.

1079
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,660
You didn't deserve it.

1080
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,760
You didn't earn it.

1081
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,960
It's not a punishment for something you did do or didn't do.

1082
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,580
You got the brain you got.

1083
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:55,180
It's a kind of brain that isn't quite broken enough to have been bred out of our ancestors,

1084
00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:01,740
but isn't quite functional enough to leave you alone when you just want to get some stuff done.

1085
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,160
Just like the answer to,

1086
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,060
when will we get there,

1087
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:06,800
is,

1088
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,120
when we get there.

1089
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,620
The answer to,

1090
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,420
why is my brain like this,

1091
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:12,380
is,

1092
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,820
because your brain is like this.

1093
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,960
And that's all there is to it.

1094
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,080
There is no more.

1095
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:19,560
Bummer.

1096
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,780
It's a bummer.

1097
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,020
But to know this is bummer is good.

1098
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:28,100
It means you can stop asking why.

1099
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:33,380
You can stop blaming yourself or past experiences or your genetics or reality.

1100
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,920
Well, you can keep blaming them,

1101
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,360
but only if it's doing you some good to keep blaming them.

1102
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,780
Blame them all.

1103
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,480
Blame me.

1104
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,180
Blame God.

1105
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,200
See where that gets you.

1106
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,420
Because if it's where you want to be,

1107
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,360
then blame harder.

1108
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:51,620
And if asking why and casting blame are not doing you any good,

1109
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,820
then it's good to stop.

1110
00:53:53,940 --> 00:54:01,520
Stop right now and stop again later when you ask why again later and cast blame later.

1111
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:09,500
Practice the bummer until it becomes as natural as practicing asking why and practicing casting blame.

1112
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,060
Get good at the bummer of because.

1113
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:17,540
The more you practice the bummer of because,

1114
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,840
the more you'll get good at it.

1115
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:24,700
You're going to be glad you did when you first move on to the next idea that might help.

1116
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:31,480
And that idea is to get a good look at people whose bummer is much, much more of a bummer than yours.

1117
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:36,160
Every single bad thing that you've done or that has been done to you,

1118
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:43,040
I'm going to guarantee that it won't take too long to find someone who has done worse or who has been done worse.

1119
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,380
They might be dead from it or in a bad way.

1120
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:53,120
Sometimes you'll see that they're just getting along with things because they've gotten good at the bummer of because.

1121
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,540
You can too.

1122
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,760
Or you can be less bad at it, which is enough.

1123
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,620
When you find those subgeni who have less slack than you,

1124
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:08,080
why, you'll remember this sermon and you'll be able to tell it to them.

1125
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,600
Not because you're better than they are,

1126
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,020
but because we're all handing the sputtering out of our mouths.

1127
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,560
We're all throwing torch of slack to each other in a dark cave

1128
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,740
and sometimes it'll be your turn to hold it for a while.

1129
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,160
I have other ideas that might help.

1130
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:23,540
Drugs.

1131
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,320
Or medicine drugs.

1132
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,540
Or meditation.

1133
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,560
Or eating well and getting some exercise.

1134
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:35,600
Or reading amateur humor publications issued by mail order mind control cults.

1135
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:40,480
Making peace with the people you aren't blaming anymore, that might help.

1136
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,540
They might still be jerks,

1137
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,820
and you might still be a jerk,

1138
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:50,880
but let there be a general jerk amnesty to free up that energy for some exciting new jerk to interact with.

1139
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,220
It might help to do less of the thing that definitely doesn't help.

1140
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,240
And you know exactly what that is.

1141
00:55:59,340 --> 00:55:59,860
Exactly.

1142
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,720
Whoever told you that you could always be happy,

1143
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,760
that you deserve to always be happy,

1144
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,040
that person told you a lie.

1145
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,240
You can't,

1146
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,580
and nobody gets what they deserve.

1147
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,040
Bummer.

1148
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,660
I'm here to tell you that there are means to be less miserable.

1149
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:22,560
Less miserable is all the slack that some subgenius brains can handle.

1150
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:23,740
Think of it.

1151
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,180
As much slack as your brain can handle.

1152
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,200
That's fantastic.

1153
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:31,980
Those weirdo contented normal seeming subgenie-y

1154
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,080
whose brains are only half as slacked up as they could be,

1155
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:38,520
and your broken brain is overclocked with slack.

1156
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,360
I'm glad to see it when that happens.

1157
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,420
If you want more slack, try anything,

1158
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:52,080
except the stuff you've practiced for decades that never works.

1159
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:59,300
More slack for some subgenius brains is slightly less miserable for a short period of time.

1160
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:03,260
Some subgenius brains don't even get that, friend,

1161
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,240
and they don't get it even once.

1162
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,420
You've suffered this far.

1163
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,500
You can keep suffering this far.

1164
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:08,760
You can keep suffering longer.

1165
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,420
But maybe not only suffer.

1166
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,900
Maybe you can see that sputtering torch somewhere off in the cave

1167
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,680
as we pass it back and forth.

1168
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,400
It's hard to tell how far away it is or what it would take to hold onto it,

1169
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,320
but I have faith that you're ready.

1170
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,060
When it's right there, grab a hold, get a good look,

1171
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,480
and then it's gone.

1172
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,560
Was it never there?

1173
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,380
No, it was there.

1174
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,380
And someone you maybe don't even know is holding it for you,

1175
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,780
until it's your turn again.

1176
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:44,280
I have faith that when it's my turn, you'll hand it to me.

1177
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:49,820
You already have so very many times.

1178
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,800
Thank you.

1179
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:57,380
And thank you, Dr. Onan Kanabite,

1180
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,820
for that unusually sober-sounding,

1181
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,960
but hopefully very helpful rant.

1182
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,260
And always,

1183
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,140
praise Bob.

1184
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:15,220
This is the Hour of Slack from Church of the Subgenius.

1185
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,040
Not the entire church, actually.

1186
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,760
It's from the Subgenius Foundation and many contributors.

1187
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,640
And you can learn more at subgenius.com.

1188
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,160
A lot more.

1189
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:33,720
Technically, I think over 200,000 pages more.

1190
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:38,480
And you can also read it.

1191
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:47,920
Or write to us at Post Office Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1192
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,840
The Subgenius Foundation.

1193
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,320
Or just write to me, Ivan Stang,

1194
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,720
stang at subgenius.com.

1195
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,080
And let there be slack.

1196
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,420
Oh, thank you, Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

1197
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,380
for the background music,

1198
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,940
which is from the instrumental jambs

1199
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:14,520
called Witch Disco.

1200
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,880
.

1201
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:16,880


1202
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,840
.

1203
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:21,840


1204
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:21,840


1205
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:21,840


1206
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:21,840


1207
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:21,840


1208
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:21,840


1209
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:21,840


1210
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:21,840


1211
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:21,840


1212
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:21,840


1213
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:21,840


1214
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:21,980
.

1215
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,080
.

1216
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,280
.

1217
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:26,300
.

1218
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,780
.

1219
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1220
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1221
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1222
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1223
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1224
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1225
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1226
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1227
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1228
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1229
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1230
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1231
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1232
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1233
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1234
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1235
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1236
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1237
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1238
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1239
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1240
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1241
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1242
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760

1246
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760


1247
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:28,760
