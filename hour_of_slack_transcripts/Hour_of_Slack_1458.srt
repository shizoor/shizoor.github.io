1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,960
Okay, we're rolling.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,360
Hey, church, put the church in order.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,360
Here we go.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:06,620
Hey!

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,480
Hey!

6
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,480
What?

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,740
Who am I?

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,420
I'm the record.

9
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,980
Genie the record.

10
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,940
Genie the magic record.

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,480
Why, I can do anything.

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:23,680
Oh?

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,360
You don't think so?

14
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,140
Well, I'll prove it.

15
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,400
Alakazoot, I'm a whistle.

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,600
Whistle.

17
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,860
That was easy.

18
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,900
Alakazing, I'm the self-genius.

19
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,640
Our self-match.

20
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,080
Here's your host.

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,420
Yeah, by this time, we're going to present you to the electric church.

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,480
Hey, we're going to dedicate to the feedback family.

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,960
And all the human beings and you people.

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,680
And if you all stand up, put your right hand across.

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,860
Whatever you can find, put it across.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,320
Oh, wow.

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,100
You know, you just stand up and, you know, uh-oh.

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,760
Yeah, okay.

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,420
I'll tell you what.

30
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,540
Yeah, we're going to get into all of that.

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,120
Don't worry, man.

32
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:14,480
Don't worry.

33
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,160
You don't have no program.

34
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,700
Just relax.

35
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,680
When I say toilet paper, that's when you come rolling out, okay?

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,400
Well, kid, then you want me to play Recorded in 1738 in the Benjamin Franklin Studios?

37
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,480
Some of my friends have prepared a song.

38
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:29,720
I'll tell you what.

39
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,300
I'm going to play a song that they desire you to hear.

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,180
And I would appreciate it if you would listen to it.

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,480
Also, please play it for your friends.

42
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:49,160
And even after election day, please run it off once in a while to remind you that I am in Washington and will be watching out for your interest.

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,180
The song will now be sung by the Lang and Glee Club.

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,620
Well, I'm up in this room

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,460
Looking all around

46
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Well, I look out my bellybutton window

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,420
And I see nothing but a whole lot of flowers

48
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,240
And I'm wondering if they want me around

49
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,540
Well, what is all the fuss about out there?

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,760
What seems to be the sham?

51
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,200
Cause, you know, if you don't want me around, babe

52
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
Well, I'll be glad to go back to the street, babe

53
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,480
And even take a longer rest

54
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,460
Before coming down to shoot again

55
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,260
Man, I remember the last time it was good

56
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,840
They were still arguing about me then

57
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,120
So if you don't want me now

58
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,100
Give or take

59
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,800
You only got two hundred days

60
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,180
If you don't want me now

61
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,180
Make up your mind

62
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,300
Where I'm at

63
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,120
Cause I ain't coming this way too much more again

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,900
Well, you know they got pills for ills and thrills and even

65
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,540
Spill the lot for you

66
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,940
Oh, I just forgot that.

67
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,000
I feel evil.

68
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,680
I'm evil

69
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,580
If you want some more, you'll come to the right place.

70
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,940
Well, since my babies left me

71
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,260
I've had to pay to jail

72
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,460
Cause down the island is the true home of the rich man.

73
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:29,460


74
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:29,920
Get out of here, I tell you!

75
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,680
Okay, here we go.

76
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,060
One.

77
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,700
Two.

78
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,520
Three.

79
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,140
Four.

80
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:38,760
Heh.

81
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,740
Two for the money.

82
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,980
Two for the show.

83
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:41,980


84
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:41,980


85
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,780
Do it right!

86
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,480
So, here we go!

87
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,520
We got d flavored!

88
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:54,520


89
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:54,520


90
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:54,520


91
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,100
We're going for the money!

92
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,220
I swear

93
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,620
I'll do anything

94
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,540
I wanna do, John

95
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,100
All my life

96
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,280
They all feel bad

97
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,220
Friends, Jimi Hendrix could be a really funny guy,

98
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,960
and this show is dedicated to funny Hendrix.

99
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,760
And unless you're a victim of Hendrix mania like I sometimes am,

100
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,320
you probably haven't heard these versions of these songs.

101
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,280
We even have Hendrix preaching later.

102
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,200
Our man in Dobbs Town, G. Gordon Gordon,

103
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,360
found a huge mass of rare Hendrix in Bob's Falls.

104
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,040
Recordings unheard since 1970,

105
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,300
and tonight we're playing the funniest,

106
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,880
and maybe the most surrealistic.

107
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,880
Oh, God.

108
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,840
You always are a part of me

109
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,500
I see you in my dreams

110
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,640
I see you when I dream

111
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,640
You are my catastrophe

112
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,300
Okay, we got it.

113
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,100
Okay.

114
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,780
Okay.

115
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,160
Okay.

116
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,880
Okay.

117
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,500
Look Old Viana

118
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,380
Here comes a flew

119
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,220
The thirteenth of many times

120
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,660
Just like a fool

121
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,180
Triple-breasted, green, red motherfuckin' dark-toed

122
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,820
Playin' the violin

123
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,800
Hittin' wrong notes

124
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,480
Woah!

125
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,080
Look Old Vianna

126
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,460
It's comin' my way

127
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,120
When it's around, I never have a happy day.

128
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,380
He gives me bad luck by rubbing his ring.

129
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,760
See that? I just broke a guitar string.

130
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,840
Oh, look all beyond her.

131
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,460
He's falling at my baby.

132
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,620
Now she says she's gonna leave me in her bed.

133
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,240
I don't need a bath.

134
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,980
Look like him hanging around.

135
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,740
He's knocking on my door.

136
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,480
Now my house is burning down.

137
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,420
Crackle, crackle.

138
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,800
Pop, pop.

139
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,880
Look all beyond her.

140
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,440
This is the end.

141
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,500
He just now said he wants to be my friend.

142
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,960
When it's around, I can't do nothing right.

143
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,700
He's got me wearing shades in the middle of the night.

144
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,620
Look all beyond her.

145
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,980
Yeah.

146
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,320
Look all beyond her, baby.

147
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,000
Get away, get away from here.

148
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,200
Wow.

149
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,420
Look all beyond her, yeah.

150
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,720
Look all beyond her, baby.

151
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,920
Look all beyond her, yeah.

152
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,480
Look all beyond her.

153
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,620
Where's my shotgun?

154
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,880
I can blow this fool away.

155
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,900
Get away from here.

156
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,620
Look all beyond her, baby.

157
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah, hey.

158
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,880
Look all beyond her.

159
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,540
Look all beyond her, baby.

160
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,880
Look all beyond her.

161
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,400
Should I get my doner with a place on her side.

162
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,720
Yeah, yeah.

163
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,380
Yeah.

164
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Yeah yeah.

165
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,180
Yeah yeah yeah.

166
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah, oh, oh, oh yeah, yeah.

167
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,740
Yeah yeah.

168
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,380
Yeah yeah.

169
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:42,520


170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000


171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,020
Yeah.

172
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

173
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,380


174
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,380


175
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,380


176
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,380


177
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,380


178
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,380


179
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,380


180
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,700
And that's all I got.

181
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:46,700


182
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:46,700


183
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:46,800
Oh, yeah.

184
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:46,820
The Oh, look up to me.

185
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,220
When I go naked.

186
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,260
When I go naked.

187
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,260


188
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,720
When I go naked.

189
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,400
Down the lane.

190
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,300
Yeah, yeah.

191
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,320
Holders and goldens.

192
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,900
Oh, I'm about to turn my plow on you.

193
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,480
I'm about to turn my plow on you.

194
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,820
I'm going to ride on all these red riders.

195
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,620
The night of the night.

196
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,680
The night of the night.

197
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,100
The night of the night.

198
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:26,280
The night of the night.

199
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:36,840
The night of the night.

200
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,500
The night of the night.

201
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:40,000
The night of the night.

202
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:15,220
The night of the night.

203
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,800
The night of the night.

204
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,320
Oh, my God.

205
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,460
How do we hang out like that?

206
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,600
If you look around you,

207
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,620
you will see a few minds being blown.

208
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
It's happening.

209
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,580
It's happening, baby.

210
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,160
Yeah.

211
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,780
I hope you're enjoying your ride.

212
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,240
Oh, yeah.

213
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,440
Let's get the existence of God issue aside for a later volume

214
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:25,400
and just stipulate that in some way, self-replicating organisms came into existence on this planet

215
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,440
and immediately began trying to get rid of each other,

216
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,560
either by spamming their environments with rough copies of themselves

217
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,960
or by more direct means which hardly need to be belabored.

218
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,300
Most of them failed and their genetic legacy was erased from the universe forever,

219
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,700
but a few found some way to survive and to propagate.

220
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:54,000
After about three billion years of this sometimes zany, frequently tedious fugue of carnality and carnage,

221
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,740
New Waterhouse IV was born in Murdo, South Dakota,

222
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,380
to Blanche, the wife of a congregational preacher named Bunyan Waterhouse.

223
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:11,220
Like every other creature on the face of the earth, Godfrey was, by birthright, a stupendous badass.

224
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:18,020
Albeit in the somewhat narrow technical sense that he could trace his ancestry back up a long line

225
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:25,220
of slightly less highly evolved stupendous badasses to that very first self-replicating,

226
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,860
which, given the number and variety of its descendants,

227
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,440
might justifiably be described as the most stupendous badass of all time.

228
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,580
Everyone and everything that wasn't a stupendous badass was dead.

229
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,100
As nightmarishly lethal, mimetically programmed death machines went,

230
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,140
these were the nicest you could ever hope to meet.

231
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,100
And that's right near the beginning of a book I'm loving,

232
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,320
called The Cryptonomicon, or actually just called Cryptonomicon by Neil Stevenson.

233
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,080
I love this book, and I have been in hog heaven listening to this,

234
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,140
a lot of Hendrix stuff that I never heard before, which is saying something.

235
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:19,140
And in fact, we will, well actually Lonesome Cowboy Dave should be calling in any minute now.

236
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:24,400
I've got another couple of Hendrix songs.

237
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,280
You might not...

238
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,560
You may have heard before, but not these versions.

239
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,120
And also, he'll be preaching at the end.

240
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,040
A lot of...

241
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Oh, I'll turn Princess Wee on.

242
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:35,820
She's here.

243
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:44,640
A lot of really good stuff came off of a commercially available four-CD box set

244
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,620
called West Coast Seattle Boy.

245
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,780
And when I was writing the credits for this show,

246
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,520
I was writing the initials of that album.

247
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,380
West Coast Seattle Boy.

248
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,120
West Coast Seattle Boy, WCSB,

249
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,900
which is the radio station in Cleveland from which we're broadcasting tonight.

250
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,780
And I'm sure you'd rather hear this Hendrix music than me,

251
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,900
but that's too bad, because this is the hour of slack.

252
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,540
And when we get instrumentals, we sometimes talk over them,

253
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,920
and I just told you where you can find them.

254
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,420
This actually is called Villanova Junction Jam.

255
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,380
And actually, I don't think it is on WCSB, West Coast Seattle Boy.

256
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,320
It was on something that J.R. Bob Dobbs recorded.

257
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,300
He used to run around with Hendrix a lot,

258
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,480
and he left a lot of tapes in Dobbstown,

259
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,080
and apparently Dr. G. Gordon Gordon dug them up.

260
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,400
We are so lucky.

261
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,160
Yes.

262
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,140
I could go on and on about that, and I might.

263
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,140
Here, we can just turn this.

264
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,880
Here we can just turn this.

265
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,440
My kids weren't real big Hendrix fans, and my parents hated it.

266
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,400
But Lonesome Cowboy Dave probably knows all about it.

267
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,720
Yeah, I'll tell you all about it.

268
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,140
No, not really.

269
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,020
I won't be rest of reason right now.

270
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,580
Well...

271
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,300
Is everything okay there, Dave, where you are?

272
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,260
I mean, by okay, I mean...

273
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,320
Well, I don't know what I mean.

274
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,840
Well, I have to hold the phone up to my head, funny.

275
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,500
I'm just going to make a comment before we begin.

276
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,680
I know that many times we layer our performances

277
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,440
with different aspects of the absurd,

278
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,800
and also there's the unexpected occasionally

279
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,460
and the other things that create laughter.

280
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,180
There's often many, many sophomore jokes

281
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,900
about...

282
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,560
...experienced inflations and things like that.

283
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,280
But if you think about it really, really, really, really hard,

284
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,120
if you really try to put your finger on any one particular thing,

285
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,920
I think we're just like rats in a maze

286
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,420
running around and grabbing the cookies at the right time

287
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,740
so we get, like, genetic overpoints.

288
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,860
Yeah, so?

289
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,000
Well, I was hoping if we got some genetic overpoints,

290
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,500
we might get, you know, a little bit of ubermatch.

291
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:24,820
That's credit.

292
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,060
Ubermatch credit and underpoints.

293
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,000
Ubermatch credit?

294
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,220
Hey, did you catch that song about X-Day

295
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,200
that I just played, the Hendrix song,

296
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:39,560
called...

297
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,200
Yeah, I know.

298
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,560
...The Stars That Play With Laughing Sam's Dice?

299
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,060
I don't understand that, though.

300
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,960
It was like Hendrix's secret...

301
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,080
A secret subgenius, yeah.

302
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,700
Well, he...

303
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,960
You know, Bob...

304
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,180
Bob...

305
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:00,620
Dobbs actually started the church of the subgenius in 1953.

306
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,880
And when Hendrix was just starting out,

307
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,040
he may have been a subgenius,

308
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,160
but I think he was a good subgenius

309
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,680
and schismed and started his own religion,

310
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,460
which he called the Electric Church or the Electric Sky Church.

311
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,360
Unfortunately, their church headquarters, believe it or not,

312
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,380
was not much better than ours.

313
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,040
It was...

314
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,520
And it was somewhere in New York.

315
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,240
Huh?

316
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,440
At least it wasn't in Dallas.

317
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,320
Right.

318
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,840
Which I guess is the home of all evil.

319
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,120
Well, there's a story about Jimi Hendrix in Dallas

320
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,360
where he...

321
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,780
I don't know how many concerts he played in Dallas,

322
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,400
but this was the one I saw when I was 15 years old.

323
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,220
And it sounded terrible to me,

324
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,340
because where I was sitting and the place it was in.

325
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,360
But as I...

326
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,840
I read in a book that when...

327
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,920
This would have been 1969.

328
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,360
And Hendrix was backstage getting ready to go on

329
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,840
and these Dallas cops walk into the room

330
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,580
and they look at Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding

331
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,260
studiously avoiding Hendrix.

332
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,560
And they said,

333
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,640
if that N-word plays the Star Spangled Banner,

334
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,080
he ain't gonna leave Dallas.

335
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,940
He's alive.

336
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,800
Well, needless to say,

337
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:32,220
Hendrix went out and as people in the close rows describe it,

338
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,460
it was a great show.

339
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,460
Unfortunately, the bootleg that I heard of it

340
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,000
sounded like what I heard,

341
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,760
which was a giant auditorium made of concrete.

342
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,280
He did play the Star Spangled Banner.

343
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,580
He did.

344
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,280
Yeah, he did.

345
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,220
And he left Dallas alive.

346
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,480
The cops ran off with their tails tucked between their legs.

347
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,240
And I wonder if he did that song, Mr. Bad Luck.

348
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,380
Which I played earlier.

349
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,560
Which...

350
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,120
Wasn't he one of the original founders of the town, Mr. Bad Luck?

351
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,180
He was kind of like a Mr. Potter's guy in Capitals.

352
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
It's a wonderful life.

353
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,920
Like, you know, a real curmudgeonly old capitalist

354
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,260
who'd do anything for...

355
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,020
And originally cornered the oil market.

356
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,900
Are you talking about Jimi Hendrix or Bob

357
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,860
or that Dallas cop or which?

358
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,400
Um, Mr. Bad Luck.

359
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,220
Oh, right, right, right, right.

360
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,680
Sorry.

361
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,520
My tummy's upset.

362
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,180
I'm distracted.

363
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,060
It's true.

364
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,120
I have a very sneaky feeling that perhaps you can't even hear me.

365
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,260
Because you guys sound like you're...

366
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:45,000
Well, Dave, I think the station's bad line is being bad.

367
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,800
Your phone sounded fine earlier, right?

368
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,180
Well, it sounds terrible here.

369
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,100
It sure sounded fine to me.

370
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,180
It's...

371
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,360
It sounds really bad here.

372
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:01,740
It's making that special WCSB ocean noise in the background.

373
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,060
Well, to me, what I'm hearing are squirrels.

374
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,460
I'm not using my landline.

375
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,680
I'm using the one I just called We Run.

376
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,580
Right, I know.

377
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,520
It's not your fault.

378
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,460
It's the...

379
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,540
And it's not actually the station's fault.

380
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:19,700
It's the phone company and the university work very, very, very slowly together.

381
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,460
Because I guess that's their idea of slap.

382
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,100
But it isn't very...

383
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,240
It's not very good for this show.

384
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,940
They keep on taking breaks to go in and get a beer or two and stuff like that.

385
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,860
And taking a little drive, you know what I mean?

386
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,360
Stuff like that.

387
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,780
Dave, I hate to say it, but this is really sounding bad on this end.

388
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
Well, she might try and call again.

389
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,820
Yeah, why don't you do that?

390
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,480
I'll just...

391
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,360
I'll tell you what.

392
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,320
Call back.

393
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,060
I'll play the song My Friend, which is four minutes long.

394
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,560
So why don't you call back in four minutes?

395
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,440
Four minutes.

396
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:55,940
Okay?

397
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,340
Thank you.

398
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,440
I'll call back in four minutes.

399
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,320
Okay.

400
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,080
Okay, bye.

401
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:00,500
Okay.

402
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,120
And that means I have to do this.

403
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,220
Okay.

404
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,320
Okay.

405
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:11,820
Okay.

406
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,280
Okay.

407
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,500
Okay.

408
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:22,640


409
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:22,760


410
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,080


411
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:23,260


412
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:23,320


413
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:23,460
Okay.

414
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,460


415
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,460


416
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,460


417
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,460


418
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,460


419
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,460


420
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,460


421
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,980
Okay.

422
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,960
Okay.

423
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,760
Okay.

424
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,440
Okay.

425
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,540
Okay.

426
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:08,720
Okay.

427
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:09,260


428
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:09,300


429
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:10,600
Okay.

430
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,440
Okay.

431
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,160
Okay.

432
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,980
Okay.

433
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:30,760
It said, come around to my room with a tooth in the middle and bring along a bottle and a present in.

434
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:37,180
Come along with a hole in the wall and bring along a present in.

435
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:48,140
Sometimes it's not so easy, especially when your only friend sees and talks, walks, looks and feels like you.

436
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,640
You feel walking, same like him.

437
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,600
Must turn the page right now.

438
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,320
Well, I'm riding through L.A. on a bicycle built for fools.

439
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,500
I see one of my old buddies and he says, you don't look like the way you used to do.

440
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,900
Well, I say, some people look like a coin box.

441
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,200
He says, like, you ain't got no coins to spare.

442
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,080
I just pick up my prize.

443
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,100
I ride from underneath the payphone and come with breath right out of my hair.

444
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:38,220
Yeah, but sometimes it's not so easy, especially when your only friend sees, looks, talks, feels like you.

445
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,860
And you do the same, just like him.

446
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:53,420
Well, I just got out of Scandinavian jail and I'm on my way straight to you.

447
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,520
But I'm feeling so dizzy.

448
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,840
I take a quick look in the mirrors to make sure my friend's there, too.

449
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,880
And you know that I don't drink coffee, so you fill my cup full of sand.

450
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,540
But the frozen tea leaves on the bottom, cherry lipstick around a broken edge.

451
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,440
And my phone, that left, may you talk.

452
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,380
This talks, looks like you.

453
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,060
And you feel and talk just like him.

454
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,420
Do parts of the song very, very moments.

455
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,500
Lastly, you can listen to what he says.

456
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,820
Fill my cup.

457
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:48,820


458
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:48,980
W house.

459
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:49,960
W room.

460
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:49,960


461
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,000
You do it all, task, multitask, every time, right?

462
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,000


463
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,780
papaya talk po us it's it's apple pie bun

464
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:50,780


465
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,080
if I get through this to say

466
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,820
that I get

467
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:51,820


468
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,540
You have to full reading,

469
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,060
get prepared,

470
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,080
and text

471
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,440
Well, well, well, well.

472
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:13,300
I hope that when Dave calls back, things will work better.

473
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:18,260
It's kind of some sort of magical situation that this board runs on.

474
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,140
Sometimes the magic ain't there.

475
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,700
Boy, it was really getting...

476
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,480
Oh, well.

477
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,180
Oh, well.

478
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,180
It was getting too crunchy.

479
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,260
What did you say, Princess Wee?

480
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,520
It was getting too crunchy.

481
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,560
Yes, it's a crunchy noise we get on that line.

482
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:46,540
And if it doesn't work, I've got more of that Captain Beefheart sung by women.

483
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,640
But hopefully this will sound better.

484
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,460
What?

485
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,920
No.

486
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,640
What?

487
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,220
Hi, Dave.

488
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,940
This is weirder than before.

489
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:00,960
It's crunchy.

490
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,700
Can you hear me at all?

491
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:07,720
Yeah, we can hear you clearly, but there's this nasty background crunchiness.

492
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,620
I can't hear that on your end, but my signal is clear, right?

493
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,320
Well, it's very bad here.

494
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:25,200
And I'm afraid we're not going to be able to subject the listeners to this crunchiness.

495
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,100
I don't think.

496
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,280
It makes me sad.

497
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,900
It's tragic.

498
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,000
We got a suggestion.

499
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,720
We need to block out line one first before Dave calls in.

500
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,640
This isn't line one.

501
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
Line one is blocked.

502
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,400
Oh, okay.

503
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,720
It's line three.

504
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,440
I see.

505
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
This is the only one we can get, apparently.

506
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,060
Okay.

507
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,520
Well, thanks for the try there.

508
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:50,820
Yeah.

509
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,080
Yeah.

510
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,260
Dave, do you have any messages that you can say over the scratchy crunchiness?

511
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,020
Well, will they be clearly understood by my audience?

512
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:07,500
When I make these pronouncements, I'd like to make sure that each and every one of the

513
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,940
young people I'm talking about, they understand these subgenius values and the virtues and

514
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,180
the things that we're expected to do.

515
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,900
As long as I don't turn any music on, yeah, they can understand you.

516
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,120
Well, I can't.

517
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,040
I can't even hear any music.

518
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,960
All I can hear is you.

519
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,480
There isn't any.

520
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,940
That was all really clear, what you just said, Dave.

521
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,040
I think the listeners got that message.

522
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,220
That wasn't the message, though.

523
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,660
Oh.

524
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,000
That was the preface.

525
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,620
Oh, that was the preface of the message.

526
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:35,940
Okay.

527
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,260
The prepuce of the message.

528
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:37,940
The prepuce.

529
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,220
Well, yeah, it was the intro of the message that was set up.

530
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,840
That was the foreskin.

531
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,180
Okay, so whip it back and what's the message?

532
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,440
Well, the message is, of course.

533
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:59,480
To maintain these virtues and vices and to advertise our benign aspects and to more thoroughly

534
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:07,200
pronounce each punishmental value that's incrementally added to the core delusion of

535
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,280
the entire spectrum.

536
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,720
Now it's getting to where your message is being lost.

537
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,940
I think.

538
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,440
You mean verb?

539
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,060
Well, it was lost before you started emitting it, I think.

540
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,120
I think.

541
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,120


542
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,120


543
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,120


544
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,120


545
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,120


546
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:20,220
I think.

547
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,700
But it's, the sound is crunchy.

548
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,400
Very.

549
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,700
It sounds like a bad radio sound effect that's supposed to be fire burning, like somebody's

550
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,980
crumpling paper.

551
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,960
That's fire burning.

552
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,060
Only there's kind of an ocean in the distance.

553
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:45,400
It could be a plosive device planted in the microphone system because I noticed each time

554
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,920
you said ca-ca or any sound with a ca or a hard plosive piece.

555
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,100
I think it's a sound that it sounded like the burning you were talking about.

556
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,840
The aforementioned emission of the particles in between.

557
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,040
The P sound.

558
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,180
Right.

559
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,580
That's one way of putting it, if you were going to put it anywhere.

560
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,920
But I think, you know, we might fry our organs just trying to get around the idea.

561
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,700
To scope it, to fully grasp it.

562
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:17,080
You know, line three is the only one that lights up when somebody calls.

563
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:17,800
Ah.

564
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,540
And somebody tried earlier.

565
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:27,620
In the show, which is, denotes someone who is not a regular hour of slacklist for them

566
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,100
to make that attempt at all.

567
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,640
So, Dave, I guess we should, well, it's not too, it's not too horrible now.

568
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,700
No, the listener.

569
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,880
Now that we don't, but I can't, you know, if I, if I put the Jimi Hendrix music in the

570
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,240
background, it's, it's really not, they fight each other.

571
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,540
The crunching.

572
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,260
Yes, yes.

573
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,520
And the crunching, actually, we should have.

574
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,520


575
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,200
We shouldn't do this.

576
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,540
The crunching sounds like a bad broadcast signal and that's not what's happening.

577
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,340
The signal is fine.

578
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:02,260
It is the, the, but either my ears or the phone line are guilty.

579
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,360
And how about your ears, Princess?

580
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:10,160
Oh, no, I can clearly hear all the mushing and the crushing and the, it's like dull popcorn

581
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:10,820
popping.

582
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,640
Dull.

583
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,100
Dull.

584
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,740
That's the problem.

585
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,280
So you can hear, in other words, you can hear line three.

586
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,420
But if you were to take your headphones off and just listen to, you know, if you were,

587
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,960
but you can tell it's not coming from here, but it is.

588
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,920
It has nothing to do with you, Dave.

589
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:35,320
But what I'm going to do is move on and, and I'm afraid we're going to have to continue

590
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,860
this conversation hopefully next week.

591
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,940
Even if we have to pick you up in Ashtabula and drag you here and put you in front of

592
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:47,260
a microphone and then take you back home again, which I really don't want to do.

593
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,060
So I'm going to go back.

594
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:57,800
There's, there's, there was this Hendrix song called Calling All Devil's Children, where

595
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,580
it's just a jam for the first three minutes.

596
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:06,040
But the last three minutes, the jam kind of goes under and it sounds like he's standing

597
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,200
on a chair preaching to a room full of people.

598
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,140
Now, like the famous slow, long version of Voodoo Child.

599
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,240
That's actually, it was actually done.

600
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:22,360
It was done in the studio and he staged the make the audience to make it sound like it

601
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,260
was in a nightclub.

602
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,140
Did you know that?

603
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,420
Yeah.

604
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,240
Yeah.

605
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,240
I not only knew that, I think that maybe in some other transgressionary existence,

606
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,240
I might have authored that same piece.

607
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,700
Voodoo Child?

608
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,760
Yeah.

609
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,380
Yeah.

610
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,520
The long version.

611
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:39,920
It's.

612
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,380
Yeah.

613
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:47,240
It was a, well, it was, it was foreshortened because of the, you know, you know, lack of

614
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,480
equity.

615
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,600
There was too much of it.

616
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,080
No.

617
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,100
Okay.

618
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:57,740
Well, we're going to go back to this song, All, All the Devil's, Calling All Devil's

619
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,980
Children, in which Jimi Hendrix is a preacher.

620
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,700
So, um, I have to say good night, Dave.

621
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,080
You do sound better on this end.

622
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,520
I don't know.

623
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,300
Has anything changed?

624
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,120
It doesn't have any, no, no, no, nothing has changed.

625
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,880
It has nothing to do with you or anything you can do.

626
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,060
Just like our lives.

627
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:21,500
There's nothing you or me can do about anything.

628
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,520
It's terrible.

629
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,860
Oh, well, okay.

630
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,140
It's futile then.

631
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,680
It's due upon the doodoo.

632
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,660
Okay, doodoo.

633
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,780
See you later.

634
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,500
See you.

635
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,880
Bye.

636
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,400
Bye.

637
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,900
Bye.

638
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,320
Bye.

639
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,300
Bye.

640
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:38,680
Bye.

641
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,120
Bye.

642
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,720
Bye.

643
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,200
Bye.

644
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,840
Bye.

645
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:40,840


646
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:40,860


647
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:42,940
Bye.

648
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,860
Bye.

649
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:44,860


650
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:44,860


651
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,960
Bye.

652
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,740
Bye.

653
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:52,740


654
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:52,740


655
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:52,740


656
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:58,020
Alright ladies and gentlemen, tonight our guest speaker is Mr. Artin Jackson.

657
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,600
Yeah.

658
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,060
Right.

659
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,220
Go, go.

660
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:13,440
Right, the main point, the main point, the main point I'm trying to say right

661
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,200
It's gonna be completely lost.

662
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,040
You're gonna be living out of confusion.

663
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,360
Confusion!

664
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,780
Confusion!

665
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:23,940
Confusion!

666
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,080
And I'm gonna say, it only takes about three or five minutes a day by yourself at home

667
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,040
to define yourself, to figure yourself out, to find out what you wanna do with money.

668
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:34,680
Right?

669
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,120
Right!

670
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,140
Yes, money, there's so many things happening in America.

671
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,900
What are we supposed to know about it?

672
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,420
What are we gonna know about it?

673
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,040
We're gonna fight this, we're gonna know about it!

674
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,460
Yes!

675
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,880
We're gonna be in the light.

676
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,880
We're gonna be in the light.

677
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,900
And if I were you, I'd be like...

678
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:04,560
I'm gonna wait outside, I'm gonna tell about it, I'm gonna wait outside.

679
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,600
I'm gonna fight this.

680
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,440
Hold on, hold on.

681
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,540
I got nothing.

682
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,400
I got nothing.

683
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:11,940
I got nothing.

684
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,180
I got nothing.

685
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,360
You gotta save yourself.

686
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,840
What do you mean, listen?

687
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,740
You're not listening to me, are you?

688
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,880
You're not listening...

689
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,300
Yes!

690
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:19,740
Yes!

691
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,120
Yes!

692
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,240
I'm listening to you!

693
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,320
No!

694
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:22,620


695
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,280
You're gonna run out of confusion if you don't listen.

696
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,060
Oh, there's a fight!

697
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,660
Fight it, fight it, fight it, fight it!

698
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,660
Come on, come on, come on!

699
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,000
Come on!

700
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,600
Come on!

701
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:34,660
Come on!

702
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,800
Oh, I'm trying to give you more seconds.

703
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:37,960
All right, here I...

704
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,260
I'm trying to give you less than...

705
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,100
One, two.

706
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,160
One, two, three, four.

707
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:54,120
One, two, three, four.

708
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:38,500
One, two, three, four.

709
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:45,360
One, two, three, four.

710
00:40:45,360 --> 00:41:06,920
One, two, three, four.

711
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,740
One, two, three, four.

712
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,060
Five, three.

713
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,300
The retail giant says this is PR News, Washington.

714
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,340
The retail giant says this is PR News, Washington.

715
00:42:47,180 --> 00:43:14,800
The retail giant says this is PR News, Washington.

716
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:45,340
The retail giant says this is PR News, Washington.

717
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,940
The retail giant says this is PR News.

718
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:15,340
The retail giant says this is PR News.

719
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:15,340


720
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:15,340


721
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:15,340


722
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:15,340


723
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:15,340


724
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,060
And where it all belong

725
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,480
The earth goes down on their knees

726
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,960
Looking for a little ease

727
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,160
She stuck out her tongue and the fun begun

728
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,640
She stuck out her tongue and the fun begun

729
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,040
She stuck out her tongue and the fun begun

730
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,580
She stuck it out at me

731
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,560
And I just thumbed my nose

732
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:50,560
And went on washing my clothes

733
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,940
The dark curtain descends

734
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,980
A mysterious presence is lurking in the gloom

735
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,320
Reaching out with invisible hands

736
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,140
Aha, if only mobs were alive to see this

737
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,180
Huh? What's that?

738
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,480
Don't you remember?

739
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,220
Don't you remember, you old friend?

740
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:14,680
Bob?

741
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,080
But you're dead

742
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,420
I've come back

743
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,580
And I have a little something for you

744
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:20,740
No!

745
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,140
Be loyal

746
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,220
Shh!

747
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,220
Quiet, you two

748
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,860
I'm receiving some sort of signal

749
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,640
A warning

750
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,740
A cry for assistance

751
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,640
It's no good

752
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,860
I'm losing contact

753
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,780
What is it, Mr. Z?

754
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,120
I wonder if we'll ever know

755
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:37,680
Hi, pal

756
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,520
I see you're still hard at work on the

757
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:39,820
Bob?

758
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,120
Murder

759
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,480
Is there no hope?

760
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,780
Actually, Forbes

761
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,540
I have a question for you

762
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,520
Have you ever seen this man?

763
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:45,940
Bob?

764
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,200
Be loyal

765
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,740
Ah, Weasel

766
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,740
You're back

767
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,660
Any luck?

768
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:52,880
Yes, but

769
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,520
It has something to add

770
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,360
There's been a change in plans

771
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,120
What's in the package?

772
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,840
You'll find out

773
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,360
But first, I must say this

774
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,940
Tonight at the costume party

775
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,880
I advise you to abandon your plans to come dress as

776
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,060
Bob?

777
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,200
What?

778
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,180
But why?

779
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,280
The costume was designed by an expert

780
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,740
And it isn't the dress

781
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,660
I'm not a

782
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:29,660


783
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,160
Get up

784
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,140
He's stolen the show

785
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,100
Did you say

786
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:32,320
Bob?

787
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:32,840
Get up?

788
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:33,540
Where is he?

789
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,720
I must speak with him

790
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,980
Would you like some punch?

791
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,020
You poor fool

792
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,900
I've traveled halfway around the world

793
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,960
And waited four long years for this moment

794
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,300
Ah, satisfaction

795
00:46:56,060 --> 00:47:03,060
Friends, that last little bit there was

796
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,960
Caught up by Reverend Exister

797
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,960
I don't know the origins of it

798
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,300
It's something called Paradis Zone

799
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,760
Before that

800
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,840
The Captain Beefheart song

801
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,000
Lick My Decals Off Baby

802
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,560
Was not performed by Captain Beefheart

803
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,120
But by a band called Kiss Kiss Kill

804
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,500
And that's off the album

805
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,920
Mama Kangaroo

806
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,880
Philly Women Sing Captain Beefheart

807
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,340
And we may have some more of that

808
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:38,080
This music in the background

809
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,220
Boy, this is the one that went great

810
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,740
With Slaying the...

811
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,920
With the Royal Ludroth in my video game

812
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,960
In a murky, underwater lake

813
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,940
Well, lakes are usually underwater

814
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,880
But this one was especially underwater

815
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,960
And it's funny how ballet-like

816
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:03,000
The killing of giant amphibious monsters can be

817
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,140
If you've got the right background music

818
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,820
It wasn't even in slow motion

819
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,440
But it kind of seemed that way

820
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,260
You know?

821
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:15,120
Here's another nice bit

822
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,900
From the early part of Neal Stephenson's novel

823
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,100
Cryptonomicon

824
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:24,880
It describes the moment when this young math whiz

825
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,440
He's kind of an aspie

826
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,200
He's not very socially adept

827
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,820
But he's a math genius

828
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:34,600
And he's about 12 years old or so

829
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,300
And the church organist

830
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,940
Or organ teacher

831
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,040
And he's a math teacher

832
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,000
Explains to him how a pipe organ

833
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,460
Like in a church works

834
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,080
The organist, math teacher

835
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,240
Sat down with a few loose pipes

836
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,880
Of pencil and paper

837
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,760
And helped Lawrence figure out

838
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,260
Why it worked

839
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,360
When Lawrence understood

840
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,080
It was as if the math teacher

841
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,300
Had suddenly played the good part

842
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,340
Of Bach's Fantasia and Fugue in G minor

843
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,880
On a pipe organ the size of the spiral nebula

844
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,240
In the world of music

845
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,020
In Andromeda

846
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,980
The part where Uncle Johann

847
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,720
Dissects the architecture of the universe

848
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,340
In one merciless descending ever-mutating chord

849
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,860
As if his foot is thrusting

850
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,980
Through skidding layers of garbage

851
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:26,440
Until it finally strikes bedrock

852
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,500
In particular, the final steps

853
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,740
Of the organist's explanation

854
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,860
Were like a falcon's dive

855
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,500
Through layer after layer

856
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,220
Of pretense and illusion

857
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,620
Thrilling or sickening or confusing

858
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,720
Depending on what you were

859
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,020
The heavens were riven open

860
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:46,940
Lawrence glimpsed choirs of angels

861
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:50,340
Ranking off into geometrical infinity

862
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,520
Believe it or not

863
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,240
I actually know how he feels

864
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,960
Although it wasn't a math teacher

865
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,380
Explaining organs that got me there

866
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,400
Although it may have had something to do with organs

867
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,060
I suppose

868
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,640
And here's something to do

869
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,580
Oh, well

870
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,040
Well, uh, yes

871
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,740
Uh, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

872
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,880
Let's just be quiet and listen to this

873
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,980
Lovely, um, underwater

874
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,980
Royal Ludrath slaying music

875
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,160
By Jimi Hendrix

876
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,540
It's called New Rising Sun

877
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,640
New Rising Sun

878
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:35,980
New Rising Sun

879
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,360
Thank you.

880
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:15,800
Thank you.

881
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,200
Thank you.

882
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,080
Thank you.

883
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,360
Thank you.

884
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,880
Thank you.

885
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,760
Thank you.

886
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:41,200


887
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:43,760
Thank you.

888
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:47,860
Thank you.

889
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:49,920
Thank you.

890
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,680
Thank you.

891
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:57,500
Thank you.

892
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:57,500


893
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:57,660
Thank you.

894
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:57,660


895
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:07,180
From PR News in Washington, I'm participating in one of the worst massacres in France as retribution for a mayor who did not endorse bad PR.

896
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,460
Oradour sur Glanin.

897
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:14,760
The Dowd 616457-641-61-1838.

898
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:20,860
An 88-year-old former member of a Nazi SS division says this is PR.

899
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,960
And this is Hour of Slack.

900
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:29,000
And that was, well, Leamer.

901
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,740
The mighty Leamer does PR news things.

902
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:37,920
And the song we heard before that was the...

903
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:45,620
The Captain Beefheart song Plastic Factory, which I think was in his very first, well, maybe his second album.

904
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:52,800
That was being sung by someone named Lisa Christ Superstar.

905
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:53,920
Really?

906
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:54,580
Yes.

907
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,220
Lisa Christ Superstar.

908
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:02,800
And in a minute I'm going to play Crazy Little Thing, Captain Beefheart song by...

909
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,000
Only it's done by someone named Mia Johnson.

910
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:19,420
Friends, we haven't talked about Church of the Subgenius stuff much tonight, but we don't need to because what we've been doing is playing the things that helped make the Church of the Subgenius what it is.

911
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:25,520
Don't blame Jimi Hendrix or Captain Beefheart entirely, but let me put it this way.

912
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:35,980
The first albums or records I ever bought, number one was a 45 of Monster Mash, which my brother promptly sold.

913
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,540
I broke, but I forgive him.

914
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:45,980
The next, then I bought nothing but movie soundtracks for a long time because I didn't care for this rock and roll stuff.

915
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,400
But I like the...

916
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:48,880
Oh, brother.

917
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:55,560
The Monkees did some songs I heard on the radio, and my first rock album was Last Train to Clarksville.

918
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:03,540
But then my experience with rock and roll started to snowball.

919
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:07,540
And the second album that I bought was Magical Mystery Tour.

920
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:13,240
The third album I bought was Jimi Hendrix's Are You Experienced?

921
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,860
Because at this point I went, some of...

922
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,680
This is rock and roll stuff.

923
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,800
This isn't rock and roll.

924
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,820
This is science fiction.

925
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:25,280
Are You Experienced? I consider to be a science fiction album.

926
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:30,100
And actually, Magical Mystery Tour is certainly a fantasy thing.

927
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,900
The next album I bought after...

928
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:39,520
Are You Experienced? was Frank Zappa's We're Only In It For The Money.

929
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:40,660
And...

930
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,000
And my...

931
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:52,740
At some point, I think in my junior year, my friend turned me on to the Captain Beefheart album Trout Mask Replica,

932
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:58,920
which I have proved on previous shows I know by heart.

933
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,460
I don't know anything else by heart.

934
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:02,800
Simple.

935
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,840
I don't know anything else by heart.

936
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,900
I don't know anything else by that band called Heart.

937
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,300
I don't know anything else by that band called Heart.

938
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:15,240
This is the Hour of Slack, broadcasting this particular recording from WCSB Cleveland.

939
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:15,760


940
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:19,860
Although you may be listening on another station in the future.

941
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:23,920
But it'll be your now, you nowists.

942
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,400
And...

943
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,400
For more information, of course, subgenius.com.

944
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,900
All you have to do is spell subgenius.

945
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:39,140
Or write to P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

946
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,620
I think.

947
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,960
And now back to the...

948
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,360
God, this is great.

949
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,180
It is.

950
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,020
I'm just gonna leave this on.

951
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,660
We'll play the Beefheart next week.

952
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,120
Ha ha ha.

953
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,320
Ya ya ya ya ya.

954
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,100
.

955
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,100


956
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,180
.

957
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:58,660
.

958
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:58,820
.

959
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,560
.

960
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:10,560


961
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:10,560


962
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:17,980
.

963
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:18,300
.

964
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:18,840
.

965
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:18,900
.

966
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:19,060
.

967
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:19,340
.

968
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:20,940
.

969
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:21,560
.

970
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:21,600
.

971
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:21,860
.

972
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:21,860


973
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:21,860


974
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:21,860


975
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:21,920
.

976
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:21,920


977
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:21,920


978
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:21,920


979
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:21,920


980
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,000
.

981
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,000


982
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:26,620
guitar solo

983
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,280
guitar solo

984
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:27,660
guitar solo

985
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:35,520
This is WCSB Cleveland, 89.3 FM.

986
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,120
Friends normally, Radio Synesthesia would be starting right now,

987
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,080
but I just got word that Radio Synesthesia had a little bit of car trouble.

988
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:50,960
Dr. Sinister won't be here for another 10 or 15 minutes.

989
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:58,880
Luckily, I have this fantabulous Hendrix instrumentals

990
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,320
that I was planning to play in the background, so...

991
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,640
What's this one called?

992
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,700
Oh, this one is called Untitled Basic Track.

993
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,940
It was a song that no one knows what the lyrics were to go to it.

994
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,900
It's a mystery song, anyway.

995
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,080
guitar solo

996
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,040
guitar solo

997
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,420
guitar solo

998
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,800
guitar solo

999
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,460
Thank you.

1000
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:24,520
Thank you.

1001
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,320
Thank you.

1002
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:28,980
Thank you.

1003
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:02,860
Thank you.

1004
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:24,220
Thank you.

1005
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:52,420
Thank you.

1006
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:35,700
Thank you.

1007
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,020
Thank you.

1008
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:22,240
Thank you.

1009
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,100
Thank you.

1010
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:30,700
Thank you.

1011
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:57,020
Thank you.

1012
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:24,620
Thank you.

1013
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:06,860
Thank you.
