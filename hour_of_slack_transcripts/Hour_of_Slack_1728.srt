1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:09,160
It's alive. It's moving. It's alive. It's alive. It's alive. It's alive. It's alive.

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,840
The Soul of Jesus.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,640
The Tower of Death.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:23,040
I just sprayed WD-40 on it, and it stopped for about 10 or 15 minutes, and then it'll start back again.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,440
Did you try to wiggle?

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,360
Oh, yes. Yeah.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:25,820
Yeah.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,760
You're right.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,640
And...

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,060
No.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:30,880
No.

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:30,880


13
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:31,900
No.

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,240
So, if there are actually fetid fetuses falling from the sky...

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,040
And there are.

16
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,760
And they're both spelled F-O-E-T.

17
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,560
The old fetal fetter.

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,160
How come we don't call them fetid fetuses or fetid fetuses?

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,780
Because they went off fetus first.

20
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,820
That would be crazy.

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,400
That would be like a world where just chopped off feet washed up randomly on beaches.

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:53,860
Right.

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,980
That does happen.

24
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,820
It would be the same crazy world.

25
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,020
A world that didn't make any sense at all.

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,700
Chopped off feet do wash up on beaches.

27
00:00:59,720 --> 00:00:59,980
Okay.

28
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,500
I've recently been studying this.

29
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:08,880
They do wash up on beaches, and the reason for this is that sharks bite them off and then cough them up.

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,600
Well, they're actually paddling to shore.

31
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,100
But it's always right feet.

32
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,720
And we keep getting left feet in the mail as barter for membership packs.

33
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
You should see the documentary information I have.

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,620
They photograph a lot of these feet when they are washed up, and I've got photos.

35
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,840
Lots of photos.

36
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,280
Only $49.95.

37
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,560
I can send you some.

38
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,800
I'll see you later for the hot foot pics.

39
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:38,460
Well, they're not that pleasing to the appearance, but they show that a shark can carry things in its gut for many days without digesting it.

40
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,760
Ah, well, that's just the shark kingdom, however.

41
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,280
It could have been a horny seal.

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,780
That explains Philo.

43
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,980
You mean Wayne Sheen?

44
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,560
That explains the stuff that comes out of Philo's mouth on the KPFA show.

45
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,680
He's got stuff that's been undigested in his gut.

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,560
You all know who we're talking about.

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,280
Dr. Philo Drummond.

48
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,960
Only Dr. Philo Drummond.

49
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:07,900
Only the cub subco-founder and cub subco-founder of the Church of the Subgenius.

50
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,080
Back when he was a fledgling cub reporter.

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,900
A cub genius, as Dr. Darby said.

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,980
A bumbling bear cub, hunting for honey and bee trees and so forth.

53
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,240
Now a full-fledged schlub genius.

54
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:19,640
His bow tie years.

55
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,260
He ended up with more than a bucket full of money and a tree full of honey.

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
He ended up with two honeys.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,220
In fact, two families.

58
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,540
And he now, as the Mormon subgenius, supports both of those.

59
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:40,540
The fundamentalist Mormon subgenius, Philo Drummond, with his several daughters and wives.

60
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:47,160
And the latest daughter is too tiny and his payments.

61
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,040
It's rough being a polygamist.

62
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,140
He's got this whole generation and several generations to take care of.

63
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,380
And I love him in his old age.

64
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,300
Polygamy is its own punishment.

65
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,520
It's punishment that fits the crime.

66
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,260
But he's only one quarter subgenius and the rest is Jeffrey Dahmer.

67
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,340
Or no, who was the one who, yeah, Jeffrey Lundgren.

68
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
He could always drum up a date.

69
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,680
Pardon?

70
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,860
He could always drum up a date.

71
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,120
Dr. Drummond, yes.

72
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,440
Dana Leppard, it's easy to get a piece of.

73
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,740
He's just a beat off.

74
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,800
That's my opinion.

75
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,220
It's a pity Dr. Drummond couldn't be here this year.

76
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,300
I don't even have standards in this.

77
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,860
We do hope we'll be able to draw him back one of these times.

78
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,600
Because X day is always all the better for his presence.

79
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,020
It's not always pretty outside.

80
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,480
Sometimes it's raining like a dog or a cat.

81
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,720
Other times it's just cold as hell.

82
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,020
There's rarely a day as beautiful as this which leads me to believe that maybe we have been ruptured

83
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,040
and just can't fit it straight.

84
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:05,900
It's true that it was pouring rain out here until 2 o'clock on Wednesday when X day was scheduled to start.

85
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,120
So it just washed it off the calendar?

86
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,640
Actually it was 1 o'clock at that moment.

87
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:17,360
The sun ripped through the clouds and the grass instantly dried much like at the miracle of Fatima.

88
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,820
Which I think I mentioned already.

89
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,960
Well we have our miracles and our signs of wonder.

90
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,160
Believe me, we do.

91
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,080
We manifest them constantly.

92
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,420
So back to conspiracy theory.

93
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,340
What do you mean when you use the term conspiracy coincidence syndrome?

94
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,620
Actually I forget where I first encountered that idea.

95
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,080
But I was working for Playboy and somebody submitted an article.

96
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,340
I think I was the only editor who voted for publishing the article.

97
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,200
And it was about this thing.

98
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,280
This guy set out to investigate conspiracy theorists.

99
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,700
And he investigated a variety of them.

100
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,080
Those who thought the Rockefellers ran the government.

101
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,780
Those who thought the Air Force was engaged in a cover up of the UFOs.

102
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,580
And I forget what others.

103
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,560
About three others.

104
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,260
He found all of them had real incidents that they could demonstrate to his conviction that they weren't making it up.

105
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,760
That they had been persecuted.

106
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,040
Which helped prove that their conspiracy theory must be true.

107
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,280
Or why would they be persecuted?

108
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,900
And I began to think, well.

109
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,020
Uh.

110
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,480
I don't exactly believe in psychokinesis.

111
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:33,140
But I do believe that we program what happens to us a lot more than we're consciously aware of.

112
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,460
And it occurred to me that if people who believe widely conflicting conspiracy theories get equally persecuted.

113
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,560
They're bringing the persecution down on themselves in some way they don't understand.

114
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,020
And that led me into the whole concept of coincidence and synchronicity.

115
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,360
And some of it is pretty damn weird.

116
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,700
You can't explain it in any rational terms.

117
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,180
Uh.

118
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,200
Well, think May Brussel.

119
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,460
Her daughter got killed in a car accident.

120
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,920
She thought the CIA did that.

121
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:07,140
Now my attitude is so many kids get killed in car accidents that to immediately jump to the conclusion the CIA did it is kind of premature.

122
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,800
And if the CIA wanted to shut May Brussel up, the obvious thing to do would be to kill her, not her daughter.

123
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,940
But then you find things that are really weird.

124
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,660
Like, uh.

125
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,440
Kerry Thornley who believed he was brainwashed by the CIA.

126
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,460
And was part of the Kennedy assassination.

127
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,580
But he couldn't remember all the details.

128
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:36,660
He got held up in his own apartment by a guy who after pistol whipping him and taking a stereo and a television and a few other things he carted away.

129
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,140
He took Kerry's I.D. with him too.

130
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,640
Now why did he steal Kerry Thornley's I.D.?

131
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,620
Maybe that's another coincidence like May Brussel's daughter being hit by a car.

132
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,660
And the more you look into it the more mysterious it gets.

133
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,300
John Lilly.

134
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:59,400
Dr. John Lilly who has a background in more sciences than just about anybody I can think of.

135
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,280
He has coined the metaphor.

136
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,380
He insists it's a metaphor because he doesn't want to be known as a nut.

137
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,940
I also call it a metaphor because I still have some faint hope that I won't be known as a nut.

138
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,900
Cosmic Coincidence Control Center.

139
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,260
CCCC.

140
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,760
It does seem like Cosmic Coincidence Control Center pays special attention to people who pay special attention to it.

141
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,400
The more coincidences you look for the more you find.

142
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,900
And the more you look for coincidences the more you find the really weird ones that seem like synchronicities.

143
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,400
As for example the 23 theme that runs through several of my books.

144
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,240
I was giving a lecture in St. Louis.

145
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:47,940
Guy came up after the lecture with his wife, chatted with me a bit and said I know how your 23 gimmick works.

146
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,440
I said okay tell me.

147
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,740
He said it's a neurological grip.

148
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,580
You make your readers abnormally conscious of 23s and they ignore all the other numbers.

149
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,580
And I said congratulations you found the great magician who makes the grass green.

150
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,020
According to Zen Buddhism you are now enlightened.

151
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,420
And then after a while we decided to go get a pizza.

152
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,860
We went to this pizza place and they give you a number while you wait for your pizza.

153
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,240
Of course we got number 23.

154
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,160
He said how do you do it?

155
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,680
And I said I thought you did it that time.

156
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,680
I mean this kind of thing starts wandering.

157
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,360
And then after a while you find out that any philosophy you can invent fails to account for it.

158
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,420
Synchronicity isn't a theory at all.

159
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,420
It's a word that Jung made up and pretended he had a theory to go with it.

160
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,380
But in the scientific sense there is no theory of synchronicity.

161
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,080
It's just a label for a phenomenon.

162
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,740
That tends to occur when you're in depth analysis Freudian or Jungian.

163
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,200
When you do a lot of LSD or if you do a lot of oriental meditation.

164
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,780
Or if you practice western Kabbalistic magic.

165
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,820
And it happens to ordinary people too.

166
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,920
But it happens much more likely if you belong to one of those five groups.

167
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,680
If you belong to all five of those groups the synchronicities accumulate so much that you start to think.

168
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:10,020
To quote Aleister Crowley, the whole universe is an individual dealing of God with your personal soul.

169
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:21,280
So when one starts investigating conspiracies suddenly by the same principle facts backing up the conspiracy seem to pop from the woodwork?

170
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,200
Oh yeah.

171
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:33,620
It's like the law of fives created by Kerry Thornley before he started remembering or imagining his connection with the CIA and brainwashing programs and so on.

172
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,880
The law of fives holds that everything in the universe is directly connected to the number five.

173
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,400
Sometimes I restate it as given enough ingenuity on the part of the interpreter.

174
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,120
But usually I leave that out and leave it in Kerry's form and leave the reader to figure it out for himself.

175
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,020
But take for instance.

176
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,720
Hmm.

177
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,440
666 the number of the beast.

178
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,020
How the hell is that connected to five?

179
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,880
Well add it up.

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,440
666 it adds to 18.

181
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,260
18, 1 plus 8 equals 9.

182
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,300
9 is 3 squared.

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,720
There you got your 3 and your 2.

184
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,040
3 plus 2 equals 5.

185
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,400
You see how easy it is?

186
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,120
I only took three steps.

187
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,120
So because the mind is searching for those kind of connections it's putting them together wherever it can?

188
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,660
Yeah, I'd like to do a book sometime on great blunders by intelligent people.

189
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:41,660
Because when you start looking for something you tend to find, you know, this wouldn't be like Simon Newcomb, the great astronomer who wrote a mathematical proof that heavier than air flight was impossible and published it a day before the Wright brothers took off.

190
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:51,100
I'm talking about people who found a pattern in nature and wrote several scientific articles and got it accepted by a large part of the scientific community before it was just a matter of time.

191
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,240
And people generally agreed that there was no such pattern.

192
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,840
It was all just selective perception.

193
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,200
This happens over and over.

194
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,140
And if it happens to scientists, imagine how much more often it happens to artists.

195
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,340
And now imagine how often it happens to subgeniuses.

196
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,680
That was Robert Anton Wilson from the audiobook Robert Anton Wilson Explains Everything.

197
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,560
Thanks to the folks at MaybeLogic.com.

198
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,240
And praise Poke Bob.

199
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,420
This hour of slack number 1171.

200
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:28,580
Be pretty crazy since we're stitching together body parts from various live radio sessions from the last X Day Drill.

201
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:36,980
Starring Dr. Howell, Reverend Susie the Flusie, Priestess Pisces, Princess We Are Doe, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

202
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:45,360
Interspersing those, as always, with edits by NoraPref.com and from the great Mr. Fernando Nani Lemur, as heard here.

203
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,940
Tenet Mysteries.

204
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,780
This is Ellery Queen with a case I call The Lady Spectator.

205
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:58,620
I had a late call from a philanthropist named Carter who said he had received an old diary that was of great historical importance.

206
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,520
I believe you're lying, I said.

207
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,100
And in a moment, I'll explain.

208
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,000
In the case of The Lady Spectator, he hadn't even heard of the skater's walls.

209
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,440
Listen again to Ellery Queen's...

210
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,060
That body is not dead.

211
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,940
It has never lived.

212
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,060
I created it.

213
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,920
I made it with my own hands from the bodies I took from graves, from the gallows, anywhere.

214
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:36,420
I'm sure most of you saw the Bobtism where the new subgeniuses were washed clean and made new unto Bob.

215
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,180
Did you see what the water looked like afterwards?

216
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,800
Man, it was terrible.

217
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,200
That's what they have filters and chemicals for.

218
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,920
And aren't you glad the senior citizens we're going to bring in for the Bobtism?

219
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:58,200
I can tell you in all honesty that after a church of the subgenius ritual, that pool only looks a sort of a light reddish brown.

220
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:11,200
But after a church of all worlds ritual at Starwood, which goes on for hours, it looks like black sludge.

221
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,860
Well, they bring in the earth.

222
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,680
Being honest, horny-handed sons of the soil.

223
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,120
They bring in a lot of soil with them.

224
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,560
Yep.

225
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,720
A lot of sins to be washed away.

226
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,460
A lot of clogged sewers.

227
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,540
And their ritual isn't funny.

228
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,340
I've spied on the church of all worlds Bobtisms in the pool where they share water.

229
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,440
They're water brothers.

230
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:42,900
The only ones laughing, me and Bob Mosick, as we peeked over the edge watching that ridiculous charade.

231
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,940
And it goes on forever, Al.

232
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,680
Basically every other religion's charades.

233
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,960
Charades are ridiculous in a way that is not seemly to Bob.

234
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:57,060
Ours, we try to keep ours ridiculous in a way that Bob finds pleasurable.

235
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:05,960
And because we run down other religions doesn't mean that we say that we have all the answers, nor do we claim that we know everything.

236
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,400
That's what separates us from the others.

237
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,800
We don't need to know everything.

238
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,760
We're subgeniuses.

239
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,480
We need only to know our own genius.

240
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,720
Anything else is gravy.

241
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:22,720
But when did God ever say we were important enough to know why the universe is here?

242
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,760
I'm just trying to remember where I hid my frop.

243
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,600
Right. We're not Bob.

244
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,920
That's for Bob to know and us to guess about.

245
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,840
It leaves some mysteries open.

246
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,580
Think how awful it would be if they had Loch Ness monsters in aquariums.

247
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,540
They wouldn't even be monsters anymore.

248
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,820
Think of all the dirty gangly in the pool.

249
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,460
Someday if the conspiracy works, we'll be able to find them.

250
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:50,060
If the conspiracy takes over, friends, there'll be stuffed yetis in the Natural History Museum.

251
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,420
I found a yeti in the SkyMall calendar.

252
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,600
I did too. I saw that.

253
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,160
It's a garden gnome version of Bigfoot, a la the Roger Patterson movie.

254
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:10,140
They're trying to get the pinks used to the idea that yetis may soon be shambling through their gardens.

255
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,200
Have your own garden yeti, it said.

256
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,540
And they're making a bundle on these artificial yeti statues.

257
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:23,720
Or it could be like those statues of owls which they put in gardens to frighten away birds that might do damage to the plants.

258
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,560
Put a statue of a yeti in the backyard and it'll drive pinks far.

259
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,380
Next they're going to be doing squids.

260
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,840
And they're going to make us so sick of squids we won't want to fuck them anymore.

261
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,340
And then where will we be?

262
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,140
You were the only one who wanted to fuck squids all the time anyway.

263
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,840
We have photo documentation.

264
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,580
Of course you had your dalliancees.

265
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,140
Who wouldn't want to fuck squids?

266
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,740
They're so rubbery.

267
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,920
Dave's a city boy. He didn't grow up quite the same way we did, Susie.

268
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,940
You guys grew up on a farm?

269
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:03,440
The only peri-squid that Dave ever saw was a dad wrapped up in cellophane in a supermarket.

270
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,560
Or those misleading Hanna-Barbera squidly diddly cartoons.

271
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,620
Once you get squid-squack, you never go back.

272
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,920
Good question.

273
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:31,640
I think this тан add just the right phrase for it.

274
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,620
At least for now.

275
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:39,380
And the last self written statement on the ceiling says that...

276
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,300
Get out.

277
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,180
Gee, Lexi!

278
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,180


279
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,180


280
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,880
Listen again to Ellery Queen's...

281
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,460
Speaking of the cat in the hat,

282
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,560
the vulcarding child, one of the uber babies...

283
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:52,900
Yes?

284
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,200
...says that I am Dr. Seuss.

285
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,820
She doesn't talk a lot,

286
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,360
but she took one look at me and said that that's Dr. Seuss.

287
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,400
Well, that is indeed an intellectual and intuitive leap.

288
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,620
Theodore... what was his name?

289
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,140
Geisel.

290
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:11,840
Geisel.

291
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,820
Theodore Ted Geisel.

292
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,700
He was a subgenius,

293
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,220
and he knew the conspiracy would totally screw his material.

294
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,920
And as long as he lived,

295
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,380
he never let Hollywood touch his crap,

296
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,100
unless Boris Karloff was going to be associated with it.

297
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,400
But as soon as the great Dr. Seuss died,

298
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,160
and his wife was hard up for money,

299
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,360
sure enough, the next thing you know,

300
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,220
Jim Carrey has his Hollywood pecker stuck in the pot.

301
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,580
Not just him.

302
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,600
Wrecking it forever for all future generations of kids.

303
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,400
That's why we've got to get off this planet

304
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,620
before any more Dr. Seuss stories are filmed.

305
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,240
Yeah, they're even corrupting Dr. Seuss,

306
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,760
but it wasn't so much Jim Carrey as that other guy.

307
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,820
You know, Austin Powers.

308
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:03,180
Mike Myers produced an extremely blasphemous cat in the hat.

309
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,740
I didn't even want to say that name.

310
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,960
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

311
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,960
I'm simply saying it in the interest of being complete.

312
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,200
But it is not entirely...

313
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,280
It's entirely true that Hollywood ignored Dr. Seuss

314
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,260
because he was able to let one great proto-subgenius

315
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,620
interpret his works.

316
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,140
This isn't much known today,

317
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,320
and that is Bob Clampett,

318
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,900
an angel of light who walked this earth years ago.

319
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,200
Price, another Bob.

320
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,540
He was utterly great.

321
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,260
It was my privilege to know him for a brief time.

322
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:36,500
No!

323
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,600
Yes, I...

324
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,660
You knew Bob Clampett?

325
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,260
I knew Bob Clampett very well,

326
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,200
and he...

327
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:41,580
He knew me,

328
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,040
and I can't sing his praises enough.

329
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,420
He was indeed a proto-subgenius, Stang.

330
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,380
You would believe it

331
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,340
if you'd ever spoken to him for a short time.

332
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,640
And his cartoon of Horton Hears a Who...

333
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,980
Not Horton Hears a Who,

334
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,220
Horton Hatches the Egg

335
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,500
is a great Warner Brothers cartoon

336
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,520
which should be checked out sometime.

337
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,040
It was approved entirely by Dr. Seuss

338
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,380
the way Clampett interpreted it.

339
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,440
Ah, but it was banned by the conspiracy.

340
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,940
It is generally...

341
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,580
It is censored on TV,

342
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,060
but so are most of the old Warner Brothers cartoons,

343
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,260
which are simply not...

344
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,160
They're too strong for today's

345
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,060
namby-pamby intellect to confront,

346
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,500
and so they don't appear to be about anything much.

347
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,680
Something's about to happen,

348
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,340
and then it fades out,

349
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,880
or it moves to another thing.

350
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,700
And I'm telling you,

351
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,200
some of them are strong stuff.

352
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,900
Clampett himself originated the suicide gag,

353
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,140
as he called it,

354
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,120
and the murder gag,

355
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,700
which ended,

356
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,060
ended a number of these cartoons.

357
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,420
In the cartoon Hair Ribbon,

358
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,400
if you remember this cartoon,

359
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,680
with Bugs Bunny,

360
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,860
a large dog,

361
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,780
the large dog chases him underwater,

362
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,300
and then it becomes one of those strange cartoons

363
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,180
that takes place entirely underwater.

364
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,140
Nobody needs breathe,

365
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,200
but it's underwater.

366
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,020
And so at the end,

367
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,580
in one version of this cartoon,

368
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,560
the dog says,

369
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,520
this shouldn't happen to a dog,

370
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,080
picks up a large gun,

371
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,860
and blasts his brains out.

372
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,500
You can see them,

373
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,580
coming out the other side.

374
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,320
But in the other version,

375
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,780
rare, but also extant,

376
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,640
he says,

377
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,280
this shouldn't happen to a dog,

378
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,640
and Bugs Bunny leaps into the picture,

379
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,600
grabs the gun,

380
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,260
shoves it into his mouth,

381
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,700
and fires it through the back of his head.

382
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,380
More brains are seen coming out.

383
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,920
But for some reason,

384
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,160
they don't think the kiddies should be watching

385
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,300
this sort of thing today,

386
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,540
as educational as it is.

387
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,120
I know it made a profound impression on me.

388
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,040
Anyway, now is not the time to,

389
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,340
to discuss even this wonderful canon

390
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,100
of vanished literature and art.

391
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,040
It's not quite,

392
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,640
the internet still has,

393
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,680
you can still find the banned cartoons on the internet,

394
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,360
but they're about to ban the internet,

395
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,220
as we know it.

396
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,580
As we pirates and bootleggers knew it.

397
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,500
If there's anything to be learned from all this,

398
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,260
is that what one thinks is an eternally available resource,

399
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,060
has only its time to be out,

400
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,700
and then will vanish away,

401
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,580
almost utterly.

402
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,320
Beyond the extent of even the most strenuous effort to retrieve.

403
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,020
So take it advisedly.

404
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,540
Enjoy it while you can.

405
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,040
Make your own copies in multiple media.

406
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,440
And most importantly,

407
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,720
take that mental snapshot,

408
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,320
which is the hardest to erode.

409
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Think of it,

410
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,120
the brain of a dead man,

411
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,080
waiting to live again in a body I made,

412
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,460
with my own hands.

413
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,460
This is a Dan radio.

414
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,420
This is a Dan radio.

415
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,200
Good morning.

416
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,520
Crime and punishment.

417
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,720
True, quite dramatic.

418
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,280
Crime and punishments.

419
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,960
Punishment might well were the justice system criminals.

420
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,280
Would it help?

421
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,680
Help.

422
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,160
Love.

423
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,180
Payback.

424
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,140
Life of crime.

425
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,680
Slack.

426
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,100
Slack.

427
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:56,680
Love heals.

428
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:57,960
Move.

429
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,440
Play.

430
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,720
Perpetrator.

431
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,100
Traitor.

432
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:00,860
Traitor.

433
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,600
Traitor.

434
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,340
High visibility.

435
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,440
Brightly coloured.

436
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,020
Slack.

437
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,620
The El.

438
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,780
Snub-shin-off.

439
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,420
This is Dan radio.

440
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,220
This is Dan radio.

441
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,000
This is a Dan radio.

442
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,340
This is a Dan radio.

443
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,520
This is a Dan radio.

444
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:11,780
This is a Dan radio.

445
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,200
Good morning.

446
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,360
This is a Dan radio.

447
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:13,360


448
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:13,360


449
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:13,360


450
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,860
And that was a snapshot of the inside of the brain of Nor Elcret.

451
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,560
Speaking of snapshots, friends, what's on the slideshow right now is…

452
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,640
From earlier X days.

453
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,080
X days.

454
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,240
The X days of our grandparents and our…

455
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,300
Well, maybe not our grandparents, but our parents.

456
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,440
They were something, weren't they?

457
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,920
Yeah, that was when we used to hold it in Texas.

458
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,280
Yeah, I remember that.

459
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,280
And that was the Florida X days…

460
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,240
Kelly Everts was.

461
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,160
We won that contest.

462
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,420
Yep.

463
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,440
Friends, oh, there's Phyla.

464
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,100
Remember Phyla's hypno machine?

465
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,860
Yes, we had to pay the local police an awful bribe at that time.

466
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,280
Well, it's good to have these photographic records,

467
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:02,640
but they can only hint at the fountains of slack which used to flow before.

468
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:10,160
Brushwood is a nice tucked away place surrounded by unsuspecting Amish and Hutterite farmers.

469
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,660
Little do they know what actually is going on here at the molten core of subgenius understanding.

470
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,800
By the same token, we're not sure what kind of parties they're having either.

471
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,820
Well, that's true.

472
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,280
I've heard that the Amish do know how to have a lot of fun.

473
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,700
Yeah, those butter churn.

474
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,900
They finish that barn raisin.

475
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,140
They churn up a lot of clabber.

476
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,560
Yeah.

477
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,480
But that's, you know, live and let live, I have to say.

478
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:43,060
Well, you will often, as you wander around Brushwood, this is early in the week, actually.

479
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,040
There'll be more people here on Friday, of course, and Saturday,

480
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,880
and also on the days of Friday and Saturday.

481
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,320
Friday can't handle all of you guys, and neither can Saturday can't handle all you girls.

482
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,220
By the way.

483
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,400
He's a brave man.

484
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,320
But anyway, on those.

485
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:09,760
On those two days, there should be lots of, well, plus the pagans start showing up, and they're an interesting group to study.

486
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,340
The virtuous pagans.

487
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:17,640
There's one thing I'll say about the pagans, in which they're very advanced beyond the subgeniuses.

488
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,700
The pagans have mastered fire.

489
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:29,560
And I often at X Days, I lurk and sneak from camp to camp recording people secretly.

490
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,860
But I've noticed it so often.

491
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,520
The subgeniuses bring the finest liquor.

492
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,260
They have a whole bar set up.

493
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,400
They have the purest frock straight from Amsterdam.

494
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,840
They have a big twister game set up.

495
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:49,780
But the one thing they never seem to have is any heat at all or shelter.

496
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,120
So friends, I want you to study the pagans if you can.

497
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,640
Learn how it is that they get that flickering, burning fire under control.

498
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,300
We need to know these things.

499
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,820
Well, I think.

500
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,660
It's very simple.

501
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,880
You follow the alchemist's original plan for making fire.

502
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,560
All you have to do is build your fire in the shape of a pyramid.

503
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,000
That's what fire wants.

504
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,720
Don't throw flat things on glowing coals.

505
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,440
Erect a little teepee out of kindling and make sure that whatever else you have piled

506
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:30,780
up forms the pyramid shape, the triangle with the point at the top, as in all alchemical texts.

507
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,800
And you'll have a fire.

508
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,640
Otherwise, you'll just have a lot of smoke and frustration.

509
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:41,300
These pagans have been building fires a long time and tending them, tending the fire, that

510
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,080
vestal duty is of extraordinary importance.

511
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,060
If your fire gets out of control, cremora is a good chemical to throw on it.

512
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,620
Or aerosol cans, lighters, things like that.

513
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,700
Some sort of chemicals that make it burn green and blue like a witch's oil.

514
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,780
These things all add to the ecstatic effect.

515
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,940
It's the ecstatic enjoyment of the moment.

516
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:11,280
But not being able to make a fire, that is a disgraceful backsliding from the wisdom

517
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,480
and ways of our Neolithic ancestors.

518
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,660
And boy could they ever nap flints too.

519
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,840
We should get to work on napping flints because you never know when all our technology is

520
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,860
destroyed in a self-induced convulsion and we're back on the flint napping ground.

521
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,640
Then the flint nappers will be ahead of everyone else.

522
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,320
That's right.

523
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:40,000
The loser now shall be later to win for the times they are a changing.

524
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,120
And friends, you should be ready to know how to start a fire.

525
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,680
You may not be able to fire up your gas heater because you can't afford the gas.

526
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,700
You need to be able to manufacture air because they're going to start charging you for every

527
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,940
breath you take.

528
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,420
They're going to find a way to do it.

529
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:07,280
Every sip of water will cost what gas costs now if the conspiracy wins.

530
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:14,880
And that's why if by some strange twist of fate the saucers don't lift us away this Saturday

531
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,260
morning, then friends it's up to you.

532
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,500
Are you ready to fill Bob's shoes?

533
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,800
Will you be the next Bob?

534
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,580
The next Brogan.

535
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,400
The next Brogan.

536
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,620
The brain is useless.

537
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,940
We must find another brain.

538
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,620
It's just Bob is what it is.

539
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,480
It's just, it's literally Bob.

540
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,400
La.

541
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:39,800
La.

542
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,320
La.

543
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,820
La.

544
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,400
La.

545
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,720
La.

546
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:41,960
La.

547
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,180
La.

548
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,300
La.

549
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:42,320
La.

550
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:42,480
La.

551
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:42,500
La.

552
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:42,760
La.

553
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,040
La.

554
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,320
La.

555
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:43,400
La.

556
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,720
La.

557
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:43,800
La.

558
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:43,920
La.

559
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,380
La.

560
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,680
La.

561
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,360
La.

562
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


563
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


564
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


565
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


566
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


567
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


568
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


569
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


570
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


571
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


572
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


573
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


574
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


575
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


576
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


577
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


578
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


579
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


580
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


581
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


582
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


583
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


584
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


585
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


586
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


587
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,360


588
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,840
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

589
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:25,100
Well, we were hearing a very interesting story from Doc Frop the other day

590
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,780
about the discovery of a hidden book written by a 17th century witch,

591
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,600
written entirely in blood and the fabulous price that was paid for it.

592
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,080
You never know what's going to be valuable.

593
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,160
So really, you should treat everything as a potential source of value.

594
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,940
That's what Bulldada is all about.

595
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,300
The things, oh God, I'll never forget the nightmarish estate sale

596
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:58,560
of the subgenius Steve Checchi, who suddenly died in a car accident.

597
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,560
And I'm sure his last thought was probably something like,

598
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,840
oh no, what's going to happen to all my cool stuff?

599
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:12,240
And it's a lesson, friends, that you know not the hour

600
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,260
when Bob may meet you in the subgenius hell all of a sudden.

601
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:16,980
And.

602
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,120
It was interesting because the pinks that came to the estate sale

603
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,080
were all out bidding on his furniture.

604
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,260
They bought up the dinette set and all this crap

605
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,600
and they threw the treasures in the trash.

606
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,720
Ah, yes.

607
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,840
Princess We looked inside the big chemical dumpster

608
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,160
and saw a little cassette labeled ESO.

609
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,000
And we thought, that's it.

610
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,640
This poor guy's family thought he was a devil worshiper

611
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,580
because he had, you know, books.

612
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,960
And we climbed, I climbed into the dumpster and praised Bob.

613
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,720
We fished out all his videos of all the X days he'd been to,

614
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,960
the Cleveland Performance Art Festival,

615
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,940
all the crash worship shows he'd been to.

616
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,800
It was a treasure trove, not that we've had time to look at any of it.

617
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,040
But he labeled them.

618
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,300
That's one important thing about it.

619
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,660
He labeled them all.

620
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,840
It was a poignant moment, though,

621
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,000
because I would.

622
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,280
I would fish things out and go,

623
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,400
I remember when he bought this from us.

624
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,120
Well, also that beautiful torso,

625
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,620
that white statue that's on your mantelpiece at home.

626
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,160
Oh, half my T-shirts came from that guy.

627
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,180
But here's the thing.

628
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:39,780
The Pink's completely ignored this guy's collection of books,

629
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,440
which was amazing.

630
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,060
And his house was full of them.

631
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,520
But that was all about to just be thrown out,

632
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,200
burned.

633
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:47,440
And that's what happened.

634
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,100
They burned down some teenagers.

635
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:54,700
And Princess Wee and I managed to take our pick of the books.

636
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,120
The kids got, I think the kids got the drug books and the sex books.

637
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,540
And we got everything else.

638
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,920
The history and twisted medical journals and so forth.

639
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,300
But, you know, you never know, friends.

640
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,040
You can't take it with you.

641
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,580
But because you're a subgenius, you can get it all back after you've left.

642
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,040
So I want you to now, if tomorrow, if the promise of X Day holds true tomorrow,

643
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,340
don't go to grab the Grand Canyon for your escape vessel,

644
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,940
because I've got dibs on it.

645
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,920
Why don't you tell them?

646
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,980
I could wrap off quite a few things that I've already got dibs on.

647
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,480
Tell them everything.

648
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,860
Because I don't want people fighting me over it at the last minute.

649
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,660
I don't want to show up at the Amsterdam Rijksmuseum and have Doc Frop going,

650
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,580
oh, no, you don't.

651
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,520
Actually, we worked that out.

652
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,040
He's taking the paintings and I'm taking the furniture.

653
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,620
Furniture of kings.

654
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,040
But think about those things, friends.

655
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,540
What about Brushwood?

656
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,520
Do we want to see this lovely piece of land destroyed when we can just as easily beam it up into one of our saucers?

657
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,540
I don't think that its owners ever actually bought a membership,

658
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,160
although they certainly deserve honorary ones.

659
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,640
So, you know, you've got to think about it.

660
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:22,700
You've got to think about are there unsaved friends and family members or enemies that you want to keep as slaves or sex toys?

661
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,300
You've got to really think about this or you may miss your chance.

662
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:40,400
I mean, imagine if, say, you go, oh, man, I've got to go pick up that one toy store that had everything I always wanted but couldn't afford,

663
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:45,080
and some subgenius has just blasted it to cinders out of spite.

664
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,860
Just because somebody looked at them funny in that toy store one day.

665
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,560
There's going to be a lot of that going on.

666
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,200
It may be happening less than 24 hours from now.

667
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,020
These are serious things to think about.

668
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,060
Make your list of wanted sex toys now.

669
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:05,600
Say there's some bitchy boss that you always thought,

670
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:12,560
I wish I could lobotomize that bastard, keep him in a cage, and then just fuck their wound every now and then.

671
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,920
You can do this.

672
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,560
If that's the way you're thinking.

673
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,140
You're thinking about it.

674
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,880
There's a certain fifth grade teacher I had.

675
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm sure she's dead, but she won't be for long.

676
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:30,060
She won't be for long, man, because there's a power of muam and those exes, man.

677
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:36,760
If you've got that $30 membership card in your pocket, you can bring those hated teachers back from the dead

678
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,740
and make them eat that pimento cheese sandwich right in front of everybody and see how they like it.

679
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,840
You know?

680
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:51,840
I hate to sound peevish and like a person that hangs, but I know we all do it.

681
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:56,020
And some of you have much longer lists than me.

682
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,940
And I'm going to avoid you because I may be on your list.

683
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,560
I'm full aware of that.

684
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,780
Yes, there are aspects of ex-day that we tend not to keep in mind.

685
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:14,820
So let's air out our brains with some live music from the Record Bar in Kansas City.

686
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,460
A song by Bob Walkenhorst of the Rainmakers.

687
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,660
This song has been stuck in my head for weeks and I'm hoping to dump it into yours.

688
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,500
The Record Bar

689
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:26,680
The Record Bar

690
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,120
The Record Bar

691
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:43,480
The Record Bar

692
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,660
The Record Bar

693
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:58,420
I heard you telling your friend, ah, he's harmless enough

694
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:05,120
There's almost nothing you could have said that would have hurt me so much

695
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:11,300
But how to risk all you've got? Oh, I forget you forgot

696
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,340
For God, are you to see that harmless is one thing?

697
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,780
I'm most certainly not.

698
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,260
It's all fools, oh my dear.

699
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,120
It's all fools, oh my dear.

700
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,480
It's hardly ever like you think.

701
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,460
It's so most always like you feel.

702
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:44,460
It's all fools, oh my dear.

703
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,480
It's all fools, oh my dear.

704
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:57,340
When we were young, we were dancing to a band at the ring.

705
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,200
We were so far out of tune in time, didn't you hear it?

706
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,440
We were the best in the world as far as we looked.

707
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,800
We were certain, I learned it soon.

708
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,560
It was all, it was amazing what they learned.

709
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:19,160
Twice as good, twice as fast, twice as loud, twice as long.

710
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:24,660
They were at least twice as good at having such fun.

711
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,440
It's all fools, oh my dear.

712
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,080
It's all fools, oh my dear.

713
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,920
Yeah, sometimes the facts can make us hopeless again.

714
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,800
It's all fools, oh my dear.

715
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:54,480
It's all fools, oh my dear.

716
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:18,840
It's all fools, oh my dear.

717
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,860
I was in traffic by a man,

718
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,580
Raving up the crowd, he drives.

719
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,200
He couldn't stay between the lines.

720
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,420
He couldn't read between the lines.

721
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,200
And so I ran him off the road.

722
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,960
The first chance that I got, see.

723
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,640
Harmless is one thing.

724
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,960
I don't have a chance tonight.

725
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,380
It's all fools, oh my dear.

726
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:54,160
It's all fools, oh my dear.

727
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:01,040
Yeah, sometimes the facts can make the truth is dear.

728
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,180
It's all fools, oh my dear.

729
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,480
It's all fools, oh my dear.

730
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,840
It's all fools, oh my dear.

731
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,080
It's all fools, oh my dear.

732
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:13,880
It's all fools, oh my dear.

733
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,500
I've been got on in my olden days.

734
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,240
One day struck me blind.

735
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,740
But I can see the forest bottom gnashing sometimes.

736
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,780
Oh, they think that shit's bliss.

737
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,320
I'm the happiest man alive.

738
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,900
I do so want to believe.

739
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,840
I'm so damn good.

740
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,160
Oh, that's what I'm saying.

741
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,540
Sometimes I imagine politics and love

742
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,300
When the evil racist

743
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,540
Mistakes the handshake of friendship

744
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,040
Call the hate shaking fist

745
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,740
It's like the loss of a man

746
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,640
It's a national blame

747
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,400
Why leave no other choice

748
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,480
But to keep in mind that

749
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,160
It's all fools, you're overmighty

750
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,800
It's all fools, you're overmighty

751
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,420
In party and flight

752
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,280
It's your voice on the track

753
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:20,400
It's all fools, you're overmighty

754
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,460
It's all fools, you're overmighty

755
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,160
It's all fools, you're overmighty

756
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,660
It's all fools, you're overmighty

757
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,760
It's all fools, you're overmighty

758
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,540
It's all fools, you're overmighty

759
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,900
In party and flight

760
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,820
It's all fools, you're overmighty

761
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:57,380
In party and flight

762
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,440
It's all fools, you're overmighty

763
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,800
It's all fools, you're overmighty

764
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,100
It's all fools, you're overmighty

765
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,060
But you know, religion is complex.

766
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,520
Morality is complex.

767
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,720
Luckily, we don't have to worry about morality or good and evil, only what feels good.

768
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,540
We're like the new age.

769
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,560
There's no, science means nothing.

770
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,940
It's all in what you feel.

771
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,560
Our id is our id.

772
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:42,480
If you feel like you can heal somebody and they shouldn't go to the doctor,

773
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,580
then they're terrible to go to the doctor.

774
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,120
That's against the new age.

775
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,260
Don't get me started.

776
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,500
I have a question since Dr. Hill may know the answer.

777
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,940
I'll save that for Starwood.

778
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,440
With the, as Stang was talking about this list,

779
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,740
and what we should claim,

780
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:04,180
should we just think of it very deeply right at 7 a.m.?

781
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,340
Because it would be very difficult to communicate.

782
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,200
Will the exes sort of wire up a hive mind for us to be able to communicate what we got dibs on?

783
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,020
No, they instantly know.

784
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,060
Everything is instantly known.

785
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,520
All fails fall away.

786
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,600
Our intellect should-

787
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,100
They know what you really, really want and what's really inside your head.

788
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,460
Crude blundering is our mental acuity compared to theirs.

789
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,520
It's easy for them to read as it's easy for them to-

790
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:32,760
for us to read the four inch high scrawls of a kindergartner

791
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,600
on a piece of art on the refrigerator.

792
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,260
Some of y'all may be surprised.

793
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,600
You may suddenly find yourself-

794
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,640
some of you tough guys out there may wake up on the saucer

795
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,200
and you're a beautiful woman.

796
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,840
And it turned out that was really all you really wanted to be.

797
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,200
Oh look, see the eggplant there.

798
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,160
He knows what it's like.

799
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,780
You know?

800
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,760
It's too late for most of us to follow the path of Pope S. Lilith.

801
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:09,120
The brave subgenius who decided to change bodies before they couldn't wait for the exes.

802
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,760
Two girls making it!

803
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,540
Right.

804
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,740
Pope S. Lilith said,

805
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,380
Watch two girls making it.

806
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,560
Hell, I'd rather be two girls making it.

807
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,060
And actually took Bob up on that.

808
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,540
To denounce hope than just seriously

809
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:50,540


810
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:50,540


811
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:50,540


812
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:58,220
Awwww.

813
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:58,520
коrono100 Wear a coat of full-grain clothes.

814
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:09,580
The mutants must appear The mutants must thrive

815
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:19,800
The saucers will burn And the darlings will die

816
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:45,220
The mutants will leave And be found in space

817
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,200
The darlings will perish

818
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,500
On earth

819
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:58,720
On earth

820
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,760
On earth

821
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,760
On earth

822
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,140
On earth

823
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,520
On earth

824
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,520
On earth

825
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,520
On earth

826
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,520
On earth

827
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:16,920
On earth

828
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,600
On earth

829
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,500
On earth

830
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:24,380
An X Day song by Dr. Gary Gbrog, friends. So very lovely.

831
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,520
Now we return to Brushwood, right after I've been spamming

832
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:28,400
the

833
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:37,520
live radio audience about my annual online course at MaybeLogic Academy, a course in subgenius history and cult management.

834
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:52,420
Now get this, one of the students who joined up learned in the course of it that her real biological father was a well-known subgenius.

835
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,420
Terrible.

836
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,720
Dr. Katahdin Lagune.

837
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,500
And I don't see the happy end.

838
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,480
I don't see any new family here.

839
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,540
No, I don't.

840
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,100
I'm looking for Mr. Lagune.

841
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:06,000
But, uh, she was one of the, and this is something I wanted to tell you all about that course.

842
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,720
She was one of the four people who passed.

843
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:14,640
There were 40 people who joined that damn course, spent 135 bucks and most of them flunked.

844
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,860
But you know how Reverend Anna Dynamite passed?

845
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,400
She crudely drew her own diploma.

846
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,340
Not even using a pen, using her mouse.

847
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:33,180
And, uh, that I thought, that showed enough nerve to prove that she really understood.

848
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:38,560
Another guy passed also by forging a diploma, but his was really fancy.

849
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,880
And he gave me one.

850
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,240
Another one passed by a bribe.

851
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,020
Sent me a book he'd written about Robert Anton Wilson.

852
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:55,560
But the one who really, and I'm telling you this because I know you'll forget by the time you take the course.

853
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,300
Because you're subgeniuses.

854
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:04,960
But the one guy who really passed with flying colors was the guy who said, this is all a lie.

855
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,840
You're talking about this Doug Smith guy having to work.

856
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,460
And there was never an Ivan Stanger just flew, breezed through life.

857
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:20,340
And that Bob is just this piece of clip art as far as you guys really know.

858
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,540
You don't have any more solid evidence of him than that skull of the person that was shot in San Francisco.

859
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,440
In 84.

860
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,540
And a few other things, pipes and teeth and stuff.

861
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,000
And you, this is a lie.

862
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:42,360
So this whole thing, all of these documents, you hired actors, handsome young actors to play these old subgenius ne'er do wells as young people.

863
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:47,240
And faked all these graphics and things just to test our faith.

864
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:54,540
The same way that God put dinosaur bones into the Grand Canyon to test the faith of geologists.

865
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,540
And paleontologists.

866
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:01,780
And that guy was like, he doesn't need subgenius 102.

867
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,600
He passed subgenius 101.

868
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:16,640
And the truth of the matter is he realized that the only way to really pass is when you realize subgenius 102 is when you teach the next sucker subgenius 101.

869
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,060
That also works for mysticism 101.

870
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,640
For ye of little faith.

871
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,220
Mysticism 102.

872
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,800
Which actor won?

873
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:24,800


874
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:28,060
Which actor was playing you and which actor was playing how?

875
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,800
Well, I don't know.

876
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:30,840
They hired unknowns.

877
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,340
But they were really good looking ones.

878
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:33,620
Really?

879
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:33,620


880
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,840
I was there in the early 80s.

881
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:40,800
And I don't remember any of us looking that good.

882
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,420
I know I for one was never that young.

883
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,760
That's an actor playing in that old movie.

884
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,060
They cleaned it up in post.

885
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:47,940
They did?

886
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,360
It's digital redo that they can do now.

887
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,900
I was wondering because the prop production was great.

888
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,800
I mean the glasses that the young stand on.

889
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,040
The glasses that the young actor wore were just impressive.

890
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,700
Well, you have to remember they were trying to make it look 80s style.

891
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,480
You know, it's that Elvis Costello look was big.

892
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:03,940
Right.

893
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,400
Now you're a...

894
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,580
To many people here, Priestess Pisces is old hierarch.

895
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,020
She's been around forever as long as they can remember.

896
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,100
I'm a spring chicken.

897
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:19,780
But yeah, to me, to me even Nenslow is a newcomer.

898
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,300
To me actually Dr. Howell is second stage subgenius.

899
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,960
Because I didn't meet you until like 1980.

900
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:33,440
That makes Dr. Howell an infant instead of genius.

901
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,260
A mere embryo, barely out of the shell.

902
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,700
Still covered with the amniotic fluid.

903
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:49,660
You can tell the very first ones who were touched by Bob because they all have false teeth and wear wigs and trusses and...

904
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,380
The elders.

905
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,000
...can barely walk.

906
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,300
The Elohim.

907
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:57,900
They've been exposed to the radiation of Bob directly.

908
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,600
That's why Philo has to wear a mask all the time.

909
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,860
Philo is pretty frightening if you see him up close.

910
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,660
Yeah, yeah, it shows.

911
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,340
It really shows.

912
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,140
His years spent in Dobstown.

913
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,540
Man, there's...

914
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,300
You can see every ass rape on his face.

915
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:22,760
Philo has to toil in the bowels of the conspiracy to support his multiple families.

916
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:23,280
Being...

917
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,220
He's the Mormon subgenius.

918
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,340
Yeah, he's the polygamous subgenius.

919
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,700
He actually does have more than one wife.

920
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:39,960
This is the sun, the moon, the stars, carved images, pictures, icons, dead people, human science, money.

921
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,260
Make yourself useless.

922
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,480
There is no God.

923
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,880
You should worship science or the creation, Mother Nature.

924
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,880
Astrology rules.

925
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,820
We need Buddhists.

926
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:02,040
When you come like me, follow after sorcerers, witches, mediums, you need to seek homosexuals.

927
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,620
That is good advice for you now.

928
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,920
Please write to me.

929
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,160
I would like to know about you.

930
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:08,860
Okay.

931
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,860
This program is presented by the Centers for Disease People.

932
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,240
Is your heart trying to die from a heart attack?

933
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,860
New treatments are available today that can save you.

934
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,060
You can kill.

935
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,160
So listen to your doctor and feel short-headed or have chest pains in the arms or shoulders.

936
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,100
Down in Abilene, Texas is Brian.

937
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:32,980
Hey, Brian.

938
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,000
You're on with the Reverend Ivan Stang.

939
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:35,460
Good morning.

940
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,820
Good morning.

941
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,280
Hail Bob and hail Connie.

942
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,400
Hail.

943
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,940
Yeah, Connie is Bob's beautiful wife.

944
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:43,440
Cool.

945
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:50,600
Yes, I remember the good Reverend mentioning that not enough people remembered Connie and they just focused on Bob.

946
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,520
Not enough people remember which?

947
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,500
Not enough people remember Connie.

948
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,440
Oh.

949
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:05,360
Well, you got to have some sex in your religion and Connie is pretty cute.

950
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,300
Bob is good looking too, but.

951
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,920
You have to wonder what the kids will look like.

952
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,040
They look like Ken and Barbie.

953
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,220
Oh, yeah.

954
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,460
And neither one of them have sexual appropriate identifying.

955
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,420
Yeah, right.

956
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:24,200
Yeah, so you don't have to worry about them reproducing too much.

957
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,840
Good thing, yeah.

958
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,680
Bob's head, just his head alone, reproduces fabulously.

959
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:38,580
The main portrait of Bob actually came from a piece of Yellow Pages clip art that wasn't anybody's copyright or trademark.

960
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:43,380
It had been used to death at some point in the ancient past and we trademarked it.

961
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:49,160
And I've seen that thing projected at concerts over.

962
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,700
I've seen it over Michael Jackson's head.

963
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:59,160
I've seen him, I've seen like a one story high fire breathing three dimensional Bob face sculptures.

964
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:02,240
We have some real fanatics in this religion.

965
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,480
Luckily, some of them are pretty good artists.

966
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,580
That's a good thing.

967
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:11,000
And very few of them have been serial killers that we know of.

968
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,000
As far as you know.

969
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,280
Brian?

970
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:15,680
Yeah.

971
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,860
I joined the church myself.

972
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:23,540
A couple of months ago and it's an honor to meet Mr. Stang, Reverend Stang, excuse me.

973
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,600
Right, that's Reverend Stang.

974
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,120
That's Reverend Stang.

975
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:25,580
Yeah.

976
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,100
I didn't spend six weeks at Dobbs Town University.

977
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,100
Of course not.

978
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:29,820
I didn't go to college for nothing.

979
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,640
How is Princess Wee, by the way?

980
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,620
Oh, Princess Wee is my wife.

981
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:35,620
Oh.

982
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,800
She is sound asleep.

983
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,560
She's much better.

984
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:43,820
You see, I'm speaking from Cleveland Heights, Ohio and it's 3.30 in the morning here.

985
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:44,260
Oh my.

986
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,840
So she's, I'm married to her.

987
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,400
She's a princess from outer space.

988
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,020
Cool.

989
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:50,420
Right?

990
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:54,040
And I actually have a really happy marriage.

991
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,120
There are such things as happy subjeans.

992
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:56,920
Well, I've heard of it.

993
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,200
Yeah, that's her official title, Queen of All the UFOs, if I remember correctly.

994
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,120
That's right.

995
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,700
Yeah, she is the queen of all the UFOs.

996
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:14,100
Unfortunately, being unidentified, we don't know which UFOs they are, so we can't figure out which is her home planet.

997
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,820
And although she should be weighted on the moon.

998
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,920
She's weighted on hand and foot by handmen and footmen.

999
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,080
Instead, she has to go to work like everybody else.

1000
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,340
I'd worship her.

1001
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:32,520
I'm still waiting to get an autographed picture of Princess Wee and stick it up on my altar and bow to her three times a day.

1002
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:33,960
Wow.

1003
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,080
Oh, it's great to know that we've got stalkers out there.

1004
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:37,620
That's great.

1005
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:38,820
No, no, no.

1006
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,160
All the way in Cleveland, eh?

1007
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:40,500
I just want a picture.

1008
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,500
I'm not going to stalk her.

1009
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:43,600
He's just a worshiper.

1010
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,900
He's a faithful, loyal worshiper.

1011
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:53,300
Well, like I said, there was a time when the Church of the Subgenius was all a bunch of lonely, nerdy guys with glasses.

1012
00:53:53,740 --> 00:54:00,080
And we gradually changed that by lying and saying there were lots and lots of girls.

1013
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,700
And by golly, it finally happened.

1014
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:13,080
And now some of our, like for instance, out in Atlanta, Reverend Susie the Floozy has a weekly radio show on a college station.

1015
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,080
And there's...

1016
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,040
The Connieites, we call them.

1017
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,840
These are the women's auxiliary, you might say.

1018
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,960
Women's sewing auxiliary at the church.

1019
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:24,620
As they were, yeah.

1020
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,120
We borrowed a lot from the Masons.

1021
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:27,920
Really?

1022
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,740
Well, you know, they secretly control the universe.

1023
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:31,700
I've heard that, yeah.

1024
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,420
And so we figured, you know, they had...

1025
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,600
They must be doing something right.

1026
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,260
Yeah.

1027
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:39,820
And...

1028
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,600
All those cool uniforms they wear.

1029
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:43,440
Yeah.

1030
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,360
Yeah, they all...

1031
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,880
Yeah, and they have some great initiation stunts and so forth.

1032
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,140
We've tried to borrow from them.

1033
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:56,200
And of course the secret names business, the whole secret society thing.

1034
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,200
Right, yeah, right.

1035
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,000
I like that too.

1036
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,200
Except you're not a secret, I mean.

1037
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:07,300
And the good Reverend will be getting an order from me in a couple of weeks after I get my tax return, getting you three Bob books.

1038
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:07,860
Cool.

1039
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:09,200
That's right.

1040
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:09,920
There are three.

1041
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,340
We have the Old Testament, the New Testament, and yet the Third Testament.

1042
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:14,340


1043
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:17,480
And the Third Testament, all right.

1044
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:23,940
Well, the new one is the Cyclopedia of Slack, the Bobliography, and that's the latest one.

1045
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,740
But the basic one is called the Book of the Subgenius.

1046
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:37,820
If you Google subgenius and spell it correctly without an O, you'll suddenly know everything.

1047
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,040
You'll know all you need to know and then you'll wish you didn't.

1048
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:41,740
See?

1049
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,180
It really sucks you in.

1050
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:44,320
Yeah.

1051
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1052
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1053
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1054
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1055
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1056
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1057
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1058
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1059
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1060
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1061
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1062
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1063
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1064
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1065
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1066
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1067
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1068
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1069
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1070
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1071
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320


1072
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,660
I haven't had a real job since the 90s.

1073
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,400
Praise Bob, it's been play for pay for over a decade now.

1074
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:57,420
By the way, the collages before that were by Norrell Preff and the background music here is by Speed Cave.

1075
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:09,340

1076
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,500
Okay, good.

1077
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,820
Now give me a little smile.

1078
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,420
Come on, now.

1079
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:23,100
Okay, I'm not used to smiling.

1080
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,680
Can I see something about this reflective surface?

1081
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,740
Yeah, it appears to be mercury, doesn't it?

1082
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,880
I reflect too much.

1083
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:33,800
Except mercury is liquid at this stage.

1084
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,860
I reflect too much.

1085
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,900
I have too much in sight.

1086
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:44,300
Okay, so I have to make sure I'm not walking around in this, you know, in this, you know,

1087
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:44,300


1088
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:44,300


1089
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:44,300


1090
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:44,300


1091
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:44,300


1092
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,560
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

1093
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,120
What worries me is that it's reflecting everything but us.

1094
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,600
I need more outside.

1095
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,160
I reflect too much.

1096
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,640
I hate to be the one non-scientist that picks the sub-guards.

1097
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,700
I reflect too much.

1098
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:11,400
One could self-reflect oneself into a grave.

1099
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,260
Dig your own grave and save!

1100
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,900
One could self-reflect oneself into a grave.

1101
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,440
Snap into a daydreamer.

1102
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,540
Snap into a daydreamer.

1103
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,880
Snap out of it!

1104
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,140
Never get out.

1105
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,160
Never get out.

1106
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,700
Never get out.

1107
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,000
Stop eating.

1108
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,380
Stop drinking water.

1109
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,180
Snap out of it!

1110
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:05,340
Stop moving.

1111
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,100
Stop living.

1112
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,240
Never get out.

1113
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,120
Now to pull this predator in close.

1114
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,000
Spring entry.

1115
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,900
Never get out.

1116
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,800
Never get out.

1117
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:29,900
Get out.

1118
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,600
Okay, whatever.

1119
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:31,560
Go!

1120
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,120
Go!

1121
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:32,600
Get out of here!

1122
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,820
We're out of here, friends.

1123
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,240
That was Phineas Narco of NationalCynical.com.

1124
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:46,000
Where you can get a lot more Phineas if you want.

1125
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,500
Christ Bob.

1126
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,760
Feeeeeble.

1127
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,300
Feeeeeble.

1128
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,960
Welcome to eternal good news of hell.

1129
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,620
We need punishment.

1130
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:06,780
The righteous receive eternal everlasting punishment.

1131
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,180
Instantaneous non-existence.

1132
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,980
It is not punishment.

1133
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,100
Go to hell.

1134
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,540
Cease to exist.

1135
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,040
Day and night, forever and ever.

1136
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:16,600
There.

1137
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:16,980
There.

1138
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:22,000
What will happen sexually, my friend, please do not cut it off.

1139
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:26,460
D-E-M-O-N-O-K.

1140
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,800
Have a good eternity.
