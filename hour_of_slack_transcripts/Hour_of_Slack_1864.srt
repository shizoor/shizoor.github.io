1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
Nan nan nan naaaaaaaaan

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,140
Nan nan nan naaaaaaaaan

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,580
Ugh, cunt

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,160
The s-

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,680
Lan lan lan lan lan lan la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

6
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,780
Time to rock.

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,760
Time to rock.

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,820
Time to rock.

9
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:15,560
Time to rock.

10
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,360
Too much.

11
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,240
Too often.

12
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,800
Time to rock.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,800
Time to rock.

14
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,640
Time to rock.

15
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,440
I'm in there and have to dig life with father, and I mean father Slack.

16
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,360
I'm so curious.

17
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,940
I'm so curious.

18
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,460
I'm so curious.

19
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:15,580
I'm so curious.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,760
I'm so curious.

21
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:17,820
I'm so curious.

22
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,280
Hi, this is Pat Paulson.

23
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,000
I just want to say that I endorse Bob as my running mate in this year's election,

24
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,360
and this is the hour of Slack in Dallas, Texas.

25
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,120
You know, I know where that is.

26
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,980
Coming up on your morning show.

27
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,200
On your morning station, it's the hour of Slack drive-by comedy hour.

28
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,760
Once again, your wacky hosts Ivan Stang and Lonesome Cowboy Dave

29
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,060
help ease your morning commute with a fun-filled hour of classic rock, laughs, and trivia

30
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,220
where you can win fabulous prizes.

31
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,780
So stay tuned to your classic rock station coming up right after this.

32
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,700
Goodbye, Earth.

33
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,720
Good morning, Planet X.

34
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,340
Good morning, Planet X.

35
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,560
Say your prayers, little one.

36
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,080
Don't forget my son to include everyone.

37
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,000
I tuck you in, warm within.

38
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,700
Keep you free from sin till the Sandman he comes.

39
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,980
Sleep with one eye open.

40
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,160
Rip in your pillow tight.

41
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,180
Eggs and lights.

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,940
Enter night.

43
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,760
Take my hand.

44
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,000
We're off to Never Never Land.

45
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,740
It's so crazy about Bob.

46
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,500
Everybody in here is so crazy about Bob.

47
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,080
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

48
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,440
All of the religions will be having a heart attack.

49
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,020
A pipe full of frog equals what?

50
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,780
A lot of slack.

51
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,260
No matter how you kill him, he always keeps coming back.

52
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,680
Bob.

53
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,680
I'm talking about you.

54
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:29,680


55
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,560
You thousands of bucks!

56
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,500
And don't expect wickedly bad guys like me to come back alive first time.

57
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:34,580
Don't tell me you haven't no idea what that blind dog pint is.

58
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,060
I also don't get surprised when a guy in play costs 1-1-0 in the mitzvah.

59
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,060


60
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,060


61
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,280
Fisherman.

62
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,620
You're classified as anêus?

63
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:36,740
Bob.

64
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,840
Full of Roundfighting.

65
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,780
Full of cribs.

66
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,620
Lynn of the Lawless divertments.

67
00:04:59,620 --> 00:04:59,620


68
00:04:59,620 --> 00:04:59,620


69
00:04:59,620 --> 00:04:59,660
Fear of provisional development control. Fear of going disguised to a CGI suff.

70
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,500
And this guy's keep looking to the skies

71
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,620
At the saucers flying by

72
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,540
And maybe by and by

73
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,000
You will see the light at the end of the pipe

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,420
That leads to Bob Dobbs

75
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,300
Bob Dobbs

76
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,680
Talking about the salesman

77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,620
To the gods

78
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,020
He's still in check of the coffin lid

79
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,560
On a conspiracy of normality

80
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,720
Oh, who could it be but Bob?

81
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:43,660
Oh, who could it be but Bob?

82
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,860
Crazy about Bob

83
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,440
Cause I looked deep into his eyes

84
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,500
Saw the dots littering

85
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,860
Soon I was hypnotized

86
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,080
Now there is no difference between two divides

87
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,180
The rich became the beggar

88
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,260
And the fool became the wise

89
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,800
Cause it's a way out, far out

90
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,960
Psychedelic freak out

91
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,860
Took a hit at Bob

92
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,440
I'm starting to freak out

93
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,300
Geek out

94
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,640
Bob Dobbs

95
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,840
My prince, I gotta look out

96
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,080
Look out everyone

97
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,020
Here he comes

98
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,640
It's Bob

99
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,100
Bob Dobbs

100
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,340
Bob Dobbs

101
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:10,720
Look out

102
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,140
Here he comes

103
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,140


104
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,960
Bob Dobbs

105
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,700
Look out

106
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,060
You wish you could forget

107
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,440
You wish you could forget

108
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,800
You wish you could forget

109
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,020
About Bob

110
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,180
Everybody up here is so crazy about Bob

111
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,980
Well, time to rock, friends

112
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,380
And the Bob rap

113
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,880
Were by this new guy

114
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,760
The Great Neptune

115
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,240
Yes, the Great Neptune

116
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,900
We're going to be playing tons more stuff

117
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,920
By the Great Neptune

118
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:41,360
Who is at www.neptune.itgo.com

119
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,420
Or josephicus at yahoo.com

120
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,760
Friends, and we heard

121
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,580
Well, this whole show

122
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,280
Is the show designed to drive you insane

123
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,080
And make you think somebody slipped you a mickey

124
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,700
Isn't that a mickey meter?

125
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,440
And so we also heard

126
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,540
Pat Boone and Motormat

127
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,920
Driving you crazy

128
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,200
And upcoming friends

129
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,520
J.R. Bob Dobbs himself

130
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,580
And in the background we hear

131
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,900
M.C. Kevrock with Time Control

132
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,560
actor Larry

133
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,020
Dr. Hackman

134
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,040
sound rest in peace

135
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,220
Stlinge

136
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,000
Bob

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,400
pasa

138
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,540
COSTA

139
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:41,780
Thanck

140
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,780
Design

141
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:44,980
welt

142
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,340
Come on, Bob.

143
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,260
Come on in.

144
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:09,000
And the worst thing was I got a little angel baby hair in my spaghetti.

145
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,840
That was the worst thing.

146
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,800
I had angel baby hair in my spaghetti.

147
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,520
And once I get to my spaghetti, I start to get a little noodley, you know.

148
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,360
I hate that.

149
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,520
I hate to feel noodley.

150
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,580
You know, once you run around here along the sun, you just can't.

151
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,180
A little too long, you just get noodley, you know.

152
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,880
You start to hang out a little too long.

153
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,060
And noodle, noodle starts to noodle.

154
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,860
That's a sad day.

155
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,040
I hate it when my little noodley starts to fart along.

156
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,800
Yes.

157
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,860
So I try to.

158
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,780
I try to.

159
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,440
Rub things on it.

160
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,560
And a little baby toes.

161
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,620
A little baby toes all over the tent, too.

162
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,340
And there's one right up there, Bob.

163
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,100
Who's there?

164
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,920
Right up on the sleeve of the shirt of the jacket of the tent.

165
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,200
On the sleeve of the shirt of the tangly bag.

166
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,140
Okay.

167
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,100
And now I want you to gently feel your neighbor's nipple to your left and to your right.

168
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,580
Bob?

169
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,260
I'm so sorry.

170
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,820
I might not know if you have been to books now, but if not...

171
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,560
Three days at a time.

172
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:32,560


173
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,120
I have to let the bad news stay with you and you don't know what I'm up to.

174
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,120


175
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,320
Probably because I hate it when these things happen.

176
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,320


177
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,340
Just keep getting better and better and better.

178
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:37,340


179
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,080
And you're too scared now.

180
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


181
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,440
But at the moment, you can breathe all you want.

182
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,620
Because I love pigs out there.

183
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,640
It's love.

184
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:41,640


185
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:41,640


186
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:41,640


187
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:41,640


188
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:41,640


189
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:41,640


190
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,180
It's love to life.

191
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,780
It's love to life.

192
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:42,780


193
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,560
Wife, don't want no nine to five

194
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,360
I want a life, don't want no babies

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,020
Don't want no wife, don't want no nine to five

196
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,860
I want a life

197
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,560
People say that I gotta grow up

198
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,880
Hey, get into the younger men, I gotta settle down

199
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,380
Find a wife and make me a move to the white-brained part of town

200
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,840
Boy, do the job of working for the men when they don't really appreciate you

201
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,200
I'll surely go watching the fat on the back when your heart gives a liver of bruise

202
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,380
And I don't want no babies, don't want no wife

203
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,700
Don't want no nine to five, I want a life

204
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,140
Don't want no babies, don't want no wife

205
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,360
Don't want no nine to five, I want a life

206
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Cause I love to play music, love to make music

207
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,640
Love to make money, love to meet women

208
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,080
Is that so funny?

209
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,220
Love to play music, love to make money

210
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,700
Love to meet women, is that so funny?

211
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,080
No!

212
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,860
People say I gotta grow up, I ain't getting any younger

213
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,020
And I gotta settle down

214
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,240
Find a wife, I'll make a move to

215
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,360
The white-brained part of town

216
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,880
Boy, do the job of working for the men when they don't really appreciate you

217
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,340
I'll surely go watching the fat on the back when your heart gives a liver of bruise

218
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,500
And I don't want no babies, don't want no wife

219
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,820
Don't want no nine to five, I want a life

220
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,180
Don't want no babies, don't want no wife

221
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,420
Don't want no nine to five, I want a life

222
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,360
Cause I love to play music, love to make music

223
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,960
Love to make money, love to meet women

224
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,100
Is that so funny?

225
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,280
Love to play music, love to make money

226
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,580
Love to meet women, is that so funny?

227
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,180
No!

228
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,240
No!

229
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,680
Yeah!

230
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,360
, a facepalm!

231
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,260
M-a-cha-b.

232
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:19,260


233
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,720
and those dreams that I awoke,

234
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:21,780
they lead me好

235
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:21,920
look how I troublesome

236
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:21,940
me thisick

237
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:21,940


238
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:21,960
music

239
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,760
Train

240
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,080
P-P-Praise Me Bob!

241
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,020
Easy

242
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,200
Taylor Swift

243
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,200


244
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,060
The concert with Sam Brok

245
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:42,340
that there was a volume of rock music that I loved.

246
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:42,340


247
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:47,460
Thousands will die by starvation, riots, or even their own hand.

248
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:53,960
This is the sort of depression that destroys the faith of a people and their nation.

249
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,240
The sort of depression that does not make one stronger from the great challenge it brings,

250
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,520
but rather weaker.

251
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,140
I stand before you today with a message born not of hope, but of despair.

252
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:20,020
Yes, misery awaits us all, and there's nothing we can do to avert this grim fate.

253
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,480
This economic depression is far too great for any of us to overcome,

254
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,920
and there is nothing left for America to do but suffer.

255
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,320
All is lost. The situation is hopeless.

256
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,740
Yes, we as a nation,

257
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,300
are doomed.

258
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,780
Doomed.

259
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,320
Doomed.

260
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,720
Doomed.

261
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,240
Next song.

262
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,640
Ah yes, took a little while until we found something that was, uh,

263
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,900
how shall I say, more spiritually enlightening

264
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:08,380
to our, uh, to our, uh, general atmosphere of, uh, new reality.

265
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,080
Ah.

266
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,320
Ah.

267
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,320


268
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,320


269
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,200
I don't know the title for this song.

270
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,140
Andrew, I'm sure will write it down on the tape afterwards.

271
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,480
But here we go.

272
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,380
I try, try fear.

273
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,720
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

274
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,420
Hello, boys and girls, and snuggles.

275
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,100
Love you, Robin.

276
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,780
Bonnie?

277
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,840
How you like my ears?

278
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,660
They're really floppy, huh?

279
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,160
And really fuzzy.

280
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,860
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

281
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,680
The Bummy Crowds?

282
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,520
Everywhere?

283
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,460
Oh, look!

284
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,580
There's a fuzzy bear.

285
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,020
Everywhere.

286
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,080
Everywhere.

287
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,080


288
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,800
Everybody be happy.

289
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,980
Our house.

290
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,840
Cotton candy and clowns.

291
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,640
Balloons flying in the sky.

292
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,680
Ha-ha.

293
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,680
Everybody be happy.

294
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,620
Everybody be happy.

295
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,080
Everybody be happy.

296
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,080


297
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,080


298
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,080


299
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,080


300
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,940
Don't question how or why.

301
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,720
Happiness is a good story.

302
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,200
Sadness is a sin.

303
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,700
Don't be ugly.

304
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,600
Be cute and snuggly.

305
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,520
Ha-ha-ha.

306
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,160
Be fuzzy.

307
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,040
Buries in.

308
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,700
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

309
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,740
This is not cool here.

310
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,500
Coming down.

311
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,820
Real cuteness is what I want.

312
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,340
Must be cute.

313
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,940
Don't be scary.

314
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,140
Gotta be hairy.

315
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,620
Don't be hairy.

316
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,160
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

317
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,980
Happiness is mandatory.

318
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,060
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

319
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


320
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


321
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


322
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


323
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


324
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


325
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


326
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


327
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


328
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


329
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


330
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


331
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


332
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


333
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


334
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


335
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,060


336
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:52,000
He knows that and be true to the story Happiness is mandatory

337
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:06,180
Do you feel cute? Well do ya, punk?

338
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:17,080
Oh look at my fluffy tail. Oh it's so fluffy and it's got me

339
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:25,640
And everyone must be cute. Everyone must be cute

340
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,180
Our cute people must be obeyed

341
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,540
Our uncute people must be destroyed

342
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:39,800
The final solution to ugliness will be

343
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,560
Cute? Why is it cute?

344
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,340
Cute! We must have big bright eyes

345
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,900
We must all be cute

346
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,500
We must all look up in the sky and see the white fluffy clouds

347
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,060
I'm cute

348
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,780
You're cute

349
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,160
We're all cute

350
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,200
Hello, Barbie, this is your father, Guru Saraduchi

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:01,740

Jehovah Hates Fred, by the way, I gave their website wrong last time.

374

JehovahHatesFred.com is spelled J-E-H-O-V-A Hates Fred dot com.

00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,620
Late one Sunday night

Then I looked off into the cold distance

442
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,860
And what did I see

443
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,940
Looked like one solitary headlight

444
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,020
Coming after me

445
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,620

00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,920
Bob will save

573
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,740
Bob's my toaster

574
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,200
Bob's my fridge

575
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,660
Bob's my little sister

576
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,420
Mitch

577
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,520
Bob will cost you

578
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,780
Bob is free

579
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,520
Bob's the lock

580
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,140
And Bob's the key

581
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,260
In short, Bob is the man

582
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,600
Who used your leg as a frying pan

583
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,540
If your mind is a jar

584
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,300
You can pour it out of the sink

585
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,980
And the subgenius church

586
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,600
Is the missing link

587
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,200
Jump! Jump off the door!

588
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:57,520
Rebirth!

589
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,680
Because Bob is the future!

590
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,820
Woo!

591
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,420
Come on you lazy ass

592
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:03,540
Jump!

593
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,800
Bob!

594
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,940
You can see the future

595
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,860
It surrounds you

596
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,800
And it surrounds the imagery

597
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,540
In the church

598
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,340
Bob is the industrial information

599
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,600
And quantum revolution

600
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,420
Bob is the color of the future

601
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,120
What color is the future?

602
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,520
Bob is the bright refraction

603
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,200
Of the quantum field around us

604
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,100
It's because Bob has slack

605
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,900
So he can't be a man

606
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,320
Slack is the quantum field!

607
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,700
And that's why I'm on my knees praying now

608
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,640
Praying here before Bob

609
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,420
Because I am Bob

610
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,400
You know and that's the odd thing

611
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,820
Is because you know

612
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,680
I don't know if my mom was raped

613
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:50,840
By a parapaetic man with blonde hair

614
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,040
Who was delivering the milk

615
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,600
Pounding the milk

616
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,480
Getting a little hard

617
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,660
But you know but there it was

618
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,540
And I just came

619
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,140
And I just came again

620
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,140
And I just keep coming

621
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,820
I can't help

622
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,860
I can't help but come here

623
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,640
It's a special thing

624
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,860
Hallelujah brother!

625
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,980
And Bob is going to lead us into the future

626
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,620
Bob is going to be the next revolution

627
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,180
Bob is going to be the nanotech revolution

628
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,120
The quantum revolution

629
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,460
The spiritual revolution!

630
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,240
Ah!

631
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,840
Ah!

632
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,060
Ah!

633
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:23,640


634
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,540
Woo!

635
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:24,660
Woo!

636
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,700
Alright!

637
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,400
Yeah!

638
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,460
All these dot coms that you see

639
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,820
There's only one dot com that matters

640
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,640
And that is

641
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,540
www.subgenius.com

642
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,500
Woo!

643
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,640
So what does this all have to do with you?

644
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,280
Well you guys

645
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,120
You're yetis!

646
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,280
You are the future!

647
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,940
You have to use that quantum field for your future

648
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,960
You guys have to make the apocalypse happen

649
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,520
You have to make the apocalypse happen

650
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,460
The more you're yourself

651
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,780
The faster the apocalypse will come

652
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,840
Ah!

653
00:32:59,360 --> 00:32:59,840
Woo!

654
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,220
Woo!

655
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:00,320
Woo!

656
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,540
Woo!

657
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:00,720
Woo!

658
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:00,960
Woo!

659
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,140
Woo!

660
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,360
Woo!

661
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,940
Yes friends!

662
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,700
Mystic homeboy at uh

663
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,860
Triple X Day

664
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,600
Uh we also heard Bob is a Rock

665
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,540
That great old classic remastered now

666
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,020
From the original tapes by Bleepo Abernathy

667
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,340
And before that

668
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,860
Get off the Devil's Payroll

669
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,200
By the folks behind Broken Circle Gospel Deluxe

670
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,140
Praise Bob

671
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,940
That's oh good!

672
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,320
Hey!

673
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,160
Hey!

674
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,680
Thank you!

675
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,380
Well thank you Bob

676
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,820
Now I'll have a drink

677
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,080
I mean man

678
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,080


679
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,080


680
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,080


681
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,080


682
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,500
Bob there's no perfect

683
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:19,860
Camera's just gone

684
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,080
ей

685
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,960
Uh officious

686
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:20,960


687
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:20,960


688
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:20,960


689
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:20,960


690
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:20,960


691
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:20,960


692
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:20,960


693
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:20,960


694
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:20,960


695
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,940
I'm just a kid

696
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,520
ble

697
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:27,120
My shoes got cow stuff on them.

698
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,500
It's the way conspiracy works, friends.

699
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,440
And conspiracy creeps into every human endeavor

700
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,580
by nature of humanity.

701
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,460
That's why we just try to say,

702
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,120
well, screw the humans.

703
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,380
We're subgeniuses.

704
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:43,900
We're different.

705
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,360
Subgenius can be any age, any size, shape, color,

706
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,640
can be from any background, any nationality,

707
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,840
any damn planet or species.

708
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,620
We don't care as long as they have

709
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,820
the fragment of Bob consciousness

710
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,040
and have sent $30 to P.O. Box 1436,

711
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,500
Dallas, Texas, and my P.O. Box.

712
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,420
Ah, yes, friends.

713
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,560
You can be saved even if it kills you.

714
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,780
And that's how much Bob loves you, friends.

715
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,320
He will kill you to save you

716
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,960
because, you know, once you're saved,

717
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,260
Bob, you never really die.

718
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,180
You know his old saying.

719
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,320
You know what Bob offers?

720
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,920
His most famous discovery.

721
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,580
Eternal salvation

722
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,820
or triple your money back.

723
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,160
What other words it offers that, friends?

724
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,340
If you don't live forever,

725
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,080
you get your money back.

726
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,640
A perfect, perfect formula

727
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,760
for belief and love

728
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,820
and slack.

729
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,740
And slack, whatever that is.

730
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,720
Slack for me would be to shut up for a minute.

731
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,920
Oh, it's been a long day.

732
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,420
Someday the exodus will come.

733
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,500
Bob's promise will come true.

734
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,040
Our alien benefactors will give us our own planets

735
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,120
and we will be able to create

736
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,460
the 25-hour day,

737
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,500
the 26-hour day,

738
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,420
the Martian time slip,

739
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,380
the day that lasts forever,

740
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,120
the night that never ends here,

741
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:24,680
friends.

742
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,900
The night that smells like cinnamon for three days

743
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,300
and then it smells like epoxy the next three days.

744
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,760
Any planet you want.

745
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,420
The most bizarre, outlandish things you can imagine

746
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,200
could come physically, literally true.

747
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,800
You better hope you have a pure mind

748
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,940
when that happens.

749
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,960
You better hope that you aren't thinking

750
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,000
real paranoid bad thoughts

751
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,080
in the back of your mind

752
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,360
at the moment when every wish can come true.

753
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,220
You better hope that you really have some good wishes.

754
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:54,320


755
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:54,880
chasing your head

756
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,840
and so you can't be constantly thinking about

757
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,620
how you're gonna get back at that conspiracy bastard

758
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,960
or so forth.

759
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,700
Friends, you gotta just learn to rise above it.

760
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,780
Time control is what Bob has been preaching all along.

761
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,460
And unfortunately, until we get the time machines working,

762
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,480
the only true form of time control available to us

763
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,600
is that boring virtue called patience.

764
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,180
And that's why you need to remember about the funny little monkey.

765
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,440
Because otherwise, it's so easy to lose patience with them.

766
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,540
And God knows, only Bob stands between most of us

767
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,740
and us becoming mad serial killers,

768
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,360
machine gunning entire McDonald's full of pink boys

769
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,600
out of their smugness.

770
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,600
Meanwhile...

771
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:24,320


772
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:54,320


773
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:24,320


774
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:54,320


775
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,160
I don't understand you, poor mama macumba.

776
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:09,520
Would you speak a little clearly, Mercedes Benzine?

777
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,800
That's your mama, baby.

778
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,320
Who is who?

779
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,180
I don't know.

780
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,360
And what is what?

781
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,260
Something I just got to know.

782
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,440
And why is this?

783
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,160
Somebody tell me now.

784
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:24,300
Why is this?

785
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,300


786
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,300


787
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,300


788
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,300


789
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,300


790
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:38,900
Hua submits to music.

791
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,340
Tons of kids play it bonus mixing!

792
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:48,360
When aimento holds a melody

793
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:48,400
two appealing?".

794
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,300
She could hear her men

795
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:50,300


796
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,860
ält be feeling.

797
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,000
How much more is going on?

798
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,160
Impossible.

799
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,280
But would it make a difference?

800
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:22,280
You wonder who, you wonder who, you used to was, who was it anyway, and what you do, I used to work at the post office, look at your hair, I scratch my hair, and look around, I don't wanna, I don't wanna do the do-do-do, but what you lost, just so you see, will not be found, it just can't be found, do you know what you are, I'm gonna buy me a Mercedes-Benz, you are what you are, I need a big red one now, you used what you had,

801
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:49,100
I got a 450 SLC, it can't go make hair, oh yeah, you ain't what you know, got some dark clubs sticking out of the truck, so you see what you got, I want down to the rink and swim, you are what you is, do you wanna see my grime, and that's all it is, I'm high, you up, you have all, you are what you is, this is some lumpy gravy you made here, and that's all it is, I look like a damn cabana, you are what you is, and your mama, oh, and that's all it is,

802
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,140
give me a car with hair like what you is,

803
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,980
I'm a boxer, show me what you is, and that's all it is,

804
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,320
I'm a boxer, show me what you is,

805
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:21,080
I know a fat old policeman, he's always on our street, a fat and jolly red-faced man, he really is a treat, he's too quite for a policeman, he's never known to frown, and everybody says he is the happiest man in town,

806
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:21,640
oh,

807
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:50,460
he laughs upon what you feed, he laughs upon his feet, he laughs at everybody when he's walking in the street,

808
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,260
he never can stop laughing, he laughs at everybody when he's walking in the street,

809
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:58,620
he laughs at everybody when he's running, he says he's never cried, but once he did arrest a man, and laughed until he cried out.

810
00:42:59,340 --> 00:42:59,340


811
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,700
laughs

812
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,360
ascend pr,,

813
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,880
ascend pr,,

814
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,680
ascend pr,,

815
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,960
His jolly face it wrinkled, and then he shut his eyes

816
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,680
He opened his great mouth, and was a wondrous sight

817
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,340
He said, I must arrest you, he didn't know what for

818
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,280
And then he started laughing, and then he dragged his jaw

819
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,660
So if you chance to meet him, when walking round the town

820
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,060
Just shake him by his fat old hand

821
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,260
And give him half a kiss

822
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:13,340
And then you'll start him laughing with all his best in mind

823
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,060
But really y'all, I kinda liked it

824
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,180
You like that?

825
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,820
Yeah, you know, I thought it was funny

826
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,400
I kinda liked it

827
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,600
I kinda liked it

828
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,220
I kinda liked the tickle

829
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,900
The way it tickled my nose

830
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,360
I love the way it tickles my nose, you know

831
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,520
The little hairy

832
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,120
Oh yeah, the

833
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:55,620
Oh, don't tickle that little hairy bobby nose

834
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,740
Oh, you're gonna make me start up

835
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,260
And think about love

836
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,880
And you know what the bad thing about

837
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,120
The bad thing is about

838
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:05,260
The bad thing is about

839
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:05,260


840
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,980
Love is subgenius love

841
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,540
And you know, subgenius love

842
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,880
Has fire and burning and death

843
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,060
Large holes

844
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:18,880
Yeah, there's just not enough large holes, you know

845
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,740
I really tried to make large holes with my potato cannons

846
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,400
But they just didn't, they just didn't quite reach

847
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,280
You know, I pounded and pounded

848
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,760
I pounded

849
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,340
I got a doodle in my noodle

850
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,160
And his name is Minky Boodle

851
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,200

I got a doodle in my noodle

867
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,280
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it

00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,320
Cause the excess

892
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,500
Might blow up the sun

893
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,180
Bob's the Rocker

894
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,500

919
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:24,960

00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:46,560
We'll be right back.

934
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,960
You can't believe it at all.

935
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,380
You can't believe it at all.

936
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,820
You can't believe it at all.

937
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,880
You can't believe it at all.

00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,780
Oh, yes.

00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,540
Bob's Your Uncle by the Reverend LeChuck,

940
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,500
delivered to alt-binary slack in mp3.form.

941
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,760
Before that, we heard Space Ghost with Minky Boodle.

942
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,880
And you are what you is.

943
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:40,680
That was the Persuasions doing Zappa from their album Frankly A Capella.

944
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,780
Before that, we heard some preaching from the Puffer Dome at Starwood 2000

945
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,620
with Einstein's Secret Orchestra and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

946
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,480
Friends, this is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

947
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,800
And if you want more information about Bob, you just write to this post office box I'm about to give.

948
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,120
I'm giving it right now. Here it comes.

949
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,860
P.O. Box 807.

950
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,080
807.

951
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,140
Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

952
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,480
Once again, that's Bob at Box.

953
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,740
807.

954
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,820
Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

955
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,920
And we've got some special Brother Cleve remastered hymnification coming right up.

956
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,000
So stay tuned to www.subgenius.com.

957
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,620
This is Ego Plum with Ebola music.

958
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,780
I got a comment in the background.

959
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:35,740
Ego Plum.

960
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,420
Well, once was a man.

961
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,960
The world's greatest salesman.

962
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,060
And he had devised a plan

963
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:02,320
to get the shackles from my feet.

964
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,760
Here I am, oh now he's gone

965
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,620
A martyr for the cause of his father

966
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:15,560
And he's coming again

967
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,520
Who knew that the first shot

968
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,480
Was gonna be the last shot

969
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,040
But he's got a hard driving pipe

970
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,160
The gas smoke all through the night

971
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,540
And although he may be hurting

972
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:38,040
The universe will keep on squirting

973
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,100
All the fun, oh

974
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,260
And he's coming again

975
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,360
He can save us from the men in black

976
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,660
With just a shot from his mighty sack

977
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,180
If only he could make it back

978
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,900
From the land of the dead

979
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,060
But until that happy day

980
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,560
We can only drink and say

981
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,740
Father's my Lord

982
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,960
And he's coming again

983
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,960
I know he can make it

984
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,840
Without him we can't take it

985
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,080
We'll lose the pieces of our minds

986
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,840
To the pink boys and the whims

987
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,040
Until the day that he comes back

988
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,460
It'll be over

989
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,880
We'll lose the pieces of our minds

990
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,160
To the pink boys and the whims

991
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,220
Until the day that he comes back

992
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,000
And he's coming again

993
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,320
Father's my Lord

994
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,200
Father's my Lord

995
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,000
Father's my Lord

996
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,840
Father's my Lord

997
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:18,840


998
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,520
Father's my Lord

999
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,240
And he's coming again

1000
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,260
And if we don't want the exits upon us

1001
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,000
And if we don't want the exits upon us

1002
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Then we need Bob to be on his part

1003
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,140
Then we need Bob to be on his part

1004
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:30,740
Then we need Bob to be on his part

1005
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,540
Then Bob is my Lord

1006
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,800
Then Bob is my Lord

1007
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,960
Then Bob is my Lord

1008
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,260
Bob is my Lord

1009
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,120
And he's coming again

1010
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,580
Great God is coming

1011
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,240
So bring my death

1012
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,540
Again

1013
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:54,560
Wow!

1014
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,560
Praise Pope Bob!

1015
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,340
This is an epistle from

1016
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,480
This is an epistle from the Reverend David Lee Black

1017
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,580
The Reverend David Lee Black

1018
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,480
I don't believe this

1019
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,460
Read the first and last paragraph

1020
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,760
Dear fellow subgeni

1021
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,820
The evil forces of anti-slack that prevent me from going to America

1022
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:16,620
Are the very same ones that prevent me from being with my brothers and sisters of slack on X Day in Brushwood

1023
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:17,700
Subsequently

1024
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,140
I think he meant consequently

1025
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,360
Subsequently

1026
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:27,520
I must have my own X Day in Kiel, Germany with my brothers and sisters of slack here

1027
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,460
There's nothing

1028
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,460
I mean nothing

1029
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:33,200
That will stop me from getting on board the intergalactic love ships

1030
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,140
On Wednesday the 5th of July

1031
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:38,060
And being with the rest of you

1032
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,240
Not the DEA

1033
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,160
Not Janet Cujo Reno

1034
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,140
Not Bill Clinton and his hordes of concubines

1035
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,120
Not customs

1036
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:49,800
Not even Mulder and Scully and the reanimated corpse of J. Edgar Hoover

1037
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,600
Could stop me when that platform lowers

1038
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,480
The red carpet rolls out

1039
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,420
And I'm carried on board in a throne like an African chieftain

1040
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:01,140
By my leather clad alien love slaves of the cosmos

1041
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,740
I had a dream the other night

1042
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,140
Which makes me believe this year is the year

1043
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,360
One of the love goddesses came to me in a dream

1044
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,420
Like a space cherub loved succubus

1045
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,900
She floated through the air and revealed to me a divine revelation

1046
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,020
Which I make known to you now

1047
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,680
On her right leg and left leg there were ten holes

1048
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,640
And a piece in the middle there were three

1049
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,660
And in the middle there were three holes

1050
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,840
She could suckle

1051
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,160
Twenty-three

1052
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,740
Which is the number of the illuminated

1053
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:36,320
She took my hand and we floated up to the heavens

1054
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:40,280
The pills are kicking in about this part in the epiphany

1055
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,380
A-bom-a-ged-i

1056
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,500
And anyway he foresees a battle of Armageddon

1057
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,260
Where the demonic forces which you guys were talking about

1058
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,100
Which have enslaved the human race

1059
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,580
With the yoke of bad television

1060
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:56,820
And have sold them sportswear, media-induced self-conceit

1061
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,640
Landmines and cheap adrenaline-producing drugs

1062
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,940
To then herd their unwitting victims into soccer stadiums

1063
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,940
And pop-star concert halls

1064
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,920
Only to farm their pain and misery

1065
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,120
To feed its insatiable appetite

1066
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,840
For hurt and suffering

1067
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,340
Have finally realized that the exes know about their evil intentions

1068
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:23,220
To make hostile bids for benign alien space corporations

1069
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:26,520
Only to peddle their superficial cheapness

1070
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:26,820
Of the evil of the universe

1071
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,740
Hollywood black magic and so space mines

1072
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:34,480
So they can create a hell in space

1073
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,000
The intergalactic federation of alien races

1074
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,180
Which currently live in peace and harmony

1075
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:44,920
Will not tolerate their universal garden of Eden

1076
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,880
To be invaded by the evil monkey-snake god of earth

1077
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,240
The evil demon monkey-snake god

1078
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,940
Who will replace all the stars with poison apples

1079
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:56,040
And sell fig leaves to the goddesses

1080
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,880
Who have 23 holes

1081
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,740
This is all black all right

1082
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,700
As I looked down into earth

1083
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,060
I saw the saucers hovering over brushwood

1084
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,700
Lemuria and Kiel

1085
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,400
I saw smaller craft hovering over several other locations

1086
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,620
Where subgenius ministers who are rich in slack

1087
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:14,760
But poor in human money supposedly reside

1088
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,700
I could see the masses of the illuminated

1089
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,080
With their suitcases of cool

1090
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,880
Boarding the saucers of love, hope and happiness

1091
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,680
As they did the armies of earth

1092
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,080
Scrambled to destroy the invading love ships

1093
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:26,680
Of the sex goddesses

1094
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,480
The very threat to their existence

1095
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,880
Then it was the great and final war

1096
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,960
As the last space saucer

1097
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,520
Sex space saucer lifted high into the heavens

1098
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,040
I could see great war begin

1099
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,760
The navies and air armadas

1100
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,900
With their rapid response forces scrambling to attack

1101
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,420
I could hear the sirens of war around the planet wailing

1102
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,980
Heralding the inescapably impending doom

1103
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,100
That awaited citizens of this sinking battleship

1104
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,480
Of hate, war and misery

1105
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,660
But the great armies of earth didn't battle with the stars

1106
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,560
But the star cruisers of the love goddesses

1107
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,160
They battled with themselves

1108
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,880
They battled with each other

1109
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,160
For the right to battle with the invading saucers of slack

1110
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,520
Hovering above the planet as it burned

1111
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,140
I could hear the screams of billions of human souls

1112
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,840
Who weren't lucky enough to get off this planet with the chosen ones

1113
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,400
The alien sex goddesses took my hand again

1114
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,520
And floated with me back down to earth

1115
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,680
To my bed

1116
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,400
Back to my alcoholic narcosa

1117
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,680
And so I awakened with this revelation I now give

1118
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,880
And with this revelation I also send the symbolic other half

1119
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,940
In the form of a cake

1120
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:37,380
I want Stang to have everyone line up for this cake

1121
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:40,500
To be ritualistically served as communion of slack

1122
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,840
For all at Hex Day in Brushwood

1123
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:47,160
Make sure Nikki Death Chick gets a big piece

1124
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:52,160
I want a lion's share of the ass whopping next time I see her

1125
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:22,180
I want a lion's share of the ass whopping next time I see her

1126
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,040
Truly love you all

1127
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:37,040


1128
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,300
Your brother and his henchw Firth

1129
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:38,300


1130
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,420
My dongs

1131
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,760
YourORA

1132
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,580
My dongs

1133
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,740
To be Born

1134
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:50,600
Dear penis

1135
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,380
I don't know what you wanna sell

1136
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:52,380


1137
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,100
I don't think I like you anymore

1138
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:00,340
You used to watch me shave

1139
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,400
Now all you do is stare at the floor

1140
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,240
Oh dear penis

1141
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,200
I don't like you anymore

1142
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,900
It used to be you and me

1143
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,840
A paper towel and a dirty magazine

1144
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:21,520
That's all we needed to get by

1145
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,260
Now it seems things have changed

1146
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:30,260
I think that you're the one to blame

1147
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,280
Dear penis

1148
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,300
I don't like you anymore

1149
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,160
Now he sings

1150
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,980
Dear Rodney

1151
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:42,500
I don't think I like you anymore

1152
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,680
Cause when you get to drinking

1153
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,260
You put me places I've never been before

1154
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:52,380
Dear Rodney

1155
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,520
I don't like you anymore

1156
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,340
Why can't we just get a grip

1157
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,820
On our man-to-man relationship

1158
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,720
Come to terms with truly how we feel

1159
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:14,380
If we put our heads together

1160
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:17,500
We'd just stay home forever

1161
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,800
Dear penis

1162
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,820
I think I like you after all

1163
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,380
Oh and Rodney

1164
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,920
While you're shaving

1165
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,600
Shave my balls

1166
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,300
Laughter

1167
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,580
Applause

1168
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:34,940
Music

1169
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,960
Music

1170
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,080
Music

1171
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,320
Music

1172
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:52,380
Music

1173
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:52,380


1174
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:52,380


1175
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:52,380


1176
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:52,380


1177
01:00:52,400 --> 01:01:01,370
