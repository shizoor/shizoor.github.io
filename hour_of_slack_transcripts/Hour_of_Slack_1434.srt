1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Program, you are about to hear of all of Slack's fun funnels, with parody, satire, and comedy.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,820
Any reference to Bob, the Church of the Subgenius, religion, politics, or any other touchy subject is intended only as humor,

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,820
and to pass no reflection on the highest standards of WREK Atlanta, its staff, or that of Georgia Tech.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,100
The world knows it's just a show.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,660
The best show in the world.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,260
It's a conspiracy.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,300
And this week, the hour of Slack and all of the Church of the Subgenius that I know of,

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,760
salute Reverend Susie the Flusies,

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,800
1,000th episode of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse,

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:41,340
produced for Georgia Tech's WREK Atlanta for, could it be, 200 years!

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:48,760
This is probably the greatest hour of Slack ever, and it's really a Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

12
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,980
Hey, come on, flus, get up!

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,020
Come on, wakey, wakey, hands off, snakey!

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,800
You gotta do that very special episode of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse, get your butt up!

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,920
Oh, evil Susie, I do a very special episode of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse every week.

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,280
Oh yeah, don't I know it, but this one has to be a special show.

17
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,040
Who cares?

18
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,980
My audience is always...

19
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,220
Don't you're drunk.

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,380
I'll just run two hours of Aquarius and nobody will know the difference.

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,760
No, come on.

22
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,580
This one can't be just one song played over and over and over.

23
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,440
Yeah, no reruns of your old crap.

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,860
No spending 17 hours sodomizing George W. Bush.

25
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,000
This episode has to be completely and utterly special, flus.

26
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,160
Who says?

27
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,620
I say!

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,900
Give me one good reason why I should even care.

29
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,660
One?

30
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,760
You want one?

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,360
Uh huh.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Toots, I got one thousand freaking reasons why you need to pull out all the stops tonight.

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,000
Like what?

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,480
Okay, well let me start with Bob's Slack Time Funhouse number one.

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
Uh huh.

36
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,560
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse number two.

37
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,280
Uh, yeah.

38
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,240
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse number 350.

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,480
I got nothing here.

40
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,620
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse number 1,000.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,440
Uh, yes.

42
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:29,480
Hey, dumbass, we haven't done the 1,000th episode yet.

43
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:38,460
That's because, dumbass, you're doing the 1,000th episode of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse right now!

44
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,420
Huh?

45
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,780
You're shitting me.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,260
Hey, sugar plum, I couldn't crap anything as big as you.

47
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,080
No.

48
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,160
Yes.

49
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,760
There have been a thousand?

50
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,720
No.

51
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,640
Yeah, you and me both.

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,040
No.

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,280
No, there's gotta be like a dozen shows a year.

54
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,400
Okay, 52 shows a year, round it down to 50.

55
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,640
That means we've been doing this crap for nothing for...

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,960
What do you get?

57
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,340
What do you get, Flooz?

58
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,380
Will you do the math?

59
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,140
Oh, man.

60
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,560
Oh, five whole years?

61
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,420
Ugh, it's more like 20 years.

62
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,300
What?

63
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,000
20!

64
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,380
No.

65
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,020
Yeah!

66
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,620
What the freaking hell?

67
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,280
So that's why you have to do something special tonight.

68
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,220
Uh, first word...

69
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,300
Uh...

70
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,440
Come on, work with me.

71
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,020
No, it's time for me to put my hoof down.

72
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,940
It's time for the rubber to meet the road.

73
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,960
Oh, you want me to rerun a section?

74
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:44,620
Ow!

75
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,540
Did you have to do that?

76
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,700
Oh, shut up!

77
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,760
No.

78
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,760
No, there's going to be no phoning it in tonight, bimbo breath.

79
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,460
You can't just pull something out of your butt and slap it on the air.

80
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,780
But I do that every single freaking week.

81
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,260
Oh yeah, don't I know it.

82
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,620
Hey, no, Flooz.

83
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,580
You have been losing game for years now and it's damn past time that you return to your roots.

84
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,320
But it's radio.

85
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,180
They can't even see my hair.

86
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,760
Ow!

87
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,240
No!

88
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,460
You're some genius root you tail wagon idiot!

89
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:25,960
Look, I don't give two flying flips for you or your weirdo pals from the Merry Mutant Marching Society, but I do care about our mission.

90
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,380
What a mission.

91
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:27,880
I did...

92
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,060
Ow!

93
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,520
Our mission, dumbass, is survival of the Yeti race.

94
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,080
Huh?

95
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,900
I give them distractions every week.

96
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,880
No, you just don't get it.

97
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,160
Skits and giggles aren't enough to armor the flock against the pink slime they're soaking in.

98
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,900
Hey, but it's...

99
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,700
They need more than that.

100
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,200
But I tell them about Bob all the time.

101
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,080
Well, have you ever thought that maybe Bob isn't enough?

102
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:53,860
Yeah!

103
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,580
Oh, you didn't say that.

104
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,580
Yeah, I said that.

105
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,860
Yeah, yes.

106
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,200
Because to them out there, our high E-pop does just another internet meme.

107
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,020
But...

108
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,160
You need to go deeper.

109
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,980
You need to go to the core.

110
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,480
You need to explain to them why Bob.

111
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:11,920
Uh...

112
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,200
Why Bob?

113
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,880
Yes, why Bob.

114
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,700
Uh...

115
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,000
Why...

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,360
Why Bob?

117
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,980
That's because...

118
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,360
Dumbass!

119
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:22,960
Uh...

120
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,060
The why of Bob.

121
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,560
The reason he exists.

122
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,520
The reason we are subgeniuses.

123
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,140
The reason we are locked in this global, pre-cosmic struggle for our race's very survival.

124
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:34,840
Huh?

125
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,880
It's not enough to have a figurehead.

126
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,140
Huh?

127
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,640
You've got to have an enemy.

128
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,420
Uh...

129
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,100
Lose.

130
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,420
Uh...

131
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,860
You need to warn them what we are all about.

132
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:44,860


133
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:44,860


134
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:44,860


135
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:44,860


136
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:44,860


137
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:44,860


138
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:44,860


139
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:44,860


140
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:44,860


141
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:44,860


142
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:44,860


143
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,060
Uh...

144
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,360
You need to warn them what you're up against.

145
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,380
And you haven't been doing that.

146
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:47,840
Oh...

147
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,300
So it's going to be up to Evil Susie to do the heavy lifting as per usual.

148
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,320
So I am going to initiate scared slacks.

149
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,740
Ah!

150
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,240
Yes!

151
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,240
Yes!

152
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,220
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

153
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,400
Because it's time to warn the Seekers about the conspiracy!

154
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,460
Oh, damn!

155
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,060
Ah!

156
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,420
Yeah!

157
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,540
Ah...

158
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,700
Oh, this isn't going to be good.

159
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,140
Ah...

160
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,780
Oh, this isn't going to be good.

161
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:14,800


162
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:14,840
Oh, this isn't going to be good.

163
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:14,840


164
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:14,840


165
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:14,840


166
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,480
Now, where was I?

167
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,040
Oh, yes, yes.

168
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,840
It began far, far away from this lovely palace.

169
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:29,400
Born to humble parents somewhere in the Midwest, the child Bob experienced a traumatic, close

170
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,660
encounter with a UFO at the age of three.

171
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,240
Soon thereafter, he began to exhibit strange powers of persuasion.

172
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,380
By age six, he had made his first million, almost by accident.

173
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:50,580
In college, he met and married his first and still his primary wife, Connie, who is

174
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:56,000
now revered by female subgenie E as the Blessed Anti-Virgin.

175
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:03,120
With Connie's encouragement, the young Dobbs became a salesman of legendary, almost frightening

176
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,400
abilities, known to his peers as the man who could sell anything.

177
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,260
He worked his way up to the very top of the conspiracy ladder and might have stayed there

178
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:13,380


179
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:20,340
But, late one night in 1953, while working on an amateur television of his own design,

180
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,380
an event occurred which was to become a milestone on man's mind path to slack.

181
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:34,420
He was suddenly seized up in the spirit by the hand of Jehovah One itself, the cosmic

182
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:41,320
puppeteer of the Old Testament, the wrathful alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy.

183
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:49,080
In this timeless moment, which we call the divine immaculation of the Bob, Dobbs received

184
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,480
the first of countless brain-curdling pronouncements which form the sacred pre-scriptures of the

185
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:55,800
church.

186
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:03,760
He was shown a vision, a world where all humanity was equally wealthy, rich beyond imagining,

187
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,380
but without working.

188
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:11,300
This experience, combined with his UFO-given sales magic, led him inevitably to the world

189
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,300


190
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,960
of religion.

191
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,460
He quickly discovered the golden rule embodied in his classic saying,

192
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,360
They'll pay to know what they really think.

193
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,960
Many that believed came and confessed and showed their deeds, and of course sometimes

194
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,440
horrible odors and horrible sounds, well that's all I want to say about it.

195
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:30,840
Ugh!

196
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,960
Ugh!

197
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:32,420


198
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,840
This party stinks!

199
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,660
I think I'm going to be sick!

200
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:35,980
Ugh!

201
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:36,960
Ugh!

202
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,240
Ah!

203
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,300
Oh my gosh...

204
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:42,520
Macaroni!

205
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,300
刻 I knew you were arrays, OK!

206
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,200
..It's morning and I gotta pick upore you.

207
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,320
What are you talking about?

208
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,680
It's morning, right?

209
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,180
What's it all about?

210
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:55,180


211
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,580
Tonight, you'll have manyyeonathoube.

212
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,260
Well, after that scene with God, Ochman-kun and Negrum, who later BTS forbidden me to

213
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,420
go lethargy in the house.

214
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,940
You should have paid for.

215
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:59,560
I'm

216
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,580


217
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,160
Have you got any books like that?

218
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,000
Have you bought any books like that?

219
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,920
There are books like that by the hundreds out here in the bookstores,

220
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,880
and they're the kind of trash and garbage that you should never read.

221
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,260
Now.

222
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,760
What?

223
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,720
Trash can, man.

224
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,340
Where are you?

225
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,360
Everywhere.

226
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,440
I will place you high in my council of trash,

227
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,000
and I will set you to burn.

228
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,500
I did that to you.

229
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,080
I did that to you.

230
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,200
They are no more fit for the human mind

231
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,420
than a bag full of viscera of cats, broken nails, and ground glass

232
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,040
are fit for your dinner table.

233
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,920
No, I shouldn't eat thee, but...

234
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,600
Sacrilicious.

235
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,900
Hey, what did you get?

236
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,220
I'm with the United States government.

237
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:57,960
What?

238
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,160
You're under arrest!

239
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,380
I'm under what?

240
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,920
Gentlemen, this...

241
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,820
is Democracy Manifest.

242
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,120
Have a look at the headlock here.

243
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,720
See that chap over there?

244
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:11,880
He...

245
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,600
Get your hand off my penis!

246
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,400
This is the bloke who got me on the penis before.

247
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,140
Why did you do this?

248
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,460
For what reason?

249
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,760
What is the charge?

250
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,600
Eating a meal?

251
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,680
A succulent Chinese meal?

252
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,460
Oh, that's a nice headlock, sir.

253
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,920
Ah, yes.

254
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,540
I see that you know your judo well.

255
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,080
And you, sir?

256
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,900
Are you waiting to receive my limp penis?

257
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,360
Now, dig at your hands, old man.

258
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,560
Tata!

259
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
You're a male, old man.

260
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,440
Ah!

261
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,380
Ah!

262
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:45,380


263
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:45,380


264
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,840
We stand at a crossroads.

265
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,400
The tenuous slack that a subgenius may occasionally enjoy

266
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,280
could be rent to shred at any moment,

267
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,940
for the human puppets of the elder gods continue their senseless plunge into madness and anti-slack.

268
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,500
Ah!

269
00:10:59,500 --> 00:10:59,920
Ah!

270
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,040
Good times.

271
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,240
The conspiracy is a patchwork of...

272
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,420
of different things.

273
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,040
Some are nations, some are products, some are hypnotic television shows,

274
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,980
some are bad pills.

275
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,280
Now, there's a distinction.

276
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,760
There's good pills and there's bad pills.

277
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,780
There's a good Bob and there's a bad Bob, right?

278
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,460
Okay.

279
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,120
And the conspiracy is the bad Bob, the bad pills, the bad TV shows,

280
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,800
and anything that, you know, is keeping you from realizing that you gotta get right with Bob.

281
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,400
It's the human condition.

282
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,760
It's things falling apart.

283
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,480
It's fat lady.

284
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,860
It's ladies in double-knit jumpsuits beating their kids in Kroger's.

285
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,360
Ah!

286
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,580
Ah!

287
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,540
What'd I do?

288
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,360
No, no, no!

289
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,600
Ah!

290
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,300
Look at the humans, all the boring humans!

291
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,900
There's so many humans, wish they'd all go away!

292
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,640
They like the same things!

293
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,860
They laugh at the same things!

294
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,220
They like Bruce Springsteen!

295
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,340
I wish they'd just die!

296
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,140
They worship conformity, to me it's deformity!

297
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,640
They don't even deserve pity for being so blank!

298
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,540
They're proud of their sameness, though they're blind to their vainness!

299
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,860
They're tunnelers and detainers!

300
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,100
Can somebody open their eyes?

301
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,740
They all went to see Star Wars!

302
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,840
They all just are whores, stuck in the same big hatchet!

303
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,620
Makes me gag!

304
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,440
They share assumptions, that lack any gumption!

305
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,920
It helps them to function as a big-seating blob!

306
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,860
Their lives are redundant, their behavior's repugnant!

307
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,340
They think they're so important, though he's trying to get ahead!

308
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,240
They're thwarting like bats, protecting turfs like cats!

309
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,780
Like overcrowded rats in some twisted experiment!

310
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,680
They're so freedom desperate, they're all little despots!

311
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,120
Trying to rule and rule over everything in their way!

312
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,520
They crowd up the parks!

313
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,960
They devour them like sharks!

314
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,560
They feed the chipmunks, hope they catch the plague!

315
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,380
They rule the planet, they entirely span it!

316
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,840
For me who ran it, I cut them down to size!

317
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,440
They make terms of feces, some part of the species!

318
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,940
To find your expensive ways to spread it around!

319
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,620
They terrace under the sky, the things they buy!

320
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,320
Only repeating the lie that it's somebody else's fault!

321
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,080
Their opinions are puny, their ideas are loony!

322
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,720
And I am so gloomy, knowing they haven't a clue!

323
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,620
They perpetually prattle, you would think they were cattle!

324
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,180
Living to chew their cuds in front of the tube!

325
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,260
They're just superficial and artificial!

326
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,480
Basically walking whistle, just taking up space!

327
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,180
They play stupid games that show they're insane!

328
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,060
So hard to refrain from mulling them all down!

329
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,500
Or even more of the things I abhor!

330
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,380
If Artified War beats a whole stinking lot!

331
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,280
They're incessantly out, it's primarily pelt!

332
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,800
Like I shut their traps, maybe they don't have peace!

333
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,280
Oh!

334
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,540
Look at the humans, all the boring humans!

335
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,060
There's so many humans, which they'd all go away!

336
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,940
They like the same things, they like the same things!

337
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,860
They like Bruce Springsteen, or Winston Jones!

338
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:04,960
Die!

339
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,240
The conspiracy has now been unmasked!

340
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,380
Let's back up a bit, I mean we spoke about this a little bit in the last show,

341
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,420
but can you tell us a little bit more about, kind of, how X-Day came about,

342
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,740
how you received this holy knowledge?

343
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,900
Um, to summarise the whole Church of the Subgenius,

344
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,180
in 1953, our saint of sales, Bob Dobbs,

345
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,340
who very few people have seen,

346
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,160
ever, apparently, since that time,

347
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,880
was seized up in the spirit,

348
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,480
and abducted, you might say, by this alien space god,

349
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:51,000
this monster that had been going, posing as god to various cultures down through history.

350
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:58,180
And this creature informed Bob that there had been a conspiracy of normal people,

351
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,620
robbing away the slack of all the weirdos and disbelievers,

352
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,950
and those who would believe anything, for centuries.

353
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,830
That that would end on July 5th, 1998,

354
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,630
when the men from Planet X would arrive and, as we call it,

355
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:17,430
rupture up all of the dues-paying subgenius ministers,

356
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,670
give them their own planet-sized spaceship,

357
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,170
filled with sex goddesses, or gods, or whatever they want,

358
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:31,010
and then allow the subgeniuses to basically live forever doing whatever they want.

359
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,470
Thanks. Thanks.

360
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,130
There were a couple times when I didn't think you were buying it.

361
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,710
You know what Jankum is?

362
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,290
The

363
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:39,290


364
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:47,610
The

365
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:48,590
The

366
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,430
The

367
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,450
The

368
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:55,470
The

369
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:01,890
The

370
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,170
You're going to live it.

371
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:09,990
You're going to live it.

372
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:09,990


373
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,670
Wandered and lost it,

374
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,230
and äth hoveredит

375
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,790
E tutti

376
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,970
E tutti

377
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:14,970


378
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:14,970


379
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:14,970


380
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,590
You heard her, we won't get to bet on her.

381
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,570
Ready?

382
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,650
Ready?

383
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:19,770
Ready?

384
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,510
Ready!

385
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:21,510


386
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,630
Now we gotta come in here and try that,

387
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:23,630


388
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,850
but we just don't want to turn into a reach.

389
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,210
Our way of seeing them out there can be fifty year old for a salon in Tampa.

390
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:26,450
See ya!

391
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,950
They like conspiracy

392
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,390
They like conspiracy

393
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,550
They like conspiracy

394
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,130
Taxes, taxes, taxes, taxes, loopholes

395
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,450
But none of them for you

396
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,550
Lawyers, lawyers, congress, mafia

397
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,190
They keep all the loot

398
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,710
You think back about the Kennedys

399
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,010
About King, about Wallace, about Lenin

400
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,790
You know then that it's just us against them

401
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,530
And you don't always side as winning

402
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,510
You know what it is

403
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,950
They like conspiracy

404
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,130
They like conspiracy

405
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,690
They like conspiracy

406
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,670
They like conspiracy

407
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,870
They like conspiracy

408
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,950
They like conspiracy

409
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,290
They like conspiracy

410
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,270
They like conspiracy

411
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:52,630
Many of our beloved friends are what you call conspiracy theorists

412
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,490
or conspiracy nuts

413
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,370
or a bunch of fruitcakes

414
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,290
But

415
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:57,530
But

416
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:57,530


417
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,850
Many of the conspiracies they talk about are quite real

418
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,910
And have affected our lives

419
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,610
The assassination of John Kennedy

420
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,750
The crashed UFOs

421
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:10,990
Pathetic

422
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,090
Those are the kind of aliens that crash their damn saucers

423
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,650
That's not the ones we're talking about

424
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,790
But nothing is as huge and monstrous

425
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:23,230
As the conspiracy of the normal people, friends

426
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,390
You know what I mean

427
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:55,990
We don't talk about the passa more

428
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,510
We don't talk about the

429
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:56,530
reality

430
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,270
To us

431
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,270


432
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:02,370
Because a vision softly creeping

433
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:07,570
Left its siege while I was sleeping

434
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:15,630
And the vision that was planted in my brain

435
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:26,430
Still remains within the sounds of silence

436
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,190
In restless dreams I walk alone

437
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,030
Narrow streets of cobbles

438
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:03,790
Near the halo of an east street light

439
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,790
I turn my collar to the cold down

440
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:14,410
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash

441
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,870
Of a neon light

442
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,610
That split the night

443
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,990
And touched the sounds

444
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,010
Of the night

445
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,690
Of silence

446
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,370
In the naked light I saw

447
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,010
Ten thousand people

448
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,010


449
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,010


450
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,590
Maybe more

451
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,410
People talking without speaking

452
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,870
People hearing without listening

453
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,850
Writing songs

454
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,630
That voices

455
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,970
Never share

456
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,610
And no one dare

457
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,050
Disturb the sounds

458
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,010
Of silence

459
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,710
Of silence

460
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,690
Oh, my God.

461
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:08,790
Oh, my God.

462
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,950
Take my arms and I might reach you.

463
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:39,790
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell.

464
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:50,510
And echoed in the wells of silence.

465
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,270
Of silence.

466
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,710
Silence.

467
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,750
Of silence.

468
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:07,650


469
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,330
And the people bowed and prayed.

470
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,530
To the neon god they made.

471
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,310
And the sign flashed out its warning.

472
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:33,070
In the words it was for me.

473
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:38,410
And the sign said the words of the prophets.

474
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,770
Are written on subway walls.

475
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,410
And tenement halls.

476
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,770
And whispered in the sun.

477
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,050
And whispered in the sun.

478
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:55,730


479
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,690
And whispered in the sun.

480
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,310
Last night.

481
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,930
Of silence.

482
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:06,630
Silence.

483
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,230
Silence.

484
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,610
Silence.

485
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:18,710
Silence.

486
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,810
Silence.

487
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:23,130


488
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,330
Look around you.

489
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,710
Look at what they've done to the things that you love.

490
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,910
They took Elvis Presley.

491
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,130
They turned him pink.

492
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,050
They made him into a fat monster.

493
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,730
That was showing, my good.

494
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,210
The nation gas.

495
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,130
That?

496
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,110
That.

497
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,310
Oh, that.

498
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,590
Who knows?

499
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:04,630
USA! USA! USA! USA!

500
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:05,970
That.

501
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:11,250
People worry that the church of the subgenius is an anti-American church.

502
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,710
A subversive church.

503
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,470
Children, we are the first real Americans.

504
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:28,090
We know what America is before they took it away from us and tried to sell it back to us.

505
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,670
We're a pro.

506
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,890
We're a prophet.

507
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,590
And as long as you can't buy slack, the conspiracy cannot win.

508
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,970
One dollar.

509
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:38,810
One dollar.

510
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,550
P.O.P.

511
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:42,970
Big fan.

512
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,150
Big fan, Bob.

513
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,810
P.O.P.

514
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,490
P.O.P.

515
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,970
P.O.P.

516
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,930
P.O.P.

517
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,750
P.O.P.

518
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,550
P.O.P.

519
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:58,690
P.O.P.

520
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:58,690


521
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:58,690


522
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:58,690


523
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:58,690


524
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:58,690


525
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:58,690


526
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,670
P.O.P.

527
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,010
P.O.P.

528
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,310
P.O.P.

529
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:11,930
P.O.P.

530
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:12,290
P.O.P.

531
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,270
P.O.P.

532
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,110
P.O.P.

533
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,290
P.O.P.

534
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,490
P.O.P.

535
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:21,550
P.O.P.

536
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,050


537
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,050


538
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,050


539
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,050


540
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,050


541
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,050


542
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:22,650
P.O.P.

543
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:22,810
P.O.P.

544
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:26,790
It's basically two passions out there right now, it's US and them

545
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,690
And unfortunately them is much that determines our future.

546
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,950
much, much greater than us.

547
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,050
The fortunate thing about it is that

548
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,150
we know that

549
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,670
them are actually working for us,

550
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,450
but them doesn't know

551
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,650
that they're working for us.

552
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,710
What do you think will be the next obstacle

553
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,250
the Earth people will put in our way?

554
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,510
Well, as long as they

555
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,250
can think, we'll have our problems.

556
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,070
America

557
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,490
has a strange idea of just

558
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,450
what slack is. They think

559
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,470
you can buy it. Actually,

560
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,330
slack for three-fourths of the

561
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,230
world is a good

562
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,450
dinner. But here

563
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,670
are plenty, ain't you?

564
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,430
Yeah.

565
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,590
3,000 kids starving in

566
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,970
Mexico City every day. Big joke!

567
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,370
Conspiracy! Big joke!

568
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,190
Slack has to be built to

569
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,950
the common law.

570
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:21,550
It's frightening,

571
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,990
isn't it? It's

572
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,170
unbelievably

573
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,330
big.

574
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,050
It's scary. It's

575
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,510
not wrenching to the

576
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,070
frequency.

577
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,730
You are a bit flesh and understand

578
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,910
not the way of the lead-clad

579
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,370
ones.

580
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,710
It's

581
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,050
Christ without a penis.

582
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,090
He's part of the conspiracy.

583
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,150
It's presidents that

584
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,970
don't look like they're capable of getting erections

585
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,570
anymore. That's the conspiracy.

586
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,130
The conspiracy is a real

587
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,230
living,

588
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,130
breathing, fiendish,

589
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,810
entity. It wants you,

590
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,550
children. Oh, it wants you,

591
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:00,730
man.

592
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,070
The Lord of Jehovah and

593
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,990
his son, Jesus, are

594
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,950
strange.

595
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,770
God, please see

596
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,330
the evil.

597
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,110
I wish God gave me a Holy Ghost machine

598
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,310
and I'd blow your head off.

599
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,490
The Lord of Jehovah.

600
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,130
Have a big time. The refrigerator

601
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,870
full of beer. The cigarette

602
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,850
stains on the fingers. The dirty

603
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,430
jokes that came from evil hearts.

604
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,710
God forgotten.

605
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,530
I want to tell you, brother, this generation of youth

606
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,550
has been raised in an environment

607
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,530
like that. I hate to be

608
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,030
as negative as I am tonight,

609
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,310
but they've been raised in an environment

610
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,890
of sexual lust.

611
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,970
They've been raised in an environment

612
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,210
I forget God.

613
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,410
Monkey rectums.

614
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,450
Hot oil massages.

615
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,090
X-ray magazines.

616
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:50,650
Get mine.

617
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,450
Live it up. Forget

618
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,790
God. Sin.

619
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,310
Get mine. Live it up.

620
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,250
Forget God.

621
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,550
Make all the sexual conquests

622
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,310
you can make. They've been raised in an

623
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,150
environment of

624
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:03,850
sorrow.

625
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,510
They've been raised in an environment of

626
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:10,510
gently awakening us

627
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,830
to remember who

628
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,350
and what we are.

629
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:18,370
But there are other ways we can be

630
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,330
communicated with besides the obvious

631
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:20,730
evidence.

632
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,630
Don't have to wait to see

633
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,430
my dad.

634
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,630
Don't be afraid.

635
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,010
Don't be afraid.

636
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,410
Don't be afraid.

637
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,170
Don't be afraid.

638
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:35,990
Don't be afraid.

639
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,070


640
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:36,590


641
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,710
Don't be afraid.

642
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:38,790
Don't be afraid.

643
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,110
Don't be afraid.

644
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:39,630


645
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:39,910
Don't be afraid.

646
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:39,910


647
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,310
Don't be afraid.

648
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,170
Don't be afraid.

649
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:41,230
Don't be afraid.

650
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:41,750
Don't be afraid.

651
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,430
is as huge and

652
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,670
monstrous as the conspiracy

653
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,550
of the normal people, friends.

654
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,530
Sheep in wool's

655
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,490
clothing. All trying

656
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,630
to act tough and be cool.

657
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:54,890
But, uh,

658
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,450
man, it's...

659
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:04,470
It's neither tough nor cool, because they're still kissing the mighty conspiracy ass.

660
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,190
And, you know, most of us do have to go back to work on Monday.

661
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:22,930
But the important thing that you can learn from the word of Bob is how to kiss ass without ever letting the lips actually touch that butt cheek of the man, if you know what I mean.

662
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:35,110
The worst crime that ever was is the easiest to commit.

663
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,790
The word crime is serving the conspiracy.

664
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:41,570
Gotcha.

665
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:50,350
I'm sorry. It's all a big mistake. You got to believe me. I don't know what happened. I'm so sorry.

666
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,390
Wouldn't you like revenge?

667
00:30:52,930 --> 00:31:02,690
Revenge on these mediocritons, these pink boys, these box-dwelling Barbies and Kens, these normals who have made normality the norm.

668
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:15,630
Pinks are but living stereotypes, insensate meat puppets and food tubes who lack and fear the spark of originality that ignites every subgenius soul.

669
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,290
I was a little scared of Bob.

670
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,650
What good do brains do today, children?

671
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:22,750
What good?

672
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,150
What good?

673
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,970
My God, children. How are you going to earn a living if you have to think about what you're actually doing?

674
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:34,610
How are you going to contend with society the way it is if you actually have to think about the issues it confronts you with?

675
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:42,450
How can you stand the pressure that conspiracy grinds you down with if you're actually going to think about that pressure?

676
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,890
Children, brains are a great detriment to life.

677
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:50,350
Come on. You don't really believe in people like that, Bob, do you?

678
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,630
I've got you figured.

679
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,910
I'm coming over your house and visit you.

680
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,870
My life's in danger. I've got you figured. Remember it.

681
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:04,190
I know exactly where you're at.

682
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,590
I want to live in your brain.

683
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:20,370
I want to live in your brain.

684
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,930
I want to live in your brain.

685
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:47,250
I want to live in your brain.

686
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:59,030
I want to make your earth shatter.

687
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,530
The door opens, and there's this sharp-looking guy in a suit.

688
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,150
Hey, here's Bob, the host of the most, you might say.

689
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,410
Okay, there's the man who made it all possible, Dr. Robert Slack.

690
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,190
Oh, don't call me Bob.

691
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,610
Hi, Dr. Bob.

692
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,610
Hi there, my dear.

693
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:27,910
This is, uh, 30 grand. Can we just have our medicine, please, Dr. Bob?

694
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:28,650
30 grand?

695
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,870
Uh, grand.

696
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,550
Yeah.

697
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,970
Hi there, my dear.

698
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,050
So Bob did the buddy thing, and he slaps it in your hand.

699
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:37,850
Hey, Bob!

700
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,470
Oh, damn.

701
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,830
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

702
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:43,950
Get him?

703
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:44,450
Get him?

704
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,530
He's a bastard!

705
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,870
Butter.

706
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,670
Bring me lots and lots of butter.

707
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,170
Oh, my.

708
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,090
Oh, man.

709
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:54,890
That's ugly.

710
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,650
I dance to my heart as a baby.

711
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,330
Ha!

712
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:58,790
Oh!

713
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,210
The third nostril.

714
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,710
That whistling sound makes me sick.

715
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:06,450
Butter, eh?

716
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,010
Oh, that job must be a lot thicker than I thought.

717
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:13,170
The true subgenius can learn to think for himself.

718
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:14,050
But...

719
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,290
Only Bob can show him how.

720
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:26,750
And so, Bob Dobbs founded his church upon a sandy beach of common sense, sense of humor, and dollars and cents.

721
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,990
A likely story, you say.

722
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,390
But it's simple, really.

723
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,910
Bob is lucky, not smart.

724
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:38,670
In fact, by the perverted conspiracy standards of intelligence, he is gifted with incredible stupidity.

725
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,570
He lives in a perpetual state of contracted consciousness.

726
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:52,770
This enables him to act without thinking, to surf effortlessly on the luck plane, to float down the fabled path of least resistance.

727
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,850
In fact, to make a million dollars every time he screws up.

728
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:04,810
Thus, it is not his wisdom, but his divine follies, his holy blunders which we emulate.

729
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:11,310
The miracle is not in what Bob does to you, but in what he allows you to do to yourself.

730
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,550
He brings...

731
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:17,110
He brings the student to the realization that everything you know is true.

732
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:23,550
Under the conspiracy, you're being ripped off every day, but you can learn to enjoy it.

733
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,950
Woo-hoo!

734
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,370
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

735
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,010
Big man.

736
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,870
One, one dollar.

737
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,210
One, one, one, one, one, one, one.

738
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,210
When you come, you see Bob.

739
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,710
If you come tonight, you will see Bob.

740
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:52,950
And now, you may come from seeing Sister Suzy the Fluzy.

741
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,650
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya.

742
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:03,690
I was watching my lizard rubbing his butt on my frog tray the other day, and I just naturally started thinking about staying.

743
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:09,770
And now, I just love to hogtie that little mutant Texan.

744
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,010
like some sort of bondage pinata.

745
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:19,830
And naturally that led me to contemplating the nature of ligature marks.

746
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:26,090
And I know that the lig in ligature means tie.

747
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,990
It comes from the Latin ligo to tie.

748
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:34,390
And then it came to me like the atomic bitch slap at the end of the stark fist.

749
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,650
Religion means to be tied.

750
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,870
Tied again.

751
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,010
Now how much more blatant could they make it?

752
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,430
You have a place in their world.

753
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,390
That's God's bottom.

754
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,310
Well who wants that for a choice?

755
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:59,290
Your boobies are like radio tubes that keep signaling me to surrender.

756
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,870
So as I sit on my lap, I know it's a trap.

757
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,690
So I think I'll go out on a bender.

758
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,050
A catatonic stupid.

759
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,370
Where do you think you're been?

760
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,150
A catatonic stupid.

761
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,110
You know you'll never...

762
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:21,370
...again.

763
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:37,370
Oh now, I don't want to be calling subgenius a religion now.

764
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,210
Although I have.

765
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:38,630
Subgenius is a religion.

766
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,130
The god that has the power.

767
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,130


768
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,130


769
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:48,830
Oh but realizing this fat toy with an accent on the toy, I really would rather start referring

770
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,950
to it as a faith instead.

771
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:57,710
Because if we're f**king sure what we've got here, a big ass faith with a big f**king

772
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,430
pipe in the f**king mouth.

773
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,990
And that pipe is our affirmation.

774
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,070
Say it with me, singers.

775
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,610
Bob Seger.

776
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:08,610


777
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:08,610


778
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:25,050
sold it, I smoked it, that settles it. Because you know what they say. They say God is in

779
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:32,550
the details. Well, I'm here to tell you that Bob is in the retail. And as a subgenius,

780
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:44,670
you can get it, wholesale seekers. Because one thing is for sure, you need slack. And

781
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:50,650
the good thing is that membership in the Church of the Subgenius is still under a bazillion

782
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:58,750
damn dollars. Yes, you can still buy your way out of pink perdition. You can actually

783
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,530
bribe your way to salvation. And you can still buy your way out of pink perdition.

784
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:11,930
You don't have to knock over a bank to do it. No, you don't have to rob a 7-Eleven. You

785
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:19,290
don't have to shoot an old lady in the legs. Unless you want to.

786
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:32,210
That's the beauty of this damn church. It's like what Stang said about eating a damn hamburger.

787
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:38,330
You want to eat the hell out of it. Well, that's right, but it's not just about the

788
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:46,710
burgers. Because if you look beneath the surface and take this aphorism to its logical subgenial

789
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:55,830
conclusion seekers, if we live as subgeniuses, should we not be living the hell out of it?

790
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:56,590
Yes!

791
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:02,510
Shouldn't every action be an action that is going to gain us?

792
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:12,730
Why the f*** do we work at our own cross purposes and tear ourselves apart just for the fun

793
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:20,250
of the con? Because seekers, I gotta admit, I let the conspiracy keep me down. Oh, it

794
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:27,150
was in so many comforting forms. And even in the depths of my misery, I thought I was

795
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:32,150
happy. But it was all false slack.

796
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:42,070
It's so deceptively comforting. And for years, I've kind of stopped being Reverend Susie the floozy almost.

797
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:53,370
I found myself turning back into plain old Susan f***s. And let me tell you, seekers, she sucks.

798
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:02,510
Oh yeah, you might think it's easy being a visual speed bump, but try walking a walk.

799
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,710
She's a mile as high as you.

800
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:10,830
Because I was sucking my tip so hard I was starting to get the lines around my lips.

801
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:16,710
Oh, but when I finally got shaken out of that hell loop and found the pieces of my shattered

802
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:24,410
self, this time I didn't cry over the burning spilt milk of my existence. This time I set

803
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:30,470
about putting myself back together. I became my own Frankenstein.

804
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,510
I became my own Frankenstein. I became my own Frankenstein. I became my own Frankenstein.

805
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:37,870
I took those pieces and I pounded them back into place.

806
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:45,270
Well, I see your red eyes surrounded by flies telling of all of your lies.

807
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:52,290
But as you slide down the street with your straitjacket feet, well, your victory is such a surprise.

808
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,770
A catatonic stupid.

809
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,330
Where do you think you're banned?

810
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,490
A catatonic stupid.

811
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:02,490


812
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:02,490


813
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:06,450
You know you'll never move again.

814
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:16,690
Seekers, if I can do it, so can you.

815
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:28,910
Because let me tell you, every Yetican out there, every seed of Dobbs is worth saving.

816
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,490
Even if it's only to piss them off.

817
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:32,490


818
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,850
You need to stick around.

819
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:41,450
And I want you to do something for me, each and every one of you.

820
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:48,410
I want you to believe in the natural superiority of your subgenius soul.

821
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:59,550
I want you to screw your overman's courage to the sticking place and look the conspiracy in its jauntous bloodshot eyes and say,

822
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,630
FIGHT MY F***!

823
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:09,290
How dare you manipulate me with your fifth-rate mind control!

824
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:23,330
Because, seekers, their methods are so tired and transparent that it is beneath you as a child of Dobbs to be even marginally affected by their works.

825
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,270
By their bulls***.

826
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:32,470
Because by the ancient science of break-thinking, the mighty mental armor of Bob can shield you from the power of the devil.

827
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:36,650
And I want you to use it.

828
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:42,490
Yes, blind yourself to the works of the Kong with the all-unseen stupidity of Dobbs.

829
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:48,670
Deafen your ears with the insipidude of the full-blood Yeti.

830
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:54,570
Cripple your legs with that Dobbs-town polio f*** that's going around.

831
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:02,470
Using the church's proven survival techniques to incapacitate your soul.

832
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:02,470


833
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:13,150
You can actually seem so unfit for exploitation by the Kong that they will not even see you on their radar.

834
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,350
You can get away scot-free.

835
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:22,350
And you can have a safe and slack-filled passage through this abysmal pink life.

836
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:26,410
And that's all I'm saying. I can't say no more. So,

837
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,810
BREAK BOB!

838
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:28,790
YAY!

839
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,810
Somebody, help me!

840
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,810
I mean, I, you know, I, you know, I know!

841
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:39,870
I met my, my, my, my, me...

842
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,130
She is absolutely...

843
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,010
And utterly amazing.

844
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,030
Oh, man, Fluz.

845
00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:00,190
I had forgotten about your big finish to that rant

846
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,570
Baltimore 2007

847
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,270
I'm just saying

848
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,530
When you got done with it

849
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,390
You picked up your metal music stand

850
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,990
And turned to go down the stairs

851
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,550
And you didn't even hit the stairs

852
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:21,010
Before you just went face first

853
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:25,830
I landed right on the music stand

854
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:37,330
And it was the one time your boobs didn't break your fall

855
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:40,330
That time, right?

856
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:45,830
I messed myself up so bad

857
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:49,050
I'm so sorry

858
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,130
I'm so sorry

859
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:50,990
I'm so sorry

860
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:54,730
You can never move again

861
00:45:54,730 --> 00:46:02,370
I know of a girl

862
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,430
Used to spend most her life

863
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:07,110
Sucking love through a vacuum cleaner

864
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:09,430
But all she ever got

865
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:10,850
Was dirt feedback

866
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:14,470
And she kept getting meaner and leaner

867
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,750
Catatonic stupid

868
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,710
Where do you think

869
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:39,030
A very short time ago in the alley down the street,

870
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,630
two outdoorsmen were dumpster diving for a tasty treat.

871
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:44,110
Hey, Bob choked one dumpster diver together.

872
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:46,170
Do you want some of this super pizza?

873
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,750
While he gobbled on the stinking mire in the dumpster.

874
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,910
No thanks, Dick, retorted his partner.

875
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,890
I'm saving my appetite for a hot meal.

876
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:56,450
Dick grunted happily as he shoveled putrid trash down his hole

877
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:59,090
till suddenly he was grasped by an explosive nausea.

878
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:02,030
Bob, sensing Dick's agony, grabbed his mangy scalp

879
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,470
and thrust his brother's head over an empty bucket.

880
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,690
Dick grasped and foaming Bob poured from his scabby lips.

881
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:11,830
Heaving desperately, he purged himself rivers of burning puke into Bob's bucket.

882
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,270
Bob guzzled his bucket of puke, stopping only to shout gleefully,

883
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:17,490
I told you I was waiting for a hot meal.

884
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:20,190
As he kicked his brother Dick's flea-specked scrotum,

885
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:24,710
yes, my brethren, we should all look at this time and try to be like Bob.

886
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:27,150
We should keep ourselves armed with Bob's bucket.

887
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:31,730
Do not be afraid to snap out the roadkill spatula on your slack army knife

888
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,790
and fight off the pink fungus of normality.

889
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:36,830
Live with true-born slack lust for Dick's spew.

890
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:37,890
Be like Bob.

891
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:38,790
Pee like Bob.

892
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:42,870
Spin about aimlessly, gushing a torrent of urine to march your special rupture site.

893
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:44,930
In preparation for X-Day,

894
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:47,410
the end is coming and your Yeti soul must fulfill.

895
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,370
It's fecal flinging to find true harmony with Jehovah One.

896
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:53,390
The next time you are burping on a prairie squid,

897
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,890
remember who made it possible.

898
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:55,450
Bob.

899
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:59,490
We should not forget that Bob is the stick that scrapes off the conspiracy crap

900
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:03,370
you stepped in before you can stomp down the galleys of that pleasure saucer.

901
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:06,930
Don't satisfy yourself by dropping pubic hairs in your boss's coffee.

902
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:08,490
Take a dump on his desk.

903
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:10,510
After wiping your taxed bunghole,

904
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:13,550
smear the name Bob in brown and green streaks across the ceiling.

905
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:17,470
Only after this sacred ritual will you pilot your own pleasure saucer.

906

Through Bob's cavernous orifice.

908
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,130
Praise Bob!

909
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:21,390
Amen.

What it is

934
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:22,930
You know what it is

935
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:09,970
Will you be the last Bob, or will you surrender to hopelessness?

936
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:14,470
Remember, this might just be his way of testing you.

937
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:19,790
Actually, these choices were already made for you at the beginning of time.

938
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:21,710
So, do it.

939
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:28,330
Join the church and gaze upon your own naked destiny, standing proud before Bob.

940
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:29,530
Where's Bob?

941
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:30,710
Where am I, Bob?

942
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,210
I'm fed up with the law around here.

943
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:33,090
You can't do this, Bob.

944
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,470
Come on, get going, boy.

945
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,090
We're busting up the joint.

946
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,670
We're tearing out all the wires.

947
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,050
We're busting it up so good.

Act like I don't even have a rifle.

966
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:38,810
We'll kill the whores with you.

967
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:42,290
Put your guns in your pockets.

968
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:43,110
Long live the buñoles.

969
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:43,930
Throw them high.

I can't see.

00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:55,870
Grease your chair.

00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:56,690
Take your crutch.

979
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,630
Change your shoes for the machine gun.

00:53:58,910 --> 00:53:59,710
Break your chains.

981
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:00,590
There are no bars.

982
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,810
It's all about fear and paraplegics.

00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:03,450
Body's up.

984
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:04,570

The links, the beautifully conditioned links are smashed.

1012
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,930
They're smashed as of now because we say so.

1013
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,310
Because we say they ought to be smashed.

1014
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:05,210
You don't work anymore.

1015
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:06,630
That's an order.

1016
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:09,910
Anybody invites you to a game of solitaire,

1017
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:13,650
you tell them, sorry, buster, the ball game is over.

1018

Every time I sit down on my kingdom's throne

1019
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:41,610
and reach out for the good book that will fade my soul.

1020
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:45,850
Face me from the gorgeous of conspiracy.

1021
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:49,530
Face me from the chain of time.

1022
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:53,050
Face me from the men in black.

Find a place to hide

From the many lives

1061

And the depths of genius

1062
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:54,490
Oh, Seekers, was it good for you?

1063
00:57:55,370 --> 00:58:00,670
Oh, this has been the 1,000th episode of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse,

1064
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:06,170
and it couldn't have happened without the joyous contributions of little Theodore and Babushka,

1065
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:08,670
J.E. Sumrall of Columbus, Georgia,

1066

with the song Blame the Conspiracy,

1067
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:12,750
which was not a subgenius song,

1068
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:13,490
ESO,

some suburban loans,

1075
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:29,610
the walk-ins with Praise Bob,

1076
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:34,310
along with deathless sermons delivered by subgenius immortals like

1077
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,130
Reverend Ivan Stang,

1078
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,410

00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:43,550
and Pope Sternodox of Little Rocks,

1082
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:47,130
teaching us exactly what we're fighting against, Seekers.

1083
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:51,910
Oh, but Seekers, I couldn't have done it without you.

1084
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:53,550
We should thank our lucky stars.

1085
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,430
They're still playing.

1086
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:56,790
We've been on a program of this caliber after so many years.

1087
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:57,750
I'm never going to let you down.

1088
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:59,130
What else is on it?

1089
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:01,590
Worst episode ever.

1090
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:02,470
Isn't it?

1091
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:03,190
Isn't it?
