1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,640
This is Timothy Larry reminding you that just as you need slack, Bob needs your help.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,020
Send in those pledges and praise Bob.

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:19,960
Sound impossible?

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,560
Yes, you rub it between the forefinger and the thumb.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,120
Say what?

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,060
You take a pinch of salt, you rub it between the forefinger and the thumb,

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,800
walk with a shim around a turning decapitated child's head,

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,780
and then jump into the grave and say,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,060
hop on my thumb, hop on my thumb, this is a problem I must overcome.

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,060
Throw in a dead cat, or a live cat that's not feeling well.

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,300
Then cover with the sod, and when the birds chirp on the third Saturday after mickle mass,

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,060
take a large dill pickle and insert it in the tumulus.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,940
Insert it in the tumulus, the heap, the shambling mound over the grave.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,400
And this time you will experience a divine regurgitation,

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,640
somewhat like under the immaculation of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,240
the slain and martyred hip-hop in the Church of the Seventh-Decade.

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,740
I believe it's something God puts in us.

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,560
It's something somebody put in us.

20
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,720
Fusion, may I help? Hydrogen fusion?

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,700
Hydrogen fusion?

22
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,780
Hmm, well, if I don't have my fusion,

23
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,100
I'm going to church at a service.

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,960
Yes, hydrogen fusion.

25
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,160
Hybrid fusion.

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,880
This material contains information affecting the national defense of the United States

27
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,380
within the meaning of the espionage laws, Title 18, U.S.C., Sections 7098 and 74,

28
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,100
a transmission or revelation of which in any manner to an unauthorized person

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,900
is inevitably prohibited by law.

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,160
Ah!

31
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,500
Ah!

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,640
Ah!

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,720
Ah!

34
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:54,560
Ah!

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,060
Ah!

36
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,300
Ah!

37
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,920
Ah!

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


40
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


42
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


46
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


47
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


48
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


49
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


50
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


51
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,040


52
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,860
Ah!

53
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,660
Ah!

54
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:05,660


55
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:05,660


56
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:05,660


57
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:05,660


58
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,900
The beginning is a very delicate time.

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,200
Shut up!

60
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,440
Shut up!

61
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,020
Look out, guys!

62
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:18,960
Ah!

63
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,980
Ah!

64
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,180
Ah!

65
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:22,620
Ah!

66
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,140
Ah!

67
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,440
Ah!

68
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:23,940
Ah!

69
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,000
Ah!

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,160
Ah!

71
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,740
Ah!

72
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:24,800
Ah!

73
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:24,800


74
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:24,800


75
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,040
Ah!

76
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,840
Well, we're tuning in on you right now.

77
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,380
And there, we're centered on...

78
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,720
Oh, okay, we're on lockup.

79
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,420
Oh, okay.

80
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:40,880
Okay.

81
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,760
You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.

82
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,660
That is why you are here.

83
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,500
We are controlling transmission.

84
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,620
Control, control, control.

85
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,900
No trouble.

86
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,340
Just get set and get going.

87
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:05,940
Hey, man.

88
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,380
Recording.

89
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,580
Everything's going fine.

90
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,380
No trouble.

91
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,960
Wait a minute.

92
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,280
Wait.

93
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,040
That's this switch here.

94
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,760
Okay, I think we're ready to go.

95
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,420
Let's go.

96
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,260
Welcome, dear friends,

97
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,040
to the...

98
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,980
The subgenius hour of...

99
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,780
What?

100
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,300
What?

101
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:40,120
Every time you say, see, hear, or think...

102
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,680
Bob?

103
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,540
That's your key phrase.

104
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,500
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

105
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,480
We are controlling transmission.

106
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,580
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

107
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,880
Ah, it's been nice out here in the little...

108
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,780
The Learning Studio.

109
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,600
Oh, yes, dear friends.

110
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,580
As you may have guessed, this is another rerun show.

111
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,580
Technically, this is hour of slack number 1071.

112
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,600
But in truth, it's a rerun of an old taped show, number 66,

113
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,820
which would make it from probably around November or December of 1986.

114
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,700
20 years ago, this particular show was marked by me.

115
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,960
Headphones, sound effects, and then it says,

116
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,980
end is amazing, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.

117
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,860
I'll have to go through and clean up some of the Dallas station

118
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,100
and Dallas address references on these old shows.

119
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,860
But, friends, we're doing reruns,

120
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,420
partly because we're working really hard on a subgenius history project

121
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,160
that takes the form of an online course,

122
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,360
which you can learn more about at maybelogic.com

123
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,040
or maybelogic.org.

124
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,600
Maybelogic is one word that sounds like those two words.

125
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,920
Praise Bob.

126
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,840
Anyway, let us go back in time now to the olden hour of slack number 66.

127
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,300
Perfect concentration.

128
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,820
No distractions.

129
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,440
No anxiety.

130
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,100
No fear.

131
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,580
No fear.

132
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,540
Brazil

133
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:52,980
Brazil

134
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,320
Brazil

135
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,840
Brazil

136
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:55,840


137
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:03,500
We stood beneath an amber moon

138
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,480
And softly murmured

139
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,440
Someday soon

140
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,720
We kiss

141
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,620
We do the work, you do the pleasure

142
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,980
Hi there.

143
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,720
I want to talk to you about ducts.

144
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,040
Do your ducts seem old-fashioned?

145
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,440
Out of date?

146
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,980
Central Services' new duct designs

147
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,720
are now available in hundreds of different colours

148
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,260
to suit your individual taste.

149
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Hurry now, while stocks last,

150
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,320
your nearest Central Services showroom.

151
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,620
Designer colours to suit your demanding taste.

152
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,520
The rumour became reality.

153
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,820
Another satanic cult.

154
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,620
Yes, just another evil cult

155
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,940
that was supposed to be a good one.

156
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,140
This is how the war gets on the radio.

157
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,220
I think a lot of subgeniuses

158
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,960
originally believed they were doing something good

159
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,980
by joining the church.

160
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,140
That wheel and chain set up

161
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,580
makes the sound of moving artillery.

162
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,340
Sounds like a real battle.

163
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,580
Well, it's nothing compared to what it takes

164
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,360
to move this show.

165
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,440
Don't be alarmed.

166
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,320
It's a lot more work than saving souls, believe me.

167
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,660
That punch didn't connect.

168
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,200
The sound was fake.

169
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,000
Although, Stang suffered a real blow

170
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,960
from an infuriated Gabofran.

171
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,180
That was a great blow.

172
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,540
Yes, the mallet on a grapefruit

173
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,780
gave the sound of that blow.

174
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:55,940
Oh.

175
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,340
Curiously refreshing.

176
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,580
It was a lot of fun, too.

177
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,840
But here they come.

178
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,080
The guard is forming to march the guilty offender away.

179
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,680
Yes, those who believed

180
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,620
the wrong lies in the book of the subgenius

181
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,240
taken into the stadium

182
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,700
near Dobstown

183
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,180
and all the Malaysians

184
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,200
pour into the little wooden seats.

185
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,480
For the clumsy child with the hard-to-fit shoe size,

186
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,560
Cap Bigfoot, our 31st season.

187
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,320
Boys and girls, 6 to 18,

188
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,380
10D to 15, EEEEEE.

189
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,580
Our patient understanding staff

190
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,780
has had outstanding success

191
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,700
with the clumsy, uncoordinated child.

192
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,800
Our unique, patented method

193
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,540
starts your child from scratch,

194
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,520
from crawling to early walking,

195
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,460
to full walking, trotting, and running,

196
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,600
until he is actually strutting, dancing,

197
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,520
and doing gymnastics.

198
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,760
Many of our graduates are now prominent

199
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,060
in ballet and jazz tag.

200
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,040
Write to George Trefeld, Camp Bigfoot,

201
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,360
Peppermill, Oregon, 65201.

202
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,460
We like you.

203
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,520
And should ignore you.

204
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,160
But instead, we are...

205
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,700
Agh!

206
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:02,900


207
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,040
Agh!

208
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,660
Yeah!

209
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,600
Agh!

210
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:12,640


211
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,620
And!

212
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:17,760


213
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:17,760


214
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,100


215
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,100


216
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,100


217
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,020


218
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,020


219
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,300
Why?

220
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:22,680
Why?

221
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,860
Bob

222
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,980
Here and there

223
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,500
Closet, gallery, knock, empty, where

224
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,400
Bob

225
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, yes, dear sir

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,860
This is the beast

227
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,120
The Chinese subgenius

228
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,280
And you are listening to the hour of slack

229
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,600
Remember, Bob is the comrade of all people

230
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,260
He is a Chinese

231
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,160
Just like in America

232
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,540
And people need slack

233
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,100
In Chinese, we call slack

234
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,340
What's a butterfly?

235
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,720
It must be true slack

236
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,400
Not the bad slack

237
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,280
Boy, will you look at that guy's slack

238
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,220
Help me somebody

239
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,080
Help me somebody

240
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,460
Thank you, Lili Jing

241
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,980
Yes, my friend

242
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,080
We have the great Ivan Stang here tonight

243
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,840
Ivan Stang himself

244
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,600
The grand auditor

245
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,960
And chief inquisitor of the subgenius faith

246
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,820
Who has every subgenius' name

247
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,440
On his special basement computer

248
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,200
And he's here tonight

249
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,820
To make the hour and a half of slack

250
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,060
Seem like, well, like forever

251
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,580
Ivan Stang

252
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,620
That's Stang of Stang's

253
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,260
Slack

254
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,620
Sibling stouter of rang

255
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,900
Of Cerno's claws and Jinger's fangs

256
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,600
When the peaks are upon us

257
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,080
When it is finally on us

258
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,380
The peaks will broil

259
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,220
But not in song

260
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,940
Nature and men will stand aside

261
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,440
The jaws of doom shall open wide

262
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,940
While Ivan Stang shall perch in song

263
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,660
Where fromlessness and fear will be gone

264
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,060
Where fromlessness and fear will be gone

265
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,500
Where fromlessness and fear will be gone

266
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:22,500


267
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:22,500


268
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,740
And in the swells

269
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,580
False prophets from their citadels

270
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,300
He topples down

271
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,360
To nether hells

272
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,140
He judges kings and guinea-pods

273
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,280
And renders into visit laws

274
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,040
Those who prove the name of gods

275
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,800
He rules the masts of King Yorhost

276
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,780
Evens his knights on the coast

277
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,900
A pledge from his name

278
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,400
As from a ghost

279
00:11:51,220 --> 00:12:00,120
Where can we go? Where can we hide? No place in all this world so wide shall escape the dire subjection of life.

280
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:09,200
The dangers howl, the sternows plead, Oh, harmless rises from the sea, no hiding place for you and me.

281
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:20,360
What future does our doom procure us? Heavenly earth indeed endure us, let the damn wound outend nor us.

282
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:30,080
A man nor us, and a wretch, the gangster of the yale gang, let us now welcome Ivan Stang.

283
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,000
Ah, yes, dear friend, so good to be here.

284
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:01,900
Say it, Ivan, say it.

285
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,420
Feeling the power here in this hideous, hideous place.

286
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,020
Bob lives, friend.

287
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,180
Bob lives.

288
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,160
Bob lives.

289
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,560
Don't let him tell you otherwise.

290
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,360
He ain't dead.

291
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,560
Oh, what is this, anyway?

292
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,160
I should know.

293
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:22,640
I'm the, I'm the guy that has to read sooner or later all the mail that comes to that P.O. box that you probably thought was just made up.

294
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:37,640
The opinions expressed by Ivan Stang do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the staff and management of this radio station, the other staff, the relations and spouses of the staff and management, or the staff of this staff and staff.

295
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,180
That's really good.

296
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,140
That's really true, Hal, but he doesn't know that it's all over the place these days.

297
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:51,440
A Bob body dragged out of the Victoria Theatre with these eyes, these dead lights looked on Bob and the light was trilling from them forever.

298
00:13:53,140 --> 00:14:01,000
There's, there's saint of sale corpses dotting the landscape all the way from Little Rock to Berkeley here.

299
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,640
I don't know what the big deal is.

300
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,840
I mean, that's just because, just because there's a, a Dobbs corpse there doesn't necessarily

301
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,640
get me.

302
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,180
I mean, can you really tell me what the big thing is here?

303
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:09,180


304
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,280
Can Bob really die?

305
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,340
Oh, my God.

306
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,720
Oh, my God.

307
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,220
When it blows its snacks,

308
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,040
when it blows its snacks,

309
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,480
when it blows its snacks,

310
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,000
when it blows its

311
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,680
snacks,

312
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,940
when it blows its

313
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,740
stacks, there ain't nowhere

314
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,940
to be found.

315
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,720
When the wolf's close

316
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,180
While we're down

317
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,440
We'll watch out

318
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,260
Till the town is around

319
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,520
Hide all the women in town

320
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,860
Hide

321
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,580
Hide all the women in town

322
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,460
When it blows

323
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,040
When it blows

324
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:26,380
When it blows

325
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,920
All you girls

326
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,740
Make no mistakes

327
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,760
Here's a golden snake

328
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,940
Snake's in the snow

329
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,820
He takes them out

330
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,520
Out on the nice mud

331
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,780
Town of the nonsense

332
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,520
They all see around

333
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,220
When he's straightened up

334
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,300
They all bend down

335
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,680
He don't bow to bad water

336
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,140
He don't push it all around

337
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,280
When it blows

338
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,680
When it blows

339
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,440
When it blows

340
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Stacks

341
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,360
When it blows

342
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,360


343
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,360


344
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,360


345
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,440
When it blows

346
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,000
Stacks

347
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,360
parliament

348
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,380
Stacks

349
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:26,460
It blows

350
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:26,740
Stacks

351
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:26,740

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:26,740


354
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,220
Blows

355
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,660
That alone

356
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,740
BS

357
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:33,740


358
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:33,740

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:33,740

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:33,740


361
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,240
Nope, nope, nope.

362
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,340
A second.

363
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,540
Okay, you gals out there.

364
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:40,680
We haven't gotten any more entries in the win a date with Cleve Duncan contest.

365
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,680
I mean, I'm not even going to go into...

366
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:51,020
If you don't know who Cleve Duncan is, then you probably don't deserve the date.

367
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,320
But if you do, go ahead and try.

368
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,440
Go ahead and try.

369
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,420
It's important.

370
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,780
Very important.

371
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,200
All right.

372
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,960
How do you across?

373
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,000
Go for lever.

374
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,240
Go for lever.

375
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,140
There you go.

376
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,480
There you go.

377
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:31,120
Đây là các bạn.

378
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,300
If you want to know the truth, then that's a fact.

379
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,360
Somebody scream, give me more slack.

380
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,600
Give me more slack.

381
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,660
Do you like slack?

382
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,640
I like it.

383
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,940
I love slack.

384
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,740
I love it.

385
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,140
Do you want slack?

386
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,160
I want it.

387
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,340
Do you need slack?

388
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,180
I need it.

389
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:56,920
You like me?

390
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,600
Yeah.

391
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,440
Come on.

392
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,460
But I need me.

393
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,280
Go get it.

394
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,460
What about a moon moon?

395
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:01,980
No.

396
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,560
The moon is a dismal.

397
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,440
Get down the program.

398
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,220
No.

399
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,840
Right out the hobo booth.

400
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,940
You like naturalist.

401
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,420
No.

402
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,860
Got the balls in the show.

403
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,340
No.

404
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,660
You and I, baby.

405
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:13,980
No.

406
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,640
That's a real cool book.

407
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,120
No.

408
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,000
Out of the world with a proper book.

409
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,940
Yeah, he'll be hopping to the barbershop with more slack.

410
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,840
I got to have my slack.

411
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,860
Give it to me.

412
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:28,980
Yeah.

413
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,860
Praise Bob.

414
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,060
Hey.

415
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,580
Boy, I mean, slack is better than red beans and rice.

416
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,160
I'm top of a smoky.

417
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,280
All covered with sand.

418
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,380
I shot my poor teacher with a red rubber band.

419
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,520
I shot her with pleasure.

420
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,620
I shot her with please.

421
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,280
Please.

422
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,980
I couldn't have missed her.

423
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,120
She was 40 feet wide.

424
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,280
I went to her funeral.

425
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,800
I went to her grave.

426
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,060
Everybody threw flowers.

427
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,360
I threw a grenade.

428
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,060
The police came and got me.

429
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,520
And put me in jail.

430
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,740
I brought a bazooka.

431
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,640
And shot into a T-L-L.

432
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,180
Oh, thank you, Tevis.

433
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,640
That was a beautiful rendition of a classic, classic childhood song.

434
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,800
And there'll be more from the tiniest subgenius prophet coming up.

435
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,560
But friends, you know, we've been griping about those who didn't pay their pledge.

436
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,020
But we haven't really thanked those who had.

437
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,720
And, well, the Will of Dobbs and I got together.

438
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,320
And we got to looking at this board in here.

439
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:06,560
This poster that they've put up that keeps track of what shows are ahead and what shows are behind on the pledge drive.

440
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:12,460
And, friends, I could scarcely believe it.

441
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:21,420
But the Hour of Slack is number five among all KNON shows as far as paid pledges go.

442
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:27,180
And the other, the four shows out of 80, what, 81 shows, I think.

443
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,180
Yeah, 81 shows.

444
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:38,360
Out of 81 shows, the four shows that made more money during that pledge drive than the Hour of Slack were all on for like 10 hours a day.

445
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,520
They're on every day.

446
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,380
We did better than Pajama Party, better than anybody.

447
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,480
Now, the gospel shows, they got as much pledges as the subgenius show.

448
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,780
But, strangely, only 8% paid.

449
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,020
I wonder what that means.

450
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,460
Well, anyway, 50% of you subgeniuses have paid, I think.

451
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,860
By now, probably 50%.

452
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,860
And those who haven't, if you haven't gotten the calls already, you will.

453
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,300
You'll get that call.

454
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,820
And it's all being recorded, not only on magnetic media here in this century, but on the Akashic Records.

455
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,600
The records of all things that have ever occurred, even inside your brain.

456
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,060
That's all recorded.

457
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:22,180
And we have access to those through our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

458
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,420
And, friends, we're going to continue with the show.

459
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,700
I hope you're, once again, I hope you're in headphones.

460
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,640
This is a real headphone.

461
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,040
This is a real headphone show.

462
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,940
How do we know you're not being a top?

463
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,520
How do we know?

464
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:46,980
Good God.

465
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,420
Just have to tell him we don't see anything.

466
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,260
What is this world coming to?

467
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,440
Don't listen to him.

468
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,180
Don't listen to him.

469
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,160
Yes, you can find help.

470
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,720
You can be deprogrammed.

471
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,640
You can find out the truth.

472
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,280
What?

473
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,740
Beat me every day.

474
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,840
It's a hell of a day.

475
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,260
I know you're a dumbass.

476
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,840
They force you to sleep on boards.

477
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,180
What a device.

478
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,500
No, he's not.

479
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,780
He's a piece of shit.

480
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,420
What a device.

481
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,660
What's going on?

482
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,980
He's a release device.

483
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,220
I don't—

484
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:29,360
He's not a piece of the en currteo,

485
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,920
no, you son of a biop.

486
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,080
Sometimes I haven't heard these things,

487
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,080


488
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,000
You know what I mean.

489
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,040
That's what it's about.

490
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,180
The most strange thing that a stripper does

491
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,880
is pick a piece of paper,

492
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,200
baw incoming,

493
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:34,400


494
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,420
No, no, no, no, no.

495
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,780
Let's shut the fuck manage.

496
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,240
Don't touch it.

497
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,460
Don't touch it anyway.

498
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:40,640
What a piece of shit.

499
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:40,640


500
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:40,640


501
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:40,640


502
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:40,640


503
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:40,640


504
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,500
the upper teeth. Be sure to keep it down until the fingers are in position. At each corner of the

505
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:54,900
mouth, insert a thumb under the upper lip. Now slide the thumbs along the inside of the upper

506
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:01,800
lip until they are positioned just below and to the side of each nostril. The results are thrilling.

507
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,580
Everywhere these messages are heard, souls are being saved and sick bodies are being healed.

508
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,320
Don't send them your money. They've got me locked up in there.

509
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:26,940
I too refused to send money to the church of the subgenius and I too fell under the power of Iggy.

510
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,560
What?

511
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,880
And I don't think they must know. They're trying to shut us up, but there are subgenius

512
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,420
dissidents.

513
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,320
Stop right there. Sorry for keeping you in, doctors. Go on.

514
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,640
Don't leave me here.

515
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,440
Don't leave me here.

516
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,400
Don't leave me here.

517
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,680
Don't leave me here.

518
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,160
Don't leave me here.

519
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,420
They make me sick.

520
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,540
Don't leave me here.

521
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,660
I understand.

522
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,380
I'm sick.

523
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,800
Don't let them kill me.

524
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,680
Torture me.

525
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,600
I understand.

526
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,540
They torture me.

527
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,960
I don't want to see you.

528
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,080
Torture me.

529
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,540
Is that what I want to be saying, miss?

530
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,280
Don't let them kill me.

531
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,000
Don't let them kill me.

532
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,520
It's been the subgenius, parrot and parakeet training tank...

533
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,780
They tortured me.

534
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,040
...to go in there and kill me.

535
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,340
I hate the budget.

536
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,780
I hate the budget.

537
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,160
...subgenius, parrot and parakeet training tank...

538
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,620
I hate this.

539
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,700
...to go in there and kill me.

540
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,640
This has been the subgenius, parrot and parakeet...

541
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,560
...training tank...

542
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,560
I'm proud of my language, but...

543
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,760
Yee-haw!

544
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,020
Let the sons of God and man be a witness.

545
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,240
Even in the belly of the Thunderbird,

546
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,640
I've been casting out the false prophets.

547
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,840
I'm busted. I got him blowing my O-ring.

548
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,380
Hey!

549
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,100
No!

550
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,160
Hey-ya!

551
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,320
No!

552
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,600
Yeah!

553
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,840
Wow!

554
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,000
We have with us from the Ministry of Information,

555
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,120
Deputy Minister Eugene Heltman.

556
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,460
Good evening, David.

557
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,460
What do you believe is behind this recent increase

558
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,860
in terrorist bombings?

559
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
Bad sportsmanship.

560
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,740
A ruthless minority of people

561
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,900
seems to have forgotten certain

562
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,540
coolness.

563
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,780
Good old-fashioned virtue.

564
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,340
They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win.

565
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,520
If these people had just

566
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,760
played a game,

567
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,120
they'd get a lot more out of life.

568
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,660
Nevertheless, Mr. Heltman,

569
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,580
there are those who maintain that the Ministry of Information

570
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,060
has become too large and unwieldy.

571
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,460
David, in a free society,

572
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,220
information's the name of a game.

573
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,540
You can't win the game if you're a man short.

574
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,300
And the cost of it all,

575
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,000
Deputy Minister,

576
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,760
7% of the gross national product.

577
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,380
I understand this.

578
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,060
I understand the concern on behalf of the taxpayer.

579
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,960
People want value for money.

580
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,920
And that's why we always insist on the principle

581
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,760
of information retrieval charges.

582
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,020
It's absolutely right and fair

583
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,140
that those found guilty should pay for their periods of detention

584
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,880
and for the information retrieval procedures used in their interrogation.

585
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,280
Do you believe that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?

586
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,040
Oh, yes.

587
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,500
Arm around, my child.

588
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:06,800
Yes.

589
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,440
We're fielding all their strokes,

590
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,160
running a lot of them out,

591
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,480
and pretty consistently knocking them for six.

592
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,420
I'd say they're nearly out of the game.

593
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,460
One law-abiding citizen

594
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,420
has to subsidize criminals.

595
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,860
But Mr. Heltman,

596
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,220
the bombing campaign is now in its 13th year.

597
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,780
Beginners like me.

598
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:36,940
I'm a little bit of a rock.

599
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,620
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.

600
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,900
Thank you, David.

601
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,380
And a very Merry Christmas to you all.

602
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:52,240
Know then that it is the year 10,191.

603
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,080
There have always been Bobs.

604
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,900
There has never been a world without a Bob.

605
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,500
Just as there's never been a Bob without a Dick,

606
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,540
his corresponding evil twin brother, Dick Dobbs.

607
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,200
After a mental mutation.

608
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,480
Bob's waiting to come home.

609
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,760
The demons you may see during the initial hallucinations

610
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,320
Get him away from me!

611
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:13,920
are not real.

612
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,580
Erotic carnality.

613
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,360
If you do not panic,

614
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,560
this phase will end after a few months.

615
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,720
Jabber.

616
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,480
So always resurface from the hypgnosis slowly, dear friends.

617
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,260
E-I-I-I-I-

618
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,820
Hoo-hoo!

619
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,180
Hoo-hoo!

620
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,260
Oh, yeah, I want to...

621
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,640
Hoo-hoo!

622
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,060
I want to...

623
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,060
That's not right, Gary.

624
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,860
That should be a...

625
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,340
Hoo-hoo!

626
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,280
Hoo-hoo!

627
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,620
Hoo-hoo!

628
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,000
Hoo-hoo!

629
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,320
Hoo-hoo!

630
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,920
Well, yes, I was going to make serious funny noises.

631
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:46,280
Because we all know that Bob is the man that makes all the ladies go...

632
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,360
Hoo-hoo!

633
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,060
Hoo-hoo!

634
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,540
He's the man that makes all the men go...

635
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,020
Well, let's take a little rest.

636
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:56,260
It ain't an own-chattin' laid-back universe, dear friends.

637
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,320
It's a...

638
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,360
Let's take a little rest and...

639
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,180
...universe.

640
00:30:59,440 --> 00:30:59,740
Shh!

641
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,060
An action-packed universe.

642
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,300
Hello, what's in here?

643
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,560
Yeah, a boring and...

644
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,480
A burulating and...

645
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:10,960
...biodiversity.

646
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,320
...biologically active...

647
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:12,740
...a universe where everyone has a...

648
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,040
...orange globe coming from...

649
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,240
...a universe where everyone has a...

650
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,240


651
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,340
...events coming from holes between their shoelaces...

652
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,720
...oranges, bluefish...

653
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:16,880
...oranges, lobsters...

654
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,140
...oranges, lobsters...

655
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,760
...enormous bioplasm that stretches throughout...

656
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,140
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

657
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,020
Oh, did you get some of that, too?

658
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,540
Yes, it was delicious.

659
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,740
That he'd force him to eat this big, ugly piece of meat.

660
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,660
Hoo-hoo!

661
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,960
He was a little short, chubby guy, and that's where Bob got the idea.

662
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,480
They say he came in with checkered pants on, but I just don't remember.

663
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,200
He was allowed to eat all he wanted.

664
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,160
Anything he wanted.

665
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,020
Bob's big boy was a real person.

666
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,960
That's true, but there was a real Bob,

667
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,780
and this parable goes to show that there is indeed always a real Bob.

668
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,740
There has to be a Bob, dear friend.

669
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,600
Even the things which you cannot possibly believe in, Bob's big boy indeed,

670
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,240
turn out to be an actual historic person,

671
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,480
and as it is with Bob's big boy,

672
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:16,080
surely it is with the far more impressive and major deity we know as the Avatar of All Slack.

673
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,560
That's how we know him.

674
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,520
Others call him Pimp or Mongrel.

675
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,660
Others call him a demon or your mama.

676
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,500
Indeed.

677
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,540
And the children of Bob are everywhere.

678
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,640
Bob lives on in his millions and millions, literally millions of illegitimate children,

679
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,360
all of them pressing lawsuits against me personally.

680
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,380
Well, Doctor, I'm sure you're used to it by now.

681
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,720
When I took on the job as sacred scribe at the church,

682
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,840
I had no idea what I was going to be getting into.

683
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,940
We had 500 employees in 1980.

684
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,360
Now it's just me and someone else.

685
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,900
Well, that's just the Reagan-esque spirit.

686
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,680
That's it.

687
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,240
Bob's boy is stabbed up in a corner.

688
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,820
And yet they say that Bob doesn't even exist.

689
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,540
There are some who say that there is no Bob.

690
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,700
If there's no Bob, then where did all of those dead bodies come from?

691
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,440
What about all those ads in the 50s that he posed for?

692
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,260
Well, it says right here, the body store.

693
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,560
Dead Bob's for any occasion.

694
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,780
Oh, put that away.

695
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,040
No Bob too small, no Bob too big.

696
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,480
No, really, guys, all kidding aside, I must admit,

697
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,060
Rob's a rough one.

698
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,820
At least the official father church, the subgenius foundation,

699
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:36,180
which we don't expect any of you except the stinking Bobbies to cling to.

700
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,580
Nevertheless, we have the only true word of Bob, the original apostles.

701
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:48,580
And as far as I'm concerned, this whole thing about Bob being dead is a ruse.

702
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,960
Bob staged that whole thing himself.

703
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,680
It was fashionable in the 60s.

704
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,300
Bob, Bob, Rob, Rob.

705
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,900
It's the same frontwards and back, friends.

706
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,100
There's a reason there's an O in the middle.

707
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,900
A hole in the middle between those two Bs.

708
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,340
It's symbolic, friends.

709
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:17,040
You can look through the center of that O in Bob's name and see the future and the past.

710
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,680
But the spice must flow.

711
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,080
Oh.

712
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:23,900
Oh.

713
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:24,960
Oh.

714
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,440
Oh.

715
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,160
Oh.

716
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,160


717
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,160


718
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,160


719
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,160


720
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,160


721
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,440
Oh.

722
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:26,460


723
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


724
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


725
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


726
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


727
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


728
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


729
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


730
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


731
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


732
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


733
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


734
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


735
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


736
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


737
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


738
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


739
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


740
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


741
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:26,580


742
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,640
Oh.

743
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,860
Oh.

744
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


745
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


746
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


747
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


748
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


749
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


750
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


751
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


752
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


753
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


754
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


755
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


756
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


757
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


758
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


759
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


760
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


761
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


762
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


763
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


764
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


765
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


766
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


767
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


768
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


769
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:31,860


770
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:40,980
A woman age 93 was killed on a merry-go-round when she and her wheelchair were thrown from the thing in Sherman's amusement park.

771
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,160
Yankee Doodle went to town riding on a baby

772
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,080
In the corner just in time to see the naked lady

773
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,400
Yankee Doodle went to town riding on a turtle

774
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,480
In the corner just in time to see the lady turtle

775
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,680
Yankee Doodle went to town with a bag of peaches

776
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,220
He rode so fast he was coming back

777
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,600
He smashed some healthy peaches

778
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,040
Yankee Doodle went to town riding on a pony

779
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,880
Riding on a rocket

780
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,180
Bumped into the Alamo and peed on Davy Crockett

781
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:43,860
You have reached the correct number

782
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,400
However, your call has already been analyzed and rejected

783
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,180
This matter is out of our hands

784
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,700
As soon as we are able to transcend the time problems

785
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,020
Inherent in life on Earth

786
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,660
And gain control of the situation

787
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,320
We will return you to your previously scheduled conversation

788
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,360
If this had been an actual phone call

789
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,960
You would have been instructed to leave your name, number, time, and message

790
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,040
When you hear the tone

791
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,300
Thank you

792
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,620
Uh, reference time, praise Bob

793
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,200
This is Robin Anton Wilson

794
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,980
And about my appearance for the Church of the Subgenius

795
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,140
Jeff Rosenbaum, who arranges

796
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,920
The tours will be calling you about that

797
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,940
Because he has

798
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,620
He's the one who has all the flight plans

799
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,520
And the airline tickets and his controls

800
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,260
He will be the one who will arrange the dates

801
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,360
If you win, I'll be there

802
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,220
And I better shut up because I'm running out of time

803
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,920
Praise Bob

804
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,360
Praise Bob

805
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,500
Well, yeah, that's right

806
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,920
That was Robin Anton Wilson

807
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,420
And about ten of you listeners probably know who he is

808
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:52,060
We have the chance of setting up a lecture

809
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,020
And or show or whatever

810
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,780
With Robin Anton Wilson

811
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,140
He's going to be coming through Texas

812
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,660
To do shows at least in Austin

813
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,740
At the Book People's Bookstore

814
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,300
I know about that one

815
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,700
But we could set one up here in Dallas

816
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:11,880
But we need like about $450 or $500 front money, see

817
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,300
To get him in

818
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,340
And that's just the cost of the show, basically

819
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,760
So we also need a place to do it

820
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,260
And if anybody is wild and crazy about Robin Anton Wilson

821
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,760
And wants to get real involved in the show

822
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:25,760


823
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:25,760


824
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:25,760


825
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,640
And bringing him to Dallas

826
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,400
Then let us know

827
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,580
For those of you who don't know

828
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,200
He's the author of Illuminatus and Schrodinger's Cat

829
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,280
And several other cosmic science fiction books

830
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,660
That, well, you just have to check them out

831
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,240
But write us here at the station

832
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,480
Or write to Bob

833
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,980
Or call us right now

834
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,600
You can speak to the Will of Dobbs

835
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,840
So we're going to continue here

836
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,040
Oh, right, you're negatively in the background

837
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,560
We have a swimming pool in the background

838
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:55,760
Well, as a matter of fact, we're going to do a show

839
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,080
So you can hear Dr. Hal Robbins

840
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,100
And Gary Gabroke from the studio

841
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,140
Them and several movie soundtracks

842
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,840
That's what we're doing, is movie soundtracks

843
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,540
You're hearing the soundtrack of Brazil

844
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,320
In stereo

845
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,340
That's why I insist on the headphones

846
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,980
Brazil, Big Trouble in Little China, and Dune

847
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:19,160
Our favorite sound effects horrors for tonight

848
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,960
So, yeah

849
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,680
Yeah, this is Steve

850
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,500
I'm going to be in town all the time

851
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,140
What are you talking about, man?

852
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,180
But hurry, but hurry, but hurry, but hurry

853
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,140
All right, it's Mike at Jimmy Carr

854
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,440
Oh, too bad we missed you

855
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,760
This is Mike and Pam in Chicago

856
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,440
We didn't know if you had caught Pee Wee's Playhouse this morning

857
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,200
But Bob was prominently displayed on the bulletin board

858
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,880
If you didn't get it, let me know

859
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,260
And I'll send you off a copy

860
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,500
Have a good one, bye

861
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,960
How long have you been in the U.S. of A?

862
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,780
Three months

863
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,380
Where from?

864
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,500
Hong Kong

865
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,540
What happens?

866
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,400
You stay here a while?

867
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,740
Old girls leave, new girls come in?

868
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,140
Maybe

869
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,180
Take your tie off, please

870
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,560
Yeah, I know what you mean

871
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,500
My wife gave it to me for Christmas

872
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:55,760
Oh, my God

873
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,360
Green explosions

874
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,580
People flying in and out

875
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,620
That was not real

876
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,860
I want to talk to the cops

877
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,260
I want my truck back

878
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,400
Now, where the hell am I?

879
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,140
I want my water

880
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,880
Is this a gas cellar?

881
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:48,880


882
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:48,880


883
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,120
No, I still don't

884
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,940
You called after me

885
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,380
I know you miss me

886
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,280
I got a gift from some stick

887
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,560
Cool

888
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,460
What's in my pocket, then?

889
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:55,460


890
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:55,460


891
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:55,460


892
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:55,460


893
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:55,740
Well, I hope they'll pay 부 clue

894
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:55,740


895
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:55,740


896
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:55,740


897
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:55,740


898
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:55,740


899
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:55,740


900
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:55,740


901
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:55,740


902
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:55,740


903
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:55,760
Have as long as you wish

904
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,800
Ow!

905
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,380
Chris...

906
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:24,060
You injured my eyes and toppled the Louvre.

907
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,100
I think you guys are afraid of J.R. Bob Bob.

908
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:48,980
You've been doing this show for almost five years now, disrespectfully, making fun of your high E-pop, the man who brought you slack.

909
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,020
I ain't afraid of no pop.

910
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,740
Bob died for your sins.

911
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,180
Nobody knows how many times.

912
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,840
The only thing that ever brought me slack was leaving Paul in St. Louis.

913
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,220
I'm not kidding, Bob.

914
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:07,880
I was the only slack I ever got out of this damn church, and it cost me $3,000 to have him shipped back.

915
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,020
Well, most people don't fear Bob.

916
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,400
Don't fear him a bit.

917
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,640
Oh, they think Bob's always going to be their buddy.

918
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:18,600
And then as soon as they think Bob's dead, they turn around.

919
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,840
They think he ain't looking anymore.

920
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,820
They turn around and go.

921
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,980
Go to the pinks.

922
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,300
Go into the pinks, every one of them.

923
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,580
Oh, friends, he's just testing you.

924
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,540
He's been testing you for two years.

925
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,240
He knows if you've been bad or good.

926
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,020
Oh, yeah.

927
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,820
But more people are frightened of Gary than frightened of Bob.

928
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,820
Anybody want to go to an E-pop?

929
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,260
Why does this situation persist?

930
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:43,020
Well, it's because of the general loss of faith in the companies of modern people.

931
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:49,960
And the feeling that one can no longer support the fragility, superstition, and fanaticism of an earlier time.

932
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:56,300
When one might well have believed in the smiling, pipe-smoking, benevolent figure known from the book of the subdues.

933
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,080
That's right.

934
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,140
That was really beautiful.

935
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,020
Very touching.

936
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,440
It was just beautiful.

937
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,140
Could you repeat that?

938
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,100
Everybody welcome.

939
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,880
Now I'm here to talk about the conspiracy again.

940
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,340
As usual.

941
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,440
But I'm talking about a different conspiracy.

942
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,660
This time.

943
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,500
The conspiracy within the church of the subdues.

944
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,120
I was right.

945
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,340
I'm afraid it's true.

946
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,920
There is an answer.

947
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,160
The conspiracy has a way of outweighing the end.

948
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,740
And I think most of you know what I mean by the conspiracy.

949
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,380
I knew God's name.

950
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,980
But he goes back.

951
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,080
He will be on the road.

952
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,520
With no slack.

953
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,980
On the phone.

954
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,160
Oh, Lord.

955
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,580
And he's coming on.

956
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,720
Again.

957
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,400
On the road.

958
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,240
On the road.

959
00:43:59,880 --> 00:43:59,980
On the road.

960
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,820
On the road.

961
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,860
And he's coming again.

962
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,020
If we don't want the answers upon us.

963
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,500
Then we need more to be honest.

964
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,820
On the road.

965
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,960
On the road.

966
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,620
On the road.

967
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,040
On the road.

968
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,400
On the road.

969
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:24,460
On the road.

970
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,040
And he's coming on.

971
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,880
He's coming on.

972
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,360
On the road.

973
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:30,860
On the road.

974
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:30,900


975
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,900
On the road.

976
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:34,980
On the road.

977
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,820
On the road.

978
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,180
He's coming on.

979
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:36,180


980
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:36,180


981
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,200
I'm the purple flower of hell.

982
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,680
Give me wide berth.

983
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,060
When I drop my drawers.

984
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,400
Mother Nature swoots.

985
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,380
A six million year cycle will end in 1998.

986
00:44:48,380 --> 00:45:03,840
1998, Bob sees the world entering a new aeon, which, in a few years, will bring more wondrous and miraculous change and carnage, insanity, and destruction than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.

987
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:22,260
Bob brings a new destiny for America, a time of cataclysmic economic change that will offer untold riches and power to those in the know, while billions of deserving conspiracy dupes fry in hell on Earth.

988
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:32,520
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled by Bob, will usher in a spiritual rebreath and a cascade of astounding mysteries.

989
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:45,080
Supernatural bridges and a restoration of lost psychic abilities will totally transform the lives of those who dare to seek them and pay for them.

990
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,720
That's right, you're lucky to live in the end time.

991
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,340
Here's more money, Bob!

992
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,980
Lies up! They're out to get you!

993
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,140
Moving podium!

994
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:00,920
Rods!

995
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,820
And having once thought it moves on, I'm not moving.

996
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:12,740
You know, the subgenius is not just below a genius, whatever that may be.

997
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:17,680
The subgenius does not pretend to superknowledge, but to subknowledge.

998
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,660
Knowledge of the underthings, the underwear lurking beneath the clothing of existence.

999
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:27,260
The foundation garment, if you will, underlying reality.

1000
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,900
You see, the subgenius is a subgenius.

1001
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,940
A strange beast indeed.

1002
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,240
Give me a can of sound effects while you're at it, would you?

1003
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,240
Oh, yeah, and some show stretchers.

1004
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,540
And listen to him.

1005
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,320
I need some show stretchers back.

1006
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,120
Yes, ma'am.

1007
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:56,760
How about something to eat?

1008
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,140
Little did many of you know, but...

1009
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:58,580
Who wants peanuts?

1010
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,900
This isn't the only subgenius.

1011
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,400
This is the only subgenius show.

1012
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:14,920
In fact, there's six weekly subgenius shows now in New York, Beijing, New Jersey, Richmond, Virginia, St. Louis, Dallas.

1013
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:15,920
Come on, hurry now.

1014
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,240
We have to catch the last one.

1015
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,700
I gave the anti-virgin a hot protein tassel wash.

1016
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,620
I'm a bacteriological weapon.

1017
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,760
I'm armed and I'm loaded.

1018
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,460
I'm a fission reactor.

1019
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,980
I fight plutonium.

1020
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,460
Power plants are fueled by the sweat from my brow.

1021
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,760
When they plug me in, the lights go out.

1022
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,460
In Hong Kong, I weigh 666 pounds and zero gravity.

1023
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,660
Come and get me.

1024
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,840
Soon, they'll begin to fold space.

1025
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,520
Far off in the control rooms of Spice Gas.

1026
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,100
Traveling without moving.

1027
00:47:54,740 --> 00:48:00,280
Ivan Stang, 15, shows scars after being attacked by an alligator near West Palm Beach, Florida.

1028
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:09,180
On Monday, Ivan and a friend were swimming in a lake when suddenly he was grabbed by the head and pulled underwater by a giant sharp-toothed saurian.

1029
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:20,120
I couldn't see anything but teeth and didn't know what had hold of me until the gator let loose and swam away, said Ivan, who suffered wounds requiring 41 stitches.

1030
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,120
This is supposed to be a religious show.

1031
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,280
Now, what is the interpretation of this parable, my friends?

1032
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,680
The alligator is the worldly mob, the rabble.

1033
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,440
The rabble is the world's most powerful.

1034
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:30,440


1035
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,840
We seek to devour and assimilate the holy men of the Church of the Subgenius.

1036
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:44,660
The lone swimmer, buoyed up by the fluid element, represents, upon the other hand, the striving outward force of the Church of the Subgenius,

1037
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:51,580
which requires 41 stitches, the same number as the number of bullet holes in Bob's bullet-reddled body.

1038
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,860
Praise Bob. Praise Bob. Praise Bob. Praise Bob.

1039
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,940
What are we going to do?

1040
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,360
Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocrities?

1041
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,160
I wouldn't go that far.

1042
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:08,280
These pink boys, these box-dwelling Barbies and Kens, these normals who have made normality the norm?

1043
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,620
Well, no, I wouldn't like revenge on those people.

1044
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,840
I'd like revenge on you, Ivan, because you've taken one too many $20 check from me.

1045
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,920
I've never done it.

1046
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:18,080
I want my slack.

1047
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,880
Let's see your Subgenius membership card, hmm?

1048
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,440
Now, let's not get into it.

1049
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,260
I mean, say the end times came a little bit soon, Gary.

1050
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:30,080
Do you think you'd make it on the escape saucers of the sex goddesses without your little...

1051
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,800
Subgenius membership card?

1052
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,640
I'd sure try.

1053
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,380
Ah, this is a great example you're setting for the people out here.

1054
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,620
I've got my Bob America card here.

1055
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,720
It says that I paid up to 1997?

1056
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:48,600
You see, Gary is the Rasputin of the Church of the Subgenius, often thought for, but rarely encountered.

1057
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:54,420
And it is this self-same learning for slack which separates us from them.

1058
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,120
At the hip.

1059
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,740
The human may live out his entire life in a grinding cycle.

1060
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:00,640
In slacklessness.

1061
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,120
Yet he never feels cheated.

1062
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,580
He thinks it's natural.

1063
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,820
He thinks it's fine.

1064
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:05,320
Who?

1065
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:05,940
Big deal.

1066
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,400
Who cares?

1067
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,160
Well, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Sang.

1068
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:15,580
And we've been getting some calls tonight from people who apparently never heard of the Church of the Subgenius before,

1069
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:20,940
don't know anything about it, don't know that there's acres and acres of reading material available,

1070
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:28,020
which is up at least to the level of the incredible mixing you're hearing on this show.

1071
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,100
And you can...

1072
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,000
You can write for information.

1073
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,120
That's all we can tell you on this station.

1074
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,820
For very good reason.

1075
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,240
Because you need to send your money to the station.

1076
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,820
But you can send your letters of your questions.

1077
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,800
Send your questions to Bob.

1078
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,280
That's J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1079
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:52,620
And friends, that address is coming up as you stay tuned for Ron Lindsay's Sold Oldies.

1080
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,460
Have that pencil ready by now?

1081
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:58,440
Well, you need to write to Bob at P.O. Box.

1082
00:50:59,160 --> 00:50:59,680
181.

1083
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,560
417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1084
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,160
www.subgenius.com

1085
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,300
So friends, your hour of slack is coming to an end.

1086
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,520
But be ready for more slack.

1087
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,520
More slack dripping and leaking all over you.

1088
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,080
Oh, yeah.

1089
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,640
I suppose we could get in, but...

1090
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,140
They're nothing but half-footed cattle.

1091
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,040
Racing each other to be first to the slaughterhouse

1092
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,400
and stampeding you along with them.

1093
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,500
But what do you care?

1094
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,800
Oh, you've got slack.

1095
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,520
Slack.

1096
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:45,720
Yeah.

1097
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,520
Anybody want to go down the slide?

1098
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,080
Oh, get along, little bobbies.

1099
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,180
Go head on down to Dobbstown now.

1100
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:57,360
Get on in that Dobbstown corral, you little bobbies.

1101
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:58,820
Bob.

1102
00:51:58,820 --> 00:51:58,900
Bob.

1103
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,100
Bob.

1104
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,000
Bob.

1105
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:00,620
Bob.

1106
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:00,620


1107
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,860
Oh, there's a nice fat one.

1108
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:08,240
Yes, you'll be a good trading commodity

1109
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,180
come the bargaining session with the exes.

1110
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,280
First up, I noticed y'all don't talk about religion much.

1111
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,480
I guess it's real hip out here in California.

1112
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,780
It's a more humanistic approach to life.

1113
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,020
No, we believe in just letting the holy benediction of Bob

1114
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,580
flow out like pus from a bus job.

1115
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,140
We just don't understand the true power of religion.

1116
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,180
We're looking the wrong way.

1117
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:35,180


1118
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:35,800
It's really up in here right now.

1119
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,280
We're not going to think you to even be arias Program today

1120
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:36,280


1121
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:36,280


1122
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:36,280


1123
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,680
Now he was a prophet.

1124
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,920
I don't hear.

1125
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,960
Chaines to say.

1126
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,200
I love this principle.

1127
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,700
There are a bunch of good things in the world,

1128
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,520
and it can be hidden quiet,

1129
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,680
but you get

1130
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,880
shot every time you make a mistake.

1131
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,520
in reverential resignation.

1132
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,340
No wish to strive,

1133
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,380
no thought expressed,

1134
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,780
only a sense of suffocation.

1135
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,720
With the groove I only got,

1136
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,700
we shall all be moved.

1137
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,420
Ready or not,

1138
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,540
here we come,

1139
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,920
getting down on

1140
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,940
the one which we believe in.

1141
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,240
Can I get it on my foot?

1142
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,380
But thank the God.

1143
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,440
I'll come again soon.

1144
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,820
One night you will be moved.

1145
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,720
I think it's up or down.

1146
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,780
He don't tell me now.

1147
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,700
Friends, if you're interested in more history

1148
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,000
of the Church of the Subgenius,

1149
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:56,760
there will be an online course taught in that.

1150
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,140
That's why we're doing these rerun-type shows.

1151
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,120
And if you want information about that,

1152
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,480
you can check out

1153
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,640
maybelogic.org

1154
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,220
or even maybelogic.com.

1155
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,620
It's MaybeLogic Academy that is doing this.

1156
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,460
For information on the Church of the Subgenius,

1157
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:19,680
please look into subgenius.com.

1158
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:29,540
I love you.

1159
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,960
Speaking of ancient fossilized subgenius tapes,

1160
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,440
I'm going to close with some cuts

1161
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,960
from Media Barrage No. 4,

1162
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,200
which predates Hour of Slack.

1163
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,240
This was put together in late 1980.

1164
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,660
And it'll be okay because

1165
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:52,540
remember where Bob is?

1166
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:58,780
Bob is at EO Box 1403-06.

1167
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:02,020
Bob can help you.

1168
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,480
That's right.

1169
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,640
Thanks, Bob.

1170
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:08,400
Thank you for bringing that joy

1171
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,220
and sunshine and blood into my veins

1172
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:14,120
and bringing those pills into my briefcase

1173
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,060
where I can get them out and take them

1174
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,080
whenever I want.

1175
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,120
Yeah, pumping through me.

1176
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,960
And I like the pills that Bob sends

1177
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,220
because Bob sends pills that make my heart wise.

1178
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,240
I have wise blood and family.

1179
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,880
It's just one of the wonderful things.

1180
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,580
I love to feel the blood that Bob makes me

1181
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,380
pump through my brain

1182
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,980
because the drugs and, oh, Bob.

1183
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,600
I like it.

1184
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,640
What if somebody isn't really good with throat noises?

1185
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,020
Will you still take their money?

1186
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:51,280
We do not require proof of subgeniusness at all.

1187
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,020
We often find that we're able to,

1188
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,700
once they join up,

1189
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,420
we're able to get them off to one of our subgenius retreats,

1190
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,280
change their diet,

1191
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,000
start feeding them.

1192
00:55:59,020 --> 00:55:59,220
We're able to get them off to one of our subgenius retreats,

1193
00:55:59,220 --> 00:55:59,660
and start propaganda,

1194
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,520
repeating the same thing over and over again

1195
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,880
until they forget who they are

1196
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,440
and start responding only to our dogma.

1197
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:07,880
But it's all real.

1198
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:08,680
It's really real.

1199
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,000
It was really, really real at the time we were there.

1200
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,140
The communications are wide open.

1201
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:17,320
We can hear everything coming down that pike,

1202
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,680
coming our way.

1203
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,340
And we like to be on the radio

1204
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,320
and talk to all the boys and girls

1205
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,200
that are all out there.

1206
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,580
We're letters.

1207
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,220
And keep them cards and letters coming, girls.

1208
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,200
And send pictures.

1209
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:29,840
And send pictures of yourselves,

1210
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:30,880
if you know what I mean.

1211
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,360
Because we need more girls at the church.

1212
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,460
And bring your rich fathers.

1213
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,200
And we'll convince them that we're not really that weird.

1214
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,440
And we can get some money

1215
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,660
and really make him a lot more money.

1216
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,600
Because we're a modern mystical business, man.

1217
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:46,560
Marvelous.

1218
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,900
The smell of success is never too sweet.

1219
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,260
We can help you out.

1220
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,300
I think we're being sold a bill.

1221
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,140
A big bill of goods.

1222
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:13,020
You can fly to Malaysia and Dobstown.

1223
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,900
And you can fly to the special mountaintops

1224
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,820
where Bob learns from great holy men

1225
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:24,160
that have helped him along when he was younger.

1226
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,580
And now he's teaching them.

1227
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,280
And you can be with Bob

1228
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,200
and be listening to the teachings

1229
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:34,420
teachings that come through. And I tell you, friends, if you can just get that, if you

1230
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:38,180
can just pull out that wallet, pull it out of your pocket, pull it out of your purse,

1231
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:43,020
pull it out of wherever you got it. You can put one hand on the radio and with the other

1232
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:47,180
one you pull out that dollar bill. And I tell you, if you don't feel that power coursing

1233
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:52,560
from that dollar bill to that radio or that tape recorder or that, whatever you may have.

1234
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:57,580
I mean, some people tell me they hear the voices and they don't have no machine running

1235
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:02,220
at all. The only experiment people can do if they're listening on the radio or on their

1236
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:08,560
tape machine is they can take that dollar bill out of their pocket and hold it by one

1237
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:13,200
end above the machine that they're listening on, whether it be the radio or the tape recorder.

1238
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:21,020
Hold it there on one end with two hands, right? One grasp on each corner and hold it above

1239
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:27,400
the machine and you'll notice that it bends down and points towards the radio. It will

1240
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:27,560
point. It will point. It will point. It will point. It will point. It will point. It will

1241
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:32,680
point down towards that, down toward the center of that machine, right where the real

1242
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:40,440
power is meeting the wires and it's all coming together. It's coming out of the reality of

1243
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:45,360
the physical world and turning into the spirit world. And there's a bridge there and Bob

1244
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:49,300
can help you make that bridge to where the physical world don't no longer mean nothing

1245
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:53,560
to you and that dollar bill won't mean nothing to you. And friend, I'm telling you that in

1246
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:57,380
five years that dollar bill ain't going to mean nothing in the spirit world, the physical

1247
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:57,560
world.

1248
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:02,060
The physical world on a mental world to anybody doesn't mean anything. Now it, it, it means

1249
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:07,300
very little. It can mean a bottle of beer for some lost individual. It can mean a cigarette

1250
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:12,840
or two. It can mean enough gas to get you back home from the gas station. Sure. But

1251
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:17,000
I tell you what, when that tribulation money starts coming down, you're going to find out

1252
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,140
that those little green pieces of paper made by made by the clones in Washington, the people

1253
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:26,800
that there aren't people there, they're making that stuff and it ain't going to be worth

1254
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,100
nothing.

1255
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:27,540
You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't

1256
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:31,560
sleep on it. You can't burn fires with it. You can't stay warm with that. You have to

1257
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,720
have too much of it. But I tell you what you don't need too much of. And that's, that's

1258
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,520
the word of Bob.
