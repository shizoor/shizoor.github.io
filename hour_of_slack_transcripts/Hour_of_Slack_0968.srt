1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,040
There he is, the guinea one! Get up!

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,620
The Self Genius

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,160
Power of

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:12,580
Swatch

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,220
Well, I'm just going to see about this.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,780
Who are you?

7
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,380
I am someone who will call downstairs if I do not get an explanation.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,600
Probably a nightmare.

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:21,860
I'm frightened.

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,680
Will you explain this at once?

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,300
Who is that man?

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,460
It's all...

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,740
He's gone.

14
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,780
Oh, no it's not.

15
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,720
Where do you think you're going?

16
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:44,000
Friends, this Hour of Slack number 968 is actually Reverend Susie the Floozy's Aliens episode of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse.

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,580
The bi-weekly show from amazing WREK Atlanta.

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,520
Greatest college station in the universe.

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,900
The other stations which also carry the Hour of Slack are also the greatest stations.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:16,600
But WREK is one station which produces so much original programming that it leaks out into the whole world of other college and independent stations as follows.

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,500
Oh, have you seen Bob?

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,540
You ought to be here soon.

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,780
Yeah? Well, maybe.

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,980
Yeah, maybe.

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,640
I can feel the vibes in the air.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,760
Ah, he's coming.

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,200
And when he comes, I run right through the jail door.

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,880
When I spot the driver with a second glance

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,540
Foot to floorboard impacts you now, gee

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,380
But here comes Bob

31
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,100
I ain't subtle in my ways of making friends

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,440
Girl, this bubble mess was caused by my neglect

33
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,980
Of course I'll pay him by the way I do it

34
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,400
And here comes Bob

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,040
I ain't subtle in my ways of making friends

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,360
No

37
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,620
But here comes Bob

38
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,900
Sometimes I will stoop to hitting two dork hoots without the frills

39
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,700
But that is just for casual acquaintances for stripped down thrills

40
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,940
Your car, girl, or mine it doesn't matter doesn't matter

41
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:29,960
Just be a little more confident

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


43
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


44
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


45
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


46
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


47
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


48
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


49
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


50
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,840
to know. But for affairs with standing

52
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,100
tower, I go after limousines.

53
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,940
It's always nice when something big

54
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,600
is acting as your go-between.

55
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,860
And for a group encounter, I'll hit

56
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,680
buses, mobile homes, or trains to

57
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,280
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

58
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,900
It's hard to make

59
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,660
acquaintances in our big

60
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,820
town. The skies stare at

61
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,080
nothing much at all.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,780
But here comes Bob.

63
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,620
Bob. I ain't so full in

64
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,880
my ways of making

65
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,240
friends.

66
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,620
Friends.

67
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,540
How quaint

68
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,820
it is.

69
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,340
Instant adulation comes to

70
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,580
some at birth.

71
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,280
One, two queens of corporate entities.

72
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,200
But here

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,320
comes Bob. Some day

74
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,500
they'll put me away. I'll think back

75
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,440
on active days. Most were worth

76
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,480
the minor scars. Some were worth the

77
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,520
damage cost. And the judge will say

78
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,420
to me, Bob, you've got a bad

79
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,500
means to a word.

80
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,820
Why an end?

81
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,160
An end.

82
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,420
But here comes Bob.

83
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,240
Are you ready for re-entry? We're ready.

84
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,460
Okay, Skipper. All set.

85
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,320
Zero X from central control. You are in

86
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,240
correct re-entry attitude and are

87
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,740
about to enter Earth's atmosphere.

88
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,520
Roger, central control.

89
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,460
Radio control over to you in five seconds.

90
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,520
Four, three, two, one.

91
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,660
Okay, you better start transmitting.

92
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,660
Right. Give me order.

93
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,500
Yes, sir.

94
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,480
Transmit. I will, sir.

95
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,000
Click.

96
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:35,440
What would you do if you thought someone

97
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,560
from another world was watching

98
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,160
you? Tonight

99
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,480
we present

100
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,420
Tales of Tomorrow.

101
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,400
Tales of Tomorrow.

102
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,540
Tonight's Tale of Tomorrow.

103
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,160
Appointment on Mars.

104
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,940
Mars.

105
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,220
Mars.

106
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:00,960
Mars.

107
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:01,400
Mars.

108
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,000
Imagine, he says he's seen Mars.

109
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,320
Mars.

110
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,720
In the year of our Lord,

111
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,360
3063,

112
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,880
it is a galaxy of peace

113
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,780
where not only worlds of different

114
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,780
civilizations have learned to live together,

115
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,000
but worlds of different life forms.

116
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,940
And this is the Galaxy

117
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,280
Bureau of Investigation,

118
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,480
the brain center of the universe,

119
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,120
where the great scientific and economic minds

120
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,500
of the planet are.

121
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:27,500


122
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,280
The planet's work in democratic unity

123
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,920
to preserve peace, prosperity, and equality among all men.

124
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,820
But powerful and evil forces throughout the galaxy

125
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,740
are trying to gain control of those GBI secrets

126
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,880
by which the democratic balance is maintained.

127
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,760
There's still a small group holding out in the caves

128
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,080
on the island, sir, but we should have them by morning.

129
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,940
The stars and stripes will fly over this island, too.

130
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,880
This war might finally be coming to an end, Major.

131
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,160
I certainly hope so, sir.

132
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,200
While below on the planetoid, the man responsible,

133
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,620
watches for the first sign of a falling ship.

134
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,440
Well, Mr. Stang, it was an almost foolproof plan.

135
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,160
Over here, Bob.

136
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,560
Bob. Over here.

137
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,440
Look at the flying saucer.

138
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,580
Oh!

139
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,140
Enemy plane, sir?

140
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,120
Impossible.

141
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,160
No plane can fly that fast.

142
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,800
That looked to me like it was from another planet.

143
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,140
I have to agree, sir.

144
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,500
It did look like it was from another planet, but...

145
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,100
Shall we report it, sir?

146
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,180
What, that we're being invaded by little green men from outer space?

147
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,340
Let's just keep it as our secret.

148
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,200
You can tell your son about it when he's born.

149
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,620
Major Spielberg?

150
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,200
Sir, yes, sir!

151
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,960
The space tape is coming!

152
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,320
The space tape is coming!

153
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,960
You'd rather count the bubbles in ourselves to try

154
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,320
The space tape is coming!

155
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,660
The space tape is coming!

156
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,480
Cause the drops kick you in your side of your head and neck

157
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,640
The space tape is coming!

158
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,940
The space tape is coming!

159
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,640
The human black side squash machine!

160
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,960
The space tape is coming!

161
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,320
The space tape is coming!

162
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,080
Carry through a wall Punch through solid rocks

163
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,340
Space tape is coming!

164
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,660
The space tape is coming!

165
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,320
Who is the one to hack the Microsoft computer?

166
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,700
The space tape is coming!

167
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,020
The space tape is coming!

168
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,700
Good man exalted highest wizard of them all

169
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,020
The space tape is coming!

170
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,320
The space tape is coming!

171
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,940
Spread against my float Have my dough

172
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,340
The space tape is coming!

173
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,660
The space tape is coming!

174
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,060
Tough liver stone to wear down today

175
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,700
The space tape is coming!

176
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,000
The space tape is coming!

177
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,960
clever disguises. But who am I?

178
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,080
Space tape is coming. Space tape is

179
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,320
coming.

180
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,620
We're doomed. We're doomed.

181
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,020
We're under attack from a form of light we do not

182
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,860
understand. You seem to be skeptical.

183
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,320
Those two flying saucers

184
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,000
are transports. What?

185
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,500
Aliens. Go, bitch.

186
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,140
Oh, God, no. Is today the 5th?

187
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,640
We need to get out of here.

188
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,280
All units, on the alert.

189
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,740
Saucer contact.

190
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,720
Ah! Look at the

191
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:56,880
window!

192
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,040
Hey, it's a flying saucer!

193
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,840
What are they doing?

194
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,480
Spaceship.

195
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,000
What do you make of that?

196
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,860
Yeah. They were here already.

197
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,340
We're driving down the street

198
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,700
sitting on the street.

199
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,440
Look at that.

200
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,520
Look at my IC.

201
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,980
I see flying saucers

202
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,460
landing over there. So I went

203
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,380
a little closer to see what I can get.

204
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,600
A good read. I don't believe

205
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,580
the plan is detected. The make-out

206
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,180
wasn't effected. They're gonna shoot

207
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,700
a behavior, a swipe,

208
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,700
and then I heard a leader say,

209
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,840
make them dance.

210
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,340
Na, na, na, na.

211
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Make them play.

212
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,060
Na, na, na, na.

213
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,280
Make them dance.

214
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,620
Na, na, na, na.

215
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,120
We're not safe yet.

216
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,280
All right, I'll shoot him out of the sky.

217
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,900
Now, shoot it down.

218
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,440
Right.

219
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,480
Let it pass and then pursue it.

220
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,500
You got me?

221
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,100
Right.

222
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,120
It's gonna crash.

223
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,140
And inside the doomed ship...

224
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,240
All four engines are cutting out.

225
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,200
The air engine's dead.

226
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,780
No wonder, Fisherman.

227
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,000
All four chambers are stopped.

228
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,460
We're heading for a crash, Commander.

229
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,280
You better strap in.

230
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,440
You'll find straps in the cubby.

231
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,520
Are you getting any voltage?

232
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,700
No, nothing.

233
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,980
Yet fuel is feeding into the fission.

234
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,500
I'm gonna try and break the helix once we hit the planet.

235
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,700
That's where it's at, Mr. Reard.

236
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,940
At the rate we're dropping, you'll never make it.

237
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,460
We don't want to fall back to Earth, do we?

238
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,240
Talk about living on borrowed time.

239
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,000
Might be a case of out of the frying pan.

240
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,580
We're gonna be in the fire.

241
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,860
We've still gotta find a place to land, quick.

242
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,740
We're losing speed. I can feel it.

243
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,100
That isn't our only worry.

244
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,380
White lightning, white lightning.

245
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,780
This is ground beef control.

246
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,640
Do you read me?

247
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,280
Over.

248
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,520
I read only good books.

249
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,160
Over.

250
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,800
You must be way out there, pastor.

251
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,560
Over.

252
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,780
I'm high, all right.

253
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,860
But not on false drugs.

254
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,400
I'm high.

255
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,600
I'm high.

256
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,020
I'm high on the real.

257
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,380
The real thing.

258
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,020
Powerful gasoline.

259
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,660
A clean windshield.

260
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,520
And a shoeshine.

261
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,180
Over.

262
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,900
He's turning over.

263
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,120
Get thee behind me.

264
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,940
Are you in danger, pastor?

265
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,780
I'm all right, Roger.

266
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,020
Just a little argument with my co-pilot.

267
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,620
And guess what, Rog?

268
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,140
The little red needle's pointing to E.

269
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,280
And while that's always stood for excellent in my book,

270
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,460
I guess it means I'm out of gas.

271
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,000
You'll have to see.

272
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,060
Like me and my friends.

273
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,340
My favorite, M1570!

274
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,780
There's a flight leaving here in the morning

275
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,440
Destination was charted long ago

276
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,020
Now the captain is pretty and weighty

277
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,980
But the engine's still on the run.

278
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:25,980


279
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:25,980


280
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,940
are still I don't know

281
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,460
Waiting now for those

282
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,160
who still linger

283
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,480
With unflagging

284
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,820
it's great to every day

285
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,840
Reservations secured

286
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,840
by the Savior

287
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,220
On this one-way flight

288
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,440
to glory land

289
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,280
All aboard the master

290
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,540
calling from the runway

291
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,440
For our leaving

292
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,400
is almost at hand

293
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,100
Make your way

294
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,280
to the tonic of Calvary

295
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,540
For this one-way flight

296
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,820
to glory land

297
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,320
The UFO!

298
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,420
Something's happening!

299
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,580
It is opening!

300
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,320
Which one?

301
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,680
The one with the ever-widening hole in it!

302
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,240
A steadily increasing glow

303
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,140
seems to emanate from everywhere

304
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,500
Perception is confused

305
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,840
We cannot be sure

306
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,320
whether we're actually hearing

307
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,880
or experiencing something

308
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,680
telepathically

309
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:54,660
Oh, come on!

310
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,240
Welcome, friend!

311
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,580
Welcome, friend!

312
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,280
Welcome, friend!

313
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:01,800
Welcome, friend!

314
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,620
Peculiar rays of shifting light

315
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,900
cause grotesque and eccentric shadows

316
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,260
to dance and play upon

317
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,860
a nebulous substance

318
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,520
which solidifies into form

319
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,280
and thus quickly dissolves

320
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,560
into spiraling vapors

321
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,720
glowing and vibrating

322
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,680
with tints and colors

323
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,040
you've never seen before

324
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,720
I'm embarrassed

325
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,180
You've never seen this as fish

326
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,440
where you, when you see fish

327
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,620
even esas

328
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,260
vosfority

329
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,400
Remember I was vapor

330
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,640
Remember I was just like you

331
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,960
Remember I was liquid

332
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,200
Remember I was someone too

333
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,580
Remember I need others

334
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,120
Remember I need oxygen

335
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,140
Remember I need others

336
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,000
Remember I need to forget

337
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:45,220
There's nothing I've their there's nothing I've their

338
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,680
there's nothing I've there's spectacular

339
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,760
There's nothing I've their there's nothing I've their

340
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,940
There's nothing I've their there's nothing I've their

341
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:53,960
There's nothing I've her there's nothing ever

342
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:53,960


343
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,560
And it seems that something I touch under my nose

344
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,420
Remember I am human

345
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,540
Remember I thought just like you

346
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,000
Remember I had reasons

347
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,080
Remember I had friends like you

348
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,420
Remember I grew tired

349
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,640
Remember I could end all this

350
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,100
Remember I have memories

351
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,920
Remember I need to forget

352
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,140
There's nothing in but us

353
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,420
There's nothing in but us

354
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,640
There's nothing in but us

355
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:49,800
.

356
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,760
There's nothing in the dust

357
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,920
There's nothing in the dust

358
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,220
There's nothing in the dust

359
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,420
There's nothing in the dust

360
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,640
There's nothing in the dust

361
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,780
There's nothing in the dust

362
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,760
There's nothing in the dust

363
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,300
There's nothing in the dust

364
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,500
There's nothing in the dust

365
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,500


366
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,560
They slowly focus into their relationship.

367
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,020
The astronauts are here.

368
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,700
Thank you, dear friends.

369
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,840
I'm down.

370
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,860
I'm grounded, safe and sound.

371
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,500
Trailing clouds of glory, I'm down.

372
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,080
And I'm marching.

373
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,500
Yes, dear friends, I'm marching.

374
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,760
To dinner!

375
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,540
Because God Almighty, I'm hungry.

376
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,660
We're hungry!

377
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,380
Of course you're hungry.

378
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,900
I'm hungry.

379
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,920
We're all hungry.

380
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,280
So let's eat.

381
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,240
Let's eat!

382
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,800
And he said the word.

383
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,840
And we ate it.

384
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,920
And what was the word?

385
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,420
Bob.

386
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:39,860
Bob.

387
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,280
Yes, dear friend.

388
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,040
There's nothing to eat here.

389
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,980
And the duck comes down with the magic word.

390
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,520
What is the word?

391
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:45,980
Bob.

392
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,280
And we ate him.

393
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,020
Eat him.

394
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,680
Oh, come now.

395
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,680
Just call me Bob.

396
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,980
Nobody really surprised me.

397
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,760
Hello, Connie.

398
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,240
Dobbs, I'm an admirer of your work.

399
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,640
Personal as well as professional.

400
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,260
Is that so?

401
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,820
Well, that's all you know about him.

402
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,540
The man's a fiend.

403
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,480
An absolute boorish.

404
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,180
You wouldn't believe the things he did to me.

405
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,860
And how.

406
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,520
You come in here and take our jobs.

407
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,320
You're dead.

408
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,060
You're dead.

409
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,980
I mean it.

410
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,460
Dead.

411
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,560
Dead.

412
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,480
What's the matter with you people?

413
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,300
I was joking.

414
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,180
Don't you know a joke when you hear one?

415
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,120
I know you're my hero.

416
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,500
Please.

417
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,400
We don't want to hurt you.

418
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,820
This is my pipe.

419
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,880
How can one ordinary man have so many enemies?

420
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,760
That's a good one.

421
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,080
They shot me out of every room in the house.

422
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,360
We'll give that creep a taste of his own medicine.

423
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,280
You can even say that.

424
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,060
She's right.

425
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,100
He's got a great idea.

426
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,460
All right.

427
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,240
All right.

428
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,340
All right.

429
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,360
This tape contains the formula for the miracle drug.

430
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,040
The tape recorder here.

431
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,620
Is that recording good enough to identify the thing?

432
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,340
If we can intercept the waves.

433
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,120
Yes, sir.

434
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,760
We'll do our very best.

435
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,740
Something wrong with the recorder?

436
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,940
Don't think so.

437
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,380
Is their system the same?

438
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,420
Yes, it is according to the directions on the card.

439
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,460
There's so much time.

440
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,600
Yes, we know.

441
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,240
Click.

442
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,980
Please explain our desperate need to your people on Earth and help us obtain their cooperation.

443
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,700
We're going to need a lot of people.

444
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,680
The report we have just heard from our astronauts is truly amazing.

445
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:33,620
On the newly discovered planet, there exists a race of superior beings with highly advanced scientific knowledge, especially in medicine.

446
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,780
And furthermore, they have extended their hand in friendship to the people of the Earth.

447
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,580
Wow, what a terrific group.

448
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,340
Yes, you see there.

449
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,100
Way out.

450
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,600
Dr. P.

451
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:46,840
Dr. P.

452
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:46,860
Dr. P.

453
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,660
The newly discovered planet is located just beyond the body we know as Jupiter.

454
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,000
Is that correct, sir?

455
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,420
True.

456
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,040
Why wasn't it discovered before?

457
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,820
Planet X is very dark.

458
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,060
We cannot observe it with telescopes.

459
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,400
The new planet was discovered by Central Observatory while they were tracing strange radio waves.

460
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,380
Gentlemen, I can now announce to you that Planet X has been causing our recent magnetic disturbances.

461
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,560
Doctor, is there intelligent life on Planet X?

462
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,260
We can't tell yet.

463
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,680
It's possible that there is.

464
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,800
But the radio waves are not necessarily human.

465
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,740
We expect to learn a lot from Planet X.

466
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:38,020
It is our duty as Supreme Council to carefully study the proposal as set forth by Planet X and arrive at an early decision.

467
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:45,240
As physicians, my colleagues and I encourage you to agree to give consideration to this request for help.

468
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,240


469
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,260
We are looking for assistance and our reasoning is as follows.

470
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,540
We'll receive a wonder drug.

471
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,140
The organizations of women have no objection.

472
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,660
We acknowledge the sincere message of peace which was forwarded by the controller of the new planet.

473
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:03,040
It appears to me that we can learn humanity from these people as well as scientific knowledge.

474
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,140
Right, Bob?

475
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:04,660
Yeah.

476
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,480
The only thing he lacks is a little humanity.

477
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,520
Gotta look something.

478
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,960
From your remarks, it appears that we are in agreement.

479
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,240
The Council shall therefore order cooperation with the United States.

480
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,240


481
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,980
We are in agreement with Planet X.

482
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,520
Bobbie, there's nothing to be frightened of now.

483
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,020
On my planet, all of you will be free men, not locked away like animals.

484
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,720
Be free.

485
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,540
Find your own happiness.

486
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,680
I wanna go with Bob.

487
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
I wanna go to the boys club.

488
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,600
Thank you.

489
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,960
Thank you very much.

490
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
I just thought I'd have one for the road.

491
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,200
How about you, Bob?

492
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:42,840
Fair enough.

493
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,040
Oh.

494
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,400
Hey, Bob, save us a beer too, huh?

495
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,200
You'd better go now, Madge.

496
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,460
I won't go home alone.

497
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,040
Bob will take you.

498
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,000
I'll handle the whole thing.

499
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,420
Cool.

500
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,240
He's a genius.

501
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,040
A smart genius.

502
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,560
Oh, you and your shouts.

503
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,020
The never-ending frontier of the universe challenged his imagination.

504
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,320
Millions of tiny, dead, planetoid worlds like this one were merely charted and passed by

505
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,440
for the great and rich planet worlds beyond that beckoned with the promise of adventure,

506
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,220
exotic sights, and adventure.

507
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,800
New sensations.

508
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:22,360
But one man found what he was looking for upon this planetoid marked only on the charts

509
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,860
as Theta N1.

510
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,220
Barren, dead, but for a rich, single oasis of fertility where a lush and rich jungle

511
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:40,340
spawned a teeming, prowling, slithering form of life that existed to kill or be killed.

512
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,400
Well, our chances of getting out of here, even if I lock holes, are practically nil.

513
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,200
I'm not going to be able to get out of here.

514
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,780
Our only chance is to take the ship of our friends up there.

515
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,280
A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies.

516
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,300
The chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.

517
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,760
Feel the tension of unbounded lust.

518
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,940
See the trembling flesh consume itself in nights and days of uninhibited abandon.

519
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:18,300
Know the twisted passion of jaded desire.

520
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,640
Superior mutants, repent, quit your job, and slack off.

521
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,580
Are we controlled by secret forces?

522
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,180
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

523
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,680
Do people think you're strange?

524
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,020
Do you?

525
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,620
Then you may be on the right track.

526
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:53,620


527
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:53,620


528
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:53,620


529
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:59,560
Give me slack, or give me food, or kill me.

530
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,540
Give me slack, or give me food, or kill me.

531
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,900
Kill me.

532
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,300


533
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,800
Kill me.

534
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,760
Kill me.

535
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,800
Brains on!

536
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:21,620
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity for thousands of years.

537
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,780
God has been misquoted all this time.

538
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,400
Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet.

539
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,200
Jehovah is an alien.

540
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,160
Jehovah is an alien.

541
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,200
I am not immune to terror and menace.

542
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,480
I am not immune to terror and menace.

543
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,920
You can fly, you may die.

544
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,900
You can fly, you may die.

545
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,040
You can fly, you may die.

546
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,060
You can fly, you may die.

547
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,800
Brains on!

548
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,140
You may die.

549
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,900
Brains on!

550
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,140
You may die.

551
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,180
Brains on!

552
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,180
You may die.

553
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,820
Brains on!

554
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,720
You may die.

555
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,300
You might choose safety over home to live in.

556
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,500
I don't know why.

557
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:18,880
Maybe I'm too strong.

558
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,000
Hurry, the 10s come down July 5th.

559
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,220
Prayer is all we have.

560
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,500
We won't get a second chance at it.

561
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,880
Hey, Bob, say that's true, huh?

562
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,140
So what do you say, Bob?

563
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,520
What can I do?

564
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,140
Now we deserve a vacation.

565
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,680
Not you, Glenn.

566
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,480
You're flying back to Planet X.

567
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,540
What?

568
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,280
You're to be our first ambassador.

569
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,880
Whatever's fair, pal.

570
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,220
Fair enough.

571
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,080
I think not.

572
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,420
So I tried to call the police.

573
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,800
They heard the focus is to be in the field.

574
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,240
But I went out to tell the man.

575
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,500
They could be his assistant, and she didn't care.

576
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,980
I went to one of the military.

577
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,100
They said, come on, man, is this really necessary?

578
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,340
I called up the highest branch of government.

579
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,860
But they couldn't even talk.

580
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,180
Dancing with the president.

581
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,020
Mega bass.

582
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,600
Mega play.

583
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,520
Mega bass.

584
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,360
Mega bass.

585
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,200
Mega bass.

586
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,160
Mega bass.

587
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,940
Mega bass.

588
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:22,880
Mega bass.

589
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,180
Mega bass.

590
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,680
Mega bass.

591
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:27,840
Mega bass.

592
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:27,840


593
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:27,840


594
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,520
Oh, my goodness, that's a space helmet.

595
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,000
Oh.

596
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,800
Come get your luggies together now.

597
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,800
Oh, my gosh.

598
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,960
Hurry up, girl.

599
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,100
Oh, Connie, it's good to see you.

600
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,100
Oh, for crying out loud.

601
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,920
Sorry you mustn't mind me.

602
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,420
I've been up all night, all kinds of things racing through my mind.

603
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,300
It's supposed to be.

604
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,540
I was nervous just before the ceremony.

605
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,480
At least, so I'm told.

606
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,400
I'm not a bit nervous. I'm quite calm.

607
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,740
Oh, I've reasoned this whole thing out.

608
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,780
Bob mustn't make a mistake.

609
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,600
It would ruin his whole life.

610
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,640
Okay, so you win.

611
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,300
I'm going straight down this minute to get our tickets.

612
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:02,920
Tickets?

613
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,540
Oh, I have my veil!

614
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,400
Let me stand still a minute.

615
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,400
Oh, I'm so sorry.

616
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,900
I guess I'm just too excited.

617
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,100
Am I blushing?

618
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,200
Very calm.

619
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,200
Oh, I'm so sorry.

620
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,300
I should have had better sense of the fact that a cheap little punk like you carry a gun.

621
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,280
All right, get my bag. We're leaving.

622
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,140
Come on, everybody in the living room. Go ahead.

623
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,660
Are they going to be coming along with us?

624
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,020
Yes, it would be very helpful to us if we ever get lost.

625
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,700
Because they can always cheer us up.

626
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,980
Well, I sure hope that doesn't happen to us this time.

627
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,980
Only joking.

628
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,180
You're on her side now for all I've done for you.

629
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,100
Who does what have you done for me?

630
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,420
I warned you.

631
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,580
Well, I'm not exactly grateful for that.

632
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,420
I warned you.

633
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,080
We are getting just exactly what you deserve.

634
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,580
And one of the girls is a dickhole to death.

635
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,360
I hate you.

636
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,160
I hate you.

637
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,660
I hate you.

638
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,560
I hate everybody.

639
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,460
I hate everybody.

640
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,380
I hate everybody.

641
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,580
You got my heart.

642
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:53,940
Sorry.

643
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,940
Oh, you wait.

644
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,380
Someday you'll need a girlfriend.

645
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,700
And then you'll give your country to me.

646
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,540
Going down?

647
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,440
No, I'm going up.

648
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,240
The 5th of July.

649
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,780
Mr. Tang.

650
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,880
Any past minute instructions?

651
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,120
Oh, you're quick.

652
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,540
You weren't anybody who hadn't seen you come into my office.

653
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,060
Oh.

654
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,080
Oh.

655
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:12,500
Oh.

656
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,140
Yes.

657
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:13,800
Stop.

658
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,360
Who else am I talking about?

659
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,340
Relax.

660
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,680
Get the red alarm off for me.

661
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,920
There'll be KPI agents all over the place if I have to see you.

662
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,800
Perhaps, Mr. Tang.

663
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,720
I don't like this being around when the council is voting its most important decision in galaxy history.

664
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,300
Right.

665
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,320
The conspiracy has now been unmasked.

666
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,520
And we're not going to let you escape so easily.

667
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,400
But I must go.

668
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,880
It is wretched for us all.

669
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,240
But please help me.

670
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,740
Ridiculous, Mr. Tang.

671
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,780
I've ordered a red alarm for them on Mars.

672
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,260
Benedict.

673
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,240
While I'm on route.

674
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,820
Keep me informed if you get any reports on it.

675
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,380
Right.

676
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,320
You'd better get going.

677
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,680
You'll miss your takeoff for every...

678
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,160
Goodbye, Doctor.

679
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,040
Goodbye, Doctor.

680
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,280
Goodbye, Doctor.

681
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,600
They're looking for the Earthman.

682
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,320
Will you call off the rocket patrol?

683
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,700
Now, children, the idea that you behave yourselves and let the Earthman alone.

684
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,800
Look, children, why don't you play in your trailer?

685
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,280
But that's a rocket ship.

686
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:08,580
Good.

687
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,100
Why don't you fly to the moon?

688
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,040
Yeah, let's go.

689
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,460
Let's go.

690
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,020
Let's go.

691
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:32,840
Let's go.

692
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,740
Let's go.

693
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,000
Let's go.

694
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,880
Grab your hat and we'll head up in the blue.

695
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,800
In a little rocket built for two.

696
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,400
Baby, we're gonna blast off.

697
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:30,960
And before we're through, we'll leave the cares that we know on terra firma below.

698
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:35,020
While we go singing and swinging on the moon.

699
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,200
Let's go.

700
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,140
Let's go.

701
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,340
Let's go.

702
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:13,760
Let's go.

703
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,380
Have a holiday on the moon, honey.

704
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,860
How can that noisy Earth below?

705
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:30,960
And if your folks ask about our house, honey, tell Mater and Pater we live in a crater.

706
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,060
We're really gonna enjoy a life of bees.

707
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,080
Living on moonlight cocktails and green cheese.

708
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,840
Mr. and Mrs. Space Commuter.

709
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:48,620
If you please, and in a few years we might produce our own satellite.

710
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,740
While we go singing and swinging on the moon.

711
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,240
Swing on the moon.

712
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,620
Moonlight cocktail.

713
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,620
I wish on the moon.

714
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,240
Bob, rise and shine.

715
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,100
Come on.

716
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,560
Bob.

717
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,400
Come on, Bob.

718
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:05,740
Get up.

719
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,620
Bob!

720
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,760
Get up!

721
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,740
Come on!

722
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,040
Come on, it's six o'clock.

723
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,700
Rise and shine.

724
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,360
Rise and shine.

725
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,000
All aboard the master's calling from the runway.

726
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:21,580
For our leaving is almost at hand.

727
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,660
Make your way to the top of Cape Calgary.

728
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,240
For this one-way flight to glory land.

729
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:34,860
Bob.

730
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,260
Bob.

731
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,240
Bob.

732
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,880
Bob.

733
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:40,460
Bob.

734
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:40,660
Bob.

735
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:40,880
Bob.

736
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:40,880


737
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


738
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


739
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


740
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


741
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


742
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


743
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


744
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


745
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


746
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


747
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


748
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


749
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


750
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


751
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


752
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


753
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


754
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,340


755
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,660
No!

756
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:43,540
Bob.

757
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:44,900
Bob.

758
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,220
Oh.

759
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:51,180
Now this flight is for all those daily need.

760
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,800
And their pilot is Jesus God's Son.

761
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,540
And the passenger's all for it safely.

762
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:08,220
They're prepared for this heavenly run.

763
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,320
My brother, don't worry.

764
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,360
Let this flight lead without end

765
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,760
For soon all those on board will say goodbye

766
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,920
Make your way to the cold edge of Calvary

767
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,340
And confirm your reservations to the sky

768
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,200
All aboard the last crew calling from the runway

769
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,160
For our leaving is almost at hand

770
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,060
Make your way to the cold edge of Calvary

771
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,320
I want to get a size of a piece, yeah?

772
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,480
Why, how can you tell?

773
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,760
I can, I'm just guessing.

774
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,960
After all, who knows what's out there?

775
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,180
Well, we'll soon see.

776
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,640
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

777
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,600
we present the biggest star in the universe,

778
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,300
none other than Cliff Richard Jr.

779
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,500
A shooting star will shoot you

780
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,780
When Mars goes to war

781
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,140
The man in the moon will jump on you

782
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,420
If you don't love me no more

783
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,640
If you don't stop making me lose faith

784
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,960
I will have you

785
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,840
Put up there in space

786
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:44,080
So just do what I'm telling you

787
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,480
Cause I got friends

788
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,040
Baby, listen to me

789
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,300
A shooting star will shoot you

790
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,540
When Mars goes to war

791
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,900
A man in the moon will jump on you

792
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,180
If you don't love me no more

793
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,460
applause

794
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,080
applause

795
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,920
applause

796
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,140
applause

797
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,660
applause

798
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:05,660


799
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:05,760
applause

800
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,360
applause

801
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:06,360


802
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:06,360


803
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:06,920
applause

804
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:06,920


805
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:06,920


806
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:06,920


807
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:06,920


808
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:06,920


809
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:06,920


810
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:06,920


811
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,840
No one of the lads filled out the schedule of events for the day, and not one word about Susie's checking out for the Bider Week.

812
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,380
What?

813
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,380
Are you a member, sir?

814
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:15,680
No.

815
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Pardon me, sir, if you're not a member.

816
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,100
Are you a member?

817
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,220
Ah, it's part of that junk we bought from Bob.

818
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,820
Well, why don't you look in the book?

819
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,240
It doesn't say the mark.

820
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,800
Copy, Bob, we only paid two quid.

821
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,160
No, it's not listed.

822
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:33,980
Are you wrapping it?

823
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,120
Yep.

824
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,780
Seems in a far flurry, that one.

825
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,900
Then the customer seems anxious to buy.

826
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,080
I haven't much time.

827
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,140
We haven't discussed the price.

828
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,600
That'll be five pounds.

829
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,660
Five pounds?

830
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,180
Five pounds?

831
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,380
Five minutes to go.

832
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,640
Well, where are they?

833
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,220
Where did the Earthman go?

834
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,560
The Earthman?

835
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,380
Uncle George?

836
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,540
He's present again, Doctor.

837
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,800
Aren't they the ones?

838
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,920
Who hijacked the galaxy-quilliam supply last year?

839
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,720
Yes, we've been looking for them ever since.

840
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,180
Right.

841
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,300
Yes, Mr. President?

842
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,880
They were the whiffle, sir, once, just.

843
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,780
And he hung up.

844
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,920
Yeah, now the boss says it's a very bad thing for the country.

845
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,280
See, because this contract starts after the war.

846
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,300
Oh!

847
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,020
This president is a realist.

848
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,980
He deals with the fence as they are.

849
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,780
Yeah, right.

850
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,800
They'll be here.

851
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,260
Those people always keep their word.

852
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,840
You won't forget your promise, Bob.

853
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:30,640
Sure.

854
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,860
It's a joke, Doctor.

855
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,180
You're not going to let me in on it?

856
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:37,320
Aren't you going to let me in on it?

857
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,640
In on it?

858
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,320
Sure I will.

859
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,300
Sure.

860
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,400
And now, Doctor, here it is, as we promised.

861
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,720
The miracle drug which can cure all disease.

862
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,000
Not bad.

863
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,520
Not bad.

864
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:52,960
Whee!

865
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,940
It makes you feel like a two-year-old.

866
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,100
Why didn't you tell me you could make stuff like this?

867
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,060
Oh, just a little thing I whipped up when I was with the medicine show.

868
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,700
Every drunkest in New York is inquiring about Jane.

869
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,960
We start bottling it in a little bit.

870
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:03,960


871
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,280
Good morning.

872
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,620
And now, the spaceship is ready to take you back.

873
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,040
When you were here on your previous trip,

874
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,920
we recorded all the information to the smallest detail.

875
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,300
We have recreated your ship from that data.

876
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,060
It's opening.

877
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,760
I bet it is cold in there.

878
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,620
I bet there's food in there.

879
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,000
I'm saved!

880
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,360
I'm going in!

881
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:25,780
No!

882
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,080
Don't do that, sir!

883
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,100
It's dark and dirty in there!

884
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,340
Oh, but Mom!

885
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,380
It's full of bees and spiders!

886
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,860
You might poke your eye out!

887
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:33,980
Mom!

888
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,640
When did your father come home?

889
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,420
I'm going in, Mom!

890
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,300
There's a vacancy!

891
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,020
I'm going in!

892
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,800
I'm going in!

893
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,580
I'm going in!

894
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,440
Everything all set for the big party?

895
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:44,900
We're getting there.

896
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,600
I'm gone.

897
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,460
Susie here still loves the Whopper.

898
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:54,700
Man, this is one thing I really don't mind standing in line for, if you know what I mean.

899
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,880
Did you get her innuendo?

900
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,100
I've always hated that creature, the way she exploits her title and everything.

901
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,420
Girl, that woman's about as subtle as a rhinoceros horn.

902
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,120
I'm going up the backside.

903
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,740
In fact, I thought they put her in a state sanitarium.

904
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,760
They did, but they let her out.

905
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,980
Look at her record.

906
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,880
They stink!

907
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:12,640
I agree!

908
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,060
Ooh, finally, Planet X are bust for us, baby.

909
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,780
Gee, I wonder why those guards are bludgeoning Stang over there.

910
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,760
Hell, that dude has more kinks than a knotted slinky.

911
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,980
Hello, Susie!

912
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,500
Isn't this a beautiful day?

913
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,160
Oh, hey, El Diablo.

914
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,420
Ooh, great sergeant at arms uniform.

915
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,700
Especially dig the thong.

916
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,340
Are you a member?

917
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,460
Ooh, here's my subgenius membership card.

918
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:50,040
Boy, I've been hanging on to this son of a bitch for 23 years.

919
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,160
Hey, Susie.

920
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,560
Your seams are crooked.

921
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,960
I'm not wearing stockings. Those are probably just busted leg veins.

922
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,660
Oh, hi, Bob.

923
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,980
So what do you say, Bob?

924
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,360
I don't want to have anything to do with it.

925
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,900
Oh, my subgenius membership card.

926
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:23,000
Ooh, just give the great and wise a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they'll oink for more every time.

927
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,400
Oh, I'm shining.

928
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,120
Why does the sun rush to shore?

929
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:50,140
Don't they know it's the end of the world?

930
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:54,960
Cause you don't love me anymore.

931
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,460
Why do the birds

932
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,320
go on singing?

933
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,060
Why do the stars go above?

934
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:18,240
Don't they know it's the end of the world?

935
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,140
It ended when I lost your love.

936
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,580
I wake up in the morning

937
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,340
and I wonder

938
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,380
why everything's the same as it was.

939
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,340
I can't understand.

940
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,620
No, I can't understand

941
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:51,520
how life goes on the way it does.

942
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,440
Why does my heart go on beating?

943
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:05,660
Why do these eyes of mine cry?

944
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:14,520
Don't they know it's the end of the world?

945
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:19,360
It ended when you said goodbye.

946
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,560
Why does my heart go on beating?

947
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:33,680
Why do these eyes of mine cry?

948
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:43,060
Don't they know it's the end of the world?

949
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:48,720
It ended when you said goodbye.

950
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,200
Goodbye.

951
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,860
It remained for many minutes.

952
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,760
It ended when you first realized that i was failing.

953
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:18,660
Why Ä integration accepted this creation.

954
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:18,660


955
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:18,700
Why your desire came to rest you?

956
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:18,700


957
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,080
The rockets! Use the rockets!

958
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:26,680
Hello?

959
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,460
Senor Dolph told me to phone you.

960
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,160
Already gone?

961
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,260
If I were his mistress, this never could have happened.

962
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,880
We change our plans.

963
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,540
We begin the attack on Earth now.

964
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,040
Read the tape.

965
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,180
Does the tape show?

966
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,740
Red dots are decreasing.

967
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:50,880
Good.

968
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,160
Doctor?

969
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,860
We've begun broadcasting.

970
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,640
Stand by to attack.

971
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,400
Stand by.

972
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,600
Hello, and this is Crazy Chris Smith.

973
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:09,920
And welcome to another edition of Unethical Alien Abductions.

974
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:18,280
Here we are in the town of Dayton on June 15th.

975
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,040
The July.

976
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,260
1999.

977
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,700
Weird coincidence?

978
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,200
I believe not.

979
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:29,000
It's another unethical alien abduction.

980
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,460
Come on, boy.

981
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,780
Hooper, walk.

982
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,720
Come on.

983
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,580
A children and a reader.

984
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,940
The government was thinking,

985
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,000
ethical, walk in the park.

986
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,420
But for him, he did not see the future.

987
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,680
Or it was very, very unethical.

988
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:48,700


989
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:48,820
towns in the crack.

990
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:48,820


991
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,200
The state attitudes and the ways they got there.

992
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,960
But the Amendment Achievment Agency

993
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,020
said, male and female octopus tried to shoot at it.

994
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,020


995
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,020


996
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,020


997
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:10,920
Itsed for a responsive,

998
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:12,960
unethical Alaska fly-based operation.

999
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,860
Both do not eat anything.

1000
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:16,880
But even so,

1001
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:18,680
there applies this contract,

1002
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,140
We have to fight people.

1003
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,280
There's no other way.

1004
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,620
Get back here.

1005
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,640
Get back here.

1006
00:44:59,120 --> 00:44:59,940
Get back.

1007
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,960
Man, that's the door.

1008
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,900
Give me my door back.

1009
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,300
My dead car.

1010
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,320
Bunch.

1011
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:11,880
Bunch.

1012
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,880
That's enough.

1013
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,520
Another word space addiction?

1014
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:17,960
No.

1015
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,420
It's just an unethical alien objection.

1016
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,620
We've received a report that Commander has just taken off from Earth.

1017
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,160
Good.

1018
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,960
Your job is to intercept them at Planetoid Epsilon 30.

1019
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,840
This is one job I'm going to enjoy more than I expected.

1020
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,320
What do you mean?

1021
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,040
I am the controller of Planet X.

1022
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,820
To the people of the Earth.

1023
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:51,220
I command that you obey the following orders.

1024
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,220
Orders?

1025
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:59,040
You will place the Earth under our absolute control and be governed as our colony.

1026
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,260
What is it, governance as a colony?

1027
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:06,800
If you do not obey these orders willingly and immediately, we shall destroy your civilization.

1028
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,860
Double trust and think.

1029
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,640
So we stumble right into a trap.

1030
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,480
I repeat the order.

1031
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:17,060
Earth will continue to exist only as a colony of Planet X.

1032
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,700
That's a plot block.

1033
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,580
The startling announcement touched off demonstrations around the world.

1034
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,480
Some demonstrators urged capitulation, calling for peace at any price.

1035
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,260
The majority, however, seem to favor strong resistance.

1036
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,980
Opposing factions clashed violently in dozens of world capitals.

1037
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,620
And police were hard pressed to restore order.

1038
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,480
I demand the attack.

1039
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,740
Come with me if you want to live.

1040
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,360
Thank you.

1041
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,720
Thank you.

1042
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,040
Thank you.

1043
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,680
Thank you.

1044
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,280
Thank you.

1045
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,060
Thank you.

1046
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,000
course for Planet X in the Scorpion constellation. Over.

1047
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,880
Right. Good. How are you feeling? You alright?

1048
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:59,820
We would just like to get a little exercise. Well, on Planet X, you'll get

1049
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:03,920
plenty. What's this? I think it's chicken.

1050
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,600
Yeah, it doesn't taste like chicken. When you're rich, food

1051
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,960
doesn't taste like what it is. My chicken is the star of the show.

1052
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,200
Would you like some more chicken, Bob?

1053
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,780
Yeah, well, less talk and more beer, my friend.

1054
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,920
Thank you, sir.

1055
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,940
Dad, Bob broke your beer. No, I didn't. Doug broke it. It was you.

1056
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,120
Hey, Bob, save us a beer, too, huh? Right, right. Okay, Toast.

1057
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,920
The guy who got us here, our good Captain Robert.

1058
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:34,760
How do I know that?

1059
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,320
Monica found another one of these mushroom things.

1060
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,360
Hmm? And the hat's played to the airlock. Cool.

1061
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,680
That's the third one, isn't it? Howard used to call these things space barnacles.

1062
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,540
It's hard to believe he's dead.

1063
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,440
It sure will be nice to lie in some good old-fashioned Earth-type sunlight

1064
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,460
after 90 days of this. But I'm getting off at the next stop. You're not getting off at any

1065
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:05,460
stop. You're in this for keeps, and don't you forget it. Nobody's gonna walk out on

1066
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:09,000
nobody. What are you giving me, a true confession? Listen, wait a minute, seriously.

1067
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:13,200
I think I saw that guy from Planet X. Controller? Here on

1068
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:13,340
Earth?

1069
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:17,560
Yeah. In the middle of the night, I woke up and the controller was in the room.

1070
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:22,500
Ah, I think you were dreaming. That's what I thought at first. But you always

1071
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,640
know if it's a dream when you wake up. What? Well, did he say anything?

1072
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:31,380
He said that all preparations were made not to worry about anything. I wonder what he meant.

1073
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:35,020
Don't ask me. What do you think? I think maybe we're

1074
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:38,860
putting too much trust in Planet X. That's right. I don't think there's any

1075
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:43,340
doubt about it. Maybe they don't have any water up there. Maybe they figure it's time to go.

1076
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:54,640
We're only GOOD most people in the world, I unleashed the magic of –

1077
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:54,640


1078
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:54,720


1079
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:54,720


1080
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:54,720


1081
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:54,780
Ah!

1082
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,400
You just practice sitting down on the camera.

1083
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:58,860
Nonsense!

1084
00:51:59,060 --> 00:51:59,060


1085
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,820
Is he crazy?

1086
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,320
He must have.

1087
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,400
Now let's go.

1088
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:04,400


1089
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:04,820
We're not хоть touching you.

1090
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,220
Hey, listen to what we're talking about.

1091
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,380
Look, look.

1092
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,280
He puts a ogre down at his chest.

1093
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:13,300


1094
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,340
They are now on the flying side of Jupiter.

1095
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,020
Do you see anything?

1096
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,480
Check your readings.

1097
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,480
The radar thermometer is reading 15 degrees.

1098
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,640
Oh, so far from the sun, that's a high temperature.

1099
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,620
It's the universe. Nobody knows its secret.

1100
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,560
Well, we'll be landing soon.

1101
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:38,560


1102
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,180
Bob's boat was attacked here.

1103
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,660
That dang thing just sits in that area.

1104
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,180
And inside the doomed ship...

1105
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,200
Zero X to Earth.

1106
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,340
We have just touched down successfully on the surface of Mars.

1107
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:54,980
Planet X.

1108
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,140
All systems are go.

1109
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,600
We'll radio a full report to you in 30 minutes ground elapsed time.

1110
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:00,180
Click.

1111
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,660
Well, Dr. Grant, what do you think?

1112
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:05,520
My first thought is to get as many samples back to Earth as possible

1113
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,540
so that we can look into the whole question of the possibility of life

1114
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,780
existing on this planet.

1115
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,600
Sure, but what's your initial reaction?

1116
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,140
I think the atmosphere would be breathable,

1117
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,100
but too thin to sustain life as we know it.

1118
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,320
I agree with all Dr. Grant has just said,

1119
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,240
but I've always been fascinated by that phrase,

1120
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,900
life as we know it.

1121
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:31,420
I have a feeling that we may encounter life as we don't know it.

1122
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,340
Well, clearly there's life on Mars.

1123
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:33,860
Planet X.

1124
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,660
But I guess it's not life as we know it.

1125
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,840
So this is Mars.

1126
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:37,860
Planet X.

1127
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,300
You know something?

1128
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:39,940
I'm disappointed.

1129
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:40,580
What?

1130
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,520
Well, I mean I expected something different.

1131
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,400
Disappointed?

1132
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,160
All we did was come to Mars.

1133
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:46,900
Planet X.

1134
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:47,700
Disappointed.

1135
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:47,920
Yeah.

1136
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,280
No, I'm happy about it.

1137
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:49,960
Don't get me wrong.

1138
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:50,680
It's just that...

1139
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,640
Well, it's kind of strange, that's all.

1140
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,600
Nothing here.

1141
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:57,880
There's rocks.

1142
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,720
But no people.

1143
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,760
No intelligent life.

1144
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:03,740
Why not?

1145
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:04,720
That's what I'd like to know.

1146
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,660
Well, that's silly.

1147
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,300
This is Mars.

1148
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:06,880
Planet X.

1149
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,540
You can't expect to find a life like ours.

1150
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,260
Yeah, he's expecting to find the green-skinned monsters.

1151
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:11,580
You know.

1152
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:11,980
Oh, sure.

1153
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:12,940
Wait a minute.

1154
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,660
A liar coming out of the mouth.

1155
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,500
No, you don't understand me.

1156
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:17,640
Look.

1157
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,480
There's nothing.

1158
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,360
Only the barrenness and the howling wind.

1159
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,500
Lonely plane.

1160
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,080
Just nothing.

1161
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,540
I don't know.

1162
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:29,960
It's weird.

1163
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,720
Makes me feel kind of funny.

1164
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,100
Yeah.

1165
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,320
It sounds like a poor barren.

1166
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:40,700
Okay.

1167
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:41,120
Yeah.

1168
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:41,960
I tell you what.

1169
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,020
I don't think we're going to find any very large mineral deposits.

1170
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:45,440
Why?

1171
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,040
How can you tell?

1172
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,600
I can.

1173
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,320
I'm just guessing.

1174
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,540
After all, who knows what's out there?

1175
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,740
Well, we'll soon see.

1176
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,040
Look, ladies, I'm anxious to find out what's out there.

1177
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:54,840
You want to come along?

1178
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,620
You're going to stay here and dish a while, huh?

1179
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:57,660
Hey, wait a minute.

1180
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,260
Now what?

1181
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,520
My rabbit foot.

1182
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,560
I almost forgot.

1183
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,660
I feel like that superstitious scientist.

1184
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,340
Ah, it got us to Mars, didn't it?

1185
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:04,880
Planet X.

1186
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:08,540
Bart, I think the spaceship just had a little bit to do with it.

1187
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:08,540


1188
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:08,980
I don't know.

1189
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:11,760
A Martian.

1190
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,620
You guys from Planet X.

1191
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,460
Yeah, I see a Martian out there.

1192
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,160
Get away from me.

1193
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:16,640
What?

1194
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:17,360
Get away from me.

1195
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,000
There's nothing out there.

1196
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:18,400
Yeah.

1197
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,660
I can see a Martian.

1198
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,480
You guys from Planet X.

1199
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:21,440
You guys from Planet X.

1200
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,220
You guys from Planet X.

1201
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,160
Hey, there he is.

1202
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:23,860
Look out.

1203
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:24,580
Bart.

1204
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:25,880
No.

1205
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:26,680
No.

1206
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,560
Bart, put up your gun.

1207
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,500
No, get away from me, Robbie.

1208
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:30,740
We got to get him.

1209
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,040
Get to get him.

1210
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,400
Get your hands up.

1211
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,020
Bart.

1212
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:34,600
Bart.

1213
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:35,420
You're a Martian.

1214
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,260
You guys from Planet X.

1215
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:37,660
Gee.

1216
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:38,780
Oh.

1217
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:39,320
Oh.

1218
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:39,780
Oh.

1219
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,100
You shouldn't have done it, Robbie.

1220
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,420
You shouldn't have.

1221
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,720
You want to make an omelet, you got to break some eggs.

1222
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,280
Look.

1223
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,260
We welcome you.

1224
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,160
Won't you kindly seat yourselves and be comfortable?

1225
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,100
I'm controller of Planet X.

1226
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:00,720
And I've invited you here to discuss something that's very important.

1227
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,740
Discuss what?

1228
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:03,820
Where's the spaceship?

1229
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,000
Don't worry.

1230
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:05,880
It's safe.

1231
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:06,480
Sure.

1232
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:16,820
We'll be right back.

1233
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,240
Well, well.

1234
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,760
It was quicker than we expected, Crick.

1235
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,040
Yes, Rob.

1236
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,700
It was almost too easy.

1237
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,700
Such simple minds to invade.

1238
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:27,940
The little one.

1239
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,600
He suspected for a while.

1240
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,520
But fortunately, he was the weakest of the lot.

1241
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:36,080
Well, they're all gone now.

1242
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,180
Do you think war will come around?

1243
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,440
I doubt it, Frank.

1244
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,080
Come, shall we have a look at their ship?

1245
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,880
It may prove interesting.

1246
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:02,360
Rocket for the courtesy of the American Rocket Society and Reaction Motors.

1247
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:15,280
Oh, yes, Seekers, we've finally come to the end of the annual Alien X-Day show,

1248
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:20,340
which I couldn't have done without able assistance from Mel Torme,

1249
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,480
Niall Rogers, Gary Newman,

1250
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,500
oh, little dollop of Rappo,

1251
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:33,700
and big old hunks from St. Ann and Helena Handbasket from their Slogans Run CD.

1252
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,880
Good subject.

1253
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,720
Geniuses, who will be on board those pleasure saucers?

1254
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,500
And I know it for a fact.

1255
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:48,060
Oh, Seekers, this was just a simulated cautionary tale.

1256
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,820
Oh, but let it light a fire under your ass

1257
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:56,180
to do something before July 5th comes zooming down on us all.

1258
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:02,440
Oh, yes, this has to be the year that it's going to happen.

1259
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,600
And you're in luck because you've got just enough time

1260
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,620
to write for free information

1261
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:12,680
because Bob is going to cover our asses, Seekers, I'm sure of it, yes.

1262
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:17,680
So pick up that pencil and drop a last desperate line

1263
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:29,320
to the Church of the Subgenius at P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1264
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,980
Because, yes, Seekers, there is just enough time.

1265
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,200
Oh.

1266
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,020
And it's going to be this year.

1267
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:41,360
I know sooner or later Dobbs has to keep his covenant with his people.

1268
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,140
Oh, it's killing me that the first time in nine years

1269
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,620
I won't be able to make it up to Brushwood.

1270
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:53,180
But, Seekers, that doesn't mean that I'm not going to be celebrating X-Day.

1271
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:56,820
Because at 7 a.m. on the morning of July 5th,

1272
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:59,560
I am going to be out in my front yard naked,

1273
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:03,680
lying flat on my back with my eyes fixed on the horizon,

1274
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,300
waiting for that first wave.

1275
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,380
And I'm going to face raping bats to come zooming down on me.

1276
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,740
And the devil can take the hindmost because we're not going to be here.

1277
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:19,060
So go ahead and blow off your jobs and your lovers and your lives.

1278
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:26,140
And tell him Susie the floozy said to.

1279
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,740
Good night, Seekers.
