Radio Band Home

2
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,440
74.

3
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,280
What?

4
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:51,440
Is the year that they are now planning for sex on the street in every major city from coast to coast.

5
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,820
And now prepare to suffer indescribable.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,380
Torment.

7
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,580
Another Bob Hope special?

8
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,460
Worse.

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,180
Beyond these doors is an agony worse than all of us.

10
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,640
You will remain in here for eternity listening to...

11
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,320
The Soul Genius.

12
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,320
How wonderful.

13
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,340
The Soul Genius.

14
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,700
How wonderful.

15
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,060
The Soul Genius.

16
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,600
And the rose nip bubble people took him in to their own loins, didn't they?

17
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,800
Or was it more like a pork factory?

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,800
Come on, we're going to be doing a big revival this weekend.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,860
That's right, Saturday night.

20
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,260
We're talking about walking on the wild side.

21
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,040
I don't have to worry about talking about things.

22
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,920
I want to see that audience walk on the wild side.

23
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,580
How wild can we get?

24
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,220
We're up on a stage, right?

25
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,140
They're going to let you down.

26
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,220
Whatever we do is going to be kind of fake just because of that.

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,420
But what you do in the audience, well, that's real, baby.

28
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:32,000
But I'm afraid you guys, you know, you can give them your esophagus, your pork loins, your infested eyeballs.

29
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,300
You can give them everything you've got, and they're still going to sit there with one hand folded under their rump

30
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,180
and the other one waving at some person they know at the other side of the bike.

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,740
There's only one political solution.

32
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,520
I'm offering. I'm not offering, friends.

33
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,340
I'm offering.

34
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,780
Bob Lovett, the cheerful giver.

35
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,860
Let's see what's in this.

36
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,580
Okay.

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,820
It's real.

38
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,600
My God, it's a real $5 bill.

39
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,940
Praise Bob.

40
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,040
Praise Bob with a $5 bill.

41
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,380
All right.

42
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,640
Friends, we're going to bring this divine land right.

43
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
We're going to open this divine land right, friends,

44
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,600
because we're going to take this symbol of the conspiracies hold over you,

45
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
and we're going to burn this motherfucker on Mother's Day.

46
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,920
Yeah, it's on Mother's Day, friends.

47
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,040
And as the smoke that just climbs on a bill rises up to heaven,

48
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,160
the aliens know that there's still something down here worth saving.

49
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,140
That's great.

50
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,460
It starts with a handshake.

51
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,640
Exits UFO's outer space.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,860
J.R. Dobbs is not afraid.

53
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,620
He is the eye of a hurricane.

54
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,340
Watch your money.

55
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:52,600


56
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,060
Pink, serve their own needs.

57
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,240
Yeti, serve your own needs.

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,260
Feeding on a purse with workday strength.

59
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,740
End times are close at hand.

60
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,820
Uber woman, over man.

61
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,900
Liar in a fire representing all we hate.

62
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,120
With a government for hire and a combat site.

63
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,320
The best is left of genie in a hurry with a con breathing down their neck.

64
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,240
Group by group, normals falsified, full of farts.

65
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,360
Look at that love playing.

66
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,080
Fine.

67
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,420
Then.

68
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,820
Oh, oh, oh, no.

69
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,040
Population, they don't know.

70
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,140
Save yourself, serve yourself.

71
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,440
Pink, serve their own need.

72
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,580
Yeti, serve your own need.

73
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,720
Time to plunge your own seed.

74
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,180
Yeti with a rupture in the rubber.

75
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,940
And the right wing super slack maniac.

76
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,320
Slammed by bright light.

77
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,800
Feeling pretty psyched.

78
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,900
It's the end of the world as we know it.

79
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,580
It's the end of the world as we know it.

80
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,060
It's the end of the world as we know it.

81
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,240
The ball feels fine.

82
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,420
July 5th, X-Day.

83
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,580
Cluster chefs are on their way.

84
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,220
Quit your job.

85
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:49,720
Keep your slack.

86
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,880
Jared, I've got your back.

87
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,440
Hail Connie.

88
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,040
Hail Bob.

89
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,200
On your knees, self-righteous mob.

90
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,800
Give it up.

91
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,400
Give it in.

92
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,480
Find yourself a Yeti kid.

93
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,420
New religion radio.

94
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,040
Help.

95
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,300
Hope.

96
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:57,800
Gonna blow.

97
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,000
Pay to find out what you know.

98
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,540
Pass the pipe.

99
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,160
Take a trick.

100
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,340
I'm telling you, this is my joke.

101
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,420
Spirits see, steer clear.

102
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,080
Turn them in.

103
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,680
Turn them in.

104
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,260
Turn them in.

105
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:04,500
I'm gonna lie.

106
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,920
Offer me solutions and you offer me alternatives.

107
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,140
And I decline.

108
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,560
It's the end of the world as we know it.

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,180
It's the end of the world as we know it.

110
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,800
It's the end of the world as we know it.

111
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,220
But I feel fine.

112
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,400
It's the end of the world.

113
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,040
It's the end of the world.

114
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,720
It's the end of the world.

115
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,340
It's the end of the world.

116
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,160
It's the end of the world.

117
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,380
The end of the world as we know it

118
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,060
It's the end of the world as we know it

119
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,500
It's the end of the world as we know it

120
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,720
And Bob feels fine

121
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,880
The other and other, chunch on Mars

122
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,040
Immortals living, fiend bars

123
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,460
Yeti driving, fast cars bang

124
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,440
Reverend Ivan stank

125
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,560
Jesus Christ and Princess Wee

126
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,680
Smoking, frobbing, so do we

127
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,900
Reverend Susie, such a floozy

128
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,780
Dr. Pesoff stank

129
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,160
And one more time, I know you can

130
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,360
Antichristian, Reverend Geo

131
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,240
Doctor's getting right

132
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,720
Right!

133
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,660
It's the end of the world as we know it

134
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,120
And Bob feels fine

135
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,400
It's the end of the world as we know it

136
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,840
It's the end of the world as we know it

137
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,740
And Bob feels fine

138
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,940
It's the end of the world as we know it

139
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,600
It's the end of the world as we know it

140
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,040
It's the end of the world as we know it

141
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,160
And Bob feels fine

142
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,340
Unbelievable, dear friends.

143
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,840
This is Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket.

144
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:56,340
From their new CD, friends, Saint Anne and Helena did that live, actually, at the Euclid Tavern DeVival here in Cleveland on May 12th,

145
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:04,240
from which we brought home many excellent recordings, especially of Einstein's Secret Orchestra, friends.

146
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,640
So this is going to be an ESO and Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket show.

147
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,680
And wait until you hear the song I'll play later, The Ultimate Bob.

148
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,340
The ultimate Bobby song.

149
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:25,640
Friends, if you need more information about Saint Anne CDs and so forth, check out the website of Ministry of Truth.

150
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:37,420
That's minitru.org, spelled M-I-N-I-T-R-U, no E, minitru.org, friends.

151
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,260
But now, back to that actual DeVival in progress, friends.

152
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,820
Imagine the huge carved poster.

153
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,420
The pulpit made by Ed Strange.

154
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,940
And the giant dog's head painted by Jesus.

155
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,820
And the strange odours of the spice in the air.

156
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,880
Ah, yes, back to that actual DeVival in progress now.

157
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:09,740
There were times when I thought about it, but I wondered if maybe the bands in some genius DeVivals were the kind that only I liked.

158
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,960
But the Free Times had a music poll.

159
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,820
They were where everybody in Cleveland could go.

160
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,200
On what they thought the best bands were.

161
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,800
And you know who the best god damn instrumental electronic band in the world was?

162
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,220
In all of Cleveland?

163
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,360
It's Einstein's Secret Dumbstand Organ.

164
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,760
Einstein's Secret Organ.

165
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,740
Playing the song, Helmets.

166
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,960
Oh.

167
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,880
Oh.

168
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,040
Oh.

169
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,520
Oh.

170
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:37,720


171
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,160
Oh.

172
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,840
Oh.

173
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,120
Oh.

174
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,540
Do what you want!

175
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:05,020
We don't try to introduce yourself, we already know your name

176
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,860
We can follow you around and see your mind

177
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,720
Don't worry you're not enslaimed

178
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,040
People gone, people gone

179
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,820
Lost in the dumpsters of life

180
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,200
One damn thing is for sure tonight

181
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,360
My daughter's gonna do you right

182
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,140
We only wanna fuck you

183
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,300
Broken is my head

184
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,820
But what's loving you

185
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,200
Nature's hiding

186
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,840
On your head

187
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,880
Please don't try to introduce yourself

188
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,080
I already know your name

189
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,500
I've written all of you shit to your life

190
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,000
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you

191
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,300
Please don't try to understand

192
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,440
Your mind is much too late

193
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,880
Cause never an island slayers coming along

194
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,320
It wants to fuck with your brain

195
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,960
These beaches of the edge of the island

196
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,660
What's troubling you?

197
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,460
Nature's hiding

198
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,620
Let's do it now

199
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,080
We gonna fuck you

200
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,940
Cotton Barack

201
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,980
Here's a shot from thejs

202
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,340
So I'll give you mine

203
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:26,340


204
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:26,820
wit' me

205
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,500
Go on

206
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,740
But it's only real

207
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,780
Than you feel

208
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,840
I said, I'll give you mine

209
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,580
When it's time I'll give you mine

210
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,200
You better think about it

211
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,240
Thought you could stop

212
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,560
If you're a wild cock

213
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,060
Like a little cock

214
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,820
And you close the door

215
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,080
When you know that he's gonna fuck you

216
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,280
Get out pretty quick ним

217
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,840
Oh, yes, my girl

218
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,200
What's up in you?

219
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,940
Here's the nature of my day

220
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,200
Oh, yes, my girl

221
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,460
Oh, yes, my girl

222
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,260
Oh, yes, my girl

223
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:10,260
Oh, yes, my girl

224
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:20,020
Oh, yes, my girl

225
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,900
Oh, yes, my girl

226
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:56,220
What's up in you?

227
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,100
Here's the nature of my day

228
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,300
Waste ball

229
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,780
Waste ball

230
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,060
Waste ball

231
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,360
Waste ball

232
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,260
Waste ball

233
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,120
Einstein's Secret Orchestra!

234
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:16,180
We'll be back with a whole set of music for you, right after this man is done filling her head with evil thoughts.

235
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,980
Listen, people.

236
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,180
With no spiritual foundation on you.

237
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,920
I've got a secret I feel compelled to.

238
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Come out and tell.

239
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,140
Dave, what do you have to tell them?

240
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,180
I'm so sorry for the last seven months.

241
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:48,660
I know things haven't been good with King Rupert in charge of the material universe and all the punishment.

242
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,960
It's time to tell them, Dave.

243
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,600
You mean about me actually being Satan?

244
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,920
After all these years, tonight's the night.

245
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,300
I'm going to come out of the closet tonight.

246
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,920
I'm a celibate heterosexual.

247
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,080
Oh, I thought you were going to say you were Satan, and I was surprised at that.

248
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,900
Oh, you thought?

249
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,020
No, I didn't think you were Satan.

250
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:20,340
I thought you were like the least likely suspect for Satanism of anybody I could think of.

251
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,940
You mean non-Satanism.

252
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,860
You'd be a crappy Satan.

253
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,600
Satan-hood.

254
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,980
You wouldn't be a very good Satanist or a very good Satan.

255
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,040
By whose standards, Dane?

256
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,280
Well, by the standards of any cruel, hate-filled...

257
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:39,800
Of any Christian, right-minded, right-thinking individual with a pair of blue pants and a pair of buttocks that stick out as far as...

258
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:39,820
That's true.

259
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,080
It may be from their point of view, Satan is an evil being.

260
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,160
But whereas, actually, Lucifer, the bringer of light...

261
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,120
Oh, not in our relationship.

262
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,180
...might be looked at as the...

263
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,320
The pitiful fool who had his liver eaten out like Prometheus.

264
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,900
Well, the idiot.

265
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,860
The light bringer.

266
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,320
Who gave the monkeys the instruction book, and look what happened.

267
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,060
No, I'm not shaking.

268
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,520
I don't know where that was going, but it didn't go very far.

269
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,340
No, I...

270
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,520
I hope not, anyway, you know, because that would be terrible, wouldn't it?

271
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,360
If you woke up and...

272
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,140
You thought you were the least likely candidate.

273
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah.

274
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,200
Chaz is considering the idea right now.

275
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,780
He thought he was the least likely candidate, but he's wondering, like, hmm...

276
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,980
I can see how Chaz could be Satan.

277
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,760
A form of Satan.

278
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,640
Yeah, some kind of a Satan, because he's a rock and roll...

279
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,020
No, it's because you're hallucinating the star on the back of his shirt.

280
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,840
I've been to the crossroads.

281
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,560
Yeah, he's been to the crossroads.

282
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,200
Oh, you made your deal, huh?

283
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,160
He jumps around in rock and roll shows.

284
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,080
I want nimble fingers, Lord Satan.

285
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,920
I want nimble fingers, and it looks like Elvis and Arthur and Morrison.

286
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,660
Yes, and I want a brain that's much bigger than the brain I have right now.

287
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,180
I want a 356-pound brain, a pound for each day of the week.

288
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,980
I hear you. I hear you.

289
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:04,940
But, you know, Dave, no offense, but even after hearing you sing Sympathy for the Devil, I still...

290
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,140
You kind of wanted to go to a convent or a cloister or something and be by yourself,

291
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,260
and contemplate the Lord.

292
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,460
I didn't feel real delivered by Satan.

293
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,400
I didn't feel satanic.

294
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,020
I didn't feel, you know, it's like, yeah, I already know your name.

295
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,420
I thought you felt like old schmuck Jehovah One was still in charge,

296
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,660
and you were disappointed that Chaz and I could not raise the devil that night,

297
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,100
like we tried at the crossroads.

298
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,240
Yeah, I was hoping for a change, man.

299
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,960
It's just been Bob and Jehovah One and Jesus and all them.

300
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,080
The spirit of Robert Johnson did take over Johnny for a short while there,

301
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,540
during the lead solo of the song.

302
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,580
You think so?

303
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,760
I think that he probably felt like...

304
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,700
He was funky. He did a great job, I must say.

305
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,960
I was very impressed.

306
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,220
Both Sympathy for the Devil and Bang-a-Gong, Petkovic did a great job.

307
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,200
Especially for a man who, you know, spends much...

308
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,020
The whole band did, dressing like a woman.

309
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,460
Michelle's solos were kickin' butt.

310
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,440
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,040
Everything was kickin' butt.

312
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,560
And my guitar was kickin' butt, too.

313
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,500
Except Dave's butt and my foot.

314
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,240
Yeah, Dave's butt.

315
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,020
My foot wasn't...

316
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,200
Dave's butt was not being kicked.

317
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,720
My foot was coming out of your butt in the form of a little notchy goose step.

318
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,100
Right, Dave's butt was kind of more like almost kickin' my feet.

319
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,740
It was just one of those back-ass words things.

320
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,980
The Peckerwoods used to gather down by the river there,

321
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,020
start a little fire and drink some Jack Daniels.

322
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,020
And they shaved their legs.

323
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,560
One by one, each and every one of them.

324
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,960
Each and every man would take out first a left calf,

325
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,480
and then shave it as smooth as a baby's ass.

326
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,760
Then the right one.

327
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,020
But they do the knees last.

328
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,240
They do the knees very last.

329
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,660
Because that was the erotic part.

330
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,680
And then their brand-new militia suits.

331
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,340
Their beautiful camo jackets and their PX-763-49s and guns.

332
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,040
Oh, I can't remember those catalog numbers.

333
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,640
I just know they looked real good.

334
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,680
The guns, oh, man.

335
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,900
I had a gun, Gazzy.

336
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,300
It got blue and steely.

337
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,060
The red, white, and blue of somebody's idea of it.

338
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,120


339
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,880
Steely-eyed.

340
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,400
The, uh, rocket man.

341
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,760
The blue steel.

342
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,340
That's what got you going, wasn't it?

343
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:13,780
Yeah.

344
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,400
Yeah.

345
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,320
Steely-eyed rocket man.

346
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,800
And the grease on the blue.

347
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,420
The gun down the barrel.

348
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,740
The gun grease.

349
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,620
The gun grease in the barrel.

350
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,760
The gun grease.

351
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,660
The gun grease in the barrel.

352
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,800
The gun grease.

353
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,780
The gun grease.

354
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:26,980
The gun grease.

355
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,780
The gun grease.

356
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,880
Better hurry up, Abner.

357
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,720
Sweep a little faster.

358
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,640
Mr. Dobbs will be here any minute now.

359
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,960
Doggy's Lama already swept the store out twice this morning.

360
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,840
Ain't nothing more.

361
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,640
They're sweep out.

362
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,900
Well, we want the place to look nice and clean for Mr. Dobbs.

363
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,760
We want to make a good impression on him.

364
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,480
Yeah, I know.

365
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,840
Hurry up and get that done,

366
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,700
then put a couple more chairs around the table in the library there.

367
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,380
Chairs?

368
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,820
What do you want them for?

369
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,800
I suppose we can all sit around the table

370
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,240
and have a regular business meeting.

371
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:54,860
Oh.

372
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,240
Board of director stuff.

373
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,200
Uh-huh.

374
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,920
Then I'm going to run this right

375
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,660
and show Mr. Dobbs I'm a big executive and all that stuff.

376
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,160
Well?

377
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,860
Uh, Mouse here, you done drawing the drawings?

378
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:05,960
Yes, sir.

379
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,940
The plans are all ready to show Mr. Dobbs.

380
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,740
Mr. Dobbs, Lama.

381
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,140
Well, good.

382
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,200
Hurry up, Abner.

383
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,260
Get them chairs put around.

384
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,680
I'm getting to it.

385
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,880
Doggy's, I don't see why we got to make such a fuss

386
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,500
over this Mr. Dobbs fella.

387
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,000
Abner, don't you understand?

388
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,280
He's a big, famous building contractor

389
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,100
and he's donating his services

390
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,520
just to help us build a wonderful world of park mans.

391
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,120
So the least we can do is to be nice to him

392
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,380
and cooperate with him.

393
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,940
I say put that big chair at the end there.

394
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,160
That's where I'll sit.

395
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,080
Uh-huh.

396
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,940
Lama, you sure that this just ain't a big deal?

397
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:37,940


398
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:37,940


399
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:37,940


400
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,460
It ain't some trick of Squire's

401
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,040
to get that $10,000 away from us?

402
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,100
Oh, of course not.

403
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:43,780
That's ridiculous.

404
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,380
You're just suspicious, Abner.

405
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,140
I am.

406
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,440
This Dobbs wouldn't get himself mixed up

407
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,980
in some such a scheme as that.

408
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
Well, I hope not.

409
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,640
Don't forget, he's a rich retard fella.

410
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,900
Why, he built the Empire State Building.

411
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,660
Don't forget that.

412
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,720
Yeah, but I've been thinking about

413
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,760
what Squire said about us having to

414
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,880
turn the money over to Mr. Dobbs.

415
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,940
That don't sound exactly right to me.

416
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,700
Well, that's just a usual.

417
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,120
Business customer, Abner.

418
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,820
Yes, huh?

419
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,360
Now, don't forget, Abner.

420
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,020
I want both you and Mousy to try to act dignified.

421
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,420
Sort of keep an eye on Mr. Dobbs

422
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,400
and try to be like him.

423
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,600
Oh, well, don't worry.

424
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,640
Mind out, mind out.

425
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,200
Here they come.

426
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,440
Well, howdy, Squire.

427
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,240
Come on in.

428
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,180
Yes, yes.

429
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,120
Thank you.

430
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,080
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

431
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,500
Well, I want you to meet my good friend

432
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,080
and old school chum,

433
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,900
Gregory W. W. Dobbs.

434
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,560
Uh, Mr. Dobbs, this is Mr. Edwards here.

435
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,940
How do you do, Mr. Dobbs?

436
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:37,940


437
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:37,940


438
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,040
Good job.

439
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,860
Well, well, glad to know you.

440
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,140
Glad to know you, glad to know you.

441
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,260
And this is Mr. Peabody.

442
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,260
Yeah, Peabody.

443
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,060
Glad to know you.

444
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,800
Howdy, Mr. Dobbs.

445
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,000
Oh, yes, now.

446
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,740
And this is...

447
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,280
Who is this fair young god

448
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,880
coming to the house up there?

449
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:26,240
Is that you, now, Doctor Pooh?

450
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,240


451
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,240


452
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,240


453
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,340
Yes, it is you, Mr. Dobbs.

454
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:27,780
Right.

455
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,080
Oh, yeah.

456
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


457
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,200
My name is Chopper.

458
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,180
Your name's Dobbs, notOL.

459
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,260
I'm your host at the Goistor.

460
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:33,340
See you next time!

461
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:33,340


462
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:33,820
Bye!

463
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:33,820


464
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,800
I'm the god of hellfire.

465
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,640
I got a bullfire.

466
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,420
Deep 13 by Lamprey Systems.

467
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,020
Actually, that's excerpts from Deep 13.

468
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:10,480
Deep 13. Lamprey Systems posted that on alt.binaries.slack.

469
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,500
And in fact, this background music is also by Lamprey Systems.

470
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,240
Their previous CD, Electroshock Treatment.

471
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:34,000
And friends, we heard, of course, some WCSB Cleveland ESO Swamp Radio live with yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, producer and show commander Chaz and lonesome cowboy Dave.

472
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,000
In fact, let's hear it.

473
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:40,160
Let's hear their band live, dear friends, live at the Euclid Tavern, the Bible.

474
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:49,180
Some people believe that sex, sex, sex can kill the dog.

475
00:25:50,600 --> 00:26:02,760
They know better, better things can kill the dog than a bumping, jumping table or a slamming bed and strange noises at three o'clock in Eurythra.

476
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,000
It's true.

477
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:13,400
It's time for mom and dad to come back home and make me Peter's money and challenge them, which is the way it always has been.

478
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:13,760
Ha, ha, ha.

479
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,300
Oh, my God.

480
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,000
Oh, my God.

481
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:23,920
Oh.

482
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:24,280
Oh.

483
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:25,340


484
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:25,400


485
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:25,520


486
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:25,800
Oh.

487
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:25,800


488
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:25,820
Oh.

489
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,760
Oh.

490
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:27,900
Oh.

491
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:28,960
Oh.

492
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,280
Oh.

493
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,740
Oh.

494
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:29,740


495
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:29,740


496
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:29,740


497
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,500
Oh.

498
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,480
Oh.

499
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:02,220
I don't deserve to die

500
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,500
I don't deserve this abuse

501
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,620
So please just stay a while

502
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,880
We're gonna break our shield

503
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,160
We're gonna break our shield

504
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,300
We're gonna break our shield

505
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,320
We're gonna break our shield

506
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,720
We're gonna break our shield

507
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,480
We're gonna break our shield

508
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,780
We're gonna break our shield

509
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,320
I'm too late, too wild

510
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,420
I'm standing in white light

511
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,460
I had no clue to see me through

512
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,680
So please just stay for the night

513
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,200
We're gonna break our shield

514
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,840
We're gonna break our shield

515
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,000
We're gonna break our shield

516
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,980
We're gonna break our shield

517
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,140
We're gonna break our shield

518
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:29,200
Yes, Dr. Forskin

519
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,820
Now I'm off in even heaven

520
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,260
And I am lost

521
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,780
I was working the graveyard shift

522
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,180
late one Sunday night

523
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,800
Keeping a close eye on the backbeat

524
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Making sure everything was uptight

525
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,140
I was keeping a close eye on the former 09

526
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,880
Making sure those trains never ran on time

527
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,400
I looked off in the distance and what did I see?

528
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,900
Looked like one solitary headlight coming after me

529
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,960
Come and take me away

530
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,580
One solitary headlight

531
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,000
Come and take me away

532
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Come and take me away

533
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,120
Come and take me away

534
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,180
Come and take me away

535
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,180


536
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,180


537
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,240
What can you break our shield?

538
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,320
What can you break our shield?

539
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,220
What can you bring on shield?

540
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,260
What can you break our shield?

541
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,260
Oh, great angel, you don't know

542
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:12,580
The hand that holds you up is the hand that holds you down

543
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,580
Holds you down

544
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:19,220
The hand that lifts you is the hand that holds you

545
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:48,740
What can a grave do you have blind to know in heaven?

546
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,980
Into Bob's eyes

547
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,200
Make them see the way the pipe

548
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,940
Hovers just outside the deep

549
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,960
Make them look

550
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,740
And they will see

551
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:20,080
They will finally see

552
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,720
They will finally see

553
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,340
Is it all a lie?

554
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,500
I thought of all the books

555
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,580
And papers that I'd read

556
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,660
I thought of Arnold Palmer

557
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,780
And his bleeding head

558
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,060
I thought of all my brethren

559
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,160
And rants that they'd shared

560
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,340
I thought of all these things

561
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,440
And wondered if I cared

562
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,620
I pondered for a while

563
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,740
I pondered through the night

564
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,780
By the next morning

565
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,040
I decided they were right

566
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,460
We got France elections in a white array

567
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:44,720
We got France elections in a white array

568
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,640
Chaine de Beauvau, Pauvou, Manger

569
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,920
Ring in the news cause I'm country Mike

570
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,060
Use a microphone like Shazam, use tight

571
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,100
The party people scream

572
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,160
Ring, ring, sing, ring

573
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,340
Cause I got a remote for my big day

574
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,560
Ring in the news cause I'm country Mike

575
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,280
I felt so relieved

576
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,460
It really was a rush

577
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,680
I am so happy

578
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,740
That I'm a subgenius

579
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,960
Tired of playing normal

580
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,080
And following the herd

581
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,220
I awoke the next day

582
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:14,700
To see the world

583
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,260
To go and spread the word

584
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,680
The people that I talked to

585
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,480
They acted all afraid

586
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,880
They won't even listen

587
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,840
Unless they're getting paid

588
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,240
I really do hate them

589
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,120
These things of which I speak

590
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,280
They pointed and they laughed

591
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,460
They said I was a freak

592
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,540
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak

593
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,520
Tick-tock, so socialized

594
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,580
Open up your ears and clean out your heart

595
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,640
Who in the world do you want to fight?

596
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,680
It's against the system we should unite

597
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,960
Fight, fight, fight, fight

598
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,980
Fight, fight, fight, fight

599
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,780
Now I sit here thinking

600
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,840
Of everything I've said

601
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,060
I really am a Bobby

602
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,100
My face is turning red

603
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,280
I thought I was finished

604
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,520
I wondered what to do

605
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,040
Ready to give it up

606
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,700
I didn't have a clue

607
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,320
Then it all came to me

608
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,000
I really should have known

609
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,400
There are so many like me

610
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,700
I really should have known

611
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,120
I'm really not alone

612
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,680
I found others like me

613
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,560
With whom I could converse

614
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,940
One day the subgenius

615
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,520
Will rule this universe

616
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,020
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak

617
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,100
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak

618
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,700
Yes, I am a Bobby

619
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,720
I don't care if it's true

620
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,940
Yes, I am a Bobby

621
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,940
There's nothing you can do

622
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,360
I don't care if you like me

623
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:44,700
I don't care if you like me

624
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,220
It means nothing to me

625
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,880
Bobbies are here to stay

626
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,520
And someday you will see

627
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,680
I spent my thirty bucks

628
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,880
I've got my minister's card

629
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,900
I'm a deep pay member

630
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,160
And it wasn't all that hard

631
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,400
I'll start my own ministry

632
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,420
And it will be the first

633
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,020
Bobbies are not so bad

634
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,780
We really are not cursed

635
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,080
Subgenius

636
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,300
Subgenius

637
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,400
Subgenius

638
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,700
Subgenius

639
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,480
Subgenius

640
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,440
So now you know my story

641
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,600
There's nothing I've left out

642
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,720
I try to tell the truth

643
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,740
Of what it's all about

644
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,080
Yes, I am a Bobby

645
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,060
And proud to say it so

646
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,320
Yes, I am a Bobby

647
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,440
And a slack-billed dynamo

648
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,620
I am a true Yeti

649
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,700
And yes, it makes me proud

650
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,100
I am a subgenius

651
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,940
And I'll say it out loud

652
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,120
I don't care much for paint

653
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,260
And the things that they say

654
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,660
The church of the subgenius

655
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,600
Will soon have its day

656
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,580
With the

657
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:44,100
They'll say goodbye

658
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,500
saying

659
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,460
every day

660
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,260
he'd run

661
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:17,860
to the

662
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,680
water

663
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,800
from the

664
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,340
busy

665
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:20,900
street

666
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,480
he

667
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:33,920
said

668
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,100
a word

669
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,500
but

670
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,240
everybody

671
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,160
heard

672
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,140
there was

673
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,720
something

674
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,600
in his

675
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,000
face

676
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
only

677
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,560
in his

678
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:43,920
good

679
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,400
mind

680
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,000
he

681
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,460
drank

682
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,280
his

683
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,840
morning

684
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,580
coffee

685
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,580
he

686
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:06,920
got

687
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,100
the

688
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,660
oil

689
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,280
from

690
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,660
his

691
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:08,980
chin

692
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,560
he

693
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,140
handled

694
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,260
his

695
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,920
newcomer

696
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,000
at

697
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,600
the

698
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:29,600


699
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,040
but

700
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:30,820
he

701
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,560
said

702
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,200
he

703
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,700
told

704
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:39,720
the

705
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,020
truth

706
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,720
and

707
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,100
he

708
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,480
called

709
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:42,560
his

710
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:42,940
very

711
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,580
I hate you!

712
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,440
Oh, that's a good question.

713
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,060
Why don't I answer it for you?

714
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,600
One, two, three, four!

715
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,260
How did you know?

716
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,660
How did you know?

717
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,200
How did you know?

718
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,600
How did you know?

719
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,980
Once I had a son of that

720
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,820
I let them starve to death

721
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,760
It was a funny little monkey

722
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,840
And a big white Easter bunny

723
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,680
And that man had a few ages

724
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,580
And sometimes it raged

725
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,980
I turned them upside down

726
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I dragged my monkey all around

727
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,080
I dragged my monkey all around

728
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,160
I dragged my monkey all around

729
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,120
I dragged my monkey all around

730
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,500
I dragged my monkey all around

731
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,860
That's some serious funky dragging for those of you who care to drag that funky around.

732
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,880
For those of you who'd like to drag something drier around.

733
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:41,120
Lately I've been reading the kind of magazines that normal people read.

734
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,960
Princess Wee was bringing them home from work.

735
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,100
Magazines such as this!

736
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,360
W!

737
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:55,220
Or perhaps some of you have seen a magazine for men called GQ.

738
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,820
Gentleman's Portrait.

739
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:05,680
Magazines for those who want, who actually want to be more normal.

740
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,420
Who in fact want to be more normal than normal.

741
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,100
More normal.

742
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:11,100


743
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:11,100


744
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,340
More normal than normal.

745
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,520
That's their motto.

746
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,460
Just think of that, friends.

747
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:23,060
And I guess I've been hiding in my little styrofoam tower or my adobe tower for a little too long.

748
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,440
Because I had not realized how bad it has gotten.

749
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,260
As I perused these magazines, I was shocked.

750
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,900
I was absolutely appalled.

751
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:40,100
I was shedding my britches in horror at the intense.

752
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,840
The pinkness.

753
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,500
The pinkness.

754
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,580
The pinkness of this shit.

755
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,140
It's gotten worse than I ever imagined.

756
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,940
These huge ads.

757
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,900
This luscious photography.

758
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,400
These highly paid writers.

759
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:59,980
And it's all an intense celebration of total pinkness.

760
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,340
This is the most cowardly waste of fucking goddamn money I've ever seen in my life.

761
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,660
And I would love to burn it, but it's too goddamn big.

762
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,660
And I would love to burn it, but it's too goddamn big.

763
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:13,660


764
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,260
They are proud to be that fucking normal.

765
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,260
They are proud to be trying to be just like each other.

766
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,140
Luxuriantly pink, friends.

767
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:29,460
My God, the trouble they go to just to be upper normal.

768
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,440
And my friends, when I look at that magazine, and I look at that GQ,

769
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,020
I am so goddamn glad.

770
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,180
To be a weirdo.

771
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:51,040
And I am so fucking thankful to the slack of Bob Dobbs and the retardation of my poor overmind.

772
00:42:51,260 --> 00:43:01,060
That I am a scruffy, unkempt, funny looking, always a bad hair day, out of fashion, jalopy driving weirdo.

773
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,560
And you subgeniuses realize how lucky we are.

774
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,940
How rich we are.

775
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,660
To truly not care if we look rich.

776
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,820
We are so rich, we don't care if we look rich.

777
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:24,220
To not actually give that much of a shit how we look.

778
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,940
That is riches, my friends.

779
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:33,500
Imagine having to go to all the trouble these normals do just to feel valid.

780
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:39,440
All the skin treatments, the expensive clothing brands, expensive cars,

781
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,600
and all those gizmos with lights all over them.

782
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,640
That make it easier for their boss to control them.

783
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,100
Look, you can get email from your boss while you're at the beach.

784
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,000
Or look how free you are.

785
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,220
You're so free that you can get a call from the boss while you're out on the fucking golf course.

786
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:06,600
Friends, just try to keep up with what's cool alone.

787
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,320
Is enough to drive people mad?

788
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:16,440
And I guess the pink is a lot harder to drive mad because they're so much more numb.

789
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,860
Well friends, I'd rather be dumb than numb any day.

790
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,500
To paraphrase Bob.

791
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:31,440
I am living proof that you can be an utter failure and a complete dumbass in the pink world

792
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,800
and still be way better off than any of them.

793
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,340
Praise fucking Bob.

794
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,080
Because I'm rich and slack.

795
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,340
Slack.

796
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:38,920
Slack.

797
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,240
Deep slack.

798
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:48,000
Now friends, I've got more kinds of Bob t-shirts than anybody else in the world.

799
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,980
But that's not why I'm rich and slack.

800
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:57,580
I've got the sexiest space princess known in all the galaxies of Tarnasia for a girlfriend and fiance.

801
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,480
That's enough slack to kill ten elephants and last a man a lifetime.

802
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:04,120
But that's not the kind of slack I'm talking about.

803
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,060
The kind of slack I mean is the slack that I'm talking about.

804
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:11,300
The kind of slack that I'm talking about is the lack of really not caring if I'm not famous,

805
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:19,440
not rich, not cool, not powerful, and not a GQ kind of guy in any way, shape, or form.

806
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:28,040
Now friends, maybe I had to go through the chasing the gold ring and finally given up

807
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:36,440
on those things of false slack in order to finally be able to distinguish the non-things

808
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,280
that bring me real slack.

809
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:44,500
And the real slack is the slack of not being able to produce the hour of slack.

810
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:51,480
But the slack of being able to appreciate what's played on the hour of slack radio show.

811
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:56,920
The slack of being able to appreciate, period.

812
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,360
That is where the slack comes in.

813
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:06,420
The slack of glimpsing, occasionally, how fucking incredible even the most money-making

814
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,400
mundane, poverty-stricken, subgenius life is.

815
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,960
Every minute that you've got a full belly and enough sleep.

816
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:20,920
Friends, I guess in short you could call it the slack of finally being in a good mood for a change.

817
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:30,140
Now there's a long stretch there where, like many of you, I was not in that good of a mood.

818
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,140
But things change.

819
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,120
You know, if you're in a bag,

820
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,520
if you're in a bag,

821
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,200
move!

822
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,960
You know, if you're tied up,

823
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:40,640
move!

824
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,420
Get the fuck out, you know?

825
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,300
Repent!

826
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,080
Quit your job and slack off.

827
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,480
The worst thing that can happen is you might get a better job.

828
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:55,140
But friends, goddammit, I must say, right here in front of everybody,

829
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,540
the Yaka Tisma could come tomorrow and kill me and I'd have no regrets,

830
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,580
aside from missing out on the next day in eternal life,

831
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,080
because I got to see the Eiffel Tower.

832
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,300
And, uh, uh,

833
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,300
Mardi Gras,

834
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,280
a Jimi Hendrix concert,

835
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,940
five X-Days,

836
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,820
a Bernie Man in Starwood,

837
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,400
and friends, my cup runneth over, goddammit!

838
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:21,860
Or,

839
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,060
maybe it's even simpler than that, my friend.

840
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:33,980
Maybe it's just that I finally, finally, finally got over the feeling that I would never ever have a girlfriend.

841
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,100
Which is kind of weird, because I've had a girlfriend of some kind since I was 19.

842
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,460
But I think even those of you who, uh,

843
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:50,900
have a boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever person of the desired sex or creature,

844
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,260
you still know what I mean, I bet.

845
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,640
Because, uh,

846
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,520
well, even if it's basically hallucinatory,

847
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,400
it's an all too common feeling amongst such geniuses.

848
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,920
Loneliness is.

849
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,800
Uh, it's real hard to shake.

850
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,580
And it's not just funny-looking little guys,

851
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,720
or, you know, like me, or fat ugly guys or whatever,

852
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,520
weird-looking girls,

853
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,800
because I know lots of the popular, cool,

854
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:25,220
studly-looking subgenius and beautiful subgeniuses that feel the same way,

855
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,240
that feel alone in the world,

856
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,500
and get depressed,

857
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,680
and get really, really,

858
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,400
you know, they're still looking for love, friends,

859
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,820
or at least a dependable fuck-toy,

860
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,080
at least that.

861
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,080
But it's hard to find.

862
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,740
But friends, I am here to tell you, to remind you,

863
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,660
in a pep talk, which is all any good religion is,

864
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,520
to hang in there, goddammit!

865
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,820
You will score on X-Day, no matter what!

866
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,500
You understand that, as a dude's being subgenius.

867
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,660
But who knows?

868
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,500
While waiting for X-Day,

869
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,820
heck, maybe you'll just score anyway, after all.

870
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,820
Once again, friends, I can't stress this enough.

871
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,520
Don't kill yourself!

872
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,860
Let Bob do it for you!

873
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,060
Never try to second-guess old matchmaker Connie.

874
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,720
Matchmaker Connie, friends, and when...

875
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,020
You know, because the hand that Dame Connie finally deals you

876
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,880
just might be the one you least expected,

877
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,620
or it might be the one you most expected.

878
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,000
You don't know!

879
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,720
You don't know the future.

880
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,760
And, uh, I'm afraid old Bob here might not know the future, either.

881
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,380
Look at him.

882
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,900
I'm afraid he's gonna have to make a confession.

883
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,800
And it may be reassuring to some of you.

884
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,340
Some of you have been saying,

885
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,680
I'm not sure if there is a Bob.

886
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,460
Because I came here to be Bob when I saw Bob.

887
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,040
And all he did was fitfully try to hump this stuffed monkey.

888
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,940
In fact, I don't know if he's even real.

889
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,540
He looks like he might be dead, or not even a real person.

890
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,140
Friends, I'm gonna admit it to you.

891
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,040
That's not really Bob.

892
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,260
I know a lot of you were...

893
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:03,380
I know a lot of you were...

894
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,760
excited about being in the same room with Bob Dobsman.

895
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,060
That's not really him.

896
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,420
I'm afraid the real Bob is a lot healthier,

897
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,300
a little bit older,

898
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:12,600
taller,

899
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,880
and way too goddamn busy to be

900
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,420
walking around with the likes of us, I'll tell you.

901
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,820
He's probably partying with, uh,

902
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,460
Bill Gates.

903
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,020
The hobo with the most slack in the world or something.

904
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,380
I'm not sure if he's dead,

905
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,480
or if he's the most likely.

906
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,220
Oh, the scrotal guy.

907
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,540
What's the name, the scrotal twins, or whatever their name is?

908
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,340
Oh, the back thunder.

909
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,480
That's what they often call it in psychic phenomena.

910
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,920
Back thunder, the paraflatulator!

911
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,180
No, that means that the time's ellipses are kind of like melting away.

912
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,200
They're refracturing into each other.

913
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,720
That means that tomorrow may actually be...

914
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:52,760
The time intersection.

915
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,520
Right, tomorrow may actually be today.

916
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,520
The time intersection.

917
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,300
And so it was spelled.

918
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,060
And so it was.

919
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,520
The time was...

920
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:01,540
Tomorrow?

921
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,600
Are you ready?

922
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,920
Could it be Saturday night?

923
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,120
Are you ready?

924
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,660
That purple bucket mind of a emperor stingy took out his wallet

925
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:12,140
and decided to end it or begin it all.

926
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,620
Sure, it could just be another stupid subgenius revival.

927
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:19,300
Or it could be the time intersection.

928
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,020
Or it could be a bunch of puteras with a hair all full of, like,

929
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:25,180
these weird little jelly beans and things like that.

930
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,960
The potato men and the thumb people will come together.

931
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,980
As some of them say, Charlie.

932
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,440
Charlie and Bob.

933
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,520
For Bob.

934
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,580
My music...

935
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,520
Hey, you know what?

936
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,940
Dances With Rockets music is being played now, right this very minute at the Cannes Film

937
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:47,460
Festival.

938
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:47,960
What?

939
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:48,280
You wish!

940
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:48,560
Yep.

941
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,400
Jackie Snappy is in this?

942
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,540
This music right here, this exact...

943
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:53,780
Stuff.

944
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,340
Right here.

945
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:54,620
Hold on.

946
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,920
Dances With Rockets squirt music?

947
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:57,600
Yeah.

948
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,180
Please spread the word.

949
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:00,500
This.

950
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:00,960
This music right here.

951
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:00,960


952
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:00,960


953
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:00,960


954
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:00,960


955
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:00,960


956
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:00,960


957
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:00,960


958
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:00,960


959
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:00,960


960
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:00,960


961
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,620
Now, they're using this as a Cannes Film Festival?

962
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,840
This is being used at the Cannes Film Festival as we speak.

963
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,820
How come you never told anybody this?

964
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:08,680
I don't know.

965
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,740
Well, why?

966
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,040
How did you get it on there?

967
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,960
Because it's soundtracking for...

968
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,900
We are being played Mojo World film.

969
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,300
Cannes?

970
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:25,380
Or an animation of Mojo World is being shown on the very, very large plasma screen that's outdoors.

971
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:30,320
And it's getting some showing indoors on the regular screen.

972
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,080
In between things.

973
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,360
Are you ready for the plasma screen?

974
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,780
For your Mojo?

975
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,680
All your Mojo belongs to us.

976
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,160
The plasma screen.

977
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,620
That one moment in time.

978
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,340
Are belong to us.

979
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:58,460
Oh, Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout.

980
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:00,540
Would not.

981
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:01,640
Take.

982
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,020
The garbage out.

983
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,660
She'd wash the dishes and scrub the pans.

984
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,480
Cook the yams and spice the hams.

985
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:15,060
And though her parents would scream and shout.

986
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,900
She simply would not take the garbage out.

987
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:25,740
And so it piled up to the ceilings.

988
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,460
Coffee grounds, potato peelings.

989
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,960
Brownies.

990
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,140
Brown bananas and rotten peas.

991
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,400
Chunks of sour cottage cheese.

992
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,580
It filled the can.

993
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,500
It covered the floor.

994
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,160
It cracked the windows and blocked the door.

995
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,880
With bacon rinds and chicken bones.

996
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,780
Drippy ends of ice cream cones.

997
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,060
Prune pits.

998
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:53,860
Peach pits.

999
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,460
Orange peel.

1000
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,900
Gloppy glumps of cold oatmeal.

1001
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,640
Pizza crust.

1002
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,040
Crust and withered greens.

1003
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,700
Soggy beans and tangerines.

1004
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,580
Crust of blackburn butter toast.

1005
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,660
Grizzly bits of beefy roast.

1006
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:12,420
The garbage rolled on down the hall.

1007
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,360
It raised the roof.

1008
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,080
It broke the walls.

1009
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,160
I mean, easy napkins.

1010
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,260
Cookie crumbs.

1011
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,560
Blobs.

1012
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,140
Gooey bubblegum.

1013
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,480
Sulfane from old bologna.

1014
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,260
Rubbery, rubbery macaroni.

1015
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,040
Peanut butter cake.

1016
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,060
Dry curdled milk.

1017
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:28,660
Crust of pie.

1018
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,340
Rotting melons.

1019
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,620
Dried up mustard. Egg shells. Mixed with milk.

1020
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,360
With lemon custard.

1021
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,560
Cold french fries.

1022
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,560
And rancid meat.

1023
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,140
Yellow lumps of cream of wheat.

1024
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:45,640
At last, the garbage reached so high that finally it touched the sky.

1025
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:49,060
And none of her friends would come to play.

1026
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,660
And all the neighbors moved away.

1027
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:55,020
And finally Sarah Cynthia Stout said,

1028
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:59,640
Okay, I'll take the garbage out.

1029
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:04,520
But then, of course, it was too late.

1030
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,600
The garbage reached across the state.

1031
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,500
From New York to the Golden Gate.

1032
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,080
And there in the garbage she did hate.

1033
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:17,500
Poor Sarah met an awful fate that I cannot right now relate.

1034
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,680
Because the hour is much too late.

1035
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:24,180
But children, remember Sarah Stout.

1036
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:29,620
And always take the garbage out.

1037
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:33,520
The garbage out

1038
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,900

00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:08,240
Friends, write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306.

1054
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,400
Friends, I should mention, there's a...

1055
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,680
wonderful subgenius scene that...

1056
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:57,660
regularly published by the great name of Quijibo.

1057
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:05,100
And serious subgeniuses should definitely find themselves a sample copy of Quijibo.

1058
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:11,640
You can check it out on the web at quijibo.walkingdead.net.

1059
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,300
But I'm going to give their address too.

Praise Bob.

1070
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,460
Oh, and get ready for X Day, friends.
