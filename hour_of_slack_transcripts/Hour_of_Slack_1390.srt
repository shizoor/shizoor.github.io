1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,840
Slack, my friends, is like energy. It can neither be destroyed nor created. It is

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,300
just present everywhere in some form or another.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,320
Slack can be transmuted. Slack can be fine-tuned so that appeals only to you

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,160
and it is your personal form of Slack. But Slack is always there. It is around

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,740
you everywhere, even in this miserable pink world that we're forced to live in,

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,940
surrounded by Glorps. There is Slack, friends, and the way to Slack is to

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:41,300
remember the way of Bob. Bob can give you Slack. Bob can help you find that

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,760
particular kind of Slack that fits you best. Remember, it's always out there. You

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,940
and Bob can find the Slack you need.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,980
Red, can you go? Where shall I go? What shall I do?

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,700
Frankly, my dear, I don't...

12
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,040
I'll give it.

13
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,600
Some genius. Power of Slack.

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,620
From PR News in Washington, I'm a mass of cold penguin food rations trying to adapt

15
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,220
to a rapidly changing marketplace as people gathered to celebrate pummeling PR News.

16
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,760
This is going to be sort of a...

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,220
It's up to...

18
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,480
Win the titles and expect rid to both.

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,640
Power companies say they're already arranging explosives for next week.

20
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,020
And another milestone is also within view.

21
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,040
It's a...

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,280
The world program says it plans to provide monthly flying in PR News for one and a half people,

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,680
at least until the middle of a mass of cold air from the north.

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,340
The assailant escape. Police infiltrate. Strike troops. Troops true. Kill. Attacks.

25
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,380
Shooting. Attack. Shooting. PR News.

26
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,660
The National Hurricane Center in Miami says this is PR News.

27
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,020
PR News.

28
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,600
Germany calling. Germany calling.

29
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:15,740
The witches attempt to keep mum in this cathedral.

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,080
Ah, sorcery, kidnapping, and desecration.

31
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,740
The solution is...

32
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,100
The Soul Genius. Power of Slack.

33
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,920
The Soul Genius. Power of Slack.

34
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,740
The Soul Genius. Power of Slack.

35
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,900
Did I hear a flash?

36
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,100
Because the crabs he had were awful, dear.

37
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,680
Go on, I said, have a nice bowl of liquid paraffin jelly. It'll loosen you up.

38
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,840
Oh, no, he said.

39
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,860
So I turned around and said, look, a warm half pint of olive oil and a funnel.

40
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,700
I don't mind doing it, but not him.

41
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,560
He got unrest with the light off.

42
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,080
Here you are, dear, I said, do it yourself.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,980
Shove a pellet of soap up with a good squirt of cucumber juice.

44
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,840
Mrs. E.

45
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,260
When I require an evacuant, I swallow 30 feet of toweling and wait.

46
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:14,120
Death night. Death night. Death night. Death night. Death night. Death night.

47
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,440
I must have some booze.

48
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,220
I demand to have some booze.

49
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,780
If I had all the money I'd spent on drink, I'd spend it on drink.

50
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,240
You know what makes you feel helpless sometimes?

51
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,660
Spaceships rushing by.

52
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,280
Bombs. Bombs.

53
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,840
Big enough to bury continents.

54
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,360
Men and women.

55
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,820
Ordinary men and women like you and me.

56
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,140
Able to press a button and bingo.

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,820
Everything's finished.

58
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,580
And that boy, he wants to know if everything's going to turn out all right in the end.

59
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,820
I hope so. I certainly hope so.

60
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,380
We'll just have to see what's going to happen in this...

61
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,240
Hey.

62
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,440
Hey.

63
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,900
enamored

64
00:03:59,900 --> 00:03:59,900


65
00:03:59,900 --> 00:03:59,900


66
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,860
This red payback is the jack of the cop.

67
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,920
Heh heh heh.

68
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,360
quando

69
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,420
These drugs are going to blow my ass off.

70
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,540
Five, four, three, two...

71
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,600
People run to the edge of countries and stop.

72
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,120
And look above the water.

73
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,060
You can tell the edge by stones.

74
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,240
Some are small like sand.

75
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,100
Some are big like pebbles.

76
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,920
Then they usually sit down.

77
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,700
Some on man-made cushions.

78
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,580
The rest on newspaper.

79
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,000
Except for a few who don't care where they sit.

80
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,200
Stones are so unique.

81
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,280
People get bored by being unable to find two the same.

82
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,900
And anyway, the differences are superficial.

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,960
Though the stones don't think so.

84
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,480
In this way, stones are a bit like people.

85
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,340
Except they think more and say less.

86
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,680
And don't complain.

87
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,160
God bless.

88
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:56,900
Stones.

89
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,440
And that includes pebbles and sand.

90
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,300
I have a macrocosmic view of things temporal.

91
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,480
No order changes.

92
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,320
Yielding place to you.

93
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,400
God fulfills himself in many ways.

94
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,920
And soon, I suppose,

95
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,340
I shall be swept away.

96
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,960
By some vulnerable little tumour.

97
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,420
Oh my boys.

98
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,720
My boys, we're at the end of an age.

99
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,200
We live in a land of weather forecasts.

100
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,960
Breakfasts that set in.

101
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,460
Shattered by Tories.

102
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,520
Shoveled up by labour.

103
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,520
And here we are.

104
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,020
We three.

105
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,180
Perhaps the last island of beauty in the world.

106
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,260
I don't know.

107
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,480
Which of you is going to be a splendid island

108
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,820
and the damping abodes for the rest of the plane?

109
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,020
I don't know.

110
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,080
I'm not sure.

111
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,080


112
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,600
I'm not sure.

113
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:25,720


114
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:25,720


115
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:25,720


116
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:25,720


117
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:25,720


118
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:25,720


119
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:38,580
We'll try our best to find best ice-b LEO.

120
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,160
.

121
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,360
That's telling usiotou triples of a world.

122
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,360


123
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,740
See you in the fire.

124
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,620
I wish you ease of anguish.

125
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,840
My ed Thrones island.

126
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,520
ир

127
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:54,560
Subsamu land.

128
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,380
I want to join Islamic Jihad

129
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,920
I just want to kill for God

130
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,240
Praising Allah is the life for me

131
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,600
I'll use pipe bombs, what the fuck?

132
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,120
Killing Hebrews brings good luck

133
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,420
God will make all maybe proud of me

134
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,980
Load a car with dynamite and drive it to a synagogue without any brakes

135
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,900
Nothing could be better than this

136
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,000
Better than impaling your intestines on a big rusty stake

137
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,200
Pack grenades and cattle prods

138
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,320
Let's go out and kill for God

139
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,600
I can hear Mohammed calling me

140
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,000
Yowza, yowza, yowza

141
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,480
Let's go out and kill for God

142
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,320
I want to join Islamic Jihad

143
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,220
I want to kill for God

144
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,480
Praising Allah is the life for me

145
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,380
I'll use pipe bombs, what the fuck?

146
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,200
Killing Hebrews brings good luck

147
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,200


148
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,620
Let's go out and kill for God

149
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,140
Let's go out and kill for God

150
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,400
Let's go out and kill for God

151
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,660
Let's go out and kill for God

152
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,260
Let's go out and kill for God

153
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,300
Let's get the hell out of here

154
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,920
Let's kill for God

155
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,880
Ha ha ha!

156
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,720
Ah, looks like it sucks!

157
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,120
Firing up the ol' bulldozer!

158
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,480
Though the Corinth seems quite odd

159
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,940
I still want to kill for God

160
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,200
Praising Jesus is the life for me

161
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,820
Fuck those pagans, they're such cynics

162
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,200
Let's bomb the abortion clinic

163
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,320
Jesse Helms, he is my cup of tea

164
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,420
Never thought I'd make it big by selling God to idiots on cable TV

165
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,460
What the fuck?

166
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:43,920
It's not true!

167
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,720
I'm a G, but still a better way to use my business degree

168
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,620
Use a rifle, spare the rod

169
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,220
Let's go out and kill for God

170
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,700
Baby Jesus, pass my AKG!

171
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,300
Friends...

172
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,840
It's gonna be a rough time and I'm gonna...

173
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,280
I'm... this is...

174
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,080
à Cartier

175
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,200
The pounding action

176
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,340
Kiss the buyer

177
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,600
Have no fun

178
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,240
Son, I realize

179
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,060
All my money

180
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,060


181
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,240
Call me

182
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,240


183
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,240


184
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,480
Be a grown-up

185
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:27,660
And always knew

186
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:27,660


187
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:27,740
That present

188
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,000
If this little murder

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,780
Was never meant for me

190
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,840
Indeed more

191
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,360
No, no

192
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,400
My love

193
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,880
If this little heart

194
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,260
For the heart

195
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,600
Was a seraglio

196
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,260
Be my du polyn enhancees

197
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,460
You're alive. You're healthy.

198
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,100
Your life's insured.

199
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,420
There's little money set aside in case of accidents.

200
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,120
What more could you ask for?

201
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,120
These are good times.

202
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,760
Easy money, easy sex, VCRs and Nintendo to keep your minds occupied.

203
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,440
You know, they say that the golden age is never the present age.

204
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,500
They really do say that.

205
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,120
But we look all around us everywhere, and what do we see?

206
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,100
Golden opportunity.

207
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,300
Well, friends, that's just calm before the storm,

208
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,040
because tonight's sermon is entitled,

209
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,620
X-Day 1998, Day of Reckoning.

210
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,700
We all know vaguely what X-Day is.

211
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,320
Bob told us himself that it shall occur July 5th, 1998.

212
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,960
The X's shall land and whisk the good subgenies off

213
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,100
to a never-ending pleasure cruise of the cosmos.

214
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,820
But what of the peaks that remain on Earth?

215
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,040
What will happen to the A's?

216
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,380
What will happen to the B's?

217
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,380


218
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,380


219
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,380


220
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,380


221
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,320
Well, friends, as much as I hate to gloat over those less fortunate,

222
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,300
the fact is, they'll get exactly what they deserve.

223
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,300
Now, to any real subgenie, giving the normal what he deserves

224
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,300
is about the cruelest fate a normal could ever receive.

225
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,840
After all, these are the same normals that have supported the conspiracy for centuries.

226
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,480
These are the same normals that have tortured us with their ignorance

227
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,020
and defiled the name of Bob.

228
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,480
These are the same normals...

229
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,440
that have taken the most free country in the world

230
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,380
and turned it into an ever-growing bureaucratic governmental monster

231
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,620
that feeds on taxes, committees, laws, statutes,

232
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,460
buck-passing, and fill-in-the-blank.

233
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,520
Then, once the creature's rot-filled gut

234
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,540
sprues out the digested combination of all the vices

235
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,000
before mentioned by the lawyers and liars that created this filth,

236
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,120
what's the result?

237
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,800
Why, the conspiracy, of course.

238
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,720
And this pile of stinking defecation

239
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,640
we're supposed to kneel before and worship

240
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,700
and serve?

241
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,860
Never!

242
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,540
Bob will avenge us for the years of conspiracy rule

243
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,040
on that most dreaded of subgenius holidays,

244
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,000
X-Day 1998.

245
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,600
Dreaded by them,

246
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,280
but not by us.

247
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,880
Let us look at Bob's prophecy

248
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,720
and see what the normals have in store for them,

249
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,720
shall we?

250
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,160
Bob's word comes in many mysterious ways,

251
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,360
not all of which are immediately recognized

252
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,760
as divine in origin.

253
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,660
Indeed, since Bob transcends time,

254
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,280
so does his word.

255
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,880
This revelation popped up in a 1938 radio drama.

256
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,260
In this story, the Martians,

257
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,180
then a synonym for aliens,

258
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,200
later to be known as X's,

259
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,780
have landed and started to round up the normals.

260
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,480
Two of the unlucky survivors

261
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,280
meet to discuss the future of man unkind.

262
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,460
The smarter one asserts, quote,

263
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,480
I've thought it all out.

264
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,780
Right now,

265
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,580
we're caught as we're wanted.

266
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,820
An X's only has to go a few miles

267
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,040
to get a crowd on the run,

268
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,240
but they won't keep on doing that.

269
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,440
They'll begin catching us systematic-like,

270
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,780
keeping the best and storing us in cages and things.

271
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,760
They haven't begun on us yet.

272
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,780
Not begun.

273
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,420
Later, he goes on to say,

274
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,080
all those little office workers

275
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,040
that used to live in these houses,

276
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,880
they'll be no good.

277
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,760
They haven't any strength,

278
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,880
no stuff in them.

279
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,860
They used to run,

280
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,420
run off to work.

281
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,660
I have seen hundreds of them running

282
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,480
and catching their commuter trains in the morning,

283
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,460
afraid that they'd get panned if they didn't.

284
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,900
Running back at night,

285
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,680
afraid that they wouldn't be in time for dinner.

286
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,160
Lives insured and a little invested in case of accidents.

287
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,300
Yay, and on Sundays,

288
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,280
worried about the hereafter.

289
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,400
Well, the X's will be a godsend for those guys.

290
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,440
Nice roomy cages,

291
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,600
good food,

292
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,620
careful breeding,

293
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,920
and no worries.

294
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,360
Yeah, after a week or so of chasing around the fields on empty stomachs,

295
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,260
they'll come and be glad to be caught.

296
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,160
Now, this is 1938, mind you.

297
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,300
He goes on to say, finally,

298
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,880
that's not all.

299
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,920
These X's are going to make pets of some of them,

300
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,640
train them to do tricks.

301
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,880
Who knows, get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up and had to be killed.

302
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,640
Yay, and some, maybe,

303
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,580
they'll train to hunt us.

304
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,600
Yes, they will.

305
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,420
There's men who will do it gladly.

306
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,960
Well, friends,

307
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,220
how much more obvious does Bob have to be?

308
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:24,800
When he gave this brief preview of the future in 1938 on CBS,

309
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,480
it sent millions of normals into the streets screaming for reprieve.

310
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,780
They repented.

311
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,060
They begged forgiveness.

312
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,680
And yet, just a few days later,

313
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,620
after Bob Orson Welles in the War of the Worlds broadcast

314
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,580
was described by the conspiracy as nothing more than a joke,

315
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,320
the normals went back to the conspiracy way of life

316
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,460
as if nothing had ever happened.

317
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,240
They came so close to getting a second chance in mending their ways,

318
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,260
but they blew it.

319
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,440
They went back to the conspiracy masters,

320
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,920
and for their loyalty,

321
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,680
they were genously rewarded with yet another world war.

322
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,920
There's a strange sense of poetic justice to it, isn't there, friends?

323
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,620
Well,

324
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,160
they haven't seen nothing yet.

325
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,300
Just wait till the real McCoy comes.

326
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,940
It's only a few miles down the road, pink boy.

327
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,480
And like Dr. Al prescribes to his patients,

328
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,420
if you're caught in a nuclear holocaust and your skin begins to melt,

329
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,520
don't panic.

330
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,280
This is perfectly normal.

331
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,600
Yes, friends,

332
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,380
just another normal way to die for the normals doomed to die.

333
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,800
Did I say doomed to die?

334
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,780
I should have said lucky to die,

335
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,560
for bliss that are the dead after X-Day arrives.

336
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,480
The doom,

337
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,020
doomed are the unlucky pink survivors

338
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,860
who must live out their wretched existence under the cruel and merciless exes.

339
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,320
Cruel to them,

340
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,940
but not to us.

341
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,240
Not only will there be no more bowling alleys and golf courses for the pinks,

342
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,080
but there'll be no more subgenies to kick around anymore.

343
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,680
We'll be surfing the celestial stars,

344
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,240
smoking our frock,

345
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,320
unweaving our slack,

346
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,160
and sexing our anti-virgins like there was no tomorrow.

347
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,040
Because in space, friends,

348
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,060
there isn't.

349
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,120
Only back on Earth will it be an Amar,

350
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,200
and then the next day,

351
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,060
and then the next.

352
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,360
It'll be an eternal hell without end.

353
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,400
And we'll be an enjoyin' it all in the heavens on closed-circuit TV,

354
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,260
because we won't want to miss a single revenge-filled minute.

355
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,920
Praise Bob!

356
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:20,900
Amen.

357
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,520
No!

358
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,040
That's mine.

359
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,860
I'm always finding,

360
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,160
they leave these half-filled syringes layin' around.

361
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,320
We called that 10-30in' where I came from,

362
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,460
because it meant that you left the party at 10-30 and didn't finish your beer.

363
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,160
Half-finished lobotomies.

364
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,040
So I think at halfway through you're nine.

365
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,160
I know, I cleaned up a whole brain yesterday.

366
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,060
I saw that.

367
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,400
This is a reenactment of the way early man appealed to his so-called gods.

368
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,900
Saw spirits in everything that lived.

369
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:12,160
Trees, birds, and would do homage as best he could with horrible, crude caveman noises.

370
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,900
We're going back to the old ways.

371
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,460
Back when the world was simpler,

372
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,360
there were only two or three social networks.

373
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,800
The old, the new, the old, the old, the old.

374
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,640
The old, the old, the old, the old, the old.

375
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,300
Facebook worked by smoke signals.

376
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,020
And it was actually a lot more entertaining then.

377
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,380
None of this instant gratification shit.

378
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,720
Oh, nice!

379
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,120
A man can never have too many guitars.

380
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,960
Too much is always better than not enough,

381
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,100
as Bob said.

382
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,080
For the rest of this episode, we're back at X-Day.

383
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,460
15 X-Day, rather.

384
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,840
But what we played earlier...

385
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,760
Let's see.

386
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,180
G. Gordon Gordon opened the show.

387
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,120
Then Titles and News by Lee Murr.

388
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,080
But that longer collage with the old man hating,

389
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,760
that was by Slackmaster Sarcastro.

390
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,800
And involved some I-4 Cutler, I am told.

391
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,460
The song Kill for God was, of course,

392
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,440
the Rudy Schwartz Project.

393
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,500
There's a great video of that.

394
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,800
It's from a re-release of the classic album

395
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,220
Don't Get Charred, Get Puffy.

396
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,540
The Rudy Schwartz Project.

397
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,160
You can Google it before it Googles you.

398
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,580
More on that later.

399
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,420
But now, let's go to the sweat-drenched concert at X-Day

400
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,140
by Reverend Trademark Gunderson

401
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,300
and the Evolution Control Committee

402
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,500
as he demonstrates his amazing hand-operated sampler device,

403
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,280
the ThimbleTron.

404
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,100
Ladies and gentlemen, the ThimbleTron is not difficult stuff.

405
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,820
It's just a matter of simple connections.

406
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,500
Just binary, really, which is just kind of yeses.

407
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,120
Yes, yes, yes.

408
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,100
And nos.

409
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:14,580
No.

410
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,500
Yes.

411
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:15,940
Yes.

412
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,340
No.

413
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,160
No.

414
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:17,780
Yes.

415
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,320
No.

416
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,080
No.

417
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,540
Yes.

418
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,760
This is called No Time for Yes.

419
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,420
Yes.

420
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,760
Yes.

421
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,680
No.

422
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,300
Yes.

423
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,320
Yes.

424
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,720
Yes.

425
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,480
Yes.

426
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:31,480


427
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,720
Yes.

428
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,200
Yes.

429
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:33,980
Yes.

430
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,300
Yes.

431
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,540
Yes.

432
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,300
Yes.

433
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,500
Yes.

434
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,800
Yes.

435
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,220
No.

436
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:42,920
Yes.

437
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:43,760
No.

438
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:43,760


439
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,220
Yes.

440
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Yes.

441
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:45,520


442
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:45,520


443
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,080
No.

444
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,820
No.

445
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,360
No.

446
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:47,980
No.

447
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
ritt

448
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:01,480


449
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:01,480


450
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:01,480


451
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:01,480


452
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:01,480


453
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Yes.

454
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,000
But then I pause it there from say I'm negative

455
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,280
But then I pause it there from say I'm negative

456
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,620
Negative, negative, positive

457
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,260
Yes!

458
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,200
Yes

459
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,300
Yes

460
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,080
No, no, yes

461
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,040
Yes

462
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,340
Now I'm going to try a somewhat tricky overhanded maneuver here

463
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,980
I don't recommend trying this on your home thimble-tron by the way

464
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,060
Let's see what you're doing

465
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,040
It's okay to say no

466
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,060
It's okay to say no

467
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,060
It's okay to say no

468
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,240
It's okay to say no

469
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,880
No

470
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,520
Yes

471
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,680
Yes

472
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,440
Yes

473
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,040
Yes

474
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,480
Yes

475
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,640
No, no

476
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,020
No, no, yes

477
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,020
Yes

478
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,300
Yes

479
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,340
Yes

480
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:55,820
Yes

481
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,360
Yes

482
00:22:59,360 --> 00:22:59,640
No, no

483
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,300
No

484
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,840
If your test is negative

485
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,660
Because you cannot get into the 리볼비

486
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,680
If you do not get into the rectangle

487
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,960
You cannot get into the rectangle

488
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,520
If you do not get into the rectangle

489
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,960
And becomedimensional

490
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:18,960


491
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:18,960


492
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,220
And becomedimensional

493
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:19,680
But just please

494
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:19,680


495
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:19,680


496
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,460
I don't know how this works

497
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,000
Okay

498
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,340
But you and me

499
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:27,880
No

You know what I'm saying, give me the whole thing

501
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,200

00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,180
And not mine, the one from the Sarlacc.

555
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,200
But I do have a new song for you,

556
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,560
and I think you'll really enjoy it.

557
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,620
It's called Third Person Blues.

558
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,760
Andrew's got them third person blues.

559
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,820
Okay, thank you.

560
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:54,000
All right, yeah, see?

561
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,560
Now here's the part where the set list, you know,

562
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,680
would have helped out here.

563
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,840
We're going to play a couple more songs

564
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,140
before the aminos to come on back up here.

565
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,580
But let me say again that I really appreciate being out here

566
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,600
and, you know, how to fuck things up.

567
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,720
I'm going to end up with my fellow Yeti people.

568
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,360
You know, we're all washed in the sweat of Bob.

569
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,760
This keeps on coming in and out.

570
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,720
It's kind of cool, I mean.

571
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,860
All right, now Jane's Addiction for Children.

572
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,760
Jane's Addiction for Children.

573
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,180
She'll be coming down the mountain when she comes.

574
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,680
She'll be one of many children when she comes.

575
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,840
Everybody had their own opinion.

576
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,020
Holding it back, it hurts so bad.

577
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,300
It's jumping out of my flesh, and I said, uh...

578
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,440
Yeah.

579
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,700
That's a way home, or you'll get that on the way home.

580
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,320
This is called Chameleon.

581
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:03,700
Chameleon.

582
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:03,700


583
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,400
Chameleon.

584
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:05,660
Chameleon.

585
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:06,580
Chameleon.

586
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,040
Chameleon.

587
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,160
Chameleon.

588
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,580
Chameleon.

589
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:10,580


590
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:10,580


591
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,540
Yeah.

592
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,580
Yeah.

593
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:14,660
Yeah.

594
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:14,660


595
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,940
I gotta make you mine.

596
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,540
My breath, you took it.

597
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,600
I saw you set afire.

598
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,220
I gotta know just what you're into.

599
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,160
Bands that you like most and where you've been to.

600
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,380
One thing I can do, I'm gonna Google you.

601
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,120
I'm gonna Google you.

602
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,320
Time to pay your tab.

603
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,680
You breeze up to the bar.

604
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,180
I see the name on your card.

605
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,000
Photographic.

606
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,340
I type it in and hit go to see where your name is found.

607
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,700
Looks like there's one in this town.

608
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,320
Fantastic.

609
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,320
I got your number.

610
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,360
I know where you buy shoes.

611
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,940
I bet you wonder.

612
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,120
Where do I get my news?

613
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,600
It's all the air, your banking records.

614
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,800
Place that does your hair, your scripts from Eckerd's.

615
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,720
Always something new when I Google you.

616
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,500
When I Google you.

617
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,020
I'm gonna Google you.

618
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,280
I bet you can't resist me.

619
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,120
You'd be surprised to know just what you can find.

620
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,760
About a person if you have enough time.

621
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,760
A little number unlocks a lot and I found it.

622
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,180
Hooray, I found it.

623
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,100
Now that I know just what you want in a man.

624
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,960
I'll go remake myself as best as I can.

625
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,340
I'll be complete.

626
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,780
So when we meet you can't resist me.

627
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,380
Bet you can't resist me.

628
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,340
Change my wardrobe and my music.

629
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,120
Don't let go, tease.

630
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,820
I can lose it.

631
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,760
Learn to play the blues.

632
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,600
If I have time.

633
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:08,980
I can lose it.

634
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,720
Fill my iPod up with Lenny Kravitz.

635
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,920
Get my hair done up like crap.

636
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,860
It never gonna quit until you're mine.

637
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,660
I'm reading all that I can.

638
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,060
I soak up all that I read.

639
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,620
I'll become all that you need.

640
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,380
Come million.

641
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,360
Why don't you take a chance?

642
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,620
Come on, give me a try.

643
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,900
I'll be your perfect guy.

644
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,960
One in a million.

645
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,740
You got no secrets.

646
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,960
At least none you need to hide from me.

647
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,400
I don't believe it.

648
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,320
Your mother lives right down the street.

649
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,420
I can't wait to get to know you.

650
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
Hope you take the bait.

651
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,240
Some things I want to show you.

652
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,820
Up in my computer room.

653
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,480
By the light of the cathode ray tube.

654
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,320
And I bet that you'll be flat-haired too.

655
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,580
And now I go, go, go.

656
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,600
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

657
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:04,760
Whoa.

658
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:06,580
Whoa.

659
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


660
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


661
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


662
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


663
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


664
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


665
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


666
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


667
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


668
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


669
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


670
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


671
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


672
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


673
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


674
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


675
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


676
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


677
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:06,580


678
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:06,600


679
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:06,880


680
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,200
That was Andrew the Impaled from Pittsburgh,

681
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,780
whose shows also involve fire breathing,

682
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,520
eating light bulbs, walking on glass bobbies,

683
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,100
and actual impalements.

684
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,260
So beautiful.

685
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,620
Before that, the Evolution Control Committee

686
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,040
and the Puzzling Evidence Show talking about them.

687
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,640
Coming up, more jams by several fisted tales of Connie,

688
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,120
the band that exists only at X-Day Drills,

689
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,660
and Sim-G Gordon Gordon.

690
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,640
But first, an unusual wedding gift

691
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,860
presented by my nabar around the coronar,

692
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,960
Mr. Sistar.

693
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,100
A gift for Suds Pasha and Priestess Pisces,

694
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,220
who had been wed earlier at the campground

695
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,460
during the X-Day Drill.

696
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,600
Oh, wait.

697
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,200
It looks like Mr. Sister has something to eat.

698
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,400
Of importance, he's bringing.

699
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,140
I was sent here by Bob

700
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,540
to complete your whole marriage transaction here.

701
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:17,820
Whoa.

702
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,300
Okay?

703
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,440
Because you got married in July.

704
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,080
There's a factory special.

705
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,240
We don't want your marriage breaking down.

706
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,360
So what we have here is,

707
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,940
for free, Bob's Marriage Repair Kit.

708
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,440
Oh.

709
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,280
Oh.

710
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:37,880


711
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,580
Yes.

712
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,480
And I want to read you here that

713
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,660
men always come to Bob with questions

714
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,080
concerning their marriage.

715
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,700
And Bob is never too busy to share with these men

716
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,460
that you are never really a successful man

717
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,820
until your marriage is successful.

718
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,500
Did you know that Bob is an unusual creature

719
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,560
in that he enjoys spending time with people

720
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,920
and giving his autograph to the people he loves?

721
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:05,920


722
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,120
And Bob's in love with Bob.

723
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,120


724
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,160
But for those who want to meet him

725
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,000
and greet America's most exciting evangelist,

726
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,280
Bob believes that once you get a man on his knees,

727
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,600
you have begun to really make a man

728
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,520
out of a possible mistake.

729
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,180
And this shows up first in marriage.

730
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,960
And then for those times

731
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,140
when your marriage,

732
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,400
let's say, gets a little bit of a flat,

733
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:45,740
alongside the road, and things ain't going quite right, I have here an album of musical

734
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,280
selectors called Alone Together.

735
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:03,220
And Joe Lilly presenting his whispering choir and his skyloft with an all-star accompaniment.

736
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:13,240
Absolutely. So, when it's necessary to be alone, and together, we have the soundtrack for you

737
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,380
as part of our July Special. And this is direct from the dealers.

738
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,160
Do to the mic.

739
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,280
Tro-lo-lo.

740
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,920
La-la-la-la la-la-la-la-da

741
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,200
La-la-la-la la-la-la-la-da

742
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:43,280
la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la, la-la-la la...

743
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,720
la-la-la-la-, la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la la-la,

744
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,020
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la na-la-la,

745
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,040
K. G.: Key changes.

746
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,500
la-la-la-la-la-la,

747
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,300
la-la-la-la-la,

748
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:08,640
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

749
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,740
And that's as much of it as I know.

750
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:28,660
Hello my baby, hello my darling, hello my ragtime gal

751
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,040
Perfect!

752
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,780
So everybody give it up for Mr. Sister!

753
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,060
What if it's all because they're sitting on their asses?

754
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,080
Slack is self-made

755
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,580
Not give or take

756
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,980
It's something you have to do

757
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,260
Cannot expect it to

758
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,680
be given to you

759
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,620
Nothing is free

760
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:48,460
But motherfucker don't take my slack from me

761
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,540
Motherfucker don't take my slack from me

762
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,620
I understand you're alone

763
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,520
And slackless

764
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,660
I understand you're alone

765
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,660
But a thief is still a thief

766
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,180
And you will find no relief

767
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,280
I understand you're alone

768
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,280


769
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,800
If you steal my slack from me

770
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,100
No rest for the slackless

771
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,380
The slackless, slackless masses

772
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,260
But don't steal my slack from me

773
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,840
I will hunt you down

774
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,100
I will make you hurt

775
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,260
I will find a way

776
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,560
For you to regret your birth

777
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,140
Don't steal, don't steal, don't steal

778
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:21,980
Don't steal, don't steal, don't steal

779
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:27,780
Don't steal, don't steal, don't steal, don't steal

780
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,780
My slack from me

781
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,560
Steal my slack from me

782
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,900
Don't steal my slack from me

783
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,580
This serves a warning

784
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,780
My final warning

785
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,500
I've had enough

786
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,020
I've taken

787
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,880
As much as I can take

788
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,380
And I'm gonna prove to you

789
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,980
I'm pretty tough

790
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,740
Because I'm angry

791
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,120
Angry at you

792
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,660
And I'm frustrated

793
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,220
With what you do

794
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,100
And I'll tell you

795
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,380
There is no choice

796
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,340
Can you hear it

797
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,660
The hate in my voice

798
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,720
Don't steal my slack from me

799
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,880
Don't steal my slack from me

800
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,020
I'm making it clear as I can

801
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,120
You may think you're the better man

802
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,520
But I'll hunt you down

803
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,380
To the end of your life

804
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:46,380
Don't steal my slack from me

805
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,180
Don't steal my slack from you

806
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,380
I'll hold your slack

807
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,020
I won't buy the slack still

808
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:09,620
Or I want avania

809
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:09,620


810
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:09,620


811
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:09,620


812
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,360
I'll fight my deacons

813
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:10,360


814
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:10,360


815
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:10,360


816
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:10,360


817
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,940
Just that they're best

818
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,940
In my game

819
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,720
And you know

820
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,900
I've never pretty

821
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,480
I've never yet been

822
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,700
Better than they were

823
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,300
now.

824
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,300
The others promise you

825
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,580
hereafter, after

826
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,720
a bad time, we say

827
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,880
have a good time and we promise

828
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,740
you absolutely nothing

829
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,900
after that. You're on your own.

830
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,920
You find a locker,

831
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,420
do dozen things.

832
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,060
Once you get locked into a serious

833
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,260
drug collection, the tendency

834
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,340
is to push you as far as you can.

835
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,880
Downer,

836
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,140
springer, blacker,

837
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,300
bumper. Downer,

838
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,520
springer, blacker,

839
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,700
bumper. Downer,

840
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,820
springer, blacker,

841
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,000
bumper. Downer,

842
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,060
springer, blacker,

843
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:22,720
bumper.

844
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,340
Downer, springer,

845
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,600
blacker.

846
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,120
Downer, springer,

847
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:30,960
bankrupt.

848
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,860
Downer, springer,

849
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:34,720
bankrupt.

850
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,960
Downer, springer,

851
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:38,980
generous.

852
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:50,580
Downer, springer,

853
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,660
Black, black, oh kill me

854
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:48,000
Black, black, oh kill me

855
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,320
Black, black, oh kill me

856
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:01,800
Pass me that prop stick, pass me that prop stick

857
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,660
Pass me that prop stick, baby

858
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,960
BEATBOX

859
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,400
It's a great combination, isn't it, Joe?

860
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,280
What's that?

861
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,760
Arm full of narcotics and a loaded gun?

862
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,640
Let her go, Bob.

863
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,320
Boy, did we get high.

864
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,320
Yes, sirree.

865
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,420
We sure got relaxed.

866
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,140
A physician must determine if tendon repairs are needed.

867
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:45,500
There it is.

868
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,820
But if the chief ever caught me taking these pills, he'd snap my head off.

869
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,420
Here, try one of mine.

870
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,060
Oh, yeah?

871
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,380
Yeah, the chief himself's been on these for a week, and he's a change.

872
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,440
Our favorite area for clairvoyance has always been in the field of science and medicine.

873
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,360
What's your trouble, young man?

874
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,340
The Venusian group brought...

875
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:15,780
Doctor.

876
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,760
Now, see here, young man, my time is valuable.

877
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,740
Doctor, this is a medical emergency.

878
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,140
I hope you like that nonsense.

879
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,800
I try to make the audience a part of the entertainment, and they go along with it all just great.

880
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,780
That chatter with the doctor is no phony bit, really.

881
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,160
It's just the way it happens.

882
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,860
You'll have to make it in one night when you're down Florida way.

883
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,180
All right, nurse, bring the next patient in.

884
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,280
We'll see you there.

885
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,960
Off you go!

886
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:52,960


887
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,680
ared we go!

888
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,060
We're back to Planet frente in a few moments, you thug.

889
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:02,080
Let's see what's out here.

890
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:06,720
I'd like to give you a présent.

891
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:15,480
I could grab half to a green an8

892
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,740
and

893
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,940
then

894
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,700
disc patterns, you can send us

895
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,820
cow vomit,

896
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,260
tooth broken,

897
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,440
11-gated,

898
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,260
elongated,

899
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,200
creation-oriented,

900
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:28,940
spear gum,

901
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,220
restaurant,

902
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,540
scars, you can send us

903
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,660
Niki.

904
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,960
Don't look at me that way, Douglas.

905
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:40,660
You're mad.

906
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,520
Don't be frightened, Douglas.

907
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,720
The emergency, what service do you require?

908
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,640
Give me Dr. Rowe!

909
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:50,980
Doctor.

910
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,960
Good night, Docs.

911
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,220
Thank you very much.

912
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,000
Make me take off my clothes

913
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,600
and make me go out normal

914
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,000
and I have to go outside and change

915
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,200
before I come here.

916
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,880
Do you love your parents?

917
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,920
Yeah, I love them, but they're...

918
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,240
In culture schools,

919
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:15,460
the culture of the future

920
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:15,460


921
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,080
is not taught across the land.

922
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,580
Mere infants are taught all about

923
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,680
contraceptive techniques

924
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,380
and are provided with a plastic phallus

925
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,040
in the classroom

926
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,280
upon which they are trained to fit

927
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,060
rubber contraceptives.

928
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,800
This next one's called Rock and Roll Gestalt

929
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,680
and the San Andreas Fault.

930
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,760
SARAH MAX

931
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:57,760


932
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:08,080
Dr. Rowe, I sell a rock gooey

933
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,120
ann ladder for this کا

934
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,960
And change thatcelery

935
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,460
into straight regular lift lift reels

936
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,160
A cloud passed through me and my droogs

937
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,780
As we all did the twist in the frug

938
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:26,940
So we fell into some kind of fugue

939
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:31,080
And it sounded like someone was tuning his mood

940
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,920
It was a rock and roll gestalt on a San Andreas boat

941
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,880
And it tasted of the salt of the earth

942
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,660
It was a rock and roll gestalt on a San Andreas boat

943
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,700
We were feasting on our own after a bar

944
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,260
We slam danced at the victory tour

945
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,500
Give or take a few bruises or more

946
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,560
When the recorder went past fifty-four

947
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,940
There's a whole lot of shakin' down to the earth's core

948
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,640
Where the world is a mess

949
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,940
Where the sharks and the jets have been switched

950
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:19,260
Partners with the bloods in the crypts

951
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:23,020
Tipped the teetering total eclipse

952
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,700
And went tumbling twaddle

953
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,160
On the lips of another rock and roll gestalt

954
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,040
On a San Andreas boat

955
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,060
But it wasn't worth the salt in my beer

956
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:39,800
Another rock and roll gestalt on a San Andreas boat

957
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,540
And I haven't felt this way in years

958
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,140
And yeah

959
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,480
Another sonic boom

960
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,840
Has shaken up the room

961
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,020
We don't know what to do

962
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,480
We'd better do it soon

963
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:11,700
Wooo!

964
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,960
This is a rock and roll gestalt on a San Andreas boat

965
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,800
This is a full throttle assault on your brain

966
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:34,400
This is a rock and roll gestalt on a San Andreas boat

967
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,100
Now I just haven't got time for the

968
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,400
Pain

969
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,420
Amoeba Knievel did that

970
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,580
With lead singer Tommy Amoeba

971
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,620
Also from Pittsburgh

972
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,320
And the lucky husband of the amazing Fat Mandy

973
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,620
We really had a great line up of bands

974
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,000
They all busted ass and eardrums

975
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,560
Oh the collage about pills and doctors

976
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,320
Was by St. Byron Werner

977
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,280
We unfortunately did not get a good recording

978
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,940
Of the amino acids from Detroit

979
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:19,280
Who by the way are hosting another Detroit revival

980
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,960
On the holy date of 1-30-1-3

981
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,080
The day of Bob

982
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,300
Yes January 30, 2013

983
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,880
Can be written out as 1-3-0-1-3

984
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,500
Which of course spells Bob

985
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,980
Try it!

986
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,540
See subgenius.com events

987
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,440
Anyway luckily we did get a good recording

988
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,580
Of the amino acids tribute band

989
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,900
The Slot Rods

990
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,300
Who sound almost exactly like the amino acids

991
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,840
Minus the theremin

992
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:11,340
And the

There is no more money.

1041
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,960
We gotta get some money.

Oh, yeah.

1048
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,560
Friends, we're glad

1049
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,740
you listened to this show

1050
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:10,300
and we're even more glad

1051
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,140
that some listeners

1052
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,260
have donated enough

1053
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,520
to help us keep on going

1054
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,080
for another couple of months.

1055
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,960
Not just this show,

1056
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,540
but subgenius.com

1057
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,280
and all the other

1058
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,080
archive sites.

1059
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,620
But if you truly love Bob

1060
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,800
and want some of that

1061
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,140
slack back to rebound

1062
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:27,160
to you,

1063
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,560
you should go to

1064
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,980
subgenius.com

1065
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,100
front page

1066
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,620
or especially the radio page

1067
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,580
or the catalog store page.

1068
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,960
And help out financially

1069
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,000
as best you can.

1070
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,480
Now, we know what it's like

1071
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,400
to be on the brink

1072
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,360
of total poverty

1073
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,360
and we don't want any subgeniuses

1074
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,980
to make their own situations worse.

1075
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,640
But some of you

1076
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,940
still have jobs.

1077
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,940
Even five bucks

1078
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,300
makes a big difference

1079
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,300
even if it's only once a month

1080
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,840
from enough of you.

1081
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:57,220
Fifty bucks makes

1082
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,220
an even bigger difference.

1083
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,580
All we're saying is that

1084
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,080
blowjobs could go the way

1085
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:04,980
of Steve Jobs

1086
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,040
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1087
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,480
We also take checks

1088
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,660
and money orders to

1089

Thanks for anything you can do

1095
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:30,200
to help let there be slack.

1096
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,580
We have another video do you know

1097
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:55,100
some там

1098
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,540
by the motions

1099
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,600
WHAT THIS?

1100
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,120
I got to breathe right in.

1101
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:59,700
No we are breathing healthy.

1102
01:01:59,700 --> 01:01:59,700


1103
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:03,660
Achievement dollars.

1104

Green pills!

1105
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,700
Yes, bloody far!

1106
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,640
Green pills!

1107
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,500
Yes, bloody far!

1108
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,120
Kill me!

1109
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,200
Yes, bloody far!
