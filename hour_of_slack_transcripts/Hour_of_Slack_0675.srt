1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,480
It's a Bob world after all. It's a Bob world after all. It's a Bob-K-Y-N-O-N.

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,600
This is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:29,320
I create diversity of the forms, open to my words.

4
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,360
You that divide and multiply it, hear my sounds.

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:46,380
I make yields league to you, ancient associates and fellow wanderers.

6
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:58,220
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,740
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

8
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,900
And this leads me to a somewhat more serious...

9
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,860
The reason that we say Earth, we must get off.

10
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:39,720
Well, I don't know about everybody else here, but I used to spend a lot of time reading what you call science fiction dystopian novels.

11
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,020
And monster movies, you know, Planet of the Apes, Road Warriors.

12
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,860
End of the world pornography, you might say.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,580
You know what I'm saying?

14
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,360
You know what I mean?

15
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,320
Man, it almost looked fun.

16
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,640
It's almost like, yeah, let all society fall apart.

17
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,480
At least it'd be pure.

18
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Well, obviously.

19
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,520
It'd also be pure diseases, pure hell, and so forth.

20
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:08,220
But, I used to read one of the great classics of the late 60s.

21
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,080
It was Stand on Zanzibar by John Bruner, which is followed by a book called The Sheep Look Up.

22
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,240
Now, those books, when I read them in the late 60s and early 70s, were...

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,320
chilling.

24
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,760
Really bone-chilling eco-horror paranoia.

25
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,180
That it was like, boy, we better learn.

26
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,940
People better start paying attention to this stuff or it's all going to happen.

27
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:37,900
Well, what's in those sci-fi books is absolutely identical to yesterday's newspaper.

28
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,840
Honestly, I mean, it was what seemed like this dystopian horror.

29
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,620
For some reason, well, it doesn't seem all that bad.

30
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,620
In fact, it's...

31
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,700
It just reminds me of the drive over here, you know?

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The stuff about endless shopping malls and the same shop over and over.

33
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,880
Everybody looks the same and it's all the same and it's always the same year.

34
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,380
They managed to get around that.

35
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,220
Everything's always every year, I guess.

36
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,140
But, that's, you know, that's what's so horrible about it.

37
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,460
It's because it seems like, well, it just gradually didn't...

38
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,380
It wasn't even that gradual.

39
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,320
It didn't even take, what, maybe 20, 30 years and everybody's used to it.

40
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,400
No, it's just normal.

41
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,520
Now, we're worried about others.

42
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,600
You know, far, far worse things.

43
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,200
So, where does that leave you?

44
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,800
Well, actually, I have a little bit of sort of hope myself.

45
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,980
This may surprise some of you, but it's just a personal thing for me.

46
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:47,500
I totally lost faith about 10 years ago in all religion, UFOs, ghosts, prophecy, pyramid power, and get-rich-quick schemes.

47
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,780
And I returned, this will shock you even more, I returned to my childhood religion.

48
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,880
Science fiction.

49
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,420
Cheap science fiction.

50
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:16,020
There is a science fiction book that I would recommend to everybody that's sort of like a hopeful equivalent of John Bruner's earlier eco-disaster books called Earth by David Brin, who is a hard science fiction writer.

51
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,040
He's actually a physicist.

52
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,960
He's a physicist by trade.

53
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,520
And it's a very, very realistic depiction.

54
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,700
It's very plausible.

55
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,200
It's a busted-ass to make it plausible depiction of the Earth about 50 years from now.

56
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:38,640
And it's pretty grim, but because this guy actually knows something about the way things can work, it's also very hopeful.

57
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,320
He's got solutions for things that really surprised me.

58
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,680
I thought, wow, I'm glad somebody's thinking along these lines.

59
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:57,780
And I learned, I really have since I switched over from paranormal nonfiction to science fiction.

60
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,060
Excuse me.

61
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:11,740
To tell the truth, the Earth, the history of Earth and the science, well, it's a religion too, but it seems weirder.

62
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,980
The truth, or the, well, let's not use that term.

63
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,940
But I wish.

64
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,940
I wish to God.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,600
I find myself more and more as I understand that kind of relearned scientific crap.

66
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:31,120
I wish that I'd paid more attention to math and chemistry back when I had a mind.

67
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,580
You know what I'm saying?

68
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,620
They blow my mind.

69
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,960
They totally blow my mind.

70
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,380
I wish I could understand them better.

71
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:45,820
Because to some of us, math and chemistry sort of explain how everything works and what everything is made of.

72
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,900
Now, a lot of people will.

73
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,340
Some of you will disagree with that and say, well, science is a religion too.

74
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,180
Which is quite true.

75
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,240
It does take a long time for that establishment to shift gears.

76
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,600
But it will eventually shift gears.

77
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,640
They're all out to tear each other down just like rival cults are.

78
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:16,780
Now, and others would say, no, the cause of mine, in fact, the impression that I get from most of my religious nut friends is that, no, no, the universe, the cosmos is not composed of.

79
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:24,160
It's not composed of chemistry and math, but of pure, great, deep, which is fine.

80
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,620
And if that explains things to you, that's wonderful.

81
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:34,020
Math, for the instance, has gotten so weird and surreal that it might as well be magic and requires a certain amount of faith.

82
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,500
Even modern day science doesn't.

83
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,780
I mean, when you get down to it, atoms and their component parts aren't considered things anymore.

84
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,580
But rather little patterns or eddies.

85
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,840
In the energy fields.

86
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,060
In other words, atoms aren't things and neither are we.

87
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,340
We're all just patterns.

88
00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:07,020
And therefore, why are we so important that we deserve to know the cosmic secrets behind where you go after you die and who started the universe and why and what's it all about?

89
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,360
Do we really want to know, friends?

90
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,760
Because it might actually turn out to be far simpler than we thought.

91
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,120
And it might even turn out not to be fair.

92
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,140
And, you know, for some people, that just leaves them cold.

93
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:41,020
Plus, you know, it's hard to understand the terms like a light year or much less a million light years or a million years or, you know, an electron and so forth.

94
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,560
Those things are actually kind of hard to comprehend.

95
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,760
And it does leave people feverish.

96
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:55,500
Feeling very unfulfilled and alone and requiring a soul and other, you know, accessories that kind of go with that whole thing.

97
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:09,320
Now, if I happen to die and find myself in a tunnel of light opening into this vast new awareness of everything that I never could have conceived possible, I'm not going to complain.

98
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,500
You won't.

99
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,700
But if I die and I'm just dead, you likewise won't hear.

100
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,200
You won't hear me complain.

101
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,480
I like to think, like most people, too, that there is a side two to the tape.

102
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,940
But we better hope Bob or somebody remembers to flip the damn tape.

103
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,500
It better be make your tape a good tape so that they want to flip it.

104
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,240
You know what I mean?

105
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,160
They may just go, that one sucks.

106
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,900
Throw it out.

107
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,680
And sell that with a, you know, re-record over that one.

108
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,200
Wow.

109
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,760
I never had thought about that.

110
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:55,720
But, you know, on the other hand, perhaps my beloved friends back in Dallas, the Southern Baptists are right.

111
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,780
And when I die, I'll go to hell forever.

112
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,640
Be tortured for eternity.

113
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,620
Which would prove the existence of Satan to me.

114
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,860
Certainly not God.

115
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,520
But I have a problem with some of those, my rival religious nuts.

116
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,160
Because they, I don't know.

117
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,740
I always felt like.

118
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:24,480
My God, whatever, however you want to take that, probably is doing okay without my help.

119
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,660
As far as I can tell.

120
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,500
I'm not that important of a cog in all reality, exactly.

121
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,940
And, but a lot of people don't seem to think so highly of their God or even of their nature and so forth.

122
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,760
They kind of, you get the impression they think that God is like some little kid, some child, or some tinkerbell.

123
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,680
That needs.

124
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
The help.

125
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,340
Of illiterate little old human believers.

126
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,320
Real badly.

127
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,380
Or else, he'll dry up and blow away just like Tinkerbell if the kids don't applaud.

128
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,840
And believe enough.

129
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,520
You know, if you don't believe enough, poor God, she's gonna die.

130
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,240
Well, I'm sorry.

131
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,160
But if I was God, I'd be a hell of a lot more impressed with, for instance, the subgeniuses

132
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,700
who at least are willing to take some responsibility for their own .

133
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:15,820
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,200
I'm sorry.

135
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,560
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:16,660
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,660


138
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,660


139
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,660


140
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,660


141
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,660


142
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,660


143
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,660


144
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,660


145
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,660


146
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,660


147
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,660


148
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,660


149
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,160
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,660
You know, is God Tinkerbell?

151
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,980
Is God a bigger wuss than me?

152
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,340
Is God scared of, I don't think so.

153
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,180
We used to declare every revival, we'd declare war on God.

154
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,780
You know, if it's that kind of a f***ing situation, why not?

155
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,800
And, that's why we really do think that the gods are a lot more impressed with those who,

156
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,640
as we address them, we don't need to be a God.

157
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:46,640


158
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:46,640


159
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:46,640


160
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:46,640


161
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:46,640


162
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:46,640


163
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:46,640


164
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:46,640


165
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:54,360
we to use another the term in another way those of us who can build our own ship you know because

166
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:01,420
you can look at the phrase that's a new subgenius catchword it's a joint einstein secret orchestra

167
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:07,680
and church of the subgenius catchword build your own ship that can also be taken very metaphorically

168
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,140
doesn't mean you have to build or steal a spaceship and achieve orbit velocity velocity

169
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:23,000
that's really scary and without the help of space aliens I've been told but you know you build your

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,840
own mental ship you know build your own world in your head it's not real and if you stub your toe

171
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:39,500
it's still gonna hurt but if whatever it takes to get you through the day if you want to believe in

172
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,000
anything you know and just don't shove it in our

173
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:52,800
faces don't get me wrong this is a surprise that some people want to sound like a little vigilante

174
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:01,540
Carl Sagan or Isaac Asimov every now and then but I've heard the voice of the sand friends I've ridden

175
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:10,260
the snake I've I guess you could say I've seen the so-called well I've seen the flight life and that

176
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,400
happened before I ever even tried

177
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:19,680
that fucking time we weren't lucky enough to find out 70 thousand people evidence because

178
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:27,980
it redundant well rip

179
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,900
that's the line we weren't seeing in the following 26 thing is you know some are

180
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,260
laying

181
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:50,260
in space and actually are fascinated with the mechanics of creating an enclosed environment

182
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:56,660
that's not necessarily natural but mimics of one in such a way that it'll last just as long

183
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:03,860
so that you can travel in it and friends we we're not i mean i don't seriously expect to see much

184
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:13,320
of that in my own lifetime but we do this for the children friends to keep the dream alive

185
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:21,020
we talk about this stuff a whole lot just as the older when i was a kid my older generation wanted

186
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:28,860
to send us off to vietnam so we could lose our legs over nothing well by the same token i want

187
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,660
to see my children sent off in little flimsy tin cans lined with explosives

188
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:39,920
and bolts hurtling at unimaginable speeds through the most hostile environment possible

189
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:52,560
to only go where no human has gone before and fill space only with subgeniuses and that is why friends

190
00:13:53,620 --> 00:14:03,540
i find that the research into uh space travel um it's expensive and there's a lot of problems

191
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:03,840
here and there and i think that's why i'm here today and i'm here to talk about the research

192
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:03,840


193
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,680
at home that we have to deal with but you know that research tells us an awful lot about the

194
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:19,040
spaceship we're already on the one we all got stuck with the one we stole and it's an old one

195
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,340
it's seven billion some odd years old i don't know and it's but that's a lot of design you know that's

196
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:31,620
a seven billion years worth of design has gone into it and uh it works pretty cool really i mean

197
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,820
in fact it generally works so well that we don't have to worry about it anymore we can just go and

198
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:33,980
do a little bit more with it and we can do a little bit more with it and i think it's a great project

199
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:33,980


200
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,400
probably have a better solution now but we tend to take it for granted and think it'll run itself

201
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:46,560
and you know that's to some extent that's true it doesn't need us but um but since we've wiped out

202
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,840
all the other tool using primate bipeds uh we are the you might say that we're the focused

203
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:01,320
eyes and hands of the biosphere, let's call it. We're the only ones left with hands.

204
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:11,660
And I got to thinking about that, our place on this earth as badass primates.

205
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:19,460
I was looking at my dog. I was feeding my dog. In fact, I was opening the door and got to the dog food sack

206
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:27,340
and got the big scoop and scooped the stuff into his bowl and put the bowl back where he feels comfortable eating.

207
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,280
And I wondered to myself, do dogs envy hands?

208
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:42,940
Does my dog Ghost stare at me doing those routines and think to himself, I wish I could do that.

209
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,340
I wish I could. I've seen him do a couple of things that I kind of thought I could do.

210
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,220
Better.

211
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,820
I'll find out if he's friendly first.

212
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:58,520
But I decided, yes, yes, he does envy hands. He's not a complete dumbass.

213
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,580
And to tell the truth, there's something we primates are very good at, which is grooming.

214
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,860
We, you know, pick each other's fleas, so to speak.

215
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:15,340
When I'm petting that one, or one of my kids is petting that dog, he's digging it.

216
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,340
And he can't get that from another dog.

217
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:24,080
Now, by the same token, you know, I can't supply the pheromones that he wants for certain other things.

218
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:30,460
But boy, I can ruffle that animal's hair on his back better than any other dog can because I've got hands.

219
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:42,480
And that, so I stopped and that made me realize that our place in the biosphere, we're the Tyrannosauruses, friends.

220
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,420
We are the monsters and the gods.

221
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:56,980
We are the serious, well, primates can kick all the other species' asses that are larger than ten microns.

222
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:08,000
The other ones that are smaller than really tiny ones can still kick our asses any time they want to mutate a little ways over.

223
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:14,540
And so that's why, you know, yeah, it's real fun being the Tyrannosaurus of the planet.

224
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,400
But being the Tyrannosaurus of the universe.

225
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,040
I mean, the Tyrannosaurus virus cold bug might be even more fun, I don't know.

226
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:31,100
But just as we can groom our dogs or cats or whatever, and they can't quite do those same things for themselves.

227
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:43,880
Now that we've kind of started, I guess we have to, and we have the hands, that means we can either groom the spaceship or the planet ourselves.

228
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,440
Or we can blow it out.

229
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
We can just be dumb asses and just...

230
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,980
And then, of course, I always end up giving these wonderful...

231
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,680
I start off with this war on God and end up with this corny, damn, eco, you know, save the planet crap.

232
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,960
And the fact is, we can afford to worry about it because we're Americans or whatnot.

233
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:09,300
We're in a very industrial, rich, so forth.

234
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:16,020
You know, the developing countries are all going to be using, wanting to use the same free force of the resources that we are.

235
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,260
But they're not going to fret about the niceties like we have.

236
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,640
They're just going to go for it.

237
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,400
Things are going to go real fast.

238
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,180
And I worry sometimes about...

239
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,440
I don't worry about my...

240
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,860
I've got college-age kids.

241
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,160
I don't worry about their generation too much at all.

242
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,200
I don't even worry all that much about their kids' generation.

243
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,880
But the generation after that...

244
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,080
Well, actually, it's best, probably best not to make predictions, friends.

245
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,300
Unless they're divinely inspired.

246
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,320
And I just ain't up for that anymore.

247
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:02,200
And that's all that I had to say about the assigned material.

248
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,580
And you get to be the first subgenius into space.

249
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,060
Well, I don't mind being the first.

250
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,600
If you get your car started.

251
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,240
Where are you sitting, Dave?

252
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,060
I'm sitting in a porcelain room surrounded by...

253
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,500
It looks like barbed wire I can see out of a little window.

254
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,720
And there's a little bit of snow coming in through the window.

255
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,940
They put you back in there, didn't they, Dave?

256
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,060
They tried to.

257
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,200
I don't really know if I'm in a safe house now or if that's where they took me back to.

258
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,080
Is it the basement of the auditorium?

259
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,640
Or put me back in the nuthouse?

260
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,060
But it looks to me I've never been in this room before.

261
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,360
What does it smell like?

262
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:56,160
Well, it smells like lackluster violets and what's that other stuff they put on the deceased?

263
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,300
Human urine.

264
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,620
Human urine is in there definitely for sure.

265
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,380
And it looks like some guys in Nazi uniforms marching around out there now.

266
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,240
No, I guess it looks like it says Apex on the back of their shirts.

267
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh, you just...

268
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,940
Dave, you got a job.

269
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,440
I got a job?

270
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,880
Yeah, yeah.

271
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,520
Don't you remember?

272
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,900
You told me about it the other day.

273
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,980
You said you got a job at Apex.

274
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,160
You're one of the executioners.

275
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,860
Yeah, but I...

276
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,860
Whenever they have a prison, man, half of those people cheer for the executioner.

277
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,760
Yeah, but I don't know...

278
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,340
You've got as good a chance as the prisoner when you get out there.

279
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:28,700
Definitely.

280
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,440
I'm not wearing the same kind of clothes with them guys.

281
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,880
You've got a much more weapon than he has and a cooler mask.

282
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah, but see, I don't got the same kind of clothes on that them guys do out there.

283
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,580
Them guys got like cool uniforms.

284
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,800
I got looks like these...

285
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,000
Like a gray prison uniform like them.

286
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,540
They're like some people that they're pulling out of the trucks.

287
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,300
Oh, oh, I'm afraid you got the other guy's job.

288
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,920
Somebody else must have got the executioner job.

289
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,120
I guess you got the victim...

290
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,460
Yeah, that's what it sounds like.

291
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,880
That's funny because he thought it was...

292
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,800
He was telling me what a great job it was.

293
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,360
He said they were paying him $6.50 an hour.

294
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,060
Isn't it wild?

295
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,320
It's just your perspective, you know?

296
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,120
$6.50, a man can build a dream with $6.50.

297
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:10,800
Yeah, for about $5.

298
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,400
He can make a chicken ranch out of sky castles.

299
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,580
For about five minutes against the executioner.

300
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,200
But you do get an axe.

301
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,140
They give you an axe.

302
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,860
It's just not as big as his.

303
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,540
It's not as long.

304
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,320
Huh.

305
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,600
Oh, oh wait, here comes the executioner now.

306
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,580
I was always a clarinet man.

307
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,340
Man.

308
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,720
Boy, they got a cool one this time.

309
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,340
Oh, man.

310
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,420
He looks like Fabio.

311
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,080
Man.

312
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,120
Oh, my God.

313
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,020
He's big.

314
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,520
You're in trouble, Dave.

315
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,700
Is she coming after me?

316
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,940
Boy, listen to the crowd.

317
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,400
Boy, they like the drinkers.

318
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,220
They're going nuts out there.

319
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,500
Yeah.

320
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,160
They like him.

321
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,140
Oh, wow.

322
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,380
I don't think they like you, Dave.

323
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,080
Well, how do they even know I'm in here?

324
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,520
Look at all those thumbs down routines.

325
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,680
Oh, my God.

326
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,360
The executioner ought to be coming in your door in about five minutes.

327
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,280
Did you see the little camera up in the...

328
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,260
You're on the air now, Dave.

329
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,140
It's one of those lipstick-pulled cameras.

330
00:21:59,580 --> 00:21:59,580


331
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,640
We're building up to it.

332
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,540
How long do you think it's going to take her to get up these steps, man?

333
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,400
Her?

334
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,300
That's Fabio coming with the big axe.

335
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,800
That's not Fabio.

336
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,640
She's got curly blonde hair.

337
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,260
I'm not seeing this.

338
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,600
Oh, but...

339
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,120
There she is.

340
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,120


341
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,120


342
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,120


343
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,120


344
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,780
You guys see the same thing?

345
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,300
Listen, you're right.

346
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,300
It's not Fabio.

347
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,480
It's Sister Decadence.

348
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,400
Oh, no, no, no.

349
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,200
A friend from Dallas.

350
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,180
No, the toilet's getting hot.

351
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,380
She's got her feet tall.

352
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,400
Behind you, Dave.

353
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,120
No, no.

354
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,540
I'm up here on the top of the toilet, you guys.

355
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,120
No, calm yourself.

356
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:24,460
Quick.

357
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,740
Pull your belt off.

358
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,580
Throw it over...

359
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:32,180
Loop it over the light bulb attachment, guard chain there, and loop it over your neck and

360
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,960
jump off the toilet.

361
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,720
Okay.

362
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,220
Okay.

363
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,900
I've got my...

364
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,460
No, wait.

365
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,000
No, wait.

366
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,900
No, I was just kidding.

367
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,220
Mrs. Fabio, Decadence should be there any second with the big axe.

368
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:42,960
I've got this thing around.

369
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,600
It's sitting right there.

370
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,080
It's stuck around my neck.

371
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,440
Sir?

372
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,420
What are you doing, sir?

373
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,460
I'm hanging from a ceiling.

374
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:48,980
You're about to meet your destiny.

375
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,360
Get out from under that table.

376
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,280
Please, sir.

377
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,160
Smile for the cameras.

378
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,480
Everyone's watching you.

379
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,680
Half of them are cheering.

380
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,900
Let go of that animal.

381
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,060
Oh, I feel so...

382
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,960
I feel so sorry.

383
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,500
I'm afraid that's not an animal, that little thing, Mrs. Fabio.

384
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:04,780
Oh.

385
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,140
So to speak.

386
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,200
Straighten up and fly right.

387
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,440
Yes.

388
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,280
Please zip yourself up, sir.

389
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,800
You're on live television.

390
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,940
Are you ready to go, Dave?

391
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:12,940


392
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:12,940


393
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:12,940


394
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:12,940


395
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:12,940


396
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:12,940


397
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:12,940


398
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,220
Where are we going now?

399
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,980
Out the runway.

400
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,180
You don't have to worry.

401
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,700
You just go.

402
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,220
What about all this stuff that's all over my chest right now, though?

403
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,300
Is this stuff going to stay on me?

404
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,660
That's lubrication for fitting you into the garbage can.

405
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,160
I don't want to have to go into any more of these small places, man.

406
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,180
Oh, look.

407
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,860
You've been selected.

408
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,860
Now it's thumbs up.

409
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,100
They like you now, Dave.

410
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,380
Yeah, they shaved my head.

411
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,280
And they painted these weird symbols on it.

412
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,160
And look at the great ship rising up out from its underground launching pad.

413
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,920
Well, it's not a very great ship, and they're just being very careful.

414
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:42,920


415
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:42,920


416
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:42,920


417
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,220
I don't know if you dragged it up from the basement, but it's a big trash can, Dave.

418
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,360
Yes, it is a big trash can.

419
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:48,840
It's a tidy can.

420
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,960
It's not a spaceship at all.

421
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:56,340
And there's 18 rockets lashed to it with what look to be dog leashes and old rope,

422
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,840
barbed wire, and the great trash can.

423
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,120
Well, it's not very good.

424
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,180
The tidy can lid is opening up.

425
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,580
Dave, there's your special lawn chair inside.

426
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,020
Back from the fantasy.

427
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,000
It's still in the tunic.

428
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,000
It was.

429
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,680
I'm not losing it.

430
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:12,920
It's not a good idea.

431
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,060
Well, at least you're safe from Fabio decadence.

432
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,880
How are we going to get him back from that module?

433
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,460
I'll take my leg up over the top of this whatever the hand is.

434
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,940
Folks, what happened was Dave locked himself down in the science module.

435
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,420
We're doing the radio show.

436
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,880
That's kind of bad down in here.

437
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,720
Well, yeah, those are the biological experiments.

438
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,600
You've locked yourself in with the biological experiment.

439
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,460
Old diapers and syringes.

440
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,880
Don't let those old diapers lay eggs in your throat, man.

441
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,920
Yeah, we've been using that module for a long time.

442
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:42,920


443
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:42,920


444
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:42,920


445
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:42,920


446
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:42,920


447
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:42,920


448
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:42,920


449
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:42,920


450
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,800
We've been using that module for a garbage can for the last four million miles.

451
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,400
It's where those alien chestbursters go to nurse their young.

452
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Well, I'm in here.

453
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,080
What do I do now?

454
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,260
Keep your mouth shut real tight.

455
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,340
And if you see any of those really big maggots, they have a nasty sting.

456
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,820
Well, there's a lot of maggots down here, man.

457
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,180
What do I do with my nostrils?

458
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,720
Do I have to close the aperture some special way like the yolk guy?

459
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

460
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,560
Don't go to sleep.

461
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,380
Stick a diaper in there or something.

462
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,400
Don't go to sleep.

463
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,280
The diaper's full of maggots, too.

464
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,220
And keep your mouth taped up because those bat things that are flying around with those

465
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,360
big protruding bodies.

466
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,520
Yeah, tape up your mouth.

467
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,560
Everything in here is live.

468
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,100
It's got some crawly coming off of it.

469
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,700
Tape up your...

470
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,380
Everything here's got growing hair on it.

471
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,240
Tape your ears up.

472
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,360
Tape your anus.

473
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:25,900
Huh?

474
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,400
Tape your anus and the head of your penis, too.

475
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,300
There's a lot of people taping that.

476
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,980
I don't know if I've got enough time for this, man.

477
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,200
This is a huge garbage can here, but there's so much stuff going on.

478
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,160
Okay, uh...

479
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,080
And if you have any open wounds, put some duct tape over those.

480
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,600
Well, I'll just crawl.

481
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,140
I'll just crawl up in a corner.

482
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:42,880
I'm just...

483
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,440
Oh, the walls are closing in.

484
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,120
Oh, it's the big...

485
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,740
He's in the compactor section.

486
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,680
No, no.

487
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,600
He can't put me in the compactor.

488
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:50,960
No, no.

489
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,140
He can't put me in the compactor.

490
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,480
Crawl out of there quick, man.

491
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,060
The cars are just a leap of faith for me not to die in this particular instance right now

492
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,080
if I were in a compactor.

493
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,200
Crawl down that spinning blade...

494
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,440
That tunnel there in the center.

495
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,300
That's the disposal.

496
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,400
Climb down there and...

497
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,000
Go toward the light, Dave.

498
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,160
Go toward the light.

499
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,180
Huh?

500
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,340
What?

501
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,320
Go to the light.

502
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,820
And just dive right through the blades.

503
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,140
Okay, here I go.

504
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,460
Here I go.

505
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:11,960
Wait a minute.

506
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,360
I'm going to die.

507
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:12,520
Oh, yeah.

508
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:12,680


509
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:12,740
Go, go, go.

510
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,640
Oh, man.

511
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,100
Oh, man.

512
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,700
Hey, I like this place.

513
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,300
Hey, you made it.

514
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,600
Yay, Dave.

515
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,500
You made it.

516
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:21,900
You made it.

517
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,760
Look at this.

518
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,460
Look at this.

519
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,820
This place is great.

520
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,700
It looks like there's all kinds of pine trees everywhere.

521
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,360
It looks like a glacier over there off in the distance on a snowy mountain.

522
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,320
And there's a lake over there right nearby.

523
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,200
Where is he?

524
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,160
Dave's a winner, not a whiner.

525
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,440
He's a hero, not a zero.

526
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,220
I made my own private space out of my own private hell.

527
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,340
Now I can fly, too.

528
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:42,340


529
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:42,340


530
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:42,340


531
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:42,340


532
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,940
I could live for myself. I am living for myself.

533
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,100
There doesn't seem to be anybody else here.

534
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,060
Dude, I can hear some people.

535
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,240
I can hear noises there behind the rocks.

536
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,600
They're all having a party, Dave.

537
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,920
Should I go over and investigate, or should I just go on back towards the portal again?

538
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,660
I don't know. That's up to you.

539
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,980
Maybe if you're afraid of them, they'll be bad.

540
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,180
But if you're brave, they'll be good.

541
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,420
But maybe they'll be bad no matter what, Dave.

542
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,220
You'll just have to be brave and hope for the best, I guess.

543
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,400
What's my shot if I go back towards the portal?

544
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,180
I mean, I could get shot anywhere else or something?

545
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,600
It's either going wrist bad or...

546
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,820
What? You haven't had your shot?

547
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,660
No, I haven't had my shot yet.

548
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,820
No wonder you're down there, man.

549
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,540
None of this has happened.

550
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,460
You just haven't had your shot yet.

551
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,280
I've got one of them little glycerin packs stacked to the inside of my leg,

552
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,540
on the inside of my thigh where my testicles reach over.

553
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,280
No, that's for your venereal diseases, Dave.

554
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,640
The experimental ones that we gave you.

555
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,260
And all of your people.

556
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,840
Okay, what's these little pills then?

557
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,260
These little pink pills you gave me in my pocket?

558
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,000
Those are your dinner.

559
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,180
Those are our dinner?

560
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,040
Yeah, go ahead.

561
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,540
One of them should taste just like turkey pot pot.

562
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,140
But I ain't hungry right now.

563
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,140
Well, don't eat it.

564
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:55,740
Okay.

565
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,000
Save it for later.

566
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,100
I don't need it anymore.

567
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,460
Anything else I gotta know besides meat and cheese?

568
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,100
Those are supposed to last you a week.

569
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,560
That one pill?

570
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:02,980
I hope you've...

571
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,880
You only have one pill?

572
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,860
No, I've got two pills in here, but one pill is like a half a week or...

573
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,280
No, no, no, Dave.

574
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:09,920
Dave.

575
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,960
You guys have lost the other ones or something.

576
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,480
There's only two pills in here.

577
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,540
No wonder you're not hungry.

578
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,860
You've been eating your pills again, haven't you?

579
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,160
Dave.

580
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,620
And you haven't had your shots.

581
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,120
He's been eating the pills, but he didn't have the shots.

582
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,280
Smooth move, ex-Dave.

583
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,520
Really beautiful.

584
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Well, you know, I was kind of not really in control of my thoughts at the time.

585
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,440
And I tend to, like, when I wander off, I start chewing on things.

586
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,640
My fingernails, am and am, just anything at hand.

587
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,360
And I felt these little lumpy things in my pocket.

588
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,400
Now, you mean I'm going to be full for three weeks now?

589
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,460
Well, I think I'm going to have one myself right now.

590
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:44,800
Huh?

591
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,380
Oh, this must have been yours.

592
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,180
Sorry, man.

593
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,940
Is that the one with the guacamole dip on it?

594
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,520
Well, if you find any bodies, look in their pockets.

595
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,800
Any bodies?

596
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,460
Yeah.

597
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,400
They'll probably have the pills.

598
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,540
I'm going to be finding corpses now in here?

599
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,420
This is a beautiful, idyllic lake scene, and now I'm going to be finding corpses here?

600
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,240
Hey, it ain't our fault.

601
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,340
You locked yourself in there.

602
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,120
You shut the door.

603
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,100
The airlock's sealed.

604
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,580
You know, guys...

605
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,640
Well, you're the one who wanted to wear the moon pants.

606
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,220
Yeah.

607
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,940
I thought you were going to be so trendy.

608
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,740
Like, it's our fault.

609
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:14,640
Really?

610
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,360
Well, let me ask you one question here, then.

611
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,260
Okay, and it doesn't appear to be any sort of panorama or any kind of, like, vista or anything.

612
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,280
It just appears like it's just, like, a flat thing, and yet you can go into it.

613
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,680
Now, you guys are saying I'm actually in another room.

614
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,100
Have you tried changing the channel?

615
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,460
Oh, he probably didn't even know about the remote control.

616
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,120
These, you know...

617
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,540
No, I don't.

618
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,680
We're an amateur.

619
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:37,700
All this astronaut training that we have to put Dave through is really starting to wear me down as well.

620
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,840
Yeah, but you guys said I was going to be on it.

621
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,240
Last week, we had him in the centrifuge for 42 hours.

622
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,920
It was great.

623
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,400
We cranked it all the way up.

624
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,300
It wouldn't go any faster.

625
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,720
We burned out the motor completely.

626
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,780
And, Dave, you were so happy because it got rid of your constipation.

627
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,800
Yeah, but, see, after that all went out, then I started astral traveling, too.

628
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,080
And there was nothing left up there but this spinning, evacuating body.

629
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,900
Oh, yeah, that's what you always say.

630
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,620
So I went astral traveling.

631
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,560
Well, what else am I going to do when they're pulling my bowels out at 5,000 miles an hour?

632
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,320
David, you know it.

633
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:09,600
Huh?

634
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:15,280
You just can't prove that you left the centrifuge.

635
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,640
It feels like I just ate a ton of alum or that stuff that makes you pucker up and everything.

636
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,560
I ain't got no more.

637
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,640
I looked down and my ribs are sticking out.

638
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,960
Something must have happened to me.

639
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,860
There's all these lacerations on my arms.

640
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,020
Go talk to Ashley.

641
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,400
Who's Ashley?

642
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,540
Is mine with you?

643
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,160
No, she's over in the corner, too.

644
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,560
Ashley?

645
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,500
Just march yourself right over.

646
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,700
It's the way it's been done for billions of years.

647
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,500
It's the way it's been done for billions of years.

648
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,180
Just go over there and introduce yourself to her.

649
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,700
Dave, just...

650
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,960
Ashley, Erica, Connie.

651
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,400
You mean there's like...

652
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,660
Who are the other ones in that picture?

653
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,560
There's like babes over there beyond them rocks.

654
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,920
Not a bunch of, like, say, French savages that might beat me to death with clubs like you had mentioned.

655
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,620
No, I mean, yeah, well, Nikki Deathcheck.

656
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,040
Nikki.

657
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:57,860
Decadence.

658
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,980
Sister Decadence.

659
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,340
And sure, they'll kick your butt, but they're not going to really...

660
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,880
I mean, that's a holy spanking ritual, you know, and that's the sacred throttling...

661
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,020
The furry, at least.

662
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:08,780
...ceremony.

663
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,420
Susie, that's...

664
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,560
Did you know furry Elise?

665
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,960
Yeah, that's just a sacred reaming ordeal.

666
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,300
Furry Elise was Beethoven's favorite girlfriend.

667
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,560
Oh, yeah, I remember her.

668
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,620
She was really sweet.

669
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,740
Three penny opera.

670
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,340
She had a real loud voice.

671
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,000
She had to yell a lot.

672
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,780
She was real hairy.

673
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,500
Yeah.

674
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,860
That was the...

675
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,460
Yet he yelled.

676
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,220
...hairsuit.

677
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,300
Well, if I go over there, is the camera going to follow me?

678
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,060
I don't even know.

679
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:35,420
I think we ought to stick it over the side and see what's going on for it before I risk my whatever it is.

680
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,260
The camera's in your tooth, Dave.

681
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:37,600
Huh?

682
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,520
Dave has all...

683
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,000
He also has one of those cameras that just hover above him.

684
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,220
Everywhere he goes, it goes with him, just hovering.

685
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,380
Oh, man, that little...

686
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,040
It's shaped like a tiny rain cloud, so that it'll look more...

687
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,420
I mean, you can never see it because it stays right out of your...

688
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,560
If you turn really fast, you might see it for just a fraction of a second.

689
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,600
If he turns to your left or your right, really fast.

690
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,380
That's that thing that you see in the corner of your eye once in a while, Dave?

691
00:31:59,520 --> 00:31:59,680
Right.

692
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,300
You ever wonder why people laugh at you in point?

693
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,520
No, I never wonder why they laugh.

694
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,380
And you turn around to see what they're laughing at, and you don't see anything, and they just laugh even louder.

695
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,500
It's why you're a subgenius, Dave.

696
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,680
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

697
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,620
I actually seen them remote, child.

698
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,240
Not only out of the corner of my eye, one time I managed to turn around quick enough and catch it off guard.

699
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,620
And it looked like this little silver ball with an eyeball in it.

700
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:28,340
And it, like, the eyeball was looking right after, and it was, like, kind of going up and down, jiggling a little bit.

701
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,280
And I could hear laughter.

702
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:35,120
I could hear, like, not only it laughing, but it sounded like the people at the movies were laughing at me, too.

703
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,380
And it sounded like maybe the guy behind me would have fallen asleep.

704
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,840
And the people was laughing really, really hard.

705
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,460
But I knew when I saw that thing that things weren't the way you guys said they were.

706
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,460
You guys got me all the time, 24 hours under surveillance.

707
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,580
Well, the ratings haven't been bad.

708
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,100
They did a movie based on you called The Truman Show.

709
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,840
You know, I just hope this is all worth it.

710
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,820
I hope he's ready to go on July 5th, because the rocket will be ready.

711
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,780
But will Dave be ready?

712
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:07,140
Well, we certainly have put him through a battery of psychological tests.

713
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,360
Yeah, well.

714
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:14,020
I didn't very much like having my head put in that thing for two and a half hours while everybody poked little things in my butt.

715
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,480
But, Dave, come this summer, you're going to be a hero, man.

716
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,760
Yeah, well, I'll...

717
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,160
Did you ever know that you're my hero?

718
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,160
Well, I already feel like the sole of somebody's shoes.

719
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:28,120
I feel like I've been stepped on and walked on dog duty and everything else.

720
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,660
I'm on dog duty.

721
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,400
I've been on dog duty all night.

722
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,660
Well, sometimes they'll keep you up for three days.

723
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,600
No, that was test 24.

724
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,500
Keeping him up for three days.

725
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,380
Three days while the dog duty...

726
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,240
Well, you told me I failed that one, and I had to do it over again.

727
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,740
And they were just going to put me...

728
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,700
They were going to mark it off that someday in the future I could make it up.

729
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,620
You only have...

730
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:48,960
We mark it of the types.

731
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,440
There's only 74 more tests for you to go through, Dave.

732
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,940
One time, I was traveling across the country.

733
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,640
And we were driving through Arkansas.

734
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,960
And we had to stop and get gasoline.

735
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:23,580
So we pulled into one of those gasoline jiffy parts with the motor oil and cowboy boots and CB radios.

736
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:35,840
And as I was filling up the gas tank, I noticed this rather large, large, somewhat dim-witted gentleman enter the building.

737
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,040
And I went in to pay for the gasoline.

738
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:55,680
And the gentleman was standing in front of the glass heater with the hot dogs and the chicken wings and the baked potatoes.

739
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,400
And the lady at the counter said,

740
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,540
What can I do for you, darling?

741
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,280
And he said,

742
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,740
I'll have a potato.

743
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,460
And she said to him,

744
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,640
What'll you have on that potato there, darling?

745
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,360
And he said,

746
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,040
Nothing.

747
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,360
I'll just have...

748
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,820
The...

749
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,540
Potato.

750
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,860
Have a thing for you.

751
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:57,860


752
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:57,860


753
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:57,860


754
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,060


755
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,060


756
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,060


757
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,060


758
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:58,180


759
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:58,180


760
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,300
Dad, look what happened.

761
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,340
It's our car.

762
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,800
Viva Vita, Vita Vita!

763
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,340
That Juicy-Way Davis向 http://VT.com.id.htm

764
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,500
And it's a Uер before my nose.

765
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:08,500


766
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,520
Like a dog without a bone

767
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,420
And active out of love

768
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,360
Riders on the store

769
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,560
Riders on the store

770
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,220
Riders on the store

771
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,560
Riders on the store

772
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,520
Riders on the store

773
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,020
Riders on the store

774
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,240
Riders on the store

775
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,160
Riders on the store

776
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:00,320
Riders on the store

777
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,760
The worms are not bugs.

778
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,900
They must be for the mandible.

779
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,500
Told you.

780
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:08,500


781
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,420
Someday we'll all be worms. Someday we'll all be king of worms.

782
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,160
Someday we'll be the duke and the jolly squire. We'll be all the worms.

783
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,420
And their masters.

784
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,480
No, the master is he who has the mandible.

785
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:31,300
The worm is but the parasite upon the great mandibular god, the stag beetle.

786
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:36,280
I never had it. I don't want to be a worm. I don't want to live with it. I don't want worms crawling. I don't want worms in me.

787
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,060
The alpha male of the insect kingdom.

788
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:40,760
Blue.

789
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,640
Blue.

790
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,180
The Madagascar scorpion.

791
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,880
Purple and silver.

792
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,020
With mandibles that can crush the head of a stag beetle.

793
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,320
Pink and opaque beige.

794
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:59,020
But that can pierce the hide of a rhinoceros.

795
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,020
Blood red.

796
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,740
Pierce the rind.

797
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:12,840
And we're back at Pierce the Rhino, America's favorite efoliant game for ejaculating and emaciating small and large animals.

798
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,360
Today we've got a rhinoceros all the way from the Congo.

799
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:23,400
And the round government was kind enough to loan us this huge hippopotamus along as well we can take apart in the next half an hour or so.

800
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:29,400
But first, Derek, what do you think about when you pulled its little, well, not little, 200-pound foot right off with that?

801
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,560
Well.

802
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:42,840
I think the spectators at the arena here are going to really enjoy the rhino and the hippopotamus facing off against the giant Madagascar scorpion.

803
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:49,460
The two-ton mutated Madagascar scorpion made by the scientists here in Dobstown.

804
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,160
And God.

805
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,220
Well, what do you think about the new gladiators we got here to work with?

806
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,400
Some of them, Belzor, the Madagascar centipede.

807
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,760
Well, those aren't really gladiators.

808
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,700
Those are more along the lines of rodeo clowns, Dave.

809
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,300
Um.

810
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,220
And you should.

811
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,680
You should pay attention because you'll be joining them down there in the pit.

812
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,900
They're basically down there to clean up after the dinosaurs and the giant scorpions, the rhino and hippo.

813
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,640
Well, until.

814
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,080
They're a bucket brigade, you might say.

815
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:11,820
A bucket brigade.

816
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:17,240
And they have funny antics that they perform as the large animals battle around them.

817
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,560
Well, we heard that some of them actually do.

818
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,980
Gore and trample them.

819
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,820
Well, we heard some of them gore and trample some of them back.

820
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:30,560
I don't know if this is really a true story, but whether they're just rodeo clowns or not, it could be something a little bit stranger, a little bit.

821
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:30,720
Uh.

822
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,480
More inhumane.

823
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,520
Well, there are.

824
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:33,900
Perhaps.

825
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:44,340
Perhaps we've got these animal rights activists complaining that not only is it wrong to pit rhinos and hippopotami against these giant mutated animals and.

826
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,280
Shhh.

827
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,340
Dinosaurs.

828
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,340
Giant Madagascar scorpions and so forth are large, huge armored creatures.

829
00:39:53,560 --> 00:40:00,860
But that to even diddle with the genes made by God and create these creatures.

830
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,260
At all.

831
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,260
Some of these people think it's a sin.

832
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,120
We've had these animal rights fanatics.

833
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,620
What did I know?

834
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,900
Show has armored creatures.

835
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:17,260
These mutated giant insects have as much of a right to life as any human or rhinoceros.

836
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:30,760
And if Dobbs, in his great boredom, wishes to see a rare albino white rhinoceros battle to the death this giant mutated Madagascar scorpion.

837
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,080
Then by Dobbs, so be it.

838
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,860
Well, that's.

839
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,060
And we're not here to argue.

840
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:41,160
We're here to wait and kill time until they finally let the animals out of the gate.

841
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,760
Well, that's just one.

842
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,900
You can see the rodeo clowns milling around there in their gladiator costumes.

843
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Well, that's just one.

844
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,420
And their buckets.

845
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:56,880
Well, that's just one of the reasons, Reverend Ivan Stang, why some of the people at the Animal Creation Institute feel that perhaps you've not gone too far.

846
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,700
You perhaps haven't gone far enough.

847
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,740
And what good does it do Madagascar?

848
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:09,320
It's very kind to pit a rare albino mushroom or rhinoceros against any hippo creatures, whether they're large or small.

849
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:14,020
It seems to me you're taking advantage of the little buffaloes and hurting them needlessly.

850
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:14,720
Oh, it does.

851
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,680
You are absolutely right.

852
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:23,340
We gain no additional scientific knowledge by the torture of these animals.

853
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:28,160
But our rajah, Dobbs, the master.

854
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,680
That's wanted to see the fight.

855
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,720
So here we are.

856
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:37,540
And I wish they'd hurry up and get this horrible thing over with.

857
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,160
Look at those milling Malaysian natives and subgeniuses.

858
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,160
It is awful.

859
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,320
But some of them are so well sinewed and muscled.

860
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:53,400
It makes me wonder they just might make the greatest gladiators ever if you were to feed them to one of those, perhaps one of those Komodo dragons there that hasn't been fed in a week or something.

861
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,600
I guess you weren't here last week, Dave.

862
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,340
No, I missed.

863
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,380
And it was supposed to be great.

864
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:57,800
That's why.

865
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,780
It was supposed to be great.

866
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,520
That's right.

867
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:06,300
They were fed a week ago and they're still excreting bits of the armor from the gladiators, plastic armor.

868
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,360
The gladiators have made it.

869
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:14,060
By the way, they make that themselves out of castaway PCP pipe and so forth.

870
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,540
Castaway PCP?

871
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:22,060
From the castle building, the ongoing building of the Dobbs Castle here in Dobbstown, Malaysia.

872
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,540
Well, Dobbstown certainly is a beautiful place for the gladiatorial games we've got going on right now.

873
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,140
And one of the favorites is Pluvus Maximor.

874
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,920
And he was a semi impale last week.

875
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,100
But he used to be Gary Mitchell.

876
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,620
He used to be known as Gary Mitchell.

877
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,460
Previously was Gary Mitchell.

878
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:36,660
Reverend Gary Mitchell.

879
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,480
Reverend Gary Mitchell.

880
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,480
From that list.

881
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,880
And now he is, because of some unknown sin, he's about to be thrown into the pit.

882
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:49,820
And right after that disemboweling, too, you think he's going to be able to scamper around with that much meat gone?

883
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,840
He's a subgenius.

884
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,980
Oh, my no.

885
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:56,920
Well, we all are here, too, but I certainly wouldn't want to be in those little Spanish shoes he's wearing right now.

886
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:05,680
Well, what can you say about a Timor, the guy who has the extremely large mandibles and actually goes for the groin area?

887
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,980
Well, he doesn't go for the groins of the hippo, does he?

888
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,140
No.

889
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,460
Well, I see in it, things can turn out like they should.

890
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:42,460


891
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,540
And another thing that I'm going to try to face when I see that is both Arian Easter egg and wanted Mmmm.

892
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:46,540
I'm sorry.

893
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,660
But he wasn't like, Tril不了 em musaten.

894
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:50,660


895
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:50,960
Personally, I'm worried about that.

896
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,300
But, oh, no.

897
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:52,160


898
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,320
Pluto just squirted all over everything, huh?

899
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,080
Speaking of Planet X, to change the subject here, kids,

900
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:29,000
Princess We saw the most mysterious two bumper stickers on a car

901
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,720
that suggest a rival cult, not unlike the Church of the Subgenius mayhaps.

902
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,360
Huh. And what is the... We dare not say the name.

903
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,740
Should we or is that out of station?

904
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,040
Well, go ahead and read those words.

905
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,700
Yeah, she wrote them down.

906
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:49,920
They said, drive away Loshan Hora

907
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,700
and build more.

908
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:53,840
Mostos.

909
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,280
I think those people can't spell.

910
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,320
I think what you got was like them guys who like to whip up bumper stickers for themselves,

911
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,480
you know, on their bowling team.

912
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,020
No, man, I mean, think about it.

913
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,720
Drive away Loshan Hora.

914
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,480
These were really, really efficient.

915
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,640
What language is that?

916
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,380
That's New Age cult language, man.

917
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,600
And Mostos.

918
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,320
What is that?

919
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,500
That's New Age language.

920
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,100
That's alien gray channeling language.

921
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:21,060
Drive away Loshan Hora obviously means the same as, you know,

922
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,000
fight Negi, fight the...

923
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,620
Conspiracy, fight Babylon, you know.

924
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,060
Drive away Loshan Hora, drive away Babylon.

925
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,740
Whereas build Mostos, duh, build your own...

926
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:33,840
Mostos.

927
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:34,400
Mostos.

928
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:34,840
Mostos.

929
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,920
Well, MOS, DOS, isn't that computer talk for like having a hillbilly erection

930
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,560
or one of those, like a bad feet disease?

931
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,600
MOS...

932
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,300
That's what it is.

933
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,960
It's probably Microsoft cult.

934
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,880
Yeah, MOS.

935
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,580
That's what it is.

936
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,440
Mostos.

937
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,440
That's like, that's probably micro talk for...

938
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,640
And Loshan Hora is a new system?

939
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,060
No, that probably is...

940
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,080
That's their word for Apple.

941
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,900
No, that probably is the Hora of Babylon right there.

942
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,940
Drive away Loshan Hora.

943
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,500
Loshan Hora of Babylon.

944
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:06,120
No, actually that would be, rather than Apple, it would be Linux and MP3s.

945
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,640
That's what Loshan Hora represents.

946
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,060
Loshan Hora of the apocalypse.

947
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:17,000
This is the conspiracies version of, it's like the reverse Church of the Subgenius.

948
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:17,300
Yeah.

949
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:22,580
I think they obviously, they used the same, they ripped off the same basic formula.

950
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,420
I'm gonna throw another log in the fire here.

951
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,860
It's gone down a little bit here.

952
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,540
Let me...

953
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,020
They, uh...

954
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:27,720
Yeah, it's kind of...

955
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,140
I was wondering...

956
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,060
I love stoking the fire.

957
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,060
The air was getting awfully clear.

958
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:38,840
What are you burning there besides the fecal matter of those, um, those animals, whatever

959
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,340
you want to call them, that you've captured?

960
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,960
These little pills.

961
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,840
You're burning the pills too?

962
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,540
Yep, computers won't work.

963
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,820
Well, they say that if you have enough fat cells in your body...

964
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,580
The Y19999...

965
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:52,540
Y19999...

966
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:52,560
Y19999...

967
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:52,560


968
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:52,560


969
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:52,560


970
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:52,560


971
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:52,560


972
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:57,460
1.9999k bug struck a little earlier than the Y2K bug.

973
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,680
And then you guys had some problems?

974
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,040
In the studio there?

975
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:05,360
I mean, I knew, uh, earlier I saw some flames coming out of the window as I was driving by.

976
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,180
Nobody can go to the bathroom.

977
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,600
What, did it overflow or...?

978
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,240
No, they can't go to the bathroom.

979
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,180
You can't get in.

980
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,400
You can't open the door.

981
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,640
You can't urinate.

982
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,580
You can't watch numbers through the floor.

983
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:17,500
You can't do anything.

984
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:21,780
You can't write scroll 666 and Satan rules on the mirror or nothing?

985
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,100
No.

986
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:22,480
None of that.

987
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:22,620
None of that.

988
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:27,880
Those who read these words of wit, leave those little...

989
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:34,780
For a good time, call Reverend Ivan Stang and then the church number there.

990
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,700
Yeah, 1-888-669-2323.

991
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,040
Did you hear about that Illuminati conspiracy?

992
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:50,920
Yes, they're keeping Pope Bob Wilson at home from Winterstar, and that's why we have to preach.

993
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:51,420
Preach.

994
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,520
Yeah.

995
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:59,720
Luckily, I have a videotape of Pope Bob ranting just a month ago in Austin.

996
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,780
When are you coming, Dave?

997
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,360
Which I shot.

998
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,640
When is it, Dave?

999
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,140
When are you coming?

1000
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,160
When are you coming, Dave?

1001
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,360
Let me rephrase that.

1002
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,460
Yeah, really.

1003
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,340
I don't know if I'll ever be able to do that again with these clamps on.

1004
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,220
There's a reason for those clamps.

1005
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,020
Miles and miles of nipple clamps.

1006
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,040
Miles and miles.

1007
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,480
There's an album or something.

1008
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,200
There's an album.

1009
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,000
There's an album actually called Miles and Miles of Cock Rings.

1010
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,280
Miles and Miles of Cock Rings.

1011
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,740
That sounds like a hallucination.

1012
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,920
It's like a punkish album, I guess.

1013
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,060
I don't know what it is.

1014
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,340
Somebody told me about it.

1015
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:40,540
Well, there's been such a proliferation of weird emaciation cults and people that have taken the modern primitive things one step further.

1016
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,700
That's been forbidden for the last seven years.

1017
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,740
Most of the natives have their money.

1018
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,740
He's the favorite to win the giant mutated scorpion.

1019
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:50,680
It has the intelligence.

1020
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,940
Of a chimpanzee and is as fast as a cheetah.

1021
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:54,160
Incredible.

1022
00:48:54,560 --> 00:49:02,200
It just absolutely, not even the rare albino rhino has a chance against it.

1023
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:18,440
And that horn, by the way, of course, the horn on the rhino as well as the claws of the mutated scorpion and the hippo's teeth will all be ground up and made into Dob's own special brand of Viagra.

1024
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:19,760
Dob's brand.

1025
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,180
The Dobstown Viagra.

1026
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:21,540
Viagra.

1027
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,400
Aphrodisiac.

1028
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:28,220
The aphrodisiac powder that you're mentioning coming from all the different horny rhinoceros and so forth.

1029
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:36,820
The FDA has been investigating whether some of these substances are not really just your own mucous excretions or pieces of your hair.

1030
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:42,140
I can imagine they are investigating because the fact is these substances actually work.

1031
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,960
They are magic, as you claim.

1032
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,180
They are, in fact, foolproof aphrodisiacs.

1033
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,540
They are, in fact, the very fountain of youth.

1034
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,960
I have to go back to my job of oiling.

1035
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,120
I'm going to see news bodies.

1036
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,460
Is it all right if I go back to my job now?

1037
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,880
Oh, yes, please do.

1038
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:57,580
You can go right now.

1039
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,220
But don't forget the cream.

1040
00:49:59,420 --> 00:49:59,900
The cream.

1041
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,380
All right.

1042
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,100
I'll remember the cream.

1043
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:09,380
So there's quite a market for the leftover.

1044
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,980
As you were asking, is there a scientific reason for this fight?

1045
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,820
No, it's just for Dob's entertainment and enjoyment.

1046
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,700
But also we try to not waste the resource of the...

1047
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:26,100
...the rare white rhinoceros horn and the ankylosaurus tailbone and so forth.

1048
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:31,080
And by the way, that ankylosaurus tailbone ground up is the last of its kind.

1049
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:37,580
But supposedly that will make you as hard as an ankylosaurus tailbone.

1050
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,180
It's funny how that logic works.

1051
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:44,160
Among many others, I've been flaccid in my day and I know what it's like.

1052
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:50,680
And I certainly believe that everything you're doing here at the Gladiatorial Games is probably for the benefit of...

1053
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:50,880
...the benefit of mankind.

1054
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,080
I'm sorry, Hendo.

1055
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,200
Would you like some tiger penis sprinkled on the ice cream there?

1056
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,660
Do you have it with the honey flavor and the cinnamon or is it the pepper one?

1057
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,260
Could I...

1058
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,880
Oh, you want the pepper one.

1059
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,960
It's made from Spanish fly.

1060
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,900
So you're going...

1061
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,520
You're developing now a product with Spanish fly in it as well as the...

1062
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:20,300
Rhino horn, ankylosaurus tailbone, mutated Malaysian scorpion claw and stinger, all ground up together into the ultimate...

1063
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,640
...smokable Viagra is what we call it.

1064
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:25,500
Dobbs...

1065
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,500
Bobco's Better Blend.

1066
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,220
Oh, my nose.

1067
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,360
It's the name we're planning to market.

1068
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,140
Bobco's Better Blend.

1069
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,900
Bobco's Better Blend.

1070
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,260
I also notice here that you have been taking...

1071
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,560
Aphrodisiac smokable mixture.

1072
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,320
They all are Aphrodisiac.

1073
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,320
I notice another one here on the item box.

1074
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,680
You have the ground up the testes of some of the gladiators too.

1075
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,860
And all these products appear to be Aphrodisiac.

1076
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,400
They are men.

1077
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,260
These are the testicles of men.

1078
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,280
Bigger men than you'll ever be.

1079
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,460
Unless you eat of their testicles.

1080
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,540
From the glandulars.

1081
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,340
The glandulars.

1082
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,240
That's all they are.

1083
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,200
These are merely...

1084
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,340
You can ask the FCC.

1085
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,620
It's quite all legal.

1086
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,460
The Food and Drug Administration.

1087
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,380
The Federal Aviation Administration.

1088
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,820
All of them agree.

1089
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,320
These are perfectly legal.

1090
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,440
They're not drugs.

1091
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,180
They're vitamins.

1092
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,120
That's all they are.

1093
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,340
Tiger penis, rhinoceros horn, ankylosaurus tail.

1094
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,360
They're all glandulars.

1095
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,600
And gladiator glandulars are...

1096
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,420
They're expensive but they're well worth it.

1097
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,520
Well the glad gland here it says has a prescriptural warning underneath the box.

1098
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,820
But I'm just wondering, do...

1099
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:35,900
Are all the products here from the gladiatorial games at Dobstown, are they all...

1100
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,320
Are they all Aphrodisiacs?

1101
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,060
Are there any poisons or any other things that might benefit men?

1102
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,480
Well whatever might benefit mankind.

1103
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,500
A cure for...

1104
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,300
We have a hair conqueror.

1105
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,460
It's called the High John the Conqueror...

1106
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,420
Hair Conquer.

1107
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,980
That will straighten the kinkiest hair.

1108
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,400
We've got this kinkifier.

1109
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:06,440
Dew that will take straight Malaysian, for instance, hair and kinkify it up into a regular fright wig.

1110
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,200
A Don King afro look.

1111
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:17,040
We've got all these hair products that are also made from rare endangered animals and genetically redesigned extinct creatures.

1112
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,320
Mammoth tusk.

1113
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,180
Uh...

1114
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:19,880
Uh...

1115
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,260
Uh...

1116
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:20,440
Uh...

1117
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:20,820
Uh...

1118
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,240
Hair pomade.

1119
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,600
Dob...

1120
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,320
From Dob...

1121
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,840
Dob's Conco.

1122
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:32,100
The men's products come from Bobco and Dob's Conco is...

1123
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,640
Is...

1124
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,060
Is...

1125
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,720
For the women's makeup and...

1126
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:42,420
And I've heard that they grind the toenails and those are very, very useful in reconstruction of women's toenails.

1127
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,260
Yeah, we've heard they grind the toenails.

1128
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,700
A velociraptor toenail.

1129
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,400
Yes.

1130
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,400
We're getting...

1131
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,240
We're getting off track.

1132
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,120
Hardest woman's song.

1133
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:55,200
And we've heard they grind the toenails.

1134
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,920
We've heard they grind the toenails.

1135
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,860
Oh, Lord they grind the toenails.

1136
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:14,260
And they're the factory full of little 10-year-old Malaysian boys and girls in front of their grist mills grinding the force-grown velociraptor's clone toenails.

1137
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,660
They let their little velociraptor dogs...

1138
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,120
We must organize union.

1139
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,780
Don't waste any of the meat.

1140
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,720
We grind and grind and grind and never a loaf of bread.

1141
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,880
These children are paid.

1142
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,880
These children are paid in bread, in minimum wage.

1143
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,980
Ma, mommy, I'm dying, mommy.

1144
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,360
Eat some of this bread.

1145
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,780
It's made from the joints of these animals.

1146
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:40,680
Ground up.

1147
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,340
Very good for you, son.

1148
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:42,900
Here, have it.

1149
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,500
Back to work, you swine.

1150
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,440
Mind that, mean master.

1151
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,300
Eat this bread.

1152
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,720
Back to work, you swine.

1153
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,700
You, you're loafing again.

1154
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,360
How many toenails have you ground in the last half hour?

1155
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,160
You've ground four toenails in the last half hour.

1156
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,960
This is not nearly close to the quarter.

1157
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,260
Get back to work or I'll have you lashed again.

1158
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,600
Could I have some more loaves, please, sir?

1159
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,420
I've been dying to know something.

1160
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,280
So, please.

1161
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:14,300
You cannot have any more until you cry.

1162
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,420
Now get to the grind.

1163
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:24,900
Those of you in the following sectors who suck butt long enough will be allowed to eat gruel.

1164
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:32,860
That is why delicious, sumptuous, delicious gruel made from the other parts will be half as used.

1165
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,440
Now grind those toenails.

1166
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,560
Grind them up.

1167
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:48,100
The grinding of velociraptor toenails to be sold by...

1168
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,300
Dobbs Conco.

1169
00:55:50,920 --> 00:56:11,380
As aphrodisiacs and hair pomades back in the United States to a jaded, immoral, mass non-vocal majority sitting there in front of their TV tubes watching the commercials from Dobbs Conco.

1170
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:17,000
And ordering out by telephone for more Bob Conco.

1171
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,300
If you like boys and girls after the plutonium storms...

1172
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,900
And smokeable fire.

1173
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,740
Dobbs Conco can take care of that now.

1174
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,100
One with and you're on your way.

1175
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,060
You look so happy you did.

1176
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,360
Come on.

1177
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,880
Try it with us.

1178
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,440
What do you think?

1179
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,240
You want to try it?

1180
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:36,760
Okay.

1181
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,320
Let's try it.

1182
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,200
I don't know.

1183
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,180
They sure need it.

1184
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:40,880
Some of the...

1185
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,580
I don't know.

1186
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,680
You want to try it?

1187
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,600
I think we should try it.

1188
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:44,960
Let's try it.

1189
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:46,940
Come on.

1190
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,520
Give me some.

1191
00:56:48,300 --> 00:57:02,960
But meanwhile, in a vacuum room orbiting the planet Nexon, a radio show is being produced simultaneously in Dallas, Texas and Cleveland, Ohio.

1192
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:13,880
And you've been listening to both the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack, and Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1193
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:18,220
Starring Chaz Smith on the massive...

1194
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,760
Lonesome Cowboy Dave on guitar.

1195
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,580
And Michelle George on violin.

1196
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,260
Bob Mozek on drums.

1197
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,640
And actually Ace on drums some of the time.

1198
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:35,420
And thanks to WCSB in Cleveland where much of this was recorded.

1199
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:41,780
And Swamp Radio, Chaz Smith's studio where much of the rest was recorded.

1200
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,420
And to Ace of Cleveland for the...

1201
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:48,120
Where the Winter Star Festival...

1202
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,500
The Vival was recorded.

1203
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,680
And friends, you can get information about the Church of the Subgenius from...

1204
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,780
Post Office Box.

1205
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:05,420
No, just write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306.

1206
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,620
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1207
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,480
That's 75214.

1208
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:17,840
ESO, Einstein's Secret Orchestra is at P.O. Box.

1209
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,340
