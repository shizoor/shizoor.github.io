1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
Let's do some effects.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:01,960
Ten more minutes?

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,900
Some effects for the drug impaired.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,620
We're on WCSV Cleveland.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,000
There, did we do that right?

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,160
I think so, it sounded right to me.

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,900
It was so pretty.

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,440
I love that automatic reverb you got going from being next to the Coke machine downstairs

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,520
and having your foot stuck in the incremental medicine machine.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,660
No.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,780
No, stay where you are.

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,220
For this is a time of slack.

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,940
This is the slack hour.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,360
These are the flatest of men, period.

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,840
A squeamish.

16
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,440
About these, the prostate and the exams.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,840
And I'm trying to figure out, and so they already are not likely to go in for the exam.

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,040
Don't want to talk about it.

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,460
And so, how do you make the jump?

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,300
The sun comes up and I jump out of bed from terrible dreams swimming in my head.

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,960
Out in public in my BBDs and I can't find a place to take a pee.

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,820
My wife.

23
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,480
My wife says, sucker, you's middle aged.

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,880
Let me tell you about something that's all the rage.

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,360
Hurry to the dog boy fast as you can.

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,580
It's about time you had an exam.

27
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,580
Go downtown and stick out your can.

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,300
Let them take a look at your prostate gland.

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,180
Don't be late for the 8 o'clock tram.

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,420
You going downtown for a prostate exam.

31
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,920
It's about time you had an exam.

32
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:13,960
Maybe an eight year old prerequisite to get that right?

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:13,960


34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:20,780
I don't have these, a big Come on I only have a half foot left.

35
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,900
Ahmed comedian can't remember How-to's and movies.

36
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,360
I don't want to use Turk.

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:29,800


38
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
What was bothering me?

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,420
She rubbed her chin and said,

40
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,240
I think I see.

41
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,600
She handed me a robe and she turned to go,

42
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,000
but she asked a couple questions about urine flow.

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,640
The doctor walked in staring over his glasses.

44
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,200
I knew he must have gazed up thousands of asses.

45
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,240
Took off my hat and band over a stool,

46
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,620
said,

47
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,640
Me ton trois au fondement que.

48
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,280
Tra la la la la.

49
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,600
Get me a check on my prostate gland.

50
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,820
Tra la la la la.

51
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,380
I've been a little worried about my prostate gland.

52
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,280
Tra la la la la.

53
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,180
Drinking my coffee and eating All Brand.

54
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,040
Tra la la la la.

55
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,400
Then I head downtown for a prostate exam.

56
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,560
I think I see.

57
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,820
I got it.

58
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,240
I got it.

59
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,520
I got it.

60
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,680
I got it.

61
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,700
I got it.

62
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,780
I got it.

63
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,380
The epithelium is highly variable

64
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,160
and areas of loquivoidal or squamous epithelium

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,240
are also present.

66
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,540
With transitional epithelium

67
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,800
in the distal regions of the longer duct.

68
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,740
He dunked his finger,

69
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,960
got it covered with grease

70
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,180
and stuck it in my butt

71
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,340
with relative ease.

72
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,600
Rolled it around

73
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,780
and in case it happened,

74
00:03:59,780 --> 00:03:59,780


75
00:03:59,780 --> 00:03:59,780


76
00:03:59,780 --> 00:03:59,780


77
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,200
I felt him start to pushing up against my bladder.

78
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,460
The prostate, that's an exocrine gland.

79
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,840
In Greek, it means a guy who's taking a stand.

80
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,060
I tell you all this so you'll understand

81
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,700
that I feel a lot better about my prostate gland.

82
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,520
Everything's better with my prostate gland.

83
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,320
The nurses all singing about my prostate gland.

84
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,300
Wiggle your hips and clap your hands.

85
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,500
And close to the bottom with my prostate.

86
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,920
From PR News in Washington,

87
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,540
I'm being considered Irish by the European Union.

88
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,320
Speaking through an interpreter,

89
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,900
Secretary of State John Kerry says Russia respects radar screens.

90
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,160
And Kerry says,

91
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,580
We believe in a great track that's not Islam.

92
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,080
It's a shit that won't be with the Islam.

93
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,680
No one's officially naming to me their joints.

94
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,460
It's a good thing I'm so just shit.

95
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,060
And other members of the elite.

96
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,280
PR's reports report the search for the misanthropist

97
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,640
in five and a half signals has been expanded

98
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,060
after indications the signal was lost.

99
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,200
Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve says

100
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,100
the U.S. is the winner of this year's

101
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,260
National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction.

102
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,280
A source familiar with the Invesal Awards

103
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,980
tells PR, this is PR News.

104
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,840
The story of Acute Think,

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,280
a novel about life in war-torn Katrina.

106
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,120
Awards were also given for

107
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,420
Biography, Autobiography, Poetry,

108
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,940
Autopoetry, and PR News, Washington.

109
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,860
Ann Boehner said, this is PR News.

110
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,620
In Washington.

111
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,220
In Washington.

112
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,220
Happy puppy tongues

113
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,460
lick magic fairy ties.

114
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,540
Ice cream cones and licorice stones

115
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,800
stacked ten miles high.

116
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,760
While lonely orphans shed a tear

117
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,280
and softly wonder why.

118
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,820
Won't you bring back the old sock days?

119
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,860
The old sock days of yore.

120
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,340
Of twills and frills and gabbertees

121
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,200
and socks I've known before.

122
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,980
The frost is on the pumpkin

123
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,100
and the dew is on the boar.

124
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,660
So bring back those old sock days

125
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,960
to sweet seconded poor.

126
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,280
Yeah!

127
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,400
Yeah!

128
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,460
Yeah!

129
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,480
Yeah!

130
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,660
Wall Street bankers wipe their chins.

131
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,360
Their day has just begun.

132
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,860
Yeah!

133
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,440
Yeah!

134
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,460
The granders turgid phalluses

135
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,780
for unprotected fun.

136
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,540
Yeah!

137
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,200
Strolling past the businessmen.

138
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,080
Yeah!

139
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,380
Not to be outdone.

140
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,220
A chance upon a roving band.

141
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,360
A symphonic night.

142
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,320
So bring back the old sock days.

143
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,240
The old sock days of yore.

144
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,800
Of cotton polyester blends

145
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,840
from my favorite corner store.

146
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,640
The socks I find in shopping malls.

147
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,520
I can't help but implore.

148
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,180
So bring back the old sock days

149
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,640
and pray there's no more war.

150
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:12,840
Yeah!

151
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,580
Yeah!

152
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,600
Yeah!

153
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,400
Yeah!

154
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:18,880
Yeah!

155
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,460
Yeah!

156
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:32,600


157
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,620
Yeah!

158
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,200


159
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,540
Yeah!

160
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,140
Yeah!

161
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:41,620
Yeah!

162
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,580
Pretty good job, that boots!

163
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,700
And now you go lose your seatbelt.

164
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:48,860


165
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:48,860


166
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,260
printed with the face of Albert Fudd.

167
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,300
Sweaty pink republicans,

168
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,340
their loins are stained with blood.

169
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,320
They pause to taste an acris play

170
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,480
from Satan's scaly pud.

171
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,760
Then Mitch McConnell carries home

172
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,700
to wash Winona Jones.

173
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,860
So bring back the old sock days,

174
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,720
the old sock days of yore.

175
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,460
The twills and frills and gabardines,

176
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,220
the socks I've known before.

177
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,600
I feel despair and failure there

178
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,620
within my dresser drawer.

179
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,640
So bring back those old sock days,

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,420
that's what I'm praying for.

181
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,940
Yes, bring back the old sock days,

182
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,900
you sweet seductive heart.

183
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,960
Thank you.

184
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,360
Thank you, Ho Chi Minh City.

185
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:19,980
Thank you.

186
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,340
Hello, hello, hello.

187
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,580
He's so monster, hell.

188
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,500
Bad times rolling around.

189
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,140
It's a prehistoric thing.

190
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,560
It's a prehistoric monster.

191
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,940
It came from outer space,

192
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,540
created by the marshals to destroy the human race.

193
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,820
The FBI is helpless.

194
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,240
It's 20 stories tall.

195
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,460
What can they do?

196
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,420
Whom can they call?

197
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,240
Hello, friends, and welcome.

198
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,360
The sermon tonight is entitled,

199
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:44,740
The Sermon on the Mount.

200
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,420
How to prepare for the end of times.

201
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,400
Obviously, they're just around the corner now, aren't they?

202
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,000
You look on the horizon, and what do you see?

203
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,200
Death, destruction, nuclear Armageddon, all-out war.

204
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,880
Now, most beings, they're afraid of what they see.

205
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,380
Oh, no, we might get hurt, they say.

206
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,560
Damn right, and that's the beauty of it.

207
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,080
Not only are they going to get hurt,

208
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,600
they're going to get killed, each and every one of them.

209
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
They're going to be slimming,

210
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,120
and in their own blood.

211
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,160
Now, what about the subgenies, you say?

212
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,800
Well, we're all in this together now, you say.

213
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,360
Right?

214
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,000
Wrong!

215
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,000
We've got a lifeguard,

216
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,140
someone to toss us a lifesaver.

217
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,220
That life preserver is none other than J.R. Bob Dobbs.

218
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,760
And the rope that connects us to his salvation is slack.

219
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,880
The only way you're going to be able to reach Bob Dobbs

220
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,640
and stay afloat is to have enough slack on your lifeline.

221
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,400
Now, friends, what does it take to have enough slack?

222
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,580
For one thing,

223
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,000
you should always remember who you are working for.

224
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,560
Now, the pinks, they think they're going to retire for the conspiracy,

225
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,660
and the conspiracy is going to protect them.

226
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,400
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

227
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,160
Oh, they have a rude awakening in store for them now, don't they?

228
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,580
It will begin as a small conflict,

229
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,480
a police action, if you will.

230
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,460
Then it will expand and grow and engulf the Persian Gulf.

231
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,660
Next you'll know they'll be knocking at your door

232
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,000
and ringing on your telephone.

233
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,300
Guess who gets an all-expense page?

234
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,080
The

235
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,760
real fun doesn't even start until the bombs start going off in your very own neighborhood.

236
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,840
Oh, sure, at first it'll only be a local terrorist or two,

237
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,800
so it won't be as if you're being blown to bits by strangers,

238
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,480
but then again, what difference does it make when you're flying through air with the greatest of ease, eh?

239
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,760
Besides, it's only a matter of time before it begins to rain bombs from the heavens.

240
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,500
You won't be able to step outside without getting an instant flash burn.

241
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,000
Wh-wh-wh-wh-what's that you say?

242
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,820
Everyone is on our side?

243
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,480
The world is united so no one would want to attack us?

244
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,120
Who said the bombs would be coming from anywhere on this world?

245
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,600
Friends, they'll be dropped from sub-orbit,

246
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,840
from intergalactic sanitation and sterilization ships

247
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,280
dispatched from our good old friends up yonder on Planet 10.

248
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,380
They'll watch until the pinks are pretty well pooped from killing each other,

249
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,560
and then they'll come on down and mop up.

250
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,740
The killdozers and amphibious land shark ships will sweep across the countryside with typical efficiency.

251
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,660
They'll round up the pinks like cattle.

252
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,080
Death will take a holiday.

253
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,840
The lucky ones will die quick.

254
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,680
The unlucky ones will die slow.

255
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,640
And the moron majority won't die at all.

256
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,160
They'll be put in plastic bags and freeze-dried for convenient interplanetary self-service space snacks.

257
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,540
Oh, don't you believe the conspiracy lies that pinks don't taste good?

258
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,240
They may not have good taste,

259
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,120
but they damn sure taste good!

260
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,140
This is just a plain and simple fact you must take on faith,

261
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,760
for even Bob Dobbs does not suggest that you eat pinks before X-Day.

262
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,900
Lick pinks, now that's all right, but eat them. Taboo!

263
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,160
They're a dessert to be savored, to be saved,

264
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,720
something to look forward to, something to gloat over as we float over to our promised land beyond the stars.

265
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,740
And we gotta keep them now fresh, don't we?

266
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,820
Oh, yessiree, you probably think that a pink can't be freeze-dried and then thaw back to life,

267
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,080
but you're wrong.

268
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,440
You're talking about a conspiracy technology there, folks.

269
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,080
But we're talking about the same brains that can go traveling through light years and instantaneous folding of space.

270
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:25,200
Do you think that the minds that contain the wisdom of the universe would allow the pinks to escape life with nothing more than a freeze burn?

271
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,060
Why, that only measures 265 candles on the agony scale.

272
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,000
Why, getting sliced to death by paper cuts earns less candles than that.

273
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,920
And after all the pinks have done to you,

274
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,940
you're willing to send them off with a mere million paper cuts?

275
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,100
Have you no human dignity?

276
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,760
Have you at long last surrendered all semblance of common decency?

277
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,740
Bob said, do unto them as they have done unto you.

278
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,860
So anything short of the glass rod ramming routine is fair game.

279
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,320
Then again, nah.

280
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,100
Don't let anybody say the subgenius don't have a little compassion here and there.

281
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,820
So where does this leave us today, dear friends?

282
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,900
It radiates new hope amongst the darkened dreams.

283
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,860
And while we're on a dreary horizon,

284
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:13,260
while some whine and whimper about the possible loss of a few million lives hither tither and yawn,

285
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,180
we celebrate, for bub-lical prophecy is coming to fruition.

286
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,960
At long last, the exes will come forth to wreak Bob's revenge.

287
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:30,040
For lo, these many years of yearning, burning, and churning amongst the pseudo-suitable substance some say sucks.

288
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,000
Let my people go.

289
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,400
Swing low, sweet chariots of fire.

290
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,140
They're coming to take us away, ha.

291
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,020
Yea, the end is nigh.

292
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,580
So eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow they die.

293
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,440
Preeeease, Bob, amen.

294
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:04,400
I never know somebody do the shimmy like they do in Cucamonga.

295
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:12,940
I never knew nobody do that shimmy like they do in Cucamonga.

296
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:20,960
In Chicago ain't no shimmy, not like I seen in Cucamonga.

297
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:29,000
In Chicago won't find shimmy, not like they do in Cucamonga.

298
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:47,600
In Cucamonga they got a strut, from the wobblin' knees up to where they keep their butt.

299
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:55,600
In Cucamonga doin' a strut, from the wiggly wobbly knees up to where they got their butt.

300
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:03,080
In Sandusky won't find shimmy, not like I seen in Cucamonga.

301
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:11,060
In Kentucky ain't no shimmy, that's why we wrote a stupid song, yeah.

302
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:19,880
In Cucamonga they got a strut, from the wiggly wobbly knees up to where they keep their butt.

303
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,120
Palpitating flippers and a-

304
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,120


305
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,660
And gills, Grandpa Jones at the windowsill.

306
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,840
Whirling walls of razor blades leave a river of blood where the rapists promenade.

307
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:53,780
Iron rand in her domino duds with a strap on dildo sprayin' acid from the bulb.

308
00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:01,600
Fire and pus and heroin squirt from her vaginal lips pokin' through a grass skirt.

309
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,740
Fire and pus and heroin squirt from her vaginal lips pokin' through a grass skirt.

310
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,280
Fire and pus and heroin squirt.

311
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:14,140
Fire and pus and heroin squirt from her vaginal lips.

312
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,620
Fire and pus and heroin squirt from her vagina.

313
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,200
dressed in a sale.

314
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:32,680
Packed a gun around her waist in selfusement with a police car.

315
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:43,460
In Cucamonga they gotta dance The menfolk do it when they wanna make romance

316
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:50,160
In Cucamonga they gotta stance Where they wave around the arms and make a

317
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,700
drizzle in the pants

318
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:59,320
Philadelphia, they won't help ya Shimmer like they do in Cucamonga

319
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:09,020
Tierra del Fuego, Gotlum bago Ain't a shimmy like Cucamonga

320
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,680
A pipe of more than titanic size

321
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,300
Furlongs and lathes

322
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,220
Jotted from the rictus of the terrifyingly huge mouth

323
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,920
Whose lips were skinned back from the form of white teeth

324
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,420
Set too close together to be fastened upon the pipe in any comprehensible way

325
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,360
Under the nightmare of that mindless but all-encompassing gaze

326
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,980
The two quaked in cosmic fear

327
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,580
Clutching each other and begging each other to kill each other

328
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,060
Soon their knees smote together in fear

329
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,280
But the hideous face swelled and seemed to fill the entire sky

330
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,800
Then the whole field of vision saw that nothing else could be seen

331
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,000
Come, you heavy laden, to the feast of the sauropods

332
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,220
Everybody thinks Brontosaurus was such a patsy

333
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,040
Why, that thing was as vicious as can be

334
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,440
Didn't anyone ever see King Kong?

335
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,300
People say because it was a vegetarian, it was peaceful

336
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,040
Ha! A rhinoceros is a vegetarian

337
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,080
The Cape buffalo, the most dangerous edible on oink

338
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,680
That's a... look at, look at what it's doing!

339
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,860
The Brontosaurus was good

340
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:48,060
But the Tyran-Triana-saurus Rex was bad

341
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,520
Cause he ate me

342
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,860
The Tyrannosaurus was bad

343
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,000
Because it ate me

344
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,920
No, you're wrong, Timmy

345
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
The Stegosaurus did not eat meat

346
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,940
And not only that, it was not bad

347
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,220
It was a creature of radiant angelic goodness

348
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:20,560
Such as we evil fallen beings in the post-Adamic world cannot possibly comprehend or understand

349
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,980
I sure don't get it myself

350
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,800
I don't know what's going on

351
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,160
Hopefully, we'll have some sort of a Dave-man

352
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,240
Yes, the original Dave-man

353
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,340
Should be...

354
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,500
Hello?

355
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,860
Yes, original Dave-man

356
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,680
It's Dave-man

357
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,940
Oh, it was the original Dave-man

358
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,000
No, it was, uh, personification is very lewd

359
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,240
I can see it, yeah, yeah, you remember, never mind

360
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,480
Well, you sound healthy and hale, lonesome cowboy Dave-man

361
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:03,340
Well, what's the intrinsic, what's the meaning, not the intrinsic meaning, but what's the meaning of, uh, of Harry, H-E-R-R-Y?

362
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,640
Uh, H...

363
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,580
Do you know the meaning of that word?

364
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,560
H-E-R-R-Y, Harry?

365
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,200
Is it, is it like smottage or pride and ophage or something like that?

366
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,580
Or is it something a little bit less literal?

367
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,460
Harry, Heary?

368
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,040
This is like cherry without the C?

369
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,020
Uh, Harry, but not like, you know, a fuzzy, hairy person, H-E-I-R-Y

370
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Uh, more, you know, uh, you know, like Hale and Hardy, only hairy

371
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,060
Oh, okay, yeah, uh, whatevs

372
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,000
Whatevs

373
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,300
Uh, sometimes I get lost in the spirit, you know, it gets so exciting

374
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,620
I know, I'm sorry if I pursue such stupidity

375
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,340
Well, as long as you catch it, if, that's the important...

376
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,620
Well, even then, it's the pursuit that counts, isn't it?

377
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,000
Yes, yes, it's the pursuit that counts

378
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,920
You know, you're a loser if you don't catch it, but, uh, what the heck, at least you tried

379
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,520
It's like chasing a vagrant with a sign

380
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,900
Once they drop the sign and head off towards the vacant lot, you know you're screwed, you know?

381
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,480
Speaking of vagrants, I, uh, read today that some, uh, a mayor in, in Florida or Oklahoma

382
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,360
Or one of those heavenly places was, uh, decided to outlaw homelessness

383
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,940
Ah, that was smart

384
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,920
Some Popeye's rocket thing, you know

385
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:34,600
They were gonna make it illegal to, well, it's always been, it's always been legal to stop people from illegally loitering

386
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,220
Whatever that means, you know

387
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:42,940
Yeah, some seismic gas bag, uh, waiting, just waiting in the wings to splat on you

388
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:52,000
But now I guess if your, if your luck is so bad or your brain damage or disease or whatever is so bad that you can't, you just can't get a job

389
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,340
And you can't get a job and you can't get a job

390
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,480
And you can't get a house, they're gonna arrest you for that in this town

391
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,100
And I guess let the taxpayers pay your rent as you are fed in the jail

392
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,540
Indigence is illegal

393
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,480
And the love of such things is growing too

394
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,260
A vast number of communities are adopting these same techniques and tactics from dealing with homeless people

395
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:18,560
And vagrants at large, people just don't have enough change when they walk in the store and have to walk back with counting the days of peonage

396
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,140
See, we warned you, Sharia law, that's what it is

397
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,500
Oh wait, that's a different law

398
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:29,240
The days of peonage, where people are just picked up randomly and made to work in chain gangs

399
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,420
And with their feet bound together and their teeth carried and things like that

400
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:39,040
When, when guys who've been in chain gangs together refer to it as, yeah, we was married together

401
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,800
Yep, absolutely

402
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,320
We were, we were in the clinkers

403
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:50,760
I've been reading about the early years of Australia as a British penal colony

404
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:58,720
And, uh, boy, you could do quite a horror movie just to, and call it a documentary

405
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,080
And it would still be the scariest thing, I was having nightmares from reading that book

406
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,120
Just a realistic depiction

407
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,780
The things the British did, God will never forget

408
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,440
Well, if that's the case, then he's probably gonna remember a few things Amerikey did

409
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,560
And a few things almost everybody did, cause

410
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,000
It seems like every culture gets their moment in the sun

411
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,480
When they get to genocide everybody else around them for a little while

412
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:36,200
And then of course they end up another old third world rust bucket, waste basket, eventually

413
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,820
I think what, yes, I think what's interesting is the, of own, you know, beloved Italia

414
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,740
Which, uh, once was the Roman Empire and conquered France and Spain and stuff

415
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,540
Was later, uh, the property of France and Spain

416
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,620
Well

417
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,420
That's what happens, you know what I mean?

418
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,620
Right, right, well, England for the longest time was the property of

419
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,640
France, Germany, Denmark, you know, you name it

420
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,640
They, every, they didn't have those names then

421
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,460
But, the British, the British happened to

422
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,060
What's that name like, I'm sorry

423
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,120
You sound just like PR News, tonight's PR News

424
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,040
Yeah, and well, I was trying to do one of the funny names

425
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,480
Has Fernand and Italy murdered?

426
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,760
Have you ever been editing your tongue?

427
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,820
No, but he, I heard he has a lizard tongue now because he made a pact with the devil

428
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,440
I wouldn't call it the actual

429
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,460
Well, we've, you know, we've all kind of been there and done that

430
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,960
You can get out of it, I, I think

431
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,960
The devil said you could

432
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,460
Hey, I was a fortune teller for 25 years, Tang

433
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,640
Don't forget the days back in Hartford, Connecticut when we first met

434
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,120
When you first joined the crew and came home and told us about the church of a subgenius

435
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,260
And those were days of flopping up in the parking lot and laughing all the big time

436
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:58,520
And toasting the old coffee cup with the extra little sunshine in it

437
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,940
You know, guys like that

438
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,980
I'm sorry

439
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:10,120
Copyright 19, 2000 something, Philodrumm

440
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:16,680
Hey, I've been reading headlines and not articles

441
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,940
And I have, let's see

442
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,180
Oh, the most recent one I read

443
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:31,860
Anti-gay North Carolina GOP candidate outed as former female impersonator Miss Mona Sinclair

444
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:44,860
Well, he's probably anti-gay because he doesn't ever want anyone else to be as embarrassed as he is being outed after being anti-gay

445
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,660
So it's like, what if they're, what if they're outed?

446
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:46,660


447
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,660
I mean, I think they're anti-gay, but they were gay

448
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,860
So they better not be gay anymore

449
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,880
Oh, no, there's always been plenty of those people

450
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,300
Think of J. Edgar Hoover

451
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,520
I understood he was quite a, had quite a Hoover about him

452
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,620
Yeah, he was quite a screamer or whatever, you know, disparaging words you want to use and stuff like that

453
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,420
He used to dress up funny and like they had Hellfire Club meetings and everything

454
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,760
Oh, there's a, there's a movie, a new, a new bio

455
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,380
I don't think you remember the girl?

456
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,620
I think she was a little bit sick about J. Edgar Hoover starring Leonardo DiCaprio

457
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,360
I'd love to see Leonardo in a dress, he'd probably be cute

458
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,700
Yeah

459
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,580
Let's see what else we have here

460
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:37,740
Oh, scientific American editor flooded with hate tweets after Fox News targets him

461
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,480
Well, it serves him right

462
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,860
He was on one of their talk shows and they said, you can't say anything about climate change

463
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:50,260
So when he got off the interview he tweeted that, I was on Fox today, I feel like I need a shower

464
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:59,000
So Fox in return gave out his internet address so that people could tell him that he must die

465
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,940
What an addictive squad, they should never do things like that

466
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:10,460
Apparently that on that same TV network somebody, there was a whole panel

467
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:10,820
Media brown shirts

468
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,840
Yeah, the whole panel was imagining that he was on Fox News on the day of the election, they should never do things like that, apparently on that same TV network somebody, there was a whole panel Media brown shirts

469
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,640
the assassination of Hillary Clinton, and then used that to attack her for Benghazi.

470
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,040
Now, like I said, I only read the headlines, but they're pretty good.

471
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:32,560
Oh, and my favorite one was Fox and Friends links Benghazi and missing Malaysia flight

472
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,660
and blames Obama for both.

473
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,040
And here's their reasoning.

474
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,340
Hang on. Here's their reasoning.

475
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:45,560
Of course, as we know, Obama caused the Benghazi attack to happen.

476
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,180
Naturally.

477
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,740
Because he didn't stop al-Qaeda.

478
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:58,120
Well, yesterday, a British newspaper reported that the Malaysian government had arrested 11 terrorists,

479
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:04,640
Muslim terrorists, for destroying the Malaysia flight.

480
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:10,320
And so Fox and Friends was blaming Obama for that airplane disaster.

481
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:10,720
And I think that's the point.

482
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,880
And then they said that the Malaysian government is just disappearing because he failed to stop al-Qaeda.

483
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:19,280
However, the Malaysian government came out and said that British newspaper is lying their butts off.

484
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,000
Nothing like that happened.

485
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,260
So who are you going to believe?

486
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:32,640
And Alabama Chief Justice said that since Buddha didn't create us, the First Amendment only protects Christians.

487
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,460
Since Jesus created us, I guess.

488
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,060
It doesn't protect Jews.

489
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:39,980
Thank you, we.

490
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,100
Thank you.

491
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,320
Thank you.

492
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:45,060
Because Jews only believe in God the Father, and they leave out the Son for sure.

493
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,260
I don't know where they are in the Holy Ghost.

494
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,140
God and Chinooka.

495
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,560
Don't forget Chinooka.

496
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,640
Now what?

497
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,420
Chinooka.

498
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:54,860
Chinooka?

499
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:00,960
Is that your, the Alaskan Indian god that created us?

500
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,060
No, that's one of the Hebrew deities, I thought.

501
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,600
Chinooka.

502
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:05,960
Chinooka.

503
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,580
Are you talking about that holiday they have?

504
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,340
Chanukah?

505
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,020
Chanukah?

506
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,580
Yeah, Chanukah.

507
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,020
Yeah, Chanukah.

508
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,140
Chinooka.

509
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,360
I was riding my shoes as rather they would ride me.

510
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,360
You know what I mean?

511
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,700
I was feeling so literal, or not, lyrical.

512
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,340
That's the word.

513
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,520
I was feeling real lyrical and stuff like that.

514
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,320
It is.

515
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,000
You can't play.

516
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,740
You can't play 12 chords.

517
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,220
Because the first and the last thing is just an octave.

518
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,680
And you can't.

519
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,140
I'm sorry.

520
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,940
I lost my.

521
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,280
You are forgiven.

522
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,560
Lost my mind.

523
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:38,560


524
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:38,560


525
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:38,560


526
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:38,560


527
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,720
You are forgiven, lonesome cowboy Dave.

528
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,980
Thank you.

529
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,040
You are forgiven.

530
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,880
That is a hot sandwich to forgive to.

531
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,240
And I'm right on my, right next to me.

532
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,620
Here's another headline.

533
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,920
South Dakota Republican thinks about gay men having anal sex a whole lot.

534
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,480
That was a headline.

535
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,200
I'd like to have my face next to a headline like that.

536
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,540
Unless I was, you know, running on that fact.

537
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,560
Yes.

538
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,340
I was just thinking of the fact that the Murdoch family based its fame on tabloids back in Australia

539
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,820
and Great Britain and places like that.

540
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,020
So, you know, that's where they started and how they got there.

541
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:25,760
And they were kind of closely allied with the old group, certain little group called

542
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,980
the National Front.

543
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,740
They managed to give a lot of money, which is a British neo-Nazi group, of course, which

544
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,820
had antecedents in Mosley's Raiders, of all things, for crying out loud.

545
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:44,160
And yet we still worship at the foot of this media deity, which you have just named in

546
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,680
your speech.

547
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,220
I'm sorry.

548
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,020
I'll shut up anyway.

549
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:46,860
I'm sorry.

550
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,880
Poor Dave.

551
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,600
Dave.

552
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,620
What a sorry character he is.

553
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,520
Don't shut up.

554
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,900
Please don't shut up ever.

555
00:32:54,340 --> 00:33:02,400
You have to shout and make a lot of noise because when you die, you shut up like hell.

556
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,320
To quote the great Jeroen van Dam.

557
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,340
Or what was that?

558
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:08,980
Was that his name?

559
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,280
Was Jeroen something?

560
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,000
Jeroen.

561
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,640
I know that.

562
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:16,080
He was a crazy guy we met in Holland one time.

563
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,520
And it's true.

564
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,400
When you die, you shut up like hell.

565
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:20,840
Yes.

566
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,620
And some of us should probably shut up like hell before we die.

567
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,460
But we won't do it.

568
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,220
You'll have to kill us.

569
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:27,780
No.

570
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,800
I shouldn't have said that.

571
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,400
I'm just kidding.

572
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
We refuse, senores.

573
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,220
Compagnie.

574
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,080
We refuse.

575
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,300
We strike the fissures.

576
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:37,300


577
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:37,300


578
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:37,300


579
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,020
We'll catch the fish through stark fish removal in the ice and tie them in the nudge

580
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:47,360
ice and take the bags of chicken that we've left out to the downside.

581
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,840
We'll catch and net the stark fish of removal.

582
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,500
Oh, here's a headline.

583
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,780
Here's a headline for you, Princess Wee.

584
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,800
You won't like this one.

585
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,180
Okay.

586
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,500
Lawsuit.

587
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:05,000
Whole foods suppliers pressured to lie about the origin quality of their fish.

588
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:05,720


589
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,800
I'm always putting down whole foods.

590
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,240
Princess Wee's kind of a hippie, you know, and she'll go in there when they have good

591
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:16,640
deals.

592
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,920
But they don't fool me.

593
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,280
They're not fooling me.

594
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,300
No, sir.

595
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:29,040
I was there when they took over their very first mom and pop health food store and turned

596
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,140
it into a supermarket for rich white people.

597
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,340
Okay, there I went and said it.

598
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,020
It actually isn't just for rich white people.

599
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,480
It's for all rich people.

600
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,340
But I like to say that phrase because it's more offensive.

601
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,000
That's okay.

602
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:44,980
Okay, I said it.

603
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,180
Look out there, that stuffed bag.

604
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,120
It's all glory.

605
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Flopping in the wind like a flat jack or a mountain of dice.

606
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,040
Sorry.

607
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:55,740
I said that to a guy we know who works at a Whole Foods and he looked at me like, okay,

608
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,520
whatevs.

609
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,020
I love that new word, whatevs.

610
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,420
The kids have been saying it for about 15 years now.

611
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,040
I think we've used it.

612
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,220
Yeah.

613
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:03,900
Five times.

614
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,080
We've finally begun saying it.

615
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,500
Yeah, five times just so far in the show.

616
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:09,880
Hey.

617
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,240
That's the number of feet I could count, you know.

618
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,880
Hey, you know what, Dave?

619
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,560
You interrupted me.

620
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,820
I'm sorry.

621
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,720
Actually, when you called in, I was just about, as always, about to do the credits and I forgot

622
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,340
to mention.

623
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:25,960
I'm sorry.

624
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,460
No, it's not, Dave.

625
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,160
I told you to call at 920.

626
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,320
You called at 920.

627
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,320
I was late.

628
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,320
And no, I'm sorry.

629
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,140
It's not your fault.

630
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,200
I do apologize.

631
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,440
And we're all sorry.

632
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,600
We're so damn sorry.

633
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,320
We might as well just throw in the towel and quit.

634
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Really, man.

635
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,720
I've had enough.

636
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,220
I just can't stand it.

637
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,020
I just want to give you a hand.

638
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,140
But I'm going to give the credits anyway.

639
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:56,840
That sermon, the earlier, the sermon, How to Prepare for the End Times, was, of course,

640
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:02,000
by the great Father Joe Mama, popularly called Papa Joe Mama.

641
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:08,480
PR News and our titles, as always, were edited by Fernanda Ndele-Mur.

642
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:15,840
And all the music that you missed, Dave, was by the Rudy Schwartz Project from their new

643
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:21,480
album, which is called Winter Dance of the Koala Sperm Harvest.

644
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:31,580
And we played the songs My Prostate Gland, Bring Back the Old Sock Days, and In Cucamonga.

645
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:31,980
Oh, yeah.

646
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:31,980


647
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:43,420
And Rudy, as Schwartz in Rudy Schwartz Project is spelled S-C-H-W-A-R-T-Z, which means you

648
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:50,560
may now Google and download or steal or whatever all of the great Rudy Schwartz Project material,

649
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,140
which proves, Rudy Schwartz Project, if you ask me, proves that it is possible to be a

650
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:01,240
Zappa fan and go where the finger points.

651
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,500
Yeah.

652
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:01,780
Yeah.

653
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:01,980
Yeah.

654
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:01,980


655
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:01,980


656
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:01,980


657
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:01,980


658
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:01,980


659
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:01,980


660
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:01,980


661
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:01,980


662
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's sucking on the finger like most of these Zappa fans do.

663
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,660
And that goes for subgenius fans as well.

664
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:14,860
And Doctor Who fans and Fireside, all those so-called pseudo-intellectual damn weirdo stuff.

665
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,040
They're excuses for losers to think they're smart.

666
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,040
Because they're fans of this thing that somebody told them was smart.

667
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,140
Somebody who was lying to them or dumb.

668
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,580
So, I dare.

669
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,360
That could be true.

670
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,660
That could be true.

671
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,040
That could be really, really true.

672
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,100
Hello?

673
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:36,960
Hello?

674
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:37,860
Hello?

675
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:42,680
It could be, it could be, it could be, it could be, it could be, it could be really, it could

676
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,120
be, it could be really true.

677
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,400
Walter Brennan's on the line.

678
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,680
I thought he was dead.

679
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,080
No, I mean, I'm Doctor Who.

680
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,380
Now, now, Duke, Duke, you don't want to, you don't want to do nothing rash now, do you?

681
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,460
Don't tie me to that wagon wheel now, Duke.

682
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,260
I'll tell him, please, please.

683
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,380
It's got sand all over it.

684
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,440
It's going to hurt, Duke.

685
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,520
Dave?

686
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,360
What have you been breathing?

687
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,280
I just wondered why you had to go and do that.

688
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,360
I didn't do nothing.

689
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,240
He's innocent.

690
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,060
I can't do nothing.

691
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,580
He changed the whole atmosphere from innocence to depravity.

692
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,160
No.

693
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

694
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,360
I'm sorry.

695
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,660
Princess Wee's laughing at the way I look when I say that.

696
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,800
I'm sorry.

697
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,860
I hunch down and look all submissive and beaten.

698
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,780
I turn my butt up towards Bob.

699
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:48,160
Some say it's the look of a gargoyle hunched in its own, you know, it's under breath.

700
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,700
Dave, your voice is sounding like you invented a new low-rent special effect.

701
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,380
Yeah.

702
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,540
I started to cough.

703
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,160
I couldn't just cough.

704
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:05,740
I tried to be humorous throughout the entire thing.

705
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:11,900
I gave him some bizarre script and I was being my character.

706
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,100
I don't know how he does that.

707
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,540
That's amazing.

708
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,120
I don't either.

709
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,900
What's the name of that filter?

710
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,800
I've never heard someone cough talk before.

711
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,020
Yes, you have, dear.

712
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,480
You've heard quite a bit of it if you stop and think about that.

713
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,160
You mean if I listen to myself?

714
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,060
I've heard quite a few people talking like this.

715
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,460
Learn to cough like Captain Drummond.

716
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:44,540
The musical coughs of the subgenius doctor bands.

717
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,080
The musical cough, indeed.

718
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,820
Is this the police ever can wear the right, you know, kind of equipment?

719
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,520
And you're a kid.

720
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,440
Is it?

721
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,300
Yes and no.

722
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,080
Whatever.

723
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,420
I'll have to listen to this.

724
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,620
Back to the recording to know what you said.

725
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,720
To figure out exactly what it is that you just asked.

726
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:12,240
I am worried now that every listener now is going to catch Dave's cough.

727
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:12,740
Me too.

728
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,680
In fact, I'm starting to feel a little tickle in the back of my throat.

729
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,720
I've got a little tickle too just from listening to that.

730
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,700
And not just in my throat.

731
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,780
I've got a little tickle down there.

732
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,360
And it's not the good kind.

733
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,060
And by down there, I don't mean up here.

734
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,480
Yeah, that's the clothes you wear.

735
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,400
Made for the job.

736
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,100
Yeah, I mean, you know.

737
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:38,320
Texas gun groups protest sends restaurant employees fleeing for freezer as cops respond.

738
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,880
I can't wait to read that one.

739
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:48,880
Teacher fails to fool police with bomb threat written in the broken English of her students.

740
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,980
That one sounds like a made-for-TV movie in the making.

741
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,500
Yeah.

742
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,400
New York City cyclist arrested for using cellphones.

743
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:04,960
Cellphone to film cop told iPhones are being used as guns.

744
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,020
And the cops actually, I read that one.

745
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,560
The cops actually took this guy and arrested him and threw him in jail.

746
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,680
Uh-huh.

747
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:18,760
And explained to him that, well, just last week, a 13-year-old shot a police officer with an iPhone.

748
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,020
That's what the guy was told.

749
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,420
What?

750
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,760
Yeah, an iPhone.

751
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,020
And iPhones are being used as guns.

752
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,280
Oh, that's new one on me.

753
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,300
The cops said it.

754
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,640
It's okay to beat you up if you point an iPhone at them when they're beating somebody up.

755
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,320
Because it might be a gun.

756
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:37,960
Really?

757
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,660
And plus, you should never shoot a cyclops, no matter how old they're, 13 or 12.

758
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,080
The only thing an iPhone shoots is a picture.

759
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,940
Are you questioning the New York City Police Department?

760
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,040
Yes, sir.

761
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,360
Well, don't do that in New York City, honey.

762
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,240
Okay.

763
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:04,160
I remember one time in the subway, one of them just walked over and urinated on the third rail.

764
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,600
And I'm sorry.

765
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:13,600
Dave, I feel like we should fly to Ashtabula real fast and give you a tracheotomy or something.

766
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,180
That would be kind of fun, actually.

767
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,480
Not the flying to Ashtabula.

768
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,940
I can't imagine that.

769
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,120
But the, I got a ballpoint pen.

770
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:23,640
No, no.

771
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,180
That's what you use in emergencies.

772
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:25,480
No, no.

773
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,000
I don't need a tracheotomy.

774
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,060
We can't do that.

775
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,100
But you have to plunge it in.

776
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,300
It's suddenly and fast.

777
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,460
You can't just fiddle around.

778
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,340
Nope, nope.

779
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,820
If you're going to give somebody a tracheotomy, just go at it.

780
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,080
Does it get you high?

781
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,800
Is what I was wondering.

782
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,960
We're going to have to watch the film The Heat, dear.

783
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,760
And then after you see that, you won't want to do it with the pen anymore.

784
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,240
Really?

785
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,420
There's a scene like that?

786
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:49,740
Yeah.

787
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,400
The film is The Geese?

788
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,560
A movie called The Heat.

789
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:53,900
The Heat.

790
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,040
Oh, The Heat.

791
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,580
I thought you meant The Canada Geese.

792
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,680
Oh, it's a comic.

793
00:42:59,300 --> 00:42:59,700
Those two.

794
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,920
It's a comedy.

795
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,580
That's what you sound like.

796
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,940
A goose.

797
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,900
He does sound like a goose.

798
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,020
I'm like a river.

799
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,480
I'm like a river old school actor of the old days.

800
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,060
With a river twangy voice and a nasal husky overtones.

801
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,820
And a vacuum cleaner stuck neatly in my derriere.

802
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,460
And I'm screaming out to the world, pay attention to me.

803
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,960
About all things because I'm so...

804
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,040
Never mind.

805
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,280
Not everyone can wear that, you know, Dave.

806
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,400
Not everyone can wear it.

807
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,260
I'm a D-cup, baby.

808
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,640
You know what I'm saying?

809
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:34,980
I see, yeah.

810
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,180
I'm still...

811
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,500
Sorry.

812
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,300
I was thinking about...

813
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,360
I was thinking about the electric pumps on my head.

814
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,740
You know, but I didn't...

815
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,720
The electric sub-pump on your head?

816
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,820
No, the electro-cups.

817
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,500
The electro-cups.

818
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:55,880
The D-cups.

819
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,060
The brassieres.

820
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,140
The D-cups on your head.

821
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,100
The head.

822
00:43:59,100 --> 00:43:59,400
The head brass.

823
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,040
And you know...

824
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,480
You know, on one of them.

825
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,320
You know, despite the demon attack, the phones work fine.

826
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,820
But Dave's voice doesn't work.

827
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,220
This time his phone works and the phone lines here work.

828
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,300
But Dave's voice is all like...

829
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,680
Sounds like Pigman.

830
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,380
Remember Pigman?

831
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,700
He's calling the station all the time.

832
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,340
Pigman.

833
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,180
I learned how to shave a pig with a blowtorch from Pigman.

834
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:36,260
Well, this music in the background is from the band Mayan Ruins, who are friends of ours.

835
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,800
They play at Starwood a lot.

836
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,960
And it's from their CD called Temple of Ancient Dub.

837
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,240
Yaman.

838
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,320
Ya.

839
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,000
Yaman.

840
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,760
Yeah, this has a bunch of people playing on it, but we know Princess Wee.

841
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,300
Yes.

842
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,880
I like Duke.

843
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,340
But we never know their real names.

844
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,420
Huh?

845
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,140
Hey, hey, hey.

846
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,860
Do you know what Duke knew?

847
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:58,740
Of course you know.

848
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,420
I know about Dub and Scott, but have you ever heard of Dupa music?

849
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:08,660
I'm sure we might have heard it from any Polish people that happen to live in the area.

850
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:09,460
Perhaps.

851
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,220
Dupa music?

852
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,440
Dupa music?

853
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:12,860
Dupa music.

854
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,120
But music.

855
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,560
I know about a Dupa.

856
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,220
I'm sitting on my Dupa.

857
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:23,320
Yeah, and it makes a sound of its own that's, you know, really hard to recreate.

858
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,580
That's why I've been working on it here for a little bit.

859
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,920
I was hoping I could maybe play...

860
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,640
Kind of like a...

861
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,340
Plotzy sort of sound.

862
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,020
Oh, let me see.

863
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:32,500
Let me look at you.

864
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,080
Oh, wait.

865
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,920
Is this like throat singing?

866
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:42,820
Yeah.

867
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,320
Ha, ha, ha.

868
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,260
Ha, ha.

869
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,560
You see it?

870
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,920
It still thinks I sound like a subcortical or like a human or a subgenius or something like that.

871
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,400
Or that...

872
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,720
My voice is not...

873
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,640
It's not back to its mellifluous beautiful...

874
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:03,880
It's not.

875
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,740
It's not in its usual mellifluous...

876
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:08,620
Yes.

877
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,520
It's beautiful right now.

878
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,380
It's beautiful right now, you liars.

879
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:21,380
I've noticed lately that if I don't talk for a while, believe it or not, that sometimes happens.

880
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:27,220
If when I do start to talk, it starts out like this, and then it kind of settles in.

881
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:27,320
Yeah.

882
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:35,900
I've been having dreams like that, but it's usually that I'm like near some dairy store, like an old-fashioned ice cream place here.

883
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,620
And there's like these...

884
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:43,760
You know how people are real scared of ice cream, or not ice cream men, but clowns, you know?

885
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,080
But so people are like kind of scared of ice cream men, too.

886
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:54,660
It's that same primordial fear of this seemingly nice character.

887
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:56,980
Agreeable character.

888
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:03,860
This seemingly agreeable and nice character is actually the face of your animal fears, you know?

889
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:12,800
I thought the ice cream man decided to put maybe something in the chicken patties.

890
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,500
I'm trying to understand.

891
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:23,440
The ice cream man put some bean in the navy something or other.

892
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,160
I was...

893
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:25,500
I was...

894
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,100
I was...

895
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,980
That's all you can make out of it?

896
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,380
Dave, your voice sounds a little mushy.

897
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,020
I'm not...

898
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,720
It might be your cell phone.

899
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,860
At least we're pretty sure it's not the lines here anymore.

900
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:50,160
It could be the Christian Hartman Mayan Ruins music that's making it difficult.

901
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,540
I don't know.

902
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,700
Well, I know what I'll do.

903
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,220
I'll switch to ESO music.

904
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:56,880
How's that?

905
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,280
I think your nostrils are acting up.

906
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:08,660
But it's okay.

907
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:09,880
It's all right.

908
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,900
You don't dislike my nostrils overall in any sort of way.

909
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,240
They could use a shave, Dave.

910
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:23,160
Well, of course they could use a shave, but why not a little goatee going under the other way?

911
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,860
Having been so, you're symmetrical.

912
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:35,560
Well, you could have your goatee growing up into your nostrils if you guided it with wax and wires and strings long enough.

913
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,920
You could have them grow all the way down.

914
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,340
Now I'm getting an idea now.

915
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,500
I'm getting an idea.

916
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:47,460
What if you grew the hair up into your nostrils, one side of the mustache, okay?

917
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:55,440
Or a split chin beard that curves upwards over the mouth into each nostril.

918
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:56,620
Then...

919
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:56,900
Then...

920
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:57,180
Then...

921
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:57,180


922
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:57,180


923
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:57,180


924
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:57,180


925
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:57,180


926
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:57,200
Then...

927
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:01,380
Comes back around through the throat and out the mouth again.

928
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,620
Can I throw up now?

929
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:02,880
You should.

930
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,200
And then hangs out the sides of your mouth.

931
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,800
It would make eating messy, but, you know, you'd have to...

932
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:10,820
Oh, no.

933
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:16,240
I guess to wash the hair, you'd have to yank it out of your sinuses, wash it, and then work it all back through.

934
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:16,360
Oh, my God.

935
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,540
That's so disgusting.

936
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,060
After a while, it would happen quick.

937
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:25,800
You know, you'd work out stuff with fishing wires and stuff, fishing line to yank the hairs through.

938
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,020
And still, it's tricky.

939
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,560
It's almost like you would have to...

940
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,780
I am not liking any of this.

941
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:39,960
I'm an original thinker, and I've noticed that, you know, the way fashions are, everybody just copies each other.

942
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:47,020
And I've just thrown out an idea that the youth of today who are mostly doughy, pasty sissies,

943
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:53,000
but they spend a lot on haircuts to look like they don't care what people think of them, right?

944
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:53,600
Right.

945
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,740
So that, the mustache...

946
00:49:55,740 --> 00:50:00,540
The mustache that grows up through your sinuses and then back out of your mouth,

947
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:11,100
that would be a truly daring look that would cause a doughy, suburban, hipster kid to, you know,

948
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:15,240
feel like he was doing something really different and special.

949
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,260
And pretty soon, everybody would be doing it.

950
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,700
And, of course, he'd be the first one to cut it off then.

951
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:24,860
And then we'd have to have matching pubis bogeys going the opposite direction.

952
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:30,860
And then we'd have, like, little, like, crop circle designs going on the back,

953
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:35,020
where we have our, you know, the hair on the back of our necks and our backs and stuff like that.

954
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:35,560
Now you're talking.

955
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,240
Kids, you out there, you impressionable kids that are listening to these fashion suggestions, pick up on it.

956
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,080
These are new things.

957
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,140
This has never been done.

958
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:49,760
Here's why I'm going to spill one that Puzzling Evidence suggested about 14 years ago.

959
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,380
We were standing around.

960
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,420
Yes, that Burning Man.

961
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,540
And Puzzling Evidence said,

962
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:04,200
when are they going to start cutting their skin into little ribbons and then weaving it into patterns like a basket?

963
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:09,320
You know, instead of just scarification or body piercings and tattoos,

964
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:14,600
how about just turning ribbons of skin into woven patterns?

965
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:20,020
So, like, your hand all the way up your arm could look like it was woven, like a basket.

966
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,180
You wouldn't have much sensitivity there after that.

967
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:23,700
Yeah.

968
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,240
You know, but it would look cool.

969
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,680
And it would prove that you didn't care what others thought.

970
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:33,840
Like the onerous misbehavior of any misdirected child who's become mean and malevolent

971
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:40,060
and has to have his future spanked down into a small little teeny tiny piece on a circle chart.

972
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,080
Yeah.

973
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,580
Yeah.

974
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,800
Yeah, what he said.

975
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:51,700
Well, I like the woven skin better than losing the last joint of the little finger.

976
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,980
I really didn't like that one.

977
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,060
Oh, was that one of puzzling evidences?

978
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,360
I don't know if it was puzzling evidences or not,

979
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:05,500
but it was some subgenius that was theorizing some new body modifications.

980
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,660
Man, we could think of a whole bunch of them for other people to do.

981
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:17,440
I could think of body mods all night long for impressionable young people to run to the mall and get that done

982
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,220
so they can prove they've been underground, anti-establishment their whole lives.

983
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,060
That's why I call you a grand pooster, too.

984
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,960
That's all you can think of.

985
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,520
Well, you know.

986
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,800
I don't mean a grand pooper.

987
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,280
You know it because you're literally taking that poor child, I forget what her name is,

988
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:40,700
Necklace or Vizima or something or something, really screwy Middle Eastern name and stuff

989
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:47,920
and plashing all over the internet saying you're his or her or its grandfather or any way related

990
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,960
and you say that we all somehow know everything's fine with you now

991
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,060
and that you're not really having a nervous breakdown.

992
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:54,940
Actually.

993
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:55,100
Actually.

994
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,680
Actually, about one out of ten of those people are telling the truth.

995
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,760
They are my grandkids.

996
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,040
Yep.

997
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:02,820
Yep.

998
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,120
And back when I was a grandkid.

999
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:07,860
I knew I'd get you going.

1000
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:09,140
I knew I'd catch you.

1001
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,420
And, you know, trying to, huh?

1002
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:18,040
Back when I was a grandkid, you couldn't buy your coolness at the mall like a tattoo.

1003
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,140
You had to grow it because it was your hair.

1004
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,480
That was how you showed you were cool is you grew your hair real long.

1005
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:24,900
It proved.

1006
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,060
It proved you didn't have a job and were cool.

1007
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,360
And my hair is now.

1008
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,740
Honestly, it actually has made it.

1009
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,060
I can quite honestly say that it's made it down to my butt.

1010
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,160
The upper butt.

1011
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:38,860
Yes.

1012
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,260
But.

1013
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:39,560
But.

1014
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,440
Yes.

1015
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,920
I had a nightmare last night.

1016
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,500
I just remembered it on the way to the station.

1017
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:48,840
Last night, I dreamed that I got really drunk and I was drunk in the dream.

1018
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:54,160
And I went, I'm going to change my life around.

1019
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,280
I'm just going to start all over.

1020
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,660
I'm cutting this ponytail off right now.

1021
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:04,800
And I snipped it off in an instant and then got sick to my stomach because I do that.

1022
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,080
That took 25 years to grow.

1023
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,940
And then I woke up and went, oh, thank goodness.

1024
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,160
I never got that drunk last night.

1025
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,680
My my my vanity is still attached to the back of my head.

1026
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,180
Yeah.

1027
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:23,940
As far as prophecy is concerned, I mean, how could anything be more absurd and ridiculous?

1028
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,160
You merely cut off a small portion of your skull.

1029
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:35,640
Now, it's not as if you're growing like, you know, flounders to repopulate the great banks, you know.

1030
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:43,400
Well, remember when the skinheads decided to rebel against the long hair look by cutting all the hair off and being bald headed.

1031
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:48,660
That actually originated with that trend started with white supremacist skinhead punks.

1032
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,920
But later became popular among all white supremacists, not just punks.

1033
00:54:53,940 --> 00:55:02,860
So and just pinks, punks, pinks, white supremacists and pink supremacists and lots of black supremacists, I suppose.

1034
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:03,660
What you see, G.

1035
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:14,120
So as I was saying, white supremacists, you know, a really cool, the really cool white supremacists were the kids that wouldn't just shave their heads.

1036
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:17,080
They would shave the skin off the top of their heads.

1037
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,460
They were called skull heads.

1038
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,340
Yeah.

1039
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,260
Yeah.

1040
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,620
But the fascists put them down, man.

1041
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:23,840
Shipped them off.

1042
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:24,700
Shipped them off to Australia.

1043
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,340
Like strawberry jello, like they use in the movies and stuff like they'd be chewing on it.

1044
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,540
So they look like they're eating human flesh and everything.

1045
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:35,100
And they'd be growling and stuff like that.

1046
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:42,980
And then this big, huge tubby ladies, corporal, corporeal, massively huge, humongous lady looks like she comes from the nurse's aid station.

1047
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,040
All the way from the other side of town.

1048
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,360
She takes a bus over there.

1049
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,840
And starts beating the living hell out of them.

1050
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,840
And I was going to tell them, you know, that probably gets the law.

1051
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,200
And on that note, we must end this show, Dave.

1052
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:06,160
Actually, I have five minutes of stuff I need to play in order to pack up and make way for the following show.

1053
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,480
That sounds great.

1054
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:13,600
And you should, you know, probably, oh, geez, now you made me forget what I was going to say.

1055
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,200
That's okay, because you don't have time to say it.

1056
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:21,240
And I'm going to do the thing now where I slowly start fading you out.

1057
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:21,860
Oh, let's see.

1058
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,900
I have to be ready with.

1059
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,800
I'm not going to remember anywhere.

1060
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,880
I'll just start babbling.

1061
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,180
I know, but you'll hear the tape later and you'll hear how insultingly I fade you out like that.

1062
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,160
So mean.

1063
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:34,580
Oops.

1064
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:43,640
Friends, I neglected to mention all through the show that the headlines were from raw story dot com.

1065
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,060
Praise Bob.

1066
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,820
Miss Quimby, just exactly who is this Bob person?

1067
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,920
Don't you know who Bob is?

1068
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:53,780
I'm surprised.

1069
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:54,700
It's you, Mr.

1070
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:55,320
Christian.

1071
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,540
Well, after all, he's one of the best known of the 20th century.

1072
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:08,080
I gobbled up the mountains at the sky and drank the sea until I was the universe.

1073
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,280
The universe was.

1074
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:20,000
Life, which burned and bled in the triumph of my dream.

1075
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,920
Dim days where I stood steaming.

1076
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:50,360
Brightly in the sleep spun sight stunned glimmer of that eagle crested dream thrust through the drafty tongue tied pause of those whose tender envelope of word washed flesh flinging that nameless bitter tear stripped cry to the ice green wind whipped strawberry passion of my fractured spleens.

1077
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,720
Old lymph drained.

1078
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,900
Lid.

1079
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:54,240
Liquid.

1080
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:54,700
Bob.

1081
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:07,640
The poem that I just recited to you was composed in a hospital in Burma.

1082
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:17,640
As I lay close to death, having been savagely beaten by a horde of outraged Belgian tourists.

1083
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,040
You will find this poem in my collected verse entitled.

1084
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:24,860
Forests.

1085
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:25,820
Bob.

1086
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:31,760
It is not yet been published in this country, but you can get a privately edited edition.

1087
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,360
Signed personally by the author.

1088
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:42,220
Either in cash or money order to Bob.

1089
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,880
Sub-G soundation.

1090
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:49,740
P.O. Box 181 417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1091
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,040
I would also like to express my thanks to the Ministry of Slack.

1092
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:53,920
Who had the courage to write this poem.

1093
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:59,020
And may I say the wisdom to invite me here.

1094
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:10,760
As you know, Bob's work has been banned and Bob's books have been burned in 27 major countries and 14 newly emergent nations.

1095
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,780
Why are they afraid of Bob?

1096
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,640
Asks oneself.

1097
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,700
Why?

1098
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,760
Because Bob.

1099
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,560
Bob celebrates the virtue.

1100
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,740
The beauty.

1101
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:23,760
The wonder.

1102
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,560
The ultimate.

1103
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:27,300
Ineffable.

1104
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:28,760
Desire.

1105
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,520
Of the ecstasy of Bob.

1106
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,300
Oh, dulcis.

1107
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,460
Imperatrix.

1108
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,940
Whatever that may mean.

1109
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:44,840
Bob.

1110
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:45,840
Smarts on.

1111
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,960
Smarts for me.

1112
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,680
Oh, I like to kiss.

1113
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:49,100
Bob.

1114
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:50,480
Smarts on the cheek.

1115
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,240
Before they fall asleep.

1116
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,320
Inside of my brain.

1117
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:54,980
Bob.

1118
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,820
Smarts are wonderful things.

1119
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:57,940
Stop it.

1120
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:02,560
Don't you know that for every smart you learn, some other smart gets pushed out of your head?

1121
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:06,720
And if you learn a whole book, you'll erase your mind and you'll forget about.

1122
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,380
Hello.

1123
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:09,580
Hello.

1124
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:10,560
Hello.

1125
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,300
Just as I thought.

1126
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:15,780
Dead.

1127
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,500
P.O. Box 181 417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1128
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,100
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1129
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:27,340
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1130
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:32,380
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1131
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:33,120
Bob.

1132
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:33,620
Bob.

1133
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:33,760
Bob.

1134
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,000
Bob.

1135
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,240
Bob.

1136
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:34,320
Bob.

1137
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:34,320


1138
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:35,220
Bob.

1139
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:35,440
Bob.

1140
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:35,560


1141
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:35,760
Bob.

1142
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:36,480
Bob.

1143
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:36,480


1144
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:36,660
Bob.

1145
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:36,660


1146
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:36,700
Bob.

1147
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:36,700


1148
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:37,740
Bob.

1149
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:48,540
Bob.

1150
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:49,640
Bob.

1151
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,160
Bob.

1152
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:50,400
Bob.

1153
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,020
Bob.

1154
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:51,180
Bob.

1155
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:51,180


1156
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:53,780
Bob.

1157
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:54,360
Bob.

1158
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:54,780
Bob.

1159
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:55,420
Bob.

1160
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:55,680
Bob.

1161
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,000
Bob.

1162
01:00:58,980 --> 01:00:59,460
Bob.

1163
01:00:59,620 --> 01:00:59,720
Bob.

1164
01:00:59,740 --> 01:00:59,760
Bob.

1165
01:00:59,780 --> 01:00:59,800
Bob.

1166
01:00:59,820 --> 01:00:59,840
Bob.

1167
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,280
Bob.

1168
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:00,280


1169
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:00,280


1170
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:00,280


1171
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:00,280


1172
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:00,280


1173
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:00,420
Bob.

1174
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,120
Bob.

1175
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,360
Bob.

1176
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:04,880
Bob.

1177
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,160
even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1178
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,560
$50 makes an even bigger difference.

1179
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:17,260
All we're saying is that glow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs

1180
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:19,340
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1181
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:24,800
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1182
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:33,680
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio

1183

44118

1184
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:42,500
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
