1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,800
Truth is, this is the Ornette Lena.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,740
Whoever named the Canadian River found his ex-wife and remarried her, but his wife would have none of it.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,860
The Ornette Lena.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,520
In a moment, I'll tell you the incredible story of the longest and shortest mold.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,940
They both lived to celebrate somewhere else.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,460
The Ornette Lena.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,200
Alright, go ahead.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,740
I don't know what to do, Joe.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,500
I got no place to turn. There's nothing I can do.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,140
Well, come on. What's it all about?

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,820
Who do you talk to when you find out your son's an addict?

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,400
When did you first figure that he might be using narcotics?

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,020
He's a dope addict, Joe.

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,520
That's all I can do to keep my hands off him.

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,180
Alright, now what's he done, Ed?

16
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,480
First, I couldn't believe it, but tonight Ellen and I went to his room.

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,020
We found this.

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,580
Where'd you find this, Ed?

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,680
In his room.

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,240
I had it hidden up on the shelf in his closet. I found it tonight.

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,660
Looks like a...

22
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,700
Some genius!

23
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,580
Power of...

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,400
What?

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,380
Why?

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,380
Stang has proven hardy.

27
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,300
But Stang has...

28
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,460
The chances of him...

29
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:13,600
Who?

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,540
Stang.

31
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,360
From the Spanish, Miss Daniel.

32
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,000
Meaning untamed.

33
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,000
Stang weakening.

34
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,720
All for the sake of money.

35
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,520
And you know it.

36
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,380
You've taken him so very far, stud.

37
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,080
Pull out now, Stang.

38
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,700
And I'll come, stud.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,380
Are you willing to kill him?

40
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,540
Fuck, Stang.

41
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,820
Pull out now, Stang.

42
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,880
And I'll come.

43
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,540
Preaching on sex.

44
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,660
Think about romance.

45
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,300
Think about fatal attractions.

46
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,460
You will groan when your flesh and body are spent.

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,720
The lips drip honey.

48
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,120
Honey.

49
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,800
Drink cum.

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,580
Great job.

51
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,640
A relationship.

52
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,580
Sex.

53
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,000
May your fountain be blessed.

54
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,580
May her breath satisfy you at all times.

55
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,540
To have a growing erection.

56
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,640
Let me share with you today.

57
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,800
Enter into the arena of sex.

58
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,340
Sex.

59
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,780
Sexual.

60
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,540
You know what?

61
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,000
Every now and then I just have to come.

62
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,580
Are you ready?

63
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,480
So beautiful and so harmless and so wonderful.

64
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,620
Sexual landmine.

65
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,780
Word and a flatter.

66
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,800
Listen to me, fellas.

67
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,920
I want every guy in the room to lock eyes with me for just a second.

68
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,220
Lush in your heart.

69
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,080
Your words say no, but your eyes say yes.

70
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,020
Look lustfully at a woman, at a girl.

71
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Sexual landmine.

72
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,480
Maximize.

73
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,320
Listen well to my words of insight.

74
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,300
Smoother, smoother than oil.

75
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,720
I got news for you.

76
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,440
Are you listening?

77
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,640
Can anyone help me?

78
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,360
Do you have any suggestions?

79
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,520
If you love me.

80
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,660
Love Bob, come with me.

81
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:40,760
Yes, that was a wonderful number by our orchestra organist, Raymond Price, here on the Bob Hour.

82
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,400
Yes, yes ladies and gentlemen.

83
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,820
We're glad to have you here.

84
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,140
My wife, Zelma.

85
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,140
Our dog, Snavely.

86
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,080
Did you tell him about Bob?

87
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,280
Okay, sit down everybody.

88
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,140
Can you hear me?

89
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,100
Can you hear me out there?

90
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,800
Yeah, yeah, I think it's time for a song.

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,100
Ladies and gentlemen, do you want to hear a song?

92
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,700
Bob sucks.

93
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,200
Crump his ass.

94
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,160
Kill him.

95
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,500
Kill him.

96
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,400
Dog guanubisантes.

97
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,720
Fuckin' know-it-normal GADA sustan-

98
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,380
Careful, my young students.

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,900
You cannot stay in this state all day.

100
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,800
Why not?

101
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,480
Yeah why not?

102
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,700
It is inevitable that you are drawn back into human drama.

103
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,520
Desire.

104
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,100
Suffering.

105
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,440
Everything that exists in this imperfect world.

106
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:46,840
Shit.

107
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,620
So we get drawn back into human drama, and how important we think that is.

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,300
Then we do crazy stuff.

109
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,520
We have to go back to the ball so we can get the freedom of being like a, like a dish of

110
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,740
multi.

111
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,020
Yes.

112
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,480
And then back into the heaven.

113
00:03:59,480 --> 00:03:59,480


114
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,620
back to the drama, the suffering.

115
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,120
It's kind of a crappy deal.

116
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,840
C'est exactement ça.

117
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,680
An absurd theatrical we must play out

118
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,460
back and forth from pure being to human suffering.

119
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,440
But isn't the drama and suffering less

120
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,720
if we do the ball thing every day?

121
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,580
Don't call it the ball thing.

122
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,360
Call it pure being.

123
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,120
Well, doesn't the pure being ball thing

124
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,520
make the day-to-day suffering easier?

125
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,080
No, it doesn't.

126
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,920
You're wrong.

127
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,440
No, we're going to do this every day

128
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,780
and we'll show you it'll make it easier.

129
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,980
I'll prove it to you.

130
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,340
Human drama is inevitable.

131
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,220
Suffering cannot be diminished.

132
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,720
You cannot escape, Tommy.

133
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,320
You'll see.

134
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,060
Existence is a cruel joke

135
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,120
that entices in a form of desire.

136
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,160
It's a theater of desire.

137
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,700
My little body hurts.

138
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,700
It's painful.

139
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,200
Mr. Data,

140
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,160
what do you know of homosexuality?

141
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,400
Intriguing.

142
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,600
Accessing.

143
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,860
It appears to be a means of pleasuring

144
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,700
between two males.

145
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,300
But I am curious as to why you should ask me such a question.

146
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,360
Mr. Data,

147
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,880
as your commanding officer,

148
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,000
you must obey any order

149
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,580
no matter how deranged or insane I choose to give.

150
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,160
That is correct, sir.

151
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,660
Federation dictates it.

152
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:05,900
Mr. Data,

153
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,040
I'm going to take down

154
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,780
my Starfleet regulation issue trousers

155
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,600
and when I do,

156
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,880
I want you to

157
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,040
drive me home.

158
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,600
I must obey any order you give me.

159
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,520
Make it so.

160
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,440
Engage.

161
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,540
Must stop.

162
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,320
You must stop or you will hurt the captain.

163
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,640
You have killed the captain.

164
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,440
You have ruptured him in two.

165
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,660
It's cleft.

166
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,700
Nine out of ten top Hollywood stars

167
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,840
depend on facials to keep their skin

168
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,100
just right for the camera.

169
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,280
There's a reason why this fragrant white facial

170
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,700
is the choice of lovely,

171
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,400
lovely women everywhere.

172
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,120
In recent tests,

173
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,760
facials really make skin lovelier

174
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,020
in a short time.

175
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,540
Really?

176
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,740
The right care for delicate skin.

177
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,540
I am the key master.

178
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,800
I am the gatekeeper.

179
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,800
One of the men of sedentary...

180
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,060
Breckenrod.

181
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:30,500
trouble.

182
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:30,500


183
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:30,500


184
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:30,500

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,480

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,220


192
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,360
long

193
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,340
and incorrect

194
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:50,420
Jaw absolutely

195
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:50,840
long

196
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:54,760
speed

197
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:55,680


198
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,480
Sing when I want

199
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,400
No need to say please to no man for a happy tune

200
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Oh, I love my Rosie child

201
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,820
She got the way to make me happy

202
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,120
You and me, we're going in style

203
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,860
Cracklin' Rosie, you're a storm-eyed woman

204
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:26,000
You make me sing like a guitar strummin'

205
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,920
Bring on your baby girl, the song keeps runnin'

206
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:31,940
Oh

207
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,600
Play it now, play it now, play it now

208
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,700
Oh my baby

209
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,560
Cracklin' Rosie, make me smile

210
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,760
Girl, if it lasts for an hour, well, that's all right

211
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,360
We got all night

212
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,960
To set the world right

213
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,180
Find us a dream, but don't ask no questions

214
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,820
Yeah

215
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,620
Oh, I love my Rosie child

216
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,860
You got the way to make me happy

217
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:20,840
Yeah

218
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,460
You and me, we're going in style

219
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,140
Cracklin' Rosie, you're a storm-eyed woman

220
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,140
You make me sing like a guitar strummin'

221
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,000
Bring on your baby girl, the song keeps runnin'

222
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,720
Oh

223
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,920
Oh

224
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:43,840
Oh

225
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,100
Oh

226
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,160
Oh

227
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,080
Oh

228
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,220
Oh

229
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,720
Oh

230
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:47,820
Oh

231
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,700
Oh

232
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,460
Oh

233
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:49,720
Oh

234
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:49,780
Oh

235
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:49,980
Oh

236
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,060
Oh

237
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,140
Oh

238
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,140


239
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,500
Oh

240
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:50,520
Oh

241
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:50,540
Oh

242
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:50,540


243
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:50,540


244
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,600
Oh

245
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,700
Oh

246
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,720
Oh

247
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:53,960
Oh

248
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,560
Oh

249
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,220
Oh

250
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,160
Oh

251
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,380
Oh

252
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:56,560
Oh

253
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:56,760
Oh

254
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:56,780
Oh

255
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:56,920
Oh

256
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,020
Oh

257
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,680
Oh

258
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:57,680


259
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:57,820
Oh

260
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,200
Oh

261
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,200


262
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,400
Oh

263
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,660
Oh

264
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:58,660


265
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:58,660


266
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:58,660


267
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:58,660


268
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:58,960
Oh

269
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


270
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


271
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


272
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


273
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


274
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


275
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


276
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


277
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


278
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


279
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


280
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,500
Cracklin' Rosie by the Rudy Schwartz Project.

281
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,180
You can learn more about the Rudy Schwartz Project CVs.

282
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,140
There are quite a few of them from schwartztone.com.

283
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,020
We'll give that address again later.

284
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,420
This is a sexy hour of slack.

285
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,660
Dear friends, number 1068, Bob Corb, baby.

286
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,460
I'm going to do the credits differently this time.

287
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:36,240
I've got to prepare my online course in subgeniusness with Maybe Logic Academy.

288
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,740
I'm Professor Stang now, and I'm in a big hurry.

289
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,300
That's maybelogic.org, by the way.

290
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,480
Anyway, the show started with Lee Murr, as always, just about always.

291
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,920
One of his intro cut-ups.

292
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:57,060
The Geeks of Dubious Sexuality helped us out there with a little Stangian cut-up.

293
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,800
Noriel Preff did a great job.

294
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:11,220
And the Bob hour there was Sterno, Pope Sterno Docs and Doctors for Bob from Media Barrage No. 4 in 1981 or something.

295
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,220
A little clip from a movie called I Heart Huckabees,

296
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,400
which is wonderful.

297
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,940
Wonderful movie.

298
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:27,640
The tasteless Star Trek cut was from National Cynical Network, and there will be more of that.

299
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,220
And there is more of that at nationalcynical.com.

300
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,820
Lee Murr did some facials.

301
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,640
And friends, that's about it.

302
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,900
In fact, he's going to do a little bit more of facializing here.

303
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,940
Back to now Lee Murr.

304
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,160
Everyone loves him.

305
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
I'm going to keep talking.

306
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,880
I'm going to talk a lot.

307
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,240


308
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,240


309
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,400
There you go Mr. Cr mascotta.

310
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:10,880
As he does things and says weird things.

311
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:10,880


312
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,380
And goodbye take home benny.

313
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,200
Get down this.

314
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,940
Be careful with that ear right there.

315
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,020
Can't hear you?

316
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,220
All right.

317
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,100
So you hipster chicks got over 50 pairs of dark martins,

318
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,900
throw those cuties under 110 in five four.

319
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,000
That's right, if you're under 18 and got the face of a China

320
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,160
dog and never much cared for guys your own age,

321
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,400
then Uncle Bob's is the place.

322
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,200
Gonna lay down like this now and look up some skirts.

323
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,360
Oh, yeah.

324
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,660
Danny's not loud, and Uncle Bob's no sort of under way loud.

325
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,980
I'm the coolest cat's this side of the Rio.

326
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,600
If you're missing a wiener and don't like school,

327
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,780
then don't be a fool.

328
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,960
Get on down, down up here to the Stink Finger Cafe.

329
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,440
Open 10 AM till 2 PM every weekday

330
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,300
by special permission of the government state

331
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,040
licensing board.

332
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,100
An oasis of fresh butterfly lips and adolescent sweater fruit,

333
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,860
all ripe and throbbing for Uncle Bob

334
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,700
and his heavy meat crystal.

335
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,900
Yes.

336
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,980
Oh.

337
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,860
Oh.

338
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,700
Oh.

339
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:19,800


340
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,140
Oh.

341
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,400
Oh.

342
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,060
Oh.

343
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,120
Oh.

344
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,620
Oh.

345
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:21,640
Oh.

346
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,140
Don't be scared, lovely ladies.

347
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,600
That's just a little bug that hangs out of my mouth,

348
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,260
kicking back on the flip side.

349
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,820
Hey, y'all.

350
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,720
My name is Bug.

351
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,520
I like to drink something red.

352
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,580
It has a sort of funny smell.

353
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,720
And it comes from a hot horn.

354
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,880
But I can't tell you where that horn is.

355
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,120
I like to laugh at celebrity suicide.

356
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,800
I like it when little children are used as human shields.

357
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,260
I'm the one who shot Kennedy.

358
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,300
Me, Bug, and not me, Harvey Asbach.

359
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,800
I'm the one who should be praying to God.

360
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,620
Baby, no!

361
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,720
No!

362
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,260
No!

363
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,340
No!

364
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,700
I want everyone to die so they can all go back

365
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,020
to heaven and relax.

366
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,440
I'm tired of wearing this body.

367
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,420
Have to feed it.

368
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,440
Have to keep it moist.

369
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,340
Have to constantly protect it from those who want to hurt Bug

370
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,920
or eat him.

371
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,360
Also, I get these terrible pains in my anal region

372
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,900
that hurt really bad.

373
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,320
Let it make good things.

374
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,540
I have a green slimy snot gush out of my butt

375
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,660
and this causes hemorrhoids.

376
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,180
And because I'm a bug and not a dog or person,

377
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,060
I can't reach back and scratch them.

378
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,200
And they itch terribly.

379
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,980
I have to get back to Uncle Bob's mouth now

380
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,160
so I can rub my butt across one of his teeth

381
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,600
and leave bloody poopy smears.

382
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,880
Yeah, whoever smelt it just does it.

383
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,740
Just yesterday, a friend of mine sniffed out a tropical tree

384
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,840
some hundred yards away, exclaiming about the power of the scent.

385
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,860
I smelled nothing.

386
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,760
Does he have a history of this in his family?

387
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,380
Until I pushed, well, her family.

388
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,140
I pushed one of the deep creamy white blossoms

389
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,760
flush with my nose.

390
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,560
And then I detected only a mild musky odor.

391
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,580
I'm sorry, but it is the same when we go mushrooming as well.

392
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,300
You mushrooming?

393
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,680
You know?

394
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,240
A mushrooming problem.

395
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,700
She's always the first to realize that stinkhorns are about.

396
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,640
All right, now stop right there.

397
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,620
Stinkhorns, as you may know, are very dramatic mushrooms

398
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,100
with names like Phallus impudicus.

399
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,620
Yes, they're the drama queens of the fungal world.

400
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,300
Which erect from the soil in a form so true to their name

401
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,100
that is scarcely credible

402
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,080
and whose aroma brings in sticky-footed flies.

403
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,640
Which will then disperse their spores.

404
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,640
And the point of all this is...

405
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,900
I usually see them as soon as I smell them.

406
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,100
Our difference in olfactory acumen has nothing to do with, say,

407
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,340
the considerable difference in the size of our respective proboscis.

408
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,880
Don't underestimate the humble fly.

409
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,300
Just let me get my sleeping bag packed up here.

410
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:45,300


411
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,740
Yes, I wish you'd quit fidgeting.

412
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,160
We're trying to get some...

413
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,660
Whoa!

414
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,160
No, he's rolled into the...

415
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,440
That's terrible. I'm sorry.

416
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,360
Now you're sleeping...

417
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,280
How are you going to sleep in a wet sleeping bag?

418
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,580
I'll have to find somebody with a dry sleeping bag.

419
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,760
A warm, dry bag.

420
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,680
Try those little children over there in that campsite

421
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,220
that doesn't have any...

422
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,060
Pants?

423
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,480
Any pants on it.

424
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,600
I'll have to get them out of bed.

425
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

426
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,060


427
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,060


428
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,060


429
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,060


430
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,060


431
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,080
I'll try and get them out of bed.

432
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,140
I'll try and get them out of bed.

433
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,980
A little frotter so-dy noise there.

434
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,600
Actually, I have no idea if that's the way his name is pronounced,

435
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,080
or if he's even a he,

436
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,640
but I'm pretty sure he is.

437
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,280
Anyway, before that puzzling,

438
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,540
evidence from KPFA in Berkeley

439
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,460
with Dr. Howell and Dr. Philo Drummond,

440
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,080
and you can find all kinds of that sort of thing

441
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,440
by way of quiveringbrain.com.

442
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,140
That's Philo's website.

443
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,840
Before that, Uncle Bob and Bug

444
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,480
was from National Cynical Network.

445
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,920
See nationalcynical.com for more of that,

446
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,020
thanks to Phineas and Arco.

447
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,540
And now let us hie to 9X Day

448
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,160
for the oracle that we call the...

449
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,120
Ask Dr. Howell Show.

450
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,340
Here's one that will require visual aids, I think.

451
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,360
Oh, all right.

452
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,080
What is the nature of the symbol atop this staff?

453
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,440
See brandished item.

454
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,560
Oh, well, will you look at that.

455
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,840
The Leaston Fellow brandishing a...

456
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,080
What a beautiful staff it is.

457
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,340
That's what she said.

458
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,000
A staff of the Masonic Order

459
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,160
from a symbolic...

460
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,200
activity performed by the nobles of the Masonic Temple.

461
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,820
And the crescent of the Masonic Order

462
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,800
is there with three links attached to it.

463
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,600
Now for those three links,

464
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,740
you would have to go into,

465
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,780
or perhaps past,

466
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,280
weirdos like Manly Palmer Hall,

467
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,400
who said in his book,

468
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,140
The Secret Teaching of All Ages,

469
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,100
that these three links completely were equivalent

470
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,300
to the Christian faith, hope, charity,

471
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,220
or the Trinity,

472
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,220
itself of the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost.

473
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,120
But, of course, anything might be possible.

474
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,180
The central figure is time.

475
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,240
And this shows that this primitive precursor

476
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,680
to the Church of the Subgenius,

477
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,900
the Masonic Order,

478
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,000
was also concerned with the problem of time control,

479
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,460
one which, as subgeniuses,

480
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,400
concerns us all.

481
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,580
By the way, that Manly P. Hall's

482
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,100
classic book of...

483
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,420
kind of an occult encyclopedia

484
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:44,860
is now

485
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:45,960
free online.

486
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,600
But that isn't as fun as the huge,

487
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,700
bad-smelling book itself

488
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,680
with a black leather cover

489
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,840
that you have to

490
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,760
haul down and open up.

491
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,780
Actually, my dad

492
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,760
gave me his guilt-edged

493
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,420
copy of that book.

494
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,740
He had the deluxe copy.

495
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,960
It's a really important book

496
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,660
to those of us who have put together subgenius books.

497
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,440
It is proto-subgenius stuff.

498
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,900
We do not so much stand on the shoulders

499
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,400
of giants as we hump furiously

500
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,340
at the backs of the necks of giants.

501
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,440
And Manly P. Hall

502
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,900
is one of those giants.

503
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,280
If you ever get a chance to look through

504
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,660
his huge book,

505
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,040
which is half illustrations,

506
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,260
it may answer some of the questions

507
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,480
you've wondered about

508
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,560
looking through the book of the subgenius

509
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,620
in Revelation X.

510
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,900
As above, so below.

511
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,000
Well, many of the figures in his giant text

512
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,280
have to do with Alcanon,

513
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,980
which is the alchemical symbology

514
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,000
and allegory.

515
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,260
And what's odd is the sort of weak

516
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,300
namby-pamby way they're shown

517
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,980
instead of the vigor of the actual alchemical texts

518
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,420
and books if you look at them

519
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,460
or if you see them.

520
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,600
I will say this.

521
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,180
If you are thinking of starting your own religion,

522
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,220
Manly P. Hall's

523
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,960
Secret Wisdom of All Ages

524
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,500
is a great handbook.

525
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,680
He's been there.

526
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,380
Yeah.

527
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,360
In all of them.

528
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,080
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

529
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,040
You seem to have lost the will

530
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,340
to communicate with others.

531
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,780
Though,

532
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,960
there was a young lady from Venus

533
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,420
whose body was shaped like a...

534
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,740
I do not enjoy riddles.

535
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,060
Did I say something wrong?

536
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,780
It is a secret note only to Klingons.

537
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,880
You have friends here.

538
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,620
With all due respect,

539
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,360
this very person here

540
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,060
is difficult to say.

541
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,240
Words are not always easy for me.

542
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,640
Be gone!

543
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,060
I care about you.

544
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,660
Enough!

545
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,420
Of course, but

546
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,980
I am programmed in multiple techniques.

547
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,460
For what we consider love, sir,

548
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,540
I would need a Klingon woman.

549
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,940
A broad variety of pleasuring.

550
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,380
Klingons do not allow themselves to be

551
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,200
probes.

552
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,640
It could be a dangerous mission.

553
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,300
Shall we begin?

554
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,880
It is very difficult to say.

555
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,760
But I know you will do the right thing.

556
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,440
I am ready.

557
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,220
Today,

558
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,080
I am a warrior.

559
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,640
I must show you my heart.

560
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,500
I travel

561
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,240
the river of blood.

562
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,560
Open.

563
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,480
No!

564
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:40,920
Please,

565
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,360
be quick.

566
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:42,500
Wait!

567
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,520
It is a long mission.

568
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,840
I am a big dog.

569
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,380
The true test of Klingon strength

570
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,080
is to admit one's most profound feelings

571
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,900
while under extreme duress.

572
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,060
Thank you.

573
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,660
Captains of security, come in!

574
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,560
This is truly trying my patience.

575
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,800
So,

576
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,420
you should get into uniform.

577
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,340
Don't pull your love out on me, baby

578
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,600
If you do, then I think that maybe

579
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,060
I'll just lay me down, cry for a hundred years

580
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,380
Don't pull your love out on me, honey

581
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,660
Take my heart, my soul, my money

582
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,100
But don't leave me here drowning in my tears

583
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,840
You say you're gonna leave

584
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,200
Gonna take that big wide turn

585
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,340
Gonna fly right out of here

586
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,660
Without a single word

587
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,960
But you know you'll break my heart

588
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,700
When I watch you close that door

589
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,740
Cause I know I won't see you anymore

590
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,640
Don't pull your love out on me, baby

591
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,860
If you do, then I think that maybe

592
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,200
I'll just lay me down, cry for a hundred years

593
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,620
Don't pull your love out on me, honey

594
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,900
Take my heart, my soul, my money

595
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,140
But don't leave me here drowning

596
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,300
In my tears

597
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,060
Haven't I been good to you?

598
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,400
What about that brand new ring?

599
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,620
Doesn't that mean love to you?

600
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,560
Oh, doesn't that mean anything?

601
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,140
If I throw away my pride

602
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,980
And I got down on my knees

603
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,400
Would you beg me back, you worthy please?

604
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,280
There's so much I wanna do

605
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,580
I've got love enough for two

606
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,380
But I'll never choose a girl if I don't have you

607
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,400
Push it in, pull it in

608
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,460
Push it in, pull it in

609
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,120
Every gal in town is a girl

610
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,440
After little Goop Goop

611
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,960
He's the biggest Yoo-hoo

612
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,920
Trimming, kissing, birdie women

613
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,120
But they whisper, what's your secret fashion?

614
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,500
Little Abner says, Bart

615
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,420
We call Great Spirit

616
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,220
Where's the axe?

617
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,700
I love Goop Goop

618
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,500
I don't care

619
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,380
I'm coming

620
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,620
Well, it's about time

621
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,820
More poke, he's stupid

622
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,920
Big lummet

623
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,280
Stink, poke the lunch

624
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,320
Poke, bob, bob

625
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,960
The

626
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,040
You mean that big handsome boy?

627
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,540
Bob

628
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,060
Oh

629
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,740
Oh, my

630
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:39,740


631
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,500
Oh

632
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,220
Oh

633
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,300
I'll never be able to understand technique

634
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,920
Big sloppy

635
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,200
Oh

636
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,980
Oh

637
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,880
Oh

638
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,520
Quit complaining, Lucifer

639
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,140
Bob

640
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,600
Bob, Bob, sweet patootie

641
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,740
Come on, stick it out

642
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,400
Stick it way out

643
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,360
I'm gonna make love to her like she always wanted me to

644
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,620
Most ignorant as critter I ever did see

645
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,140
I'm gonna make love to you

646
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,180
Powerful, romantic love

647
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,680
Enormous corn porn

648
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,200
He's heard

649
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,460
Bart, Bart, Bart, Bart

651
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:10,340


652
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:10,340


653
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:10,340


654
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:10,340


655
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:10,340


656
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:10,340


657
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:10,340


658
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,760
Um

659
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,320
Jake

660
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,520
Damn

661
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:25,560
Close

662
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:25,900
Yo

663
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,580
of the time, I guess.

664
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,860
I'm in the other 20%, friends.

665
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,740
So thanks to Mula Mutata for the

666
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,100
movie clips, and before that,

667
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,320
The Pork was by

668
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,700
Norrell Preff, and is from the

669
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,020
1940 Little Abner

670
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,500
movie.

671
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,580
Rudy Schwartz Project did

672
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,200
Don't Pull Your Love,

673
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,460
and Data and Worf

674
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,740
Have Sex was courtesy

Network.

677
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,020
And now,

678
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,180
more Dr. Howell on

679
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,180
sexual dimorphism.

680
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,560
Millions of years ago,

681
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,400
giant

682
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
dinosaurs roamed

683
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,220
the earth.

684
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,940
The Atlantosaurus

685
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,500
stretched out its long neck,

686
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
its tiny eyes

687
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,640
darting to and fro

688
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,240
as it

689
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,180
its wet and wide mouth

690
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,940
opened, who

691
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,660
roar

692
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,760
inanely in the Jurassic

693
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,320
Song.

694
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,700
Now, what of

695
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,840
dimorphism, sexual

696
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,940
dimorphism, in the

697
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,280
dwarf male,

698
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,780
in humans?

699
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,580
Hmm?

700
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,560
No.

701
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:54,260


702
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,440
What is this twilight world,

703
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,380
this world that fears a rising

704
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:02,980
sun?

705
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,640
In snow geese, which nest

706
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,820
in tightly packed colonies,

707
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,220
it has been shown that mated

708
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,160
males will try to force

709
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,740
to might on neighboring

710
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,320
female.

711
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,740
They defend their own female

712
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,480
mate until all her eggs are laid.

713
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,220
Oh shut up・ ! died ? Oh shut up !!"

714
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,600
And then they make attempts on nearby females.

715
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:32,420
This mixed strategy might result in their fertilizing only one more egg on average,

716
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:38,320
or sometimes even less, but this is still a significant genetic payoff.

717
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:47,980
Access to eggs can be achieved by less overt methods than goose race, gift-giving, or bloody combat.

718
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,800
There is a strategy that seems almost unbeatable, and I wonder why.

719
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,760
Ignominious though it may seem, more males have not pursued it.

720
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,520
It is to become a resident dwarf.

721
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:09,860
Some males become miniaturized, living inside or on the females as a portable sperm bank.

722
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,180
Darwin discovered this strategy when he worked on barnacle taxonomy.

723
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,960
In some species, he found the males had degenerated into...

724
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:27,600
tiny, teensy, weensy, almost parasitic forms consisting of little more than reproductive organs,

725
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,880
with a crude physiology supporting testicles.

726
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,700
These degenerate males led some observers to claim that the females were hermaphrodites,

727
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,840
or as said in the east coast of the Americas, morphodites.

728
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,960
But actually, the male has evolved to become almost...

729
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:52,300
purely a copulatory organ, permanently lodged in residence.

730
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,180
Do I have to draw you a picture?

731
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:02,380
This kind of strategy has led to some of the more extreme forms of sexual dimorphism.

732
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:12,360
In the vertebrates and the insects, extreme sexual dimorphism normally is because of selection for the male fighting and weaponry used to acquire a harem.

733
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,280
When a male opts for an unshakable monogamy,

734
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,960
the opposite dimorphism is the opposite.

735
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:17,960


736
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,540
The opposite dimorphism develops.

737
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:29,280
One well-known case is the marine echeroid worm, Bonelia, common in the rocky bays of the Pacific Northwest and in the Mediterranean.

738
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:36,280
When young Bonelia hatch, they are sexually undifferentiated, free-swimming larvae.

739
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,400
The transformation of their tabula rasa is effected by the bottom on which they settle.

740
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,080
If it is unoccupied, the larva becomes a female.

741
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:57,620
She grows into what is essentially a giant tongue, almost three feet long, with a walnut-sized body at one end.

742
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:04,040
She uses her huge proboscis to pick up food from the bottom around her.

743
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:10,460
Males originate when a larva smells the scent of the female's outsized tongue.

744
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:17,460
If undifferentiated larvae are placed in an aquarium with chopped-up female tongue,

745
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:25,480
or an extract of the proboscis, they change into tiny males, scarcely more than 1 20th of an inch long.

746
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:36,120
In nature, the dwarf male settles on a female proboscis, transforms, then lodges himself in his mate's uterus or beside it.

747
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,520
There he remains for life, leaking out sperm at appropriate moments.

748
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,260
This strategy is known for marine sow bugs.

749
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,120
And for some nematodes, parasitic in rat bladders.

750
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,540
But it is not only of the lowly orders.

751
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,720
There are dwarf male fish.

752
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:03,300
Various species of deep-sea angler fish are dramatically dimorphic.

753
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:09,580
The female is a fearsome-looking predator of the abysmal, dark, lower reaches of the ocean.

754
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:15,920
She has a thick-set body with massive jaws, well armed with teeth and a luminous lure.

755
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:22,560
This latter wobbly, wiggly appendage is an organ developed from the first spine on her dorsal fin,

756
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,880
which projects out in front of her toothy mouth and blinks, luring inquisitive victims.

757
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,940
Male angler fish are so completely different that some were classified as separate species,

758
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,640
until taxonomists discovered them in connection with their female mates.

759
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,380
The male starts off as an unremarkable, surface-dwelling young fish.

760
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,140
But after a while, he develops immense nostrils.

761
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:03,460
And instead of a luminous lure, he grows a special tooth-bearing bone from his first dorsal spine.

762
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:10,940
His mission is to find, perhaps smell out, a female and clamp securely onto her.

763
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,800
In some cases, the attachment becomes permanent.

764
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,460
The male literally becomes part of the female.

765
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,280
He grows into her in such a way that their circulatory systems fuse,

766
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,200
and the male's mouthparts are completely useless for feeding.

767
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,480
He depends entirely on the female.

768
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,480
Presumably, he even reads the hormonal messages of her bloodstream,

769
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:39,280
to determine when he is to, uh, let go his cloud of sperm in one ecstatic moment.

770
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,240
Gah!

771
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,380
The dwarf male has traded mobility,

772
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,060
and the opportunity for multiple mates for a relatively secure monogamy.

773
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,940
This strategy has been explained as an adaptation to females that are rare and widely dispersed.

774
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:01,380
But it argues against the virtues of monogamy for the male individual,

775
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:10,120
since it shows that its evolutionary end is a degenerate dependence, even parasitism.

776
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,060
This will be the case,

777
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,780
where the environment has a low energy level,

778
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:13,840
and the male is not able to

779
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,580
have a large energy content, such as the dark, deep sea.

780
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,860
But where there is still fecundity,

781
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,900
selection on females to be large.

782
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,640
Normally, the larger a female, the more eggs she can lay.

783
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:32,620
Huge size, however, will not help a male get more mates when they are rare and widespread.

784
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,780
His mission is simply to find one and stick to it.

785
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:42,000
Thus, in the kinds of anglerfish and relatives that are common on coral reefs,

786
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:47,400
or in the icheroid worms that feed by moving about and have a high rate of encounter,

787
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,480
dwarf males simply do not exist.

788
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,320
The male then becomes a tiny resident,

789
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:59,300
not as a convenience to the female, but simply because this has been the most successful male tactic.

790
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,540
It is a female dispersion,

791
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:06,140
and the ability of males to control the precious few large female gametes

792
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,360
that make males into chest-thumping gorilla boys,

793
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,860
or degenerate dwarfs.

794
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:18,420
For the better and the best is the bearer of superfluous and tiny gametes.

795
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,100
The body is only a secondary concern.

796
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,700
Access is all.

797
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,640
This has been an essay on the natural history of sex.

798
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,420
Join us next week

799
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,680
as I, Dr. Howland Owl,

800
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,280
will continue to explain

801
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,040
the mystery of the birds and the bees.

802
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,100
See you then.

Uhhhh...

811
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,160
Delicious.

812
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,800
More urine, please.

813
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,180
Mr. Worf, you have drank all the yak urine we can synthesize.

814
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,840
Our replicators are breaking down.

815
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,840
Ch-chaw.

816
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,740
Mr. Worf.

817
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,120
But it is a warrior's drink.

818
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,300
I'm going to have my diarrhea beamed directly to your plate.

819
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,180
Hm, excellent.

820
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,160
You honor me.

821
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,820
Mr. O'Brien, engage.

822
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,180
Right, two second delay.

823
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,300
No, no, now.

824
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,020
Do it now.

825
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,540
Right, now in two seconds.

826
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,460
No, engage now, engage.

827
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,400
Right, in two seconds, engage.

828
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,120
No, not two seconds, engage.

829
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,520
Not two seconds, two seconds, engage.

830
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,600
Right, engaging.

831
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,440
Mmm, our ch-chaw.

832
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,580
It is a warrior's dish.

833
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,680
Captain, I need you in my quarters.

834
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,520
Make it so.

835
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,180
I need you to help me with the ancient ritual of Huck to Clock or Klingon Buttsex.

836
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:09,940
Hm.

837
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,580
Computer.

838
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,240
Lubricant.

839
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:13,880
Irregrate.

840
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,240
Warm.

841
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,620
Hm.

842
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,680
Huck to Cluck.

843
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,120
Ahhh.

844
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,320
What have you done to the captain?

845
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,480
I haven't, I, I don't know.

846
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,340
You appear to have ruptured the captain completely.

847
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,080
I am now commander of the Enterprise.

848
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,280
I believe you need me to help you.

849
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,280


850
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,280


851
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,280


852
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,280


853
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,280


854
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,280


855
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,280


856
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,020
What about number one?

857
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,160
He will be my number two, if you get my meaning.

858
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,060
That was a joke.

859
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:38,980
Oh.

860
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,920
All right, what's going on in here?

861
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,480
You are no longer in command, Mr. Riker.

862
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,360
What do you mean?

863
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,560
Data, what's wrong with you?

864
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,120
I'm going to have to drop my trousers.

865
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,180
I will hold him.

866
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:52,960
No, what?

867
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,760
Oh, no, please!

868
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,140
Oh, God, Lord, no, please, Jesus!

869
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,120
I have ejaculated over 1,600 cubic milliliters of my own hydraulic fluid into his mouth,

870
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,480
effectively killing him.

871
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,780
You have dishonored him.

872
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,980
You're next, Klingon.

873
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,920
Oh, I mean, good job.

874
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,000
Do-wop-da-maga-maga, do-wop-da-maga-maga, do-wop-da-maga-maga,

875
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,120
do-wop-da-maga-maga, do-wop-da-maga-maga, do-wop-da-maga-maga,

876
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,940
do-wop, ba-ba.

877
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,840
Do-wop-da-maga-maga, do-wop-da-maga-maga, do-wop-da-maga-maga, do-wop.

878
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,660
Snuggly-maga, cuddly-maga, snuggly-maga.

879
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,100
Strip-nagged, you sweet maggot.

880
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,440
Pretty children all clap and sing.

881
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,660
Strip-nagged, you sweet maggot.

882
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,820
All the bong-beams smack and ring.

883
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,300
I get so hot watching brown eyeballs rot.

884
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,400
Strip-nagged, you sweet maggot.

885
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,460
Lovely maggot, oh, so sweet.

886
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:00,900
Well, strip maggot, you sweet maggot, all the stars are shining bright.

887
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:06,280
Strip maggot, you sweet maggot, two mezzanine pearly white.

888
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,540
Jump, jump, strolling down the lane, to a happy refrain.

889
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,940
Strip maggot, you sweet maggot, lovely maggot, oh so sweet.

890
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,500
Gorgeous white dipped hair is larva.

891
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:28,040
Larva, germ spreading grub of my dreams.

892
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:34,500
I'll pour the wine while you court me with your slime.

893
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,120
Slug the maggot, slug the maggot, slug the maggot, slug the maggot.

894
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:02,340
Do-wop-ga-magga-magga, do-wop-ga-magga-magga, do-wop-ga-magga-magga-do.

895
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,820
Strip maggot, you sweet maggot, pretty maggot walk by my side.

896
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:13,020
Strip maggot, you sweet maggot, gonna make you my maggot bride.

897
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,460
Mend all my socks while we do the maggot rock.

898
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,560
Strip maggot, you sweet maggot.

899
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,720
Maggot, oh so sweet.

900
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,840
Strip maggot, you sweet maggot.

901
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,380
Lovely maggot.

902
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:28,860
Maggot.

903
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,740
Maggot.

904
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,000
Maggot, oh so sweet.

905
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,520
Joe Newman, the Rudy Schwartz Project.

906
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,240
Who else?

907
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,920
More on that at schwartztone.com.

908
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:49,340
Before that, the tasteless Star Trek from nationalcynical.com.

909
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,220
Thanks to Phineas Narco for that.

910
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,400
The background music.

911
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,040
The background music right now was by me, Reverend Ivan Stang.

912
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:06,900
The Bach that we heard earlier, jazzy Bach, was by Kenneth New at www.kenneth.nu.

913
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,460
And Norrell Preff of norrellpreff.com did the cut-up.

914
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:16,360
And now for such cut-ups, we use metal grinding tools.

915
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,300
The communication.

916
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,740
Of metallic communion.

917
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,980
The ecstasy of mechanism.

918
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:36,180
Holding or mounting your work rigidly for checking, milling, drilling, shaping, grinding.

919
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,060
Boring.

920
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,920
Welding and pattern making.

921
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,560
Yes, a quick, accurate adjustment to any desired angle.

922
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,520
Set with protractor.

923
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,560
Easy to use.

924
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,060
Three standard sizes.

925
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,480
Experiments were also made.

926
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,660
With this blade set up as a trepanning tool and a drill press.

927
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,660
It was found that only small discs could be cut out efficiently

928
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:03,400
because the equipment became too heavy for enough stiffness to cut out the larger discs.

929
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:10,060
Also, it was too messy a job because the white facing of the cardboard became soiled from oil and dirt.

930
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,480
Cutting out by hand as described was the best way.

931
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,940
And of course, there was always the grinding of the small rods.

932
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:22,240
The large ones ultimately give out, while the small ones continue.

933
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,180
And give the most satisfaction.

934
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:30,340
Or so I've always been told by kind people.

935
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,840
You hurt my feelings.

936
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,080
I'm sorry.

937
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,760
But you had to do it anyway, didn't you?

938
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,020
She's a very powerful person and I have lived with a lot of women.

939
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:40,760
Obviously.

940
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:45,420
And she used me to teach us about the inevitability of human drama.

941
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,240
So?

942
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,020
Is that where you get off the ride?

943
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:50,660
Hell no.

944
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,880
I didn't think so.

945
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,720
Looks like you saw some truth.

946
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,360
Looks like you saw some truth.

947
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,620
What'd you see?

948
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,180
Well, the interconnection thing is definitely for real.

949
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,320
It is! I didn't think it was! It is!

950
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,720
I can't believe it! It's so fantastic!

951
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:07,620
It's amazing.

952
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,020
I know.

953
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,820
But it's also nothing special.

954
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,620
Yeah, because it grows from the manure of human trouble.

955
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,380
You see, the detectives, they just wanted to gloss right over that.

956
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,820
But in fact, no manure, no magic.

957
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,100
Did you hear some of that?

958
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,480
Some of it sounds pretty good.

959
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:22,480


960
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,880
I think...

961
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,320
I think this case is closed.

962
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,780
Is it ever really closed?

963
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:30,740
Hmm...

964
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:15,700
Frankly, I'm excited.

965
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:15,720
I think all these sindentalks still don't know the truth.

966
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,180
Well, this case is a complete more creative leap, which is why the slice claims havesun

967
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:16,600
Okay, grab your Captain.

968
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,040
It's concepts.

969
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,040


970
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:20,940
Bobo.

971
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:21,580
He's looking at the movie.

972
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:21,600


973
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,460
Good work.

974
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,520
Love is love, Bob is love, Dickie, sticky love, Love is Bob.

975
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:49,360
Bob is love, Bob is love, Bob is love, Love is love,

976
00:45:51,340 --> 00:46:01,060
Bob is love, Bob is love, Bob is love, Bobby scores.

977
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:10,500
Bob is love, is love, Bob is love.

978
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,160
Bob is love, the kinda love that makes Bob Grinn.

979
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,160
Bob is love.

980
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:19,340
Bob is love.

981
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,060
Ooh-ooh

982
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,360
Ooh-ooh

983
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,360
Ooh-ooh

984
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:27,780
Ooh-ooh

985
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,420
Ooh-ooh

986
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,360
Ooh-ooh

987
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,580
Ooh-ooh

988
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,120
Ooh-ooh

989
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,620
Ooh-ooh

990
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,300
Ooh-ooh

991
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,860
Ooh-ooh

992
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,360
Uh, I thought it was about hate.

993
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,300
Ahhhhh!

994
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,360
Ahhhhh!

995
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,240
Isn't that what you really need?

996
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,080
Or hate?

997
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,720
Or hate?

998
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,520
Hate the conspiracy!

999
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,680
Hate your job!

1000
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,940
Hate the normals that stole your slap!

1001
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,140
Hate the normals that stole your slap!

1002
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,080
Make Bob your Bobby!

1003
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,400
Make Bob your Bobby!

1004
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,100
Make Bob your Bobby!

1005
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,640
Bob doesn't love you!

1006
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,520
Bob hates you!

1007
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:13,660
Bob hates you!

1008
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,440
Or Bob is hate!

1009
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:16,720


1010
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,820
Without hate there can be no love!

1011
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:21,820


1012
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,580
Bob Minitani!

1013
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:24,760
Bob Minitani!

1014
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,800
Fiends Bob!

1015
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,360
Fiends Bob!

1016
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,140
Hear what I say!

1017
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:31,840
Hear what I say!

1018
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,660
Without hate there can be no love!

1019
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:04,660


1020
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,360
without hate...

1021
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,220
without hate...

1022
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:08,480
without hate...

1023
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:08,580
without hate...

1024
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:08,580


1025
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:08,580


1026
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:08,580


1027
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,900
without hate, without hate

1028
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:09,900


1029
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:09,900


1030
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,960
without hate!

1031
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,640
without hate!

1032
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,800
One! Two! Three! Four!

1033
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,980
Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!

1034
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:31,160
Thirteen! Four! Four!

1035
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:37,900
Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine!

1036
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:37,900


1037
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:37,900


1038
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,540
NAMUWAMI!

1039
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:41,300
GET OUT!

1040
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,220
What is this crap?

1041
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,020
True facts are pigments of your imagination.

1042
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,920
Ladies and gentlemen, what do you think about the future?

1043
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,460
The things that are happening in America today are like a Sunday school picnic.

1044
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:06,840
Are you tired of running against the powerful evil forces and about ready to give up?

1045
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,080
Many people in America today are walking down the journeys of this life,

1046
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,180
unmindful of the present turbulence.

1047
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,620
Terrible, ruthless killers.

1048
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,220
Unless we have some rapid changes in our country,

1049
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,300
our easygoing life of 40 hours a week workload,

1050
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,360
two or three weeks of paid vacation a year will soon be over.

1051
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,940
They had to be annihilated.

1052
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,840
I'll be here, baby.

1053
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,700
Baby, I'm a lover, not a Christian.

1054
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,320
Proud murderers, rapists, traitors.

1055
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,220
This thought thrills my very soul.

1056
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,380
12 inches. Get out. Teach sex.

1057
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,060
I personally believe that premarital sex,

1058
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:42,900
is necessary.

1059
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,420
And now, we will go on to discuss

1060
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,660
seven erotic zones of passion in every woman.

1061
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,100
The first one is the TV world.

1062
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,800
Intersex, it's nothing more than a spawning house for sex.

1063
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,340
Raw sex and violence.

1064
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,200
The front door to adultery.

1065
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:02,680
Ladies and gentlemen, addicted to government reports, legalizing marijuana.

1066
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,900
The president of the United States has been killed.

1067
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,220
Ladies and gentlemen, the governor of California has been killed.

1068
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,160
Christians, they'll kill you.

1069
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:15,440
In fact, it's their policy to kill people frequently to keep the population terrorized.

1070
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,100
Take your children away from you.

1071
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,800
Take your children away from you.

1072
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,280
Don't be bashful.

1073
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,920
Have some candy.

1074
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,500
Cruel slavery.

1075
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,680
Everybody, over here.

1076
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,860
All right, keep moving. Move, I say.

1077
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,860
All right, right there now. Right there.

1078
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:30,400
Whee!

1079
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:31,540
Whee!

1080
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:32,260
Whee!

1081
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,380
Strip a woman naked.

1082
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,620
What do you mean, it concerns me?

1083
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,180
You must be joking.

1084
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,480
You do not have a soul, but only a body.

1085
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,920
And when you're dead, you're dead.

1086
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:46,000
I dream of the hour when the last congressman is strangled to death on the guts of the last preacher.

1087
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:47,700
Does this turn your stomach?

1088
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,760
You'll be able to do nothing about it.

1089
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:50,880
We will kill you.

1090
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,560
And they will kill you, too.

1091
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,120
This goes on night after night after night.

1092
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,420
Things seem unreal.

1093
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,120
These things seem unreal.

1094
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,700
Communism is good.

1095
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,540
Christianity is stupid.

1096
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,960
Christianity is stupid.

1097
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,240
Give up. Yes.

1098
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:16,680
Yes.

1099
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,420
Ladies and gentlemen, we will be slaughtered like cattle, shot down like flies.

1100
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:22,560
Why don't you give it up?

1101
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,300
Why don't you give it up?

1102
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,080
We mustn't come just when we feel like it.

1103
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:25,840
Profit and pleasure.

1104
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,280
What about the almighty dollar?

1105
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,860
Many people love their money.

1106
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,700
Where's my mama and my daddy?

1107
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:31,200
Shh!

1108
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,440
Will you come?

1109
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,260
Will you come?

1110
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:35,840
Will you come?

1111
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,420
Will you come?

1112
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:11,140
Will you come?

1113
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,620
Hey, I tell you, I'm talking about pianos, right?

1114
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:17,540
My very sexy lady friend, Margaret, phoned me the other night.

1115
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:21,580
You know, Margaret, short, dark hair, lives in Halifax, not short of a bob or two.

1116
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,880
Well, she was having a bit of trouble getting an old grand piano, which she

1117
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,260
bought into her house and asked me if I'd nip over there to York Cessna Shire,

1118
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:34,980
you know, in my soft top rascal, to give her a hand with all the removing and all that, you know.

1119
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,760
Well, as soon as I got to her big terraced house, I could see what the problem was.

1120
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,860
The piano was far too wide.

1121
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,340
To get through her front gate.

1122
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,320
So after a cup of tea, I asked her if she thought about, you know, taking it up the back passage.

1123
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,080
Well, she said she had considered it, but didn't think it would fit there either.

1124
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:57,640
Well, before she knew it, I had it out by the back door and I told sexy Margaret to

1125
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:02,700
stand in front of me and to help me guide the old instrument in as I gently pushed it forward.

1126
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,200
Tell you what, one quick shove and it was home.

1127
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:09,400
Well, after that, she then said she fancied it in the back room.

1128
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,140
I mean, she knew what position it was.

1129
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,260
She wanted it in up against the wall with the old legs firmly on the carpet.

1130
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,120
You know, I was so knackered.

1131
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,740
I told her I wouldn't be able to manage it unless I rested for a bit.

1132
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:25,500
Well, after getting my head down for a good ten minutes, I was up like a rocket

1133
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,120
and quickly stuck it exactly where she wanted it.

1134
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:32,020
You know, now she then went to get two candelabras to put on top.

1135
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,700
And when she returned, I could not believe my eyes.

1136
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:35,980
I'm not kidding.

1137
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,020
I never knew she had such a big pair.

1138
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,240
Massive they were.

1139
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,700
And when I held them.

1140
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,660
You know, to give them the old once over,

1141
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,940
I could see that one was slightly bigger than the other.

1142
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:49,360
Well, as it turned out, her boyfriend had given her one on her birthday.

1143
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,620
And so would you believe, had her ex-boyfriend Charlie.

1144
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,660
And she said Charlie's was about half an inch bigger.

1145
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,400
But when you put them side by side and look to them, you know, at arms length,

1146
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,040
you can hardly tell the difference. Well, at the end of the day,

1147
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,860
she was so thankful about the help that I'd given her and said she wouldn't have

1148
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,480
known what to do if I hadn't come that day.

1149
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,300
But you see,

1150
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,520
she's happy to lend a hand.

1151
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:14,100
Now, sexy Simone was moving the other day

1152
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,820
and she got me around there to help us shift, you know, a few items.

1153
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,820
First, the large clock in the hall.

1154
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,460
Mmm, baby.

1155
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:27,680
Well, I felt nervous about handling a grandfather with such a big dong.

1156
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:33,020
Still, I got a firm grip and indeed felt privileged to handle such a fine piece.

1157
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:38,900
Well, with a bit of assistance from sexy Simone, I soon had it out and in broad daylight,

1158
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,180
took it up the back.

1159
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,680
And I was able to get it out of my van and slowly slid it in.

1160
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,960
Now, I then asked sexy Simone if she was going to take her burglar alarm.

1161
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:52,300
She said she wasn't going to as she'd never used it and indeed had never had it on.

1162
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:56,240
She said she always had it off when she was at home during the day.

1163
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:00,200
And not only that, any night she went out, she had it off then too.

1164
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,420
Well, I was surprised that she didn't want to keep it.

1165
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,620
It was a very large and expensive model,

1166
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,660
which she had positioned just below her window upstairs.

1167
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,260
Hey, it looked lovely, it did.

1168
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,860
Then is the time I'd walk past her house,

1169
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,680
look up to her bedroom window and admire her big box on full display.

1170
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,720
Funny what some people leave behind and say it really is, you know.

1171
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,440
But I mean, you know, if you've got any children, perhaps, you know,

1172
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,260
teach them to play the piano because, you know, they'll enjoy it in later life.

1173
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:33,580
And that's why I'm fingering the keyboards at every available opportunity.

1174
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,100
Yeah, Fat Harry here at the keyboards.

1175
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,100
A little...

1176
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,360
Smoochy piano sounds for you, baby.

1177
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,140
She comes and she goes,

1178
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,140
walking stridely on her toes, catching Bob Bob's eyes.

1179
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,580
No surprise,

1180
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,800
for Connie Bob's attention is her prize.

1181
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:04,600
And Connie comes and she goes and she strikes a sexy pose and Bob is entranced.

1182
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,800
She will dance.

1183
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,420
And she goes and she goes and she strikes a sexy pose and Bob walks away with swelling in his pants.

1184
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,680
Connie,

1185
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:17,780
yoni,

1186
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,940
Bob doves can't get enough.

1187
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,960
Puppies, horny.

1188
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,600
Then Connie shows her stuff.

1189
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:36,240
So Connie comes and she goes and the C1 girls that's

1190
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,780
running down her way.

1191
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:40,800
And she goes and she takes a peg.

1192
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,600
Breaks the peg.

1193
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,900
And that's when Connie takes him down the peg.

1194
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:53,220
Here Connie comes, there she goes, leaving Bob in the clothes of like he asked.

1195
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,100
A glee.

1196
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,240
Till he pees.

1197
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:02,640
For Connie is a sexual panchee.

1198
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,720
Connie, yoni,

1199
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,960
he hardly has to try.

1200
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,760
Puppies, horny.

1201
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,620
And that makes Connie sigh.

1202
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,760
Now Connie came and she's gone, but Bob's hardly alone.

1203
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,680
As long as he has luck,

1204
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,760
he'll be back.

1205
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:36,700
Bob doves will always get another crack.

1206
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,740
And that's how Bob and Connie gets slack.

1207
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:48,200
Music to watch Connie by, by Popes Lilith von Frau Mensch, dear friends.

1208
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:52,640
And before that, Fat Harry White fingering the keyboard of love.

1209
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,140
He's got a Myspace thing under the name Fat Harry White.

1210
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:03,200
Prior to that, a Nor-El-Pref tribute to Negative Land.

1211
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:06,200
And the song before that, Bob is love.

1212
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,080
Bob is hate.

1213
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,720
It was by King of Slack, Bill T.

1214
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:14,060
Miller. More at BillTMiller.com or KingofSlack.com.

1215
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,400
Just some great stuff there.

1216
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:19,460
And a little bit of soundtrack from that movie, I Heart Huckabees.

1217
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,500
This is the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

1218
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,780

1220
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,480

1221
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:44,280
And Neuro Manson will see us out.

1222
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,080
Praise Bob.

1223
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:52,080
Ladies, here's a sensational beauty tip direct from Hollywood.

1224
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:57,140
When you want your hair to look its radiant best for an important date, do this the night before.

1225
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:00,060
Give your hair a glamour bath with waste fat.

1226
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,740
I certainly agree with that.

1227
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,560
It leaves the hair simply gleaming with natural glossy fats and oils.

1228
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,580
And what's more, your hair stays that way for days.

1229
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,340
Oh, still.

1230
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,440
The gun is penis.

1231
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,140
The penis is good.

1232
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,560
The gun shoots seeds.

1233
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,080
The deeds.

1234
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,960
The penis, penis shoots good deeds.

1235
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:36,600
The penis shoots good deeds.

1236
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,140
The penis shoots good deeds.
