1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Say, Pop, I had an idea.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,920
You promised me no one would get hurt.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,460
I've got a very wacky idea.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,520
Hello?

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,020
Man could lay quite a smokescreen with two pounds of tobacco, couldn't he?

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,920
Oh, my. Let me think now.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,640
Yes.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:21,620
Thanks.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,400
Come on, let's go.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,540
The Self-Genius.

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,380
Power of Swag.

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,160
You've got a macabre sense of humor.

13
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:32,660
How do I?

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,920
Ecumenical Fileshow.

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,580
And so as night continues on towards the promise of the day...

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,520
And the sunset diminished in the sky.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,080
Did you hear how the show just peeled away?

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,680
The old show just kind of like a little skin going off into...

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,060
A little dead skin.

20
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,040
The show, like a snake, renews its widgetry itself once.

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,780
The great show, File Cabinet, where the little heavens smile.

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,420
Look how pretty!

23
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,900
Now, I understand there's an analog version of that File Cabinet somewhere, right?

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,280
Really?

25
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:05,840
Yeah.

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,460
It's got to be the size of the whole universe.

27
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,700
A huge, massive wall.

28
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,300
Whoa!

29
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,160
And there it is!

30
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,840
All file-oriented and insane on the air.

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,000
Too easily impressed.

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,900
Unconvincing special effects.

33
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,480
Oh, yeah, you're right.

34
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,260
Time bomb.

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,280
Really misaligned there.

36
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,320
Look at that line.

37
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,540
Waiting for their collective dismissal.

38
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,880
Note the lack of registration of the foreground and middle ground plate.

39
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,700
By use of the...

40
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,000
Otherwise...

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,280
Otherwise...

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,400
Otherwise...

43
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,400


44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,580
Electromagnetic...

45
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:30,640
Electromagnetic...

46
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,480
Shock by...

47
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:32,200
Pulse...

48
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,460
Aspects Master...

49
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,800
Or something like it.

50
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,260
Pete Fredrickson.

51
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,540
Now...

52
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,080
Anyway, the butt...

53
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,280
He talks about his stop-motion trials in...

54
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,800
The love them or hate them.

55
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,360
...Gumby vs. Sertanese in 1962.

56
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,220
And some try to ignore their existence entirely.

57
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,380
Which, for some, defined an end.

58
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,880
Yes, it's time for the show again.

59
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,340
It was great to be young and alive in those days.

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,160
And now, old and dead...

61
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,960
Back when the show started.

62
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,840
...and appreciated all the more.

63
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,340
Anyway, friends, ladies and gentlemen, step right up.

64
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,340
Welcome to the subgenius medical curiosity show.

65
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,580
It's all real.

66
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,460
It's all here.

67
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,460
It's alive and all on the inside.

68
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,920
See the smart boy who can't keep a job.

69
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,480
See the pretty girl who can't get a date.

70
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,560
Alive and on the inside.

71
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,700
We have diseases that are spread through sexual congress.

72
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,940
We have debates.

73
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,860
Settled by fisticuffs.

74
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,680
We have people famous only for being famous.

75
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,760
And they're all inside.

76
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,980
Alive.

77
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,020
Alive, alive.

78
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,440
See grown men and women talk to an invisible monster that lives in the sky.

79
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,460
See your own body become more fragile before your very eyes.

80
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,040
Feel the horror as schools turn innocent children into innocent.

81
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,320
Adults.

82
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,520
They're all on the inside, friends.

83
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,860
We have a picture of a salesman who smokes a pipe.

84
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,700
What other religions charge all worldly goods for, we offer at a discounted low rate.

85
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,480
Get slack and feel alive on the inside.

86
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,140
Behold.

87
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,860
Aaaaaah.

88
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,320
Go back to your compartment.

89
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,400


90
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,000
And resume the schedule.

91
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,600
The ship is off.

92
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,160
Wait!

93
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,340
No!

94
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,700
I have something to say.

95
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,300
Listen!

96
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,020
Listen to what I have to say.

97
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,840
This is what I have to say.

98
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,020
The subgenius.

99
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,760
Power of...

100
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:45,560
What?

101
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,700
What are you gonna do?

102
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,180
I'm gonna smash the earth.

103
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,440
The cool green earth.

104
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,160
Fools can't you understand?

105
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,480
Do you think you're strange?

106
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,440
Are you abnormal?

107
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,040
Are you, as they say, different?

108
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,920
Do you urinate?

109
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,640
Then you are sure to be interested in this, my friend.

110
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,040
Are you ready to slide down the cutting edge?

111
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,440
In that case, I want you to make noise and praise Bob!

112
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,480
Praise Bob!

113
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,460
Praise Bob!

114
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,200
Praise Bob!

115
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,200
Praise God damn Bob!

116
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,280
The church of the subgenius.

117
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,420
Where today's wisecracks are tomorrow's divine revelations.

118
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,920
Dr. Holocaust said that just yesterday on alt.slack.

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,120
And I told you this was gonna be a new subgenius 101.

120
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,740
The world's first industrial church, they call it.

121
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,240
Tipping sacred cows since 1953.

122
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,440
Instant instructions for those who follow no master.

123
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:12,040
The perfect self-validating philosophy by which everything you know is in fact true.

124
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,220
The Zorro of world religions, the divinity school of hard knocks.

125
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,220
We are peripheral visionaries.

126
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,240
Saving souls from themselves.

127
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,580
Eternal salvation, dear friends.

128
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,780
Or triple your money back.

129
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,500
That's right.

130
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,580
If we don't live forever, we get our money back.

131
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,700
We want your money back.

132
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,960
Praise Bob, it is so true.

133
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:51,360
This hour of slack number 1181 features a lot of puzzling evidence from the titular show in KPFA.

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,620
Berkeley.

135
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,340
With Dr. Philodrum, Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence.

136
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,360
With some chopped up lemur and girl talk.

137
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,400
Although what you just heard was from the Baltimore subgenius revival of 2008.

138
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:18,140
And the carnival barker spiel was by Reverend Onan Canobot but delivered by yours truly at Starwood Festival of 2008.

139
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,340
But the real hour of slack is here.

140
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,580
It's in session right now at X-Day with Dr. Howell live.

141
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,280
Now we are in session to begin the hour of slack over the trackless waste.

142
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:45,700
An hour of slack being broadcast from Tarzan's radio station here at Brushwood Folklore Center.

143
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,140
With a live audience of almost a dozen.

144
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,320
Yay!

145
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,380
Of surviving subgeniuses.

146
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,140
The surviving subgeniuses and you are the strong and the brave my friends.

147
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,740
Because I saw some of you still tottering around at 3 o'clock last night.

148
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,920
Like I was.

149
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,320
I was policing the area actually.

150
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:13,900
Princess Wee and I were going around to make sure that there weren't any injured subgeniuses lying in the grass in front of cars.

151
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,520
Or fighting.

152
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,240
Bickering.

153
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,240
Cheating.

154
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,640
Biting.

155
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:20,980
Fighting.

156
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,560
Slashing.

157
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,840
I might be fighting but if they cheat that's not right.

158
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,260
You need to have some...

159
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:33,660
In previous X-Days there have been sad cases of feuds exaggerated until it actually came to aggressive behavior.

160
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:35,800
And why not?

161
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,520
The primordial yeti must exercise itself.

162
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:50,640
Well there's always the new kids that feel like the way to prove they have slack is to work really, really hard at advertising.

163
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,060
How truly slackful they are.

164
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:00,000
Which usually means yelling and screaming and getting in everybody's face and going how dare you tell me to turn that music down you fascist.

165
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,580
You don't know anything about slack.

166
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,180
You're a pink.

167
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,800
No.

168
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,660
The pinks are the ones who are the assholes.

169
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,940
That's how we define the conspiracy.

170
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,600
Everybody you hate.

171
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,720
It's that simple.

172
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,260
It's going to be different for each one of you.

173
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,780
To some of you I'm the conspiracy.

174
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,740
To me somebody here is the...

175
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,000
Actually I don't see anybody that I consider the conspiracy right in front of me.

176
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,080
No not at all.

177
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,880
Although we all have that little conspiracy gland.

178
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,840
Sure enough.

179
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,100
If it's overactive you can tell when you're in the bathroom.

180
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,780
No one is 100% pure.

181
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,900
It leaves a little funny color.

182
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,160
Funny smelling jenkins.

183
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,760
Speaking of which we've run into censorship here at Brushwood I noticed.

184
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,800
Yes.

185
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,800
On Wednesday.

186
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,220
Authorities.

187
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:55,960
When I got here I had 30 sheets of paper that said for the chemical toilets that said

188
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,780
Jenkin huffing chamber and fermentation station please do not flush.

189
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,300
A little picture of Bob.

190
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,320
And Susie went and taped them up dutifully inside all of the excrementation chambers.

191
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,160
And the next day they were all gone.

192
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,080
Now what is the threat?

193
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,780
You can't flush the chemical toilets.

194
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,940
So it's not like.

195
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,540
We were inducing somebody to wreck their toilets.

196
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,840
Yes you can't flush the chemical toilets.

197
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,600
What that meant to me was that at Starwood I have to bring 150 copies of those.

198
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,340
Yes Pantiera.

199
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,400
I was about to say that.

200
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,680
Yeah people were actually not flushing the floor floors.

201
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,920
Those would be the pagans.

202
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,520
Who will truly believe anything.

203
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,800
I'm surprised we haven't gotten 30 bucks out of more of them.

204
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,620
They don't want to be judgmental about anybody else's belief system so you just leave the toilet on flush.

205
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,840
What did you say not be judgmental?

206
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Well that's their idea that they if they flush the toilet they'd be violating I don't know whatever it is.

207
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:03,920
Right.

208
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,080
Oh well.

209
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,420
Yeah but they took them down out of the chemical toilets.

210
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,780
That doesn't make any sense.

211
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,900
You can't flush those.

212
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,520
I walked into one of those and looked down.

213
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,740
And thought boy that's bastard.

214
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,660
Whoever was in here before was sick.

215
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,660
And then when I left I looked down.

216
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,040
There's caviar in the last one.

217
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:24,940
Caviar.

218
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,280
That was the goat.

219
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,040
Those are goat pellets.

220
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,640
Caviar for the general.

221
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,720
So you looked down and up came your memories of Burning Man no doubt.

222
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:35,960
It did that.

223
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,480
Oh.

224
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:37,860
.

225
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,200
Sorry.

226
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,200


227
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,220
Oh.

228
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:49,460


229
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:49,460


230
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:49,920
.

231
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,780
.

232
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:51,780


233
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:51,780


234
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:51,780


235
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:51,780


236
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,160
.

237
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,080
.

238
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,100
.

239
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,120
.

240
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,140
.

241
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,100
.

242
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,440
.

243
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:10,460
.

244
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,480
.

245
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:11,580
.

246
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,760
.

247
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:17,800
.

I'm king of the town

You can take a look around

317
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,140
Baby, bend around

318
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,380

You wrote this on it, yeah.

324
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,960
Let's hit McDonald's, yeah.

325
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,380
It's E.P. and C.B.

326
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,660
I'm the nappy boy.

327
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

328
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,120
Where can I find a woman like that?

329
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,720
Like Jessie's girl.

330
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,380
Would I rather kiss a man?

331
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,060
I'm like Jessie's girl.

332
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,940
Would I rather kiss a man?

333
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,460
I'm like Jessie's girl.

334
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,220
Would I rather kiss a man?

335
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,560
Where can I find a woman like that?

336
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,660
Girl Talk did that, dear friends.

337
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,340
And you can wiki Girl Talk for details.

338
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,500
In other words, just from wondering whether the wedding is on the rocks,

339
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,740
a person could develop a cough.

340
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,640
This one works.

341
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,700
These 12 will work even better.

342
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,260
Is that one working?

343
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,940
There's 12 versions of that song that you'll love.

344
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,640
1,200 versions, please.

345
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,840
1,200 volts to a very shocking experience.

346
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,360
Soul Coffee.

347
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,180
That's a nice thing, wasn't it?

348
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,680
Is this on TV?

349
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,700
It's not the cough that carries you off.

350
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,100
It's the coffin that carries you off.

351
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,240
I have seen that on TV, but I have not seen it.

352
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,960
I have not seen it.

353
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,680
If you go into the woods today, you're in for a big surprise.

354
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,700
If you go into the woods today, you won't believe your eyes.

355
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,200
For every bear that ever was is going to be there in the forest

356
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,020
because...

357
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,080
Today's the day.

358
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,240
Today, the teddy bears have their...

359
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,420
picnic.

360
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,320
Picnic time for teddy bears.

361
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,820
See them run and laugh.

362
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,560
See them frolic about and play.

363
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,680
See them dance without a care.

364
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,960
Stabbing each other.

365
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,920
Jumping everywhere on their happy holiday.

366
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:01,720
Hiding.

367
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,040
Watch them leap and jump about,

368
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,060
and twitch and scream.

369
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,500
And shout without any cares.

370
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,200
At six o'clock, their mummies and daddies will take them home to bed

371
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,000
because they're tired little teddy bears.

372
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,580
It's the terror.

373
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,360
It's the death of the teddy bear picnic.

374
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,180
It's over.

375
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,040
The fire burned it up.

376
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,220
All of those teddy bears...

377
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,400
Non-trist protected.

378
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,140
Dangerous burning substances made in China.

379
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,400
And a...

380
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,120
Designed to kill young American children.

381
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,440
So the park rangers were alerted.

382
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,220
Helicopters were deployed.

383
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,840
When these teddy bear bears burn.

384
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,940
Somehow when they got there, there wasn't anybody to take in for questions.

385
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,040
That's when the crying starts and the fun goes away.

386
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,800
So they waterboarded the teddy bears.

387
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:55,980
And...

388
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,180
Yes, the teddy bears will confess.

389
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,640
That was the end of the picnic.

390
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,780
You must confess.

391
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,860
You must confess under duress.

392
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,240
And the teddy bears did not confess.

393
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,900
Even under the waterboarding techniques supplied by the horrible, horrible American military.

394
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,940
God damn the Pentagon.

395
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,500
Look what they did.

396
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,060
Look what they did.

397
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,900
They killed the teddy bears.

398
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,560
The Pentagon, Washington, D.C.

399
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,140
Struck by a strange assailant.

400
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,720
Some say a missile.

401
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,760
Others the accepted story of crashing jet aircraft.

402
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,060
But...

403
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:40,780
The appearance on the field of so many mutilated teddy bears has never been satisfactorily expected.

404
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,300
Have you seen a pile of teddy bears burn?

405
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,780
It looks like an explosion, man.

406
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,060
With an eerie green light.

407
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,080
It looks like magnesium.

408
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,040
They're radioactive.

409
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,260
On steroids.

410
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,100
Made of...

411
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,180
We process uranium, actually.

412
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,500
Just like the shells used by American military in Iraq.

413
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,280
Deep-leaded uranium.

414
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,500
You probably don't love me in Europe.

415
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,220
But I can't believe why my country has to be like this.

416
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,560
Wah! Wah!

417
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,880
The bombs to the rescue.

418
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,420
The largest replant.

419
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,100
Let's go home.

420
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,260
He'll rescue today.

421
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,820
And make the plane your way.

422
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,580
The silence.

423
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,420
Come on, bomb.

424
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,540
Come on, bomb.

425
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,020
To the rescue.

426
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,340
Save our asses now.

427
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,020
I couldn't see.

428
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,140
The land of the free.

429
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,240
I couldn't stand it.

430
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,520
The smell.

431
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,580
Of the free.

432
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,040
The terrible rotten smell of burning flesh.

433
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,760
Somebody open a window.

434
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:09,840
That terrible rotten smell of burning flesh is searing my nostrils already.

435
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,380
The smell of burning flesh.

436
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,360
Burning flesh.

437
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,820
It's overcooked.

438
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,340
It's defished.

439
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,360
Get back there.

440
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,880
Now I'm gonna just peel out the pork chops in just a minute.

441
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,860
But first we have to commune with our god.

442
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,840
And I'll thank you.

443
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,680
What is that terrible rotten smell?

444
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,460
Keep your meat hooks out of the platter until we've finished our devotions.

445
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,040
Burning flesh.

446
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,340
Our lord is J. Mash.

447
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,540
The eternal unsatisfied.

448
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,120
The fire in his loins burns eternally.

449
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,680
And the smoke of that burning goes up forever.

450
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,640
Day and night.

451
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,940
Into his fiery bowels.

452
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,700
The infant sacrifice.

453
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,740
The sacrifice is hurled.

454
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:01,820
That's good.

455
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,120
J. Mash, grant us victory in battle.

456
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,660
So you played my album on the 5 hour show, huh?

457
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,960
Ruthlessness in extending our lord and king's wish.

458
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,100
Would you like that one song that sounded like a machine?

459
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,660
Stupid pufferfish.

460
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,120
Retard psychologist jerky turtle.

461
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,460
Stupid pufferfish.

462
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,100
Stupid pufferfish.

463
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,220
We will never die.

464
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,680
We will never die.

465
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,740
We will never die.

466
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,440
We will never die.

467
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,060
We will never die.

468
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,980
We will never die.

469
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,700
Oh oh, they are showing us where we are supposed to be.

470
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:42,700


471
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:42,700


472
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:42,700


473
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:42,700


474
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,540
We are bound here.

475
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,200
Yeah!

476
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,580
Yeah!

477
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,580
Yeah!

478
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,900
I'm a flirt, as soon as I see her walk up in the club

479
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,660
I'm a flirt, winging eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs

480
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,280
I'm a flirt, sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low

481
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,120
I'm a flirt, when she's with a man looking at me damn right

482
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,680
I'm a flirt, so homie don't bring your girl to meet me

483
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,620
Cause I'm a flirt, baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat

484
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,060
Cause I'm a flirt, we believe it unless she gets tight

485
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,800
And you trust her, then don't bring no homie

486
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,060
Cause I'm a flirt

487
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,340
Power working

488
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,540
And you got me wide open and I know you seen that I'm joking

489
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,820
Cause the boys in the past they just couldn't last

490
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,240
That's the reason I think you can choke

491
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,460
City heaven said, don't wanna walk away

492
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,040
Just hold me tightly up in your arms and tell me everyday

493
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,100
That you ain't never gonna leave me hard broke

494
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,260
Promise to give a good time, promise to give a good time

495
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,840
Long stroke, boy this for real and this ain't no joke

496
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,760
Thought I was dreaming but I know I'm broke

497
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,660
But you just need to get me so wrong

498
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,520
Feels so right that this can't be wrong

499
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,400
Hanging up on right back, call me your phone

500
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,340
Cause I go so crazy when I hear your voice tone

501
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,620
Hustling, hustling, hustling, hustling

502
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,800
Hurry away from my noise

503
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,120
Every day I'm hustling

504
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,680
Hustlin, hustling, hustling, hustling, hustling

505
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,460
Hustling, hustling, hustling,

506
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,640
Every day I'm hustling

507
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,240
Na na na na na na na ua

508
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,020
Na na na na na na na ua

509
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:41,240
I'm going to show you how to do it.

510
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,200
How many, how many boys are ready?

511
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,500
How many saw a war?

512
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,300
Girl talk did it, but now let's go back to 1996

513
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,040
when the great subgenius preacher Papa Joe Mama

514
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,780
delivered the rant known as the last chance.

515
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,860
Uh, Reverend, fight,

516
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,580
C. Todd's recently drew our attention to the fact

517
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,020
that this 1996 post-election rant

518
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,060
has never been more timely than it is now.

519
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,040
So, uh, please pardon the odd recording quality

520
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,060
as this priceless rant was preserved

521
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,540
off of an AM radio broadcast on cassette tape

522
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,100
over 20 years ago.

523
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,820
And yet it is as fresh today as it was in 1996.

524
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,840
And now Papa Joe Mama.

525
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,660
The sermon tonight is entitled

526
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,680
The Last Chance.

527
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,860
Yes, friends, 1998 is fast approaching

528
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,120
and a lot of people out there have come to expect

529
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,980
the church to start singing a different tune

530
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,160
about the judgment day.

531
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,460
They say, hey, did you hear the news?

532
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,240
The Berlin Wall has fallen.

533
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,280
Things are getting better.

534
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,340
We say, is that so?

535
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,760
They say, hey, did you read the paper?

536
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,780
The Russians are now our friends.

537
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,180
Things are getting better.

538
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,460
We say, is that so?

539
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,140
They say, hey, did you see it on CNN?

540
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,940
We won the war.

541
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,240
Things are getting better.

542
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,680
Is that so?

543
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,760
And now they come a-running and a-cheerin',

544
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,740
sayin', roll out the barrel.

545
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,380
We now have a new president.

546
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,060
The Republicans are out.

547
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,600
The recession is over.

548
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,120
It's the year of the woman.

549
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,340
Everybody get naked.

550
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:24,620
Ooh!

551
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,240
You poor, pitiful little pinks.

552
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,080
Do you really think an eternity of sin

553
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,820
can be erased so easily?

554
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,420
Are we now supposed to embrace the conspiracy

555
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,680
and call off the exodus invasion?

556
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,440
Do you actually,

557
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,320
believe you can defuse an entire revolution

558
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,580
with a few scraps of conspiracy compromise?

559
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,920
Never.

560
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,360
These petty little sidelines

561
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,640
that have a nice day news

562
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,900
don't divert our attention from the real issue,

563
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,100
not for a second.

564
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,640
Dateline, Washington.

565
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,500
New conspiracy president sworn into office.

566
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,980
Promises new conspiracy healthcare plan

567
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,320
to keep worker drones healthy

568
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,140
and make more capable of serving the state.

569
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,280
More to follow.

570
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,620
Dateline, New York.

571
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,100
U.N. meets for conspiracy.

572
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,540
Conspiracy roll call vote of conspiracy agenda

573
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,100
for global conspiracy world domination.

574
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,920
Renegade nations refusing to conform to new world order

575
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,180
will be penalized.

576
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,140
More to follow.

577
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,800
Dateline, planet Earth.

578
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,240
Conspiracy in last ditch effort to avert bloody overthrow.

579
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,160
Attempts to utilize all arms of conspiracy propaganda machine

580
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,140
to convince subgenius rebel rousers

581
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,360
world is now A-OK.

582
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,060
Member for conspiracy high command states,

583
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:39,480
quote,

584
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,080
quote,

585
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,340
conspiracy no longer hostile.

586
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,920
Conspiracy now friend of little guy, end quote.

587
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,960
Well, well, well, the world is getting better.

588
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,800
We should just call off the invasion before it's too late.

589
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,660
Wrong.

590
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,900
You can fool some of the subgenies some of the time,

591
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,240
but you can't fool any of the overmen any other time.

592
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,760
They're much too in tune to the wily ways of the wicked one.

593
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,880
I'm talking about you, Mr. Pete boy.

594
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,720
Yes, you.

595
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,800
The one with the firm handshake and the easy smile.

596
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,080
You're not tricking anyone with your...

597
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,500
bold new vision or JFK idealism.

598
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,020
We in the church go by one credo.

599
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,200
Ask not what the conspiracy can do to you,

600
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,780
but what you can do to the conspiracy.

601
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,040
And come July 5th, 1998,

602
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,660
we're going to put that motto into simultaneous global orchestration.

603
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:33,280
We're overthrowing the conspiracy and we're executing the ringleaders,

604
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,980
along with anyone else who tries to stop us.

605
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,520
Now, to some, this may seem a little extreme.

606
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,100
That's perfectly normal to the average man in the street.

607
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,300
Witnessing a public execution of a criminal may also appear extreme.

608
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,600
After all, chances are that the man is unfamiliar with the crimes of the criminal.

609
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,160
He was too busy making a living to notice what misdeeds the condemned

610
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,080
perpetrated on society before being brought to justice.

611
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,820
Add to that the criminal's emotional last words, his pleas for mercy,

612
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,620
his insistence of his own innocence, and his reciting of all the good deeds he ever

613
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,260
accomplished. Then imagine the prisoner's family stepping forth,

614
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,560
begging for his life, and witnesses filing forward to testify

615
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,040
to the innocence of this great man so wrongly accused.

616
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:26,660
It should be no surprise that even an intelligent but uninformed person would

617
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,760
find themselves feeling sorry for the poor soul and wishing him a pardon.

618
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,900
If respected newspapers were produced and showed article after article supporting

619
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,180
the accused, even the most skeptical in the crowd would likely

620
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,940
become sympathetic. Why?

621
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,060
Because they would see in that individual before them not a criminal guilty of

622
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:51,580
crimes against humanity, but themselves falsely accused and condemned to death

623
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:56,820
for crimes they never committed. By now, the executioner should be more

624
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,260
worried about their lives than the prisoner should his.

625
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:06,300
The crowd might well demand clemency, and if refused, storm the guards and free

626
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,080
the prisoner by force. If you were part of the

627
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,020
justice intervention, you would probably feel proud for the good deed you performed

628
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:19,280
and the terrible injustice you averted. But if a few weeks later you learn that

629
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:24,800
the prisoner you saved was an insane serial killer, that the witnesses that

630
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:30,580
testified were all paid actors, and that the newspapers you believed were all

631
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,540
frauds, you might start to regret having been so compassionate.

632
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,060
Then by some quirk of fate, if you stumbled onto incontrovertible

633
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:44,060
evidence that the man you freed had devoted his life to destroying yours,

634
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,840
that his new obsession was to capture you, torture you, and sell your loved ones into slavery,

635
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,160
well, you'd probably start to feel anger.

636
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,960
Anger at yourself for being fooled.

637
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,600
Anger at the actors who tricked you, and the newspapers that lied to you.

638
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:08,880
And anger at all the mental dweebs still running around out there claiming the bastard is really

639
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:16,060
reformed and just misunderstood. This is how we at the church feel about the conspiracy.

640
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:22,040
Each and every one of us at one time or another believed the conspiracy.

641
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:27,840
Each and every one of us in one way or another served the conspiracy.

642
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:36,360
And every single one of us in no uncertain terms knows that the conspiracy is out to get us.

643
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,860
Every day it tries to capture us.

644
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,560
Torture us and enslave our kind.

645
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,660
And every single time we get close to destroying the monster,

646
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:53,440
some well-meaning but ignorant bystander starts whining that we're being too severe, too extreme.

647
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,940
They say that the conspiracy is actually innocent.

648
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:03,040
They say they know because they read all about it in the conspiracy newspapers or

649
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,960
saw it all explained to them on conspiracy TV.

650
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,440
They insist that our allegations

651
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,000
are exaggerated, that the conspiracy is getting better and that we should just mellow out.

652
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:21,280
They try to tell us that we ought to give the conspiracy slack.

653
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,800
Dear, dear friends, these poor misguided morons may be in the dark now,

654
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,880
just as we were before, and we may have acted back then just as stupid as they're acting now.

655
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,520
But that doesn't mean we don't have the right.

656
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,200
Nay, the duty to destroy the conspiracy while we have the chance.

657
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:51,220
Do not be taken in by any last minute media blitz that tries to convince you

658
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,980
that the conspiracy has suddenly turned over a new leaf because it hasn't.

659
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,860
The noose is around its neck.

660
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,320
What do you expect the conspiracy to say?

661
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,460
We deserve to die? Kill us?

662
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,000
No, the conspiracy will look and act nicer now than it ever has before.

663
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
So don't be.

664
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,220
Fool.

665
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:16,460
If you hesitate even for a second, you give the conspiracy a chance to win the crowd over.

666
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:23,820
And if that happens, you may find yourself on trial with no more X's around to pull your fat from the firing squad.

667
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,140
There's only one X day, dear friends.

668
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,400
Don't blow it.

669
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,260
July 5th, 1998.

670
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,140
Kill the conspiracy.

671
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,960
Cut off its head and launch it through the cosmos.

672
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,180
Here into the wood of our praise, Bob.

673
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:40,980
Amen.

674
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,400
McCain impersonations.

675
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,380
Vacuuming in the convention hall.

676
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,260
The elections over Dukakis has won.

677
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,080
Now everything is all died down.

678
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,280
People can go back to a country, one with severe problems.

679
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,280
Everyone has hopes this new administration will somehow be able to win.

680
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:06,680
And the Dukakis inaugural parade will be

681
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,400
the same as it was at the beginning of this year.

682
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:07,400


683
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,560
The president is coming down Constitution Avenue shortly with the president riding

684
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,960
in a tank with his head just sticking out above the turret wearing a helmet,

685
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:22,060
a very distinctive appearance for future commander in chief to assume the elective

686
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,200
office, the highest and his country.

687
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,840
And it's a beautiful spring day.

688
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,900
We have wonderful weather.

689
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,640
And here is Dr.

690
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,720
Philo Drummond.

691
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,540
Yes.

692
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,520
Yes, there he is riding his...

693
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,420
What is this? He's in a tank?

694
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,400
No, it's some kind of military vehicle.

695
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,700
A tank, a military vehicle? Is this what we want?

696
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,340
This may be the brand new Milton Bradley vehicle,

697
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,020
which costs taxpayers over $70 trillion.

698
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,720
It's a very small vehicle.

699
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,960
It scares small children and young girls.

700
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,940
His helmet is too small for him.

701
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,440
Yes, I think he sort of grew into it.

702
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,520
He never took it off since his electoral defeat

703
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,140
the first time he ran for president.

704
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,640
I don't know if I can follow him into a war zone.

705
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,460
Well, you may not have to.

706
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,440
Or a war zone or not.

707
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Now that we are fighting a five-front war,

708
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,280
it's necessary to get even more tanks.

709
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,820
It's a war of ideas.

710
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,920
So along with President Dukakis, I and many of the palpitating Americans

711
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,740
say tanks for the memory.

712
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,360
Yes, tanks are a rough side in any man's war,

713
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,920
but when they're on your side, well, that's the way to fight it.

714
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,200
A war of me over I.

715
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,340
We've always been at war with East Asia.

716
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,320
What's the matter with you?

717
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,780
We'll defeat that one so that I can prevail

718
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,840
while me gives away the secrets.

719
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,180
And we have to sacrifice them.

720
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,860
When it's over, we can build some better buildings,

721
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,760
have better food.

722
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,300
Use more water the way we used to in the old days.

723
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,820
I'm really thirsty. I'm going to get a drink of water.

724
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,540
Sorry.

725
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,980
Where's the clean water around here?

726
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,340
Somebody left that dog bowl in the street.

727
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,540
That werewolf piddle.

728
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,040
How are we going to get a drink of water?

729
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,080
Well, you can't.

730
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,060
That brings me to the...

731
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,440
I think it just flew out there.

732
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,420
I don't think an alien actually came along and pushed it over.

733
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,420
There's some purification tablets in the werewolf piddle.

734
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,180
It's been identified as a pathetic puddle of poodle piddle,

735
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,840
but locals claim that it's responsible.

736
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,440
A video of an alien pushing over a piece of ancient history.

737
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,220
To get to the bottom of this, we went to Ralph Fielding Snell,

738
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,260
in alrighty…

739
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:30,260


740
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,180
Nobody's going to buy that.

741
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,620
This is tired of us.

742
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,620
Here are the hills of old time Nevada.

743
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:35,540
Yeah.

744
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:35,540


745
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,780
… where wolves are running wild.

746
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,620
And the locals really don't know how to handle the problem.

747
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:41,740
Right?

748
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:50,520
There was an Indian petroglyph over ten million years old

749
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,580
proving it was the only one that proved it.

750
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,460
Humans did exist.

751
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,220
Very, very few people exist in the Jurassic period,

752
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,320
as previously.

753
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,340
unknown and yeah because the yeah and the fence around it which meant it was

754
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:09,560
really important around was able to destroy this monument in less than one

755
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:15,540
second this mighty monument yes story I destroyed the story famous in song and

756
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:20,240
story he's talking about a movie of an alien an alien wrecking something alien

757
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,160
rectum just like saying he's knocking over the pillars winner as it were

758
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,880
ancient glory fighting for the right well winter's coming with the strength

759
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,840
of ten ordinary ordinary men fighting for the right fighting with his might

760
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:41,340
with his might with his right with the silk umbrella ordinary hand over broom

761
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:49,860
boomale boomale and so we gather here to believe you can use her police help you

762
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,240
ease

763
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:09,960
I dreamed last night I got on the boat to heaven and by some chance I had

764
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:16,660
brought my dice along and there I stood and I hollered someone fade me but the

765
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:24,620
passengers they knew right from wrong for the people said sit down sit down

766
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:24,820
here

767
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,060
rock

768
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,140
rock

769
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:36,260
and a bowl people all said sit down sit down here rock and a bowl and the devil will drag you under by the sharp lapel of your checkered coat sit down sit down sit down sit down sit down here rock and a bowl

770
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:53,180
I sailed away on that little boat to heaven and by some chance found a bottle in my fist and there I stood nicely passing out the whiskey but the passengers were bound to

771
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:53,400
see

772
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:53,760
see

773
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,640
the

774
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,620
waves

775
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,900
and I

776
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:23,520
hollered

777
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,720
gave my last rave

778
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,720
and everyone interrupted finished this nice incredible little bullet

779
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,600
I had thirst in the tributaries and I could notfirth the

780
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,420
sound of life

781
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,140
back in the long

782
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,180
blast of the

783
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,500
donated

784
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:44,940
performed

785
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,620
it the

786
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:45,640
alone

787
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,300
life

788
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,460
Sit down, you're rocking the boat

789
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,660
Sit down, you're rocking the boat

790
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,360
Sit down, you're rocking the boat

791
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,620
Sit down, you're rocking the boat

792
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:10,540
That was Stubby K from the 1950 production of Guys and Dolls.

793
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,620
And what about this country, Lower Mesopotamia?

794
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,420
Is this a benevolent political system?

795
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,520
Hell yes, and there is Bdilium and the Onyx Stone.

796
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,880
Didn't we take this country away from the Neanderthals?

797
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,560
What about our aggressive stance on...

798
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,940
The daughters of the sons of the Harry Runners.

799
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,900
We stole this country from the Neanderthals.

800
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,500
Gave it from the caves and didn't give what it was.

801
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,320
We should give it back, it's their country.

802
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,180
Yeah, give it back!

803
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,980
That's right, man.

804
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,240
Turn the U.S. upside down.

805
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,480
Not the U.S., you're talking about Lower Mesopotamia.

806
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,940
Scrape the crap off it.

807
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,900
Talking about Ur. Ur of the Chaldeans.

808
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,540
Give it back to the Indians.

809
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,320
We need to give Ur of the Chaldeans back to the Neanderthals.

810
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,280
Well, we have to.

811
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,620
We should give it back.

812
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,220
They have to be represented in court.

813
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,660
It will be a lengthy legal proceeding.

814
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,160
Yeah, but I think somebody found some DNA of a Neanderthal now.

815
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,100
So we should be able to clone them and get them represented properly.

816
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,840
Until you grow one and you present him with the deed.

817
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,100
As well as the key to the city.

818
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,540
He's now the richest landowner on Earth.

819
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,520
I'm the authorized...

820
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:13,600
I'm the authorized...

821
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:13,600


822
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,420
I'm the authorized representative of the only known file of Neanderthal DNA.

823
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,420
I represent that DNA.

824
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,520
That was left on a pillowcase of...

825
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,200
These are some kind of wrappers in a junkyard or something?

826
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,220
Ah, I mean, Ace Junkyard had great days.

827
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,960
Sure did, man. I'm gonna miss that one.

828
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,140
Yeah, me too, man.

829
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,880
It was so great.

830
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,700
I've got some great shots of you, Philo, and your young family.

831
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:51,320
Did anyone else here wake up in absolute pain all over their whole body as if they'd been run over by a truck?

832
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,080
I see most everybody's hands went up.

833
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,080
Well, I was a little stiff, but I wouldn't put it that way.

834
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,460
But there have been a lot of insects attacking me personally.

835
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:07,300
I was only bitten where I put the hippie insect repellent, which my hippie wife gave me.

836
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,300
She said, you've got to put some stuff on.

837
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,960
I just put it on my hands, and my hands are covered with little bites.

838
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,460
All the rest of me they stayed away from.

839
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,280
Come on, boys, a hippie.

840
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:18,760
That's right.

841
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,680
We could get high off of this guy's blood.

842
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,620
I've got spiders.

843
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,780
You've got spiders?

844
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,780
Pisces has spiders.

845
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,880
Oh, that's quite a nice leg, but a bad spider bite.

846
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,600
Yeah, I didn't know they would just often bite you like that.

847
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,100
Yeah.

848
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:39,520
Without provocation.

849
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,640
There's all kinds of interesting flora and fauna around here.

850
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:52,320
It's great doing a – think if we did X Day in a hotel like a sci-fi convention or a comic book con.

851
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,800
You'd think we'd get a bunch of pinkies out here now.

852
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,400
Think about if it was indoors.

853
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:06,100
At least the people who come here are willing to either camp out – and for some of them it's their first time.

854
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,680
It's a huge adventure.

855
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:18,080
To drive 20 miles from their home, leave their parents for the first time, stay up all night, drink beer, and get bitten by bugs.

856
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,180
They'll be talking about it for years.

857
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,460
Some of us live that way every night.

858
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:31,440
Well, if you want to continue your interesting reverse vision of dinking down subgenius to something totally insignificant,

859
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:37,660
try to imagine a combination comic book convention and subgenius.

860
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,540
That would be a nerd out beyond compare.

861
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,960
Yes, yes, yes.

862
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:53,640
You know, I have to ask everybody, how do you think the Church of Subgenius might be different with a woman in charge?

863
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,760
What do you mean?

864
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,640
Well –

865
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,700
Hail Connie, dude.

866
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,320
Who do you think wears the panties in the dog's family?

867
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:00,400
Really?

868
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,340
I mean, that's what's been happening for the past 15 years.

869
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,940
So Connie would wear the pantaloons and the panties.

870
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,160
Yeah.

871
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:12,300
I'll bet you didn't know that our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq often wear women's pantyhose,

872
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,760
because that's a good way those soldiers keep warm.

873
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,320
They just hope they don't get wounded so the medics discover that when they're being tended to.

874
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,260
And I'm not kidding.

875
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,680
Didn't football players do that, too?

876
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,220
Football players? Of course.

877
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,720
Listen, all men wear pantyhose, and we just don't talk about it.

878
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,320
Now it comes out.

879
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,020
Until now.

880
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,280
The bitter truth.

881
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,540
Well, too bad we had to blow that one on the air.

882
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,620
In my case, I have a –

883
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,560
Because, you know, I don't wear pantyhose.

884
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,700
And mine are killing me.

885
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,580
When I went on to the beaches in Normandy, I was wearing some frilly little panties, and I'm proud of it, too.

886
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,660
You know, the first guy to do that was Ed Wood, of course.

887
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,120
Right. That was what I was thinking of.

888
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,140
And he was a subgenius before he knew it, but he also wore it as a necklace, and he tried to asphyxiate himself.

889
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,960
And he got into porn in the end, like Bert I. Gordon, you know.

890
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,820
Really? Big Gordon got into porn?

891
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,520
Yes. He made crappy monster movies, and finally he just got into porn.

892
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,640
He didn't make monster movies before he got into erotica?

893
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,860
He went into monster shot movies.

894
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,640
No, I read Bert I. Gordon's biography, and it made his fans crestfallen.

895
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,340
Believe it or not, there were Bert I. Gordon fans.

896
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:27,020
They used to publish a fanzine about him called Mr. Big, B-I-G, Bert I. Gordon.

897
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,240
And that fanzine is a rare collectible item today.

898
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:36,540
His films had the most jiggly, wonderful matte lines of any blue screen.

899
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:42,200
I just bought a copy of The Magic Sword at Walgreens for 99 cents. I wish I'd brought it.

900
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,520
That's actually, that has pretty good effect.

901
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,060
That's the Citizen Kane of Bert I. Gordon movies.

902
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:53,760
I could see like maybe a 5'9 dinosaur having sex with an Inuit woman as one of his prima facie.

903
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:58,680
You know, actually, The Magic Sword is about St. George, who's an interesting character.

904
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:03,300
He has adventures with the dragon. I just recently read a whole book on that subject.

905
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,400
It's strange.

906
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:11,760
There's a museum in Kentucky that says dinosaurs are, you know, actually that kind of dragon that St. George fought.

907
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,540
They were still around.

908
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:16,100
Well, the chickens are related to dinosaurs if we're going to fry them, for crying out loud.

909
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,660
See, everything is a convoluted circle that runs right back to nowhere.

910
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,480
To chickens?

911
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,760
To knowers are.

912
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,340
Dinosaurs taste like chicken.

913
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,720
Nowhere is like...

914
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,260
...hungry and high chickens in Amsterdam.

915
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:26,760
Oh my.

916
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:33,360
I had some Jehovah's Witnesses show up at my door recently, and I'm always polite to my fellow religious fans.

917
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,320
That's right. I'm not mean to them.

918
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,060
But I did lie.

919
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,340
But woe unto them if my roommate answers the door.

920
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,160
Oh, God. I did lie to them because I...

921
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:51,060
As they were...as I was politely getting rid of them, they...I said, you know, I come behind any religion that doesn't want to kill everybody.

922
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,200
And they actually high-fived me.

923
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,520
But I was lying because I'm part of the religion that actually really does want to kill everybody.

924
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,640
Well, the truth is...

925
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,140
But as somebody pointed out...

926
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:01,840
...that you held up your hand.

927
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,300
Every time you lie to a Jehovah's Witness, Bob has a little...

928
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:05,300


929
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,220
...a little orgasm.

930
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,100
Yes, the second death.

931
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,300
Did you take your flip with them at least?

932
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:15,780
You think that dried-up old bag of hump could actually have an orgasm by witnessing a Jehovah One Witness cram it?

933
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,280
Come on, Stang.

934
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:17,940
No.

935
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:25,200
I always tell the Jehovah's Witnesses that I admire their illustrations in their books.

936
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:25,900
And it's...

937
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:26,360
Yeah, I wonder who does those.

938
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,500
...that part I'm not lying.

939
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:35,260
Because all the illustrations that I've ever done for subgenius were direct rip-offs of specific Jehovah's Witnesses.

940
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,920
I thought it was a little too obvious.

941
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,960
I thought I would try to reproduce in a subgeniously manner.

942
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,140
And then what happened?

943
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,260
The devil busted out all of hell broke loose.

944
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,200
And he came all the way home.

945
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,240
Chaymash, revenge.

946
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,760
The portcullis smashed down, and Chaymash gloated in the darkness.

947
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,360
And Moab hither before ye and unto lo.

948
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,980
For ye was...

949
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,880
...barely I say unto you.

950
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,600
...forcing the temples grim.

951
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,220
And that twice more.

952
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,780
The old man was a battered god of Palestine.

953
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:08,220
Chaymash!

954
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:12,560
And mooned Ashtaroth, heaven's queen and mother both.

955
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,320
Thou sits not girt with tapers wholly shy.

956
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:17,920
Chaymash!

957
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,520
Chaymash, where are you?

958
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,520
Chaymash!

959
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,840
Come here, little Chaymash!

960
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,920
Come here, little Chaymash!

961
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,220
The libic hammam shrinks his horn.

962
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,100
In vain, Viterian maids their wounded tamu's with one.

963
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:32,340
...to the one.

964
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,760
Just remember, Chaymash.

965
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:33,800
...to the one.

966
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,820
...to the one.

967
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:36,980
...to the one.

968
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,020
That'll teach you for ridiculing Chaymash.

969
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:46,720
And sullen Moloch fled, hath left in shadow's dread his burning idol all of blackest hue.

970
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:53,420
In vain, with timbrel's ring they call the Grizzly King, in dismal dance about the furnace

971
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,140
blew.

972
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,880
The brutish gods of Nihil...

973
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,500
And his hair was all akimbo.

974
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,760
...Isis and Oros and the dog and...

975
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,240
Molek had the funniest hairdo.

976
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,140
Did you see that?

977
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,380
Huh?

978
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,080
The hairdo Molek had on that time.

979
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,560
Molek's hairdo?

980
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,180
Yeah.

981
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,420
Well, I mean, he put mud on it.

982
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,980
That's how he kept it like that.

983
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,200
He put mud on his hair.

984
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:17,520
Mud-do.

985
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,800
No kidding.

986
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,020
They kept their hair up.

987
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,380
Looks like a victim died of mud overdose.

988
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:21,820
Yeah.

989
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,020
He jumped in so much mud.

990
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:22,700
No, he's got mud on.

991
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,820
He's styling with mud, man.

992
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,700
He seems to have a...

993
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,960
Special kind of Nihil mud.

994
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,520
...stopper.

995
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:27,880
Yeah.

996
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,480
It was.

997
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,200
Here in the desert.

998
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:29,780
So sweet.

999
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,460
A production of EbMud.

1000
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:31,840
Here in the desert.

1001
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,880
State of California.

1002
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:33,220
I'll be back in a minute.

1003
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,220
We'll be able to...

1004
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:34,660
Black mud.

1005
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,040
...continue with the show at that time, but everybody just...

1006
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,700
Take it easy.

1007
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:37,780
Take it easy.

1008
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,900
His name was Mud.

1009
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,840
But then there was Mud's Women.

1010
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,700
Play some video games or something and just go off.

1011
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,600
Yes, Mud's Women.

1012
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,780
They could slick their hair back big time with that mud.

1013
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,940
Delightfully comedic episode.

1014
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,760
All your favs are there.

1015
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,000
Here's some quarters.

1016
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,180
Hopefully this will last you the rest of the evening.

1017
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,800
A sequel to another episode involving hair mud.

1018
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,580
This is $900 in quarters.

1019
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,180
Okay, zip your zipper back up, though.

1020
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:58,620
You don't need to bring that back.

1021
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,280
I was about to.

1022
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,400
I don't need to be reminded.

1023
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:01,820
It's okay.

1024
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:05,560
I'm quite able to comport myself with dignity.

1025
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,240
We are perfectly fine without that form of nudity here at the game arcade.

1026
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,440
Well, the ice...

1027
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,260
I mean, the ice...

1028
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,020
We're perfectly fine without it.

1029
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,880
That might be one thing, but here I kind of feel...

1030
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,080
Well, there's a time and a place for everything.

1031
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:20,900
Kind of feel...

1032
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,440
No, don't kind of feel that.

1033
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,760
No, I just wanted to check the outfit.

1034
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,500
Look at that.

1035
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:25,800
Wow.

1036
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,920
That's just nasty.

1037
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,180
That is just totally nasty.

1038
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:29,800
That's objectionable.

1039
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,880
Well, I have to say, we...

1040
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,800
I think our content is...

1041
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:34,240
No, no, we can't...

1042
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,840
And subject to scrutiny over the long run.

1043
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,320
Boy, scrutinize that.

1044
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,660
Oh, man, that's hideous.

1045
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,100
That is totally...

1046
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:41,560
Yeah, is that...

1047
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,240
We're really violating their privacy, too.

1048
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,580
Did you have to do that here?

1049
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,300
I know they...

1050
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,520
I'm glad that we weren't here.

1051
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,420
I heard you...

1052
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,380
Okay, okay, all right.

1053
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,640
Lysol spray mist.

1054
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,780
Now let's go in the one next door and see if there's anybody...

1055
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,400
This affects the other ice.

1056
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,140
Oh, wow.

1057
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,380
Would you look at that.

1058
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,980
Hey, we're here to do some radio.

1059
00:51:59,760 --> 00:51:59,840
Man, what is this, a convention?

1060
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,800
All right, we're sorry you're having trouble.

1061
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:01,800


1062
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:01,800


1063
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:01,800


1064
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:01,800


1065
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:01,800


1066
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,580
I'm sorry, but this is a convention, a defecators convention or something?

1067
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,420
What's going on there?

1068
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:09,300
We definitely want to get these defecators in focus.

1069
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:09,660
Is that what you guys saw?

1070
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,520
The defecators convention.

1071
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:10,880
Really?

1072
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:17,480
Let's get a little closer and we can start asking some of these people definite questions

1073
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:17,940
about the deficit, the US budget deficit.

1074
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,840
Kierkegaard, the philosopher.

1075
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,760
Yeah, that's what the whole thing was about.

1076
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,080
Oh, the philosophy of existentialism?

1077
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:24,640
Yeah, damn.

1078
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,840
Okay, listen, next week I'll do...

1079
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:25,840


1080
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:25,920
Okay, next week I'll do...

1081
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,600
...Defecatio and Ose.

1082
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:28,960
I don't know why you guys...

1083
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,500
What do you guys think I was doing?

1084
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,600
Well, I don't know.

1085
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:31,780
How about the...

1086
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,780
The legendary argument between...

1087
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,600
The legend of Zelda.

1088
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,340
...With Wittgenstein and Popoff.

1089
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:38,620
Zelda!

1090
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:38,980
Popoff?

1091
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:39,400
Yeah.

1092
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:39,680
Yeah.

1093
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,220
And they had the poker incident.

1094
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,920
And Russo's dog was hit by the poker a century later.

1095
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,960
Boy, I came this close.

1096
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,640
This close.

1097
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:48,700
Yeah.

1098
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,740
And Schrodinger's cat.

1099
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,580
And then General Wolfe died and the planes had come back.

1100
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:52,680
And then General Wolfe died and the planes had come back.

1101
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:52,760
And then General Wolfe died and the planes had come back.

1102
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,820
That was the good old days when the dogs and the cats were together.

1103
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:56,360
That was...

1104
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:56,360


1105
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,840
Not onions and the eels fought titanic battles.

1106
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,540
They didn't care that they were opposite enemies.

1107
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:01,560


1108
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:01,560


1109
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:06,460
They were living in harmony together in a state of neutral...

1110
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,320
They could sing harmony?

1111
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,080
...Parsimony.

1112
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,060
...Double Doors, the Horns and Honeys.

1113
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:10,840
...Parsimony.

1114
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,480
Where they would each contribute their own amount based on their ability.

1115
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,460
So did the manager own the songs or did the band own the songs?

1116
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,020
And each drawing from there within based on their need.

1117
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:25,320
And ultimately a synergistic relationship formed that could actually support a bureaucracy.

1118
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,540
Didn't have no welfare state.

1119
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,140
Everybody pulled his weight.

1120
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,540
G.R.R.

1121
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,900
Old LaSalle ran great.

1122
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,820
Those were the days.

1123
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,960
And we had that guy that would tell us here's how much you need to earn and here's how much

1124
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,720
you need to produce.

1125
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,120
And that's all we needed to care about.

1126
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:50,160
And then we'd just go home each night and play with the dog.

1127
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,560
Those were the good old days.

1128
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,720
Here, pet Rover on the head.

1129
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,980
That's not Rover's head.

1130
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,000
Don't pet him there.

1131
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,200
Long end there, buddy.

1132
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:00,640
Rover.

1133
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:01,540
That's not Rover's head.

1134
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:01,540


1135
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:02,220
Not again.

1136
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:13,480
Just take care of your pet because in your old age your pet may take care of you.

1137
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,360
He may be genetically engineered to push your wheelchair.

1138
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,020
If you're lucky.

1139
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,620
And I'm telling you, you want to be nice to him.

1140
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:24,060
Your pet won't kill you when you become infirm in your wheelchair in your old age.

1141
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,060
You're just sitting there.

1142
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,680
They won't rip you open like a bag of kibble.

1143
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,720
Who suddenly would say to yourself, I don't think I can move.

1144
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,160
And then your pet comes in there with a leering eye.

1145
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:31,300
With slavery.

1146
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,300
Slavery tongue.

1147
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,560
Glowing eyes.

1148
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,760
Disembowel you.

1149
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,480
Why granny, what big eyes you have.

1150
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:43,960
Yes.

1151
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,140
We'll see about that.

1152
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,600
You loved your pet and your pet will love you too.

1153
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,340
Mm-mm.

1154
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:49,920
Good.

1155
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,120
And this is the future you're predicting, Philo?

1156
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,780
This is our doing?

1157
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:56,220
Yes.

1158
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,420
Ivan Stang said that's what happens.

1159
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,400
With leering and the time he had been having.

1160
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:00,960
He's the idol.

1161
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:01,280
He's the idol of the future.

1162
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,280


1163
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,280


1164
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,280


1165
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,280


1166
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,280


1167
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,280


1168
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,280


1169
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,280


1170
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,280


1171
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,280


1172
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,280


1173
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,280


1174
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,940
And he thought that when the pets rebel and all of you just.

1175
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:05,460
Yeah.

1176
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,040
Even the little kiddies.

1177
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,240
Not going to be UFOs.

1178
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,280
It was going to be pets.

1179
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,620
But some say that it's.

1180
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,560
Strange and weird man.

1181
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,720
Things like electric razors and microwave ovens that are going to rebel.

1182
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,160
Before the pets do.

1183
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,580
And that terrible.

1184
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,400
My electric razor will rebel and shave you to death.

1185
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,300
The rebellion will be a terrible trial for humanity.

1186
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:23,680


1187
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,080
And.

1188
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:24,340
And.

1189
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,320
You know what?

1190
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,060
You're going to have so much razor burn.

1191
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:27,240
Suddenly at the mercy of his devices.

1192
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,400
You'll have so much razor burn you'll cry.

1193
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,420
So much.

1194
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,280
It'll make you cry.

1195
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:35,060
Like a little cheerleader in a stupid 50s movie.

1196
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,480
And that toaster's going to burn your toast every day

1197
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,100
until you get carcinogen toast.

1198
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:39,940
The toaster oven.

1199
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,800
Yes, you don't want to turn your back on that.

1200
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,280
There go your dreams up in smoke above the toaster.

1201
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:43,660
Poof.

1202
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,080
And then, you know what happens?

1203
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,900
The nice next show comes in and washes away

1204
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,580
the evil, stinchy, bad show.

1205
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,200
Just in time to stave off the attack

1206
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,660
of a malevolent eggbeater and waffle iron.

1207
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:02,320
When the kitchen appliances became deadly predators,

1208
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,440
attacking without washing.

1209
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,260
Like a bomb, like a breath bomb.

1210
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,740
And so, as the kitchens were closed down

1211
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,640
all across this land of ours,

1212
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,520
the people delivered a heartfelt prayer.

1213
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,000
The utensils put back in their drawers,

1214
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,460
the bowls, the mixing bowls,

1215
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:24,240
the sifters, the basters,

1216
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,500
all the various tools,

1217
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,780
the cutriments used,

1218
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,480
the food,

1219
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,260
the things we used to cook with,

1220
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,580
the stuff from the kitchens,

1221
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,540
of the great chefs of the world.

1222
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,060
A long list of things, but we can't.

1223
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,300
Maybe salt.

1224
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,580
We have some salt.

1225
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,700
Bottomless cans and tins and bins of soup.

1226
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,700
Bread bursting from incendiary ovens.

1227
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,040
Noodles, corn.

1228
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,720
And hot cuts of oxtail.

1229
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:49,440
Green beans, oxtails.

1230
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,980
Going into a steaming stew.

1231
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,840
Where Oprah consorts with Rutabaga.

1232
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:55,580
Stew.

1233
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,180
Stewing stew.

1234
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,640
And the lodges speak only good.

1235
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,400
The Rutabagas.

1236
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,760
Yeah, they're heavy.

1237
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:02,480
They're weighty.

1238
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,940
Sorry, Rutabagas illegal in the States.

1239
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:05,900
That's just rude.

1240
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,960
Um, and you know, a whole bag of Rutabagas.

1241
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:10,700
Rutabagas.

1242
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:11,040
That's a...

1243
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:11,280
That...

1244
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,680
Leave that bag alone.

1245
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,520
I'm just poking it about, but please...

1246
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:15,980
Poke the bag.

1247
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,040
Don't squeeze the...

1248
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,520
That bag of Rutabagas has, uh...

1249
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,320
Is that a bag of show?

1250
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:20,780
It has feelings.

1251
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:24,180
You probably were the guy that put those bite marks in the sausage on...

1252
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,520
at the grocery store, right?

1253
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,020
I was hungry.

1254
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:26,480
Yeah.

1255
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,380
I was hungry.

1256
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,360
Oh, he did it.

1257
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,100
Yeah, I meant he did it.

1258
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:29,700
Ah, the raw sausage.

1259
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,040
I just wanted to go home.

1260
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,120
He just wanted to feel it.

1261
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,500
Where they've got his sausage there for me.

1262
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:33,500


1263
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,080
Teeth when you did it.

1264
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,200
Come on, Sheriff Filo.

1265
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:35,940
Hal just wanted to go home.

1266
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:36,860
He just wanted to bite it.

1267
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,920
Bite his teeth.

1268
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:37,940
And there I can respond.

1269
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:38,300
Go home.

1270
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,640
I just wanted to see what the bite marks looked like.

1271
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,120
You know what I mean.

1272
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,820
You just wanted to go home.

1273
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:47,380
Bite marks also, but the next buyer, since we're in a store, the buyer would look and

1274
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:47,780
see...

1275
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:48,800
And I'll have mustard.

1276
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,480
Someone's bitten on this sausage.

1277
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,360
Look, there's teeth marks on it.

1278
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,100
And there's some sauerkraut on the side.

1279
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,660
I can't do that thing.

1280
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,240
Hey, look, there's a crazy kid sitting right over there.

1281
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,720
And those hot dogs can run.

1282
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,100
He's just muttering to himself.

1283
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,980
Those hot dogs can run, but they can't hide.

1284
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,440
He's the one that bit the sausage, Officer.

1285
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,680
He's the one what done it.

1286
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:14,880
See?

1287
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:15,680
You see that crazy look in his eye?

1288
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,300
These sausages are my property, and I'll do what I want with them.

1289
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,020
One of his eyes is looking this way, and one of them's looking that way.

1290
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,500
Now, kick yourself away from here, you uneducated bumpkin.

1291
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,940
This rural, backward...

1292
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,060
That's what I'm talking about.

1293
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,060


1294
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,060


1295
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,060


1296
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,060


1297
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,060


1298
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,060


1299
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:25,940
That's not the way he said it earlier.

1300
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,060
... has no authority over me.

1301
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,580
Am I not...

1302
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:28,580


1303
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,880
... Fin Fang Foon?

1304
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,120
Oh, I guess I'm not.

1305
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,580
People walking down the boulevard.

1306
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,540
I guess that's turning into a show.

1307
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:35,760
Yeah.

1308
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,980
Yes, there they are.

1309
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:37,480
Traffic.

1310
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:38,760
Traffic is starting...

1311
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,540
The show is almost over.

1312
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:40,160
Fives are going on.

1313
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,760
It's like it doesn't even matter.

1314
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,480
The show's about to disappear.

1315
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,500
It doesn't matter if the show disappears.

1316
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:44,280
The show blows up.

1317
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,200
The winter evening goes on.

1318
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,400
We'll be back next week, right?

1319
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,380
We'll be back next week?

1320
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,420
Smell of stakes and passageways.

1321
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:48,660
I don't know.

1322
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,640
The show will be back next week.

1323
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:49,880
Six o'clock.

1324
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,900
If it doesn't blow up.

1325
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,260
... and it could...

1326
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,860
Are you saying that the show is volatile?

1327
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:56,700
Yeah.

1328
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,140
That it has a volatile oil and a fuse?

1329
00:58:59,140 --> 00:58:59,140


1330
00:58:59,140 --> 00:58:59,960
If you shake the show...

1331
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,120
Is that what that fuse...

1332
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:01,260
... and newspapers...

1333
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:01,940
... that burn in the views...

1334
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:02,900
... and the show off in the wrong position...

1335
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,120
... it could get stuck in the desert.

1336
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:04,260
Yeah.

1337
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,600
... the shower has beat on broken glass...

1338
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,680
And if it gets stuck in the desert and doesn't want the cop to help...

1339
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,140
... while at the corner of the street...

1340
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:10,160
... while at the corner of the street...

1341
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:10,400
... it's afraid for the cops.

1342
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,620
... blow the show up before the radio cops get there.

1343
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,320
Puzzling Evidence ends the show.

1344
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:19,700
Thanks also to Radio Synesthesia from WCSB Cleveland.

1345
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,720
This is the Hour of Slack.

1346
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:21,880
I'm your host, Tom Hiddleston.

1347
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,760
And I'm Tom Hiddleston from the Church of the Subgenius.

1348
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:30,440
See subgenius.com for everything we can't tell you here.

1349
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,060
And Christa, Flyin' Brian Brothers for the background music.

1350
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:35,680
Ah-hoo!

1351
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,360
...
