00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,020
Bob!

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,640
Bob!

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,300
Bob!

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,000
Bob!

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,200
Dubs!

6
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,540
Bob?

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,420
Dubs!

8
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,120
Oh, hello, Mr. Dubs. What is it?

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,760
Well, it's probably not...

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,480
The Self Genius Power of Slack!

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,460
The Self Genius Power of Slack!

12
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,300
By God!

13
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,900
I am for Pastor David Epley,

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,120
your Good Shepherd Prayer Partner,

15
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,900
and your personal friend.

16
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,980
In the next 13 or 14 minutes,

17
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,420
something good, good, good

18
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,800
is coming your way.

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,120
So don't leave this radio station.

20
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,740
Let's have a good time together.

21
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:45,860
Let's have a good time together.

22
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,800
He's all I need.

23
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,220
He's all I need.

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,520
He's all I need.

25
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:52,520


26
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:52,520


27
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,120
Ah, yes.

28
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,700
And at the very,

29
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,100
at the very top of the radio,

30
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,600
the door of the day of the wrath of God

31
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,440
is at hand,

32
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,420
and that if you plan to get saved,

33
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,460
you'd better do it now.

34
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,280
...inth Fist Temple Lodge

35
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,340
of the Church of the Subgenius of Little Rock,

36
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,880
and before we begin

37
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,220
this sacred spouting,

38
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,440
I think that we should all

39
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,820
bow our heads and let's all have

40
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,140
a minute of noise.

41
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:19,760
Ah!

42
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,760
Ah!

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,440
Ah!

44
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,040
Ah!

45
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,500
Ah!

46
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,180

47
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,560

60
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,800
Oh, this is Timothy Larry reminding you that just as you need slack, Bob needs your help.

61
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,200
Send in those pledges and praise Bob.

62
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,620
Has this ever happened to you?

63
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,980
Why, I should have been there, Ted. It was great.

64
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,100
There was free booze, great music, one of the best parties I ever went to.

65
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,660
Where were you that night?

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,620
Oh, I just kind of stayed home and watched TV. I guess I should have gone, huh?

67
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,960
Didn't you feel stupid? Didn't you wish you could go back to that night, that party?

68
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,280
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn how to do that very thing.

69
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,420
Introducing Bob's School of Time Control.

70
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,760
At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time, slow time, and make time run backwards.

71
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,680
But most importantly, you'll be learning how to make time work for you.

72
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,940
How, you may ask?

73
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,180
Well, just ask this man here, an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.

74
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,380
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck. Blango.

75
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,600
My dog was dead.

76
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,420
Was I sad, till I met Bob.

77
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,060
Bob showed me how I could go back, get the registration number for the car,

78
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,520
do a slip job on the brakes, and wouldn't you know it,

79
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,860
that truck went off into a ditch and burst into flames just exactly a block before he could hit old Booger.

80
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,600
Ain't that right, fella?

81
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,060
Yes, just imagine the horrible things that could be undone tomorrow

82
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,000
if you had only gone to Bob's School of Time Control today.

83
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,020
Courses start yesterday, but you can catch up.

84
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,220
Just right, Bob's School of Time Control, the universe.

85
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,580
Bob's School of Time Control, a division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited.

86
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,440
Go go Bob's School of Time Control, number one,

87
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,260
bottom the cup and

88
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,580
we go something.

89
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:46,920


90
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:46,920


91
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:54,520
and he Burnham justرت my account down and He sent me the honor of having a car and two pick up Ils hits right away HQI don't this bad kid to me was lost video of Bob sh-

92
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,320
Do you find yourself crying at funerals?

93
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,900
Do you ever feel clumsy when you're in an awkward situation?

94
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,260
When you laugh, do you often find yourself gasping for breath?

95
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,240
If so, ask your doctor when he can start putting you on more normalin.

96
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Normalin is designed to allow you to enjoy the illusion of being the person you always

97
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,200
thought you wanted to be, but may not have been sure of.

98
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,480
If you ever thought you could be more normal, more normalin may or may not be the key.

99
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,080
Side effects may include, but are not limited to, simultaneous bleeding from the ear, nose,

100
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,280
throat, and rectum, bloody diarrhea and urination, frozen fingers, partial or full paralysis,

101
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,600
diphtheria, gout, morbid dental plaque, painful mixturation, sudden inexplicable vomiting,

102
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,960
tongue fur, enlarged nostrils, and a slight possibility of detached limbs.

103
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,380
More normalin.

104
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,280
It can help you be more normal.

105
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,240
Use only as directed.

106
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:07,720
I know, and among other things, Bog, I'm doing pretty well with those pills you sent.

107
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:15,040
Pretty well, but I can always use more.

108
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,360
And it's because of Ohio and the Ohio State.

109
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,360


110
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,360


111
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,580
And red trucks, and they're all gone, Bog.

112
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,160
But that's okay.

113
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,920
I hope you're as good as me.

114
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,740
Doug's right, Virgil.

115
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,580
We are different.

116
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,820
Soon everyone will be a superior biospecies, even Doug Smith.

117
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,200
It's the good news, son.

118
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,540
What?

119
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,060
Of the limitless sex?

120
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,360
What?

121
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:50,360


122
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:50,360


123
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,900
Just to put them on top of that.

124
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,080
Well, remember...

125
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,700
Yeah, why don't you shut the butt and lower sugar levels!

126
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:09,860
Francois van Brayan?

127
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:09,880
All right, I'm out of here.

128
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:09,880


129
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:09,880


130
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,280
Good night, business.

131
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,500
Good Volunteer.

132
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,760
Hiya końem verschmerzers!

133
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,380
How are youEpika?

134
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,780
Ghost?

135
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,160
Darn it, they think crazy!

136
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,620
Let them all around!

137
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,720
Anarchy!

138
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,420
They are cruel as three!

139
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,120
It's a rattle rock party town!

140
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,280
Party town!

141
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,400
Party town!

142
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,380
Party town!

143
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:35,000
I think this is about the sickest, sickest, sickest thing I've ever heard on KFJZ

144
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,740
and since I've been listening to it.

145
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,300
There's a fella down in Texas

146
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,920
They say his name is Bob

147
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,960
He tells me I should slack off

148
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,020
I should quit my job

149
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,740
Well I'm a subgenius

150
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,280
And I must have my slack

151
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,580
If I don't live forever

152
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,780
I get my money back

153
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,280
I get my money back

154
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,260
I get my money back

155
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,780
I get my money back

156
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:14,860
I get my money back

157
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,100
I get my money back

158
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:21,340
They said that on July 5th of 1998

159
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,240
The earth would meet destruction

160
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,360
Suffer a deadly fate

161
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,660
That day was long away

162
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,880
Now it has come and gone

163
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,200
There was no fire from heaven

164
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,820
And this old world rolls on

165
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,960
Well I'm a subgenius

166
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,180
And I must have my slack

167
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,780
If I don't live forever

168
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,260
I get my money back

169
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,420
The بُا θα genetics

170
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,320
made to suffer a terrible disgrace.

171
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:23,160
Of such humiliation, he feared to show his face.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,280
Now Bob may be laughing because we are such chumps,

173
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:41,080
but there is no reason to be down in the dumps.

174
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:48,400
It'll all still happen, no need to curse or frown.

175
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,860
They got all the right numbers, just got them upside down.

176
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,540
Well I'm a subgenius,

177
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,260
and I'm a genius.

178
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:02,260


179
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,160
And I must have my slack.

180
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,700
If I don't live forever,

181
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,260
I get my money back.

182
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,220
I'm a genius.

183
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,680
I'm stupid.

184
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,520
What is my IQ?

185
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,720
What is my intelligent quotient?

186
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,320
I could have been the Golden Gate Bridge,

187
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,000
or Einstein's nemesis.

188
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,660
I could have been the dirty jockey,

189
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,200
I could have been the dirty jockey,

190
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,140
but it's all come down to this.

191
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,620
Me so stupid.

192
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,440
Me so stupid.

193
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,380
Me so stupid.

194
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,620
What is my IQ?

195
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,660
What is my intelligent quotient?

196
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,660
What is my IQ?

197
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:01,740
What is my IQ?

198
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,200
What is my IQ?

199
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,200


200
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,740
eight or ten?

201
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,800
And what does my IQ do?

202
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,200
Three or three out of ten?

203
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:20,500
Eat whatever you wish

204
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,360
싶은izar

205
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,500
I could have been Las Vegas

206
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:44,420
I could have built a drop-tire Rolls Royce

207
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,200
Could have been the president of the world

208
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,060
Could have had Ali on the road

209
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,820
Could have had Miss August again

210
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,820
Could have had Miss May again

211
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,900
Could have had Miss September again

212
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,300
But I waited till December made for me

213
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,660
Me so stupid

214
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,620
Me so stupid

215
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,380
Me so stupid

216
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,000
What is my IQ?

217
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,820
What is my intelligent quotient?

218
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,740
Hm?

219
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,580
atherine

220
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,860
BOOOOوmmmmmmm

221
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:38,860


222
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:47,940
Doing away with my life!

223
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:54,560
Ohhh aumenttechnique

224
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:54,760
Remember did you know?

225
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,440
It's about you

226
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,600
No

227
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,620
My two lives

228
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:59,060
Punk

229
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,560
Iよ

230
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,260
Oh, the snow is falling, I'm starting to yearn

231
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,600
For those hominy grits and the Christmas ferns

232
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,000
Won't you carry me back to the good old USA?

233
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Yes, I want to go back where I was born

234
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,580
With the meth labs out in the fields of corn

235
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,100
Please carry me back to the good old USA

236
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,880
Plenty of public servants who have read their Bible

237
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,180
Want to give the ladies an ultrasound that's transvaginal

238
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,560
Where the unemployed ain't got no voice

239
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,760
And the Ku Klux Klan is a lifestyle choice

240
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,280
Carry me back to the good old USA

241
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,720
Let's go!

242
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,020
Oh, the snow is falling, I'm starting to yearn

243
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:06,960
For those hominy grits and the Christmas ferns

244
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:13,820
Won't you carry me back to the good old USA?

245
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,640
Yes, I want to go back to the good old USA

246
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:18,840
Where the unemployed ain't got no voice

247
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,300
And the Ku Klux Klan is a lifestyle choice

248
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,900
Carry me back to the good old USA

249
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,720
Where the unemployed ain't got no voice

250
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,380
And the Ku Klux Klan is a lifestyle choice

251
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,880
Carry me back to the good old USA

252
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:39,760
All the small town folks say, howdy y'all, and the governor's got no brains at all, won't you carry me back to the good old USA?

253
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:48,980
There's a cop on the beat saying, how do you do? The Supreme Court says he can strip search you when you come on back to the good old USA.

254
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:59,780
Hey, Bias Corpus, Schmabius Corpus, give me an American Treblinka. As long as you don't raise my taxes, I'll be a Kool-Aid drinker.

255
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:07,840
And I won't worry my pretty little head about waterboarding in Abu Ghraib, a patriotic zombie from cradle to grave.

256
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,360
Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, you gotta carry me back to the good old USA.

257
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:33,140
Oh, yes, dear friends, the good old USA. Princess, we and I drove from one end of the country to the other and are back again.

258
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:41,040
We went searching for America, and what we found was the Salton Sea.

259
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,020
Yes.

260
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,160
And a few other cool places.

261
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,260
And that song we just heard.

262
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,180
Carry me back to the good old USA was by the Rudy Schwartz Project.

263
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,180
And going from the beginning of the show, the titles were by Lemur.

264
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:06,280
After Timothy Leary, we heard a commercial for Bob's School of Time Control.

265
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,880
And also a commercial for the pill, More Normalin.

266
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,240
Both of those were by our friend, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

267
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,220
One of the few subgeniuses we saw on our trip.

268
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,760
Who?

269
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,580
Family trip.

270
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,820
Glass Madness did a Bob song there.

271
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,720
The late Reverend David Boone wanted pills.

272
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,800
GWAR did that song, Ragnarok.

273
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:37,440
And that was Reverend Chuck Varga singing as the sex executioner.

274
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,560
I performed his marriage a long time ago.

275
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:48,640
The song There's a Feller Down in Texas was sung by the great...

276
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,960
Ninslow at a divival in, I think, Portland and possibly Seattle.

277
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,840
A long time ago.

278
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,480
Wow.

279
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:05,140
And ZZ Top did my theme song there, Me So Stupid.

280
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,680
Although Weird Al did a great stupid song called Dare to Be Stupid.

281
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,600
That's more Devo than Devo.

282
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,240
And so, yes, dear friends.

283
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:25,700
It's been a, for us, for the last two weeks, Princess Wee and I, it's been a world of motels.

284
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,340
They had to have handicap access.

285
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,980
Hey, I wonder, I see the phone doing something weird.

286
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,300
Hello?

287
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,640
Hello?

288
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,100
Oh, it's Dave.

289
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:35,940
You know what, Dave?

290
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,900
It's a good thing that I was sort of on the ball because the blinky light wasn't working.

291
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,920
A different light was all blinky.

292
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,540
Yeah.

293
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,220
I was staring for the blinky light.

294
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,140
I was staring for the blinky light, but I never saw the Dave blinky light.

295
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,820
No, I saw the phone line over there and it made a noise.

296
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,840
Anyway, Dave, welcome to the handicap access room at Motel 6.

297
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,640
What happened now?

298
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,280
We left the lights on for you.

299
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,920
And the Wi-Fi was really, really bad.

300
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,400
And if anybody didn't get an email from us, that's why.

301
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,520
We tried to email you to let you know the Wi-Fi was pointless.

302
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,260
I thought you...

303
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,760
Yeah.

304
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,220
I thought you were talking about the new boatload of baboons you got coming in this

305
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,480
week.

306
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,320
But that was it.

307
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:23,960
Pretty much.

308
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,980
It was Route 66, wasn't it?

309
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:32,760
It was chimpanzees, actually, that we were expecting, but they were supposed to be gelded

310
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,320
or fixed and none of them were.

311
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:43,960
I needed a chimpanzee who did not have his equipment because basically I needed a helper.

312
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,620
I needed somebody to do some of the work that I've been doing for...

313
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:46,740
Yeah.

314
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,660
For years.

315
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:53,180
And a castrated chimpanzee, I was thinking, well, that would be relatively cheap.

316
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:53,540
Oh, yeah.

317
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,500
You needed a yes chimp.

318
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:54,960
Yeah.

319
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,520
Right.

320
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,100
Exactly.

321
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,580
Yeah.

322
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,320
A yes chimp.

323
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
You know, because...

324
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,420
Yeah.

325
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,660
I was just going to ask you, have you ever had your armpit hairs tied and twisted by

326
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,400
a tired chimpanzee?

327
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,380
Wait.

328
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,660
A retired chimpanzee?

329
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,420
Have your armpit hair braided by a tired chimpanzee?

330
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,560
That sounds painful.

331
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,720
I don't know.

332
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:16,720


333
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:16,720


334
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:16,720


335
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:16,720


336
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:16,720


337
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:16,720


338
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,200
Yeah.

339
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,320
Because they're not really very careful and there's a lot of mistakes.

340
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:29,980
I actually have my armpit hairs braided every morning by a beautiful spice princess.

341
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,520
Well, I do too.

342
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,300
So what do you think about that?

343
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,300
I think you're lying.

344
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,820
No, no.

345
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,660
She does these little aqua colored dreadlock things and she does like pink.

346
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,960
It comes right after and it goes into kind of like a soft beige color and then it comes

347
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
out pink again.

348
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,340
That sounds rather uncomfortable under your arms, Dave.

349
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,760
It sounds very uncomfortable to me.

350
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,060
Yes, very uncomfortable.

351
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,540
I don't know what is wrong with you, Dave.

352
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,520
You need to put your armpits...

353
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,740
Your talking is very funny.

354
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,920
Put your armpits back, pits back in bowl.

355
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,820
Back in bowl.

356
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,500
Don't start slapping chapatis my way or I will slap them right back at you.

357
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,060
We can't stop talking like an Indian boy.

358
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:14,080
An idiot orphan Indian boy because when we were on the road we listened to the book Q

359
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,000
and A by...

360
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,400
I don't know.

361
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:15,460
I don't know.

362
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:15,460


363
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:15,520


364
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:15,520


365
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:15,520


366
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:15,520


367
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:15,520


368
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:15,520


369
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:15,520


370
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:15,520


371
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Philkas Swaroop.

372
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,340
I think it's Swaroop.

373
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,200
Swaroop.

374
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,000
Swaroop.

375
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,180
Swaroop.

376
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,240
Swaroop.

377
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,240


378
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,440
I can swallow syrup.

379
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:32,360
He wrote this book called Q and A which they made a movie of very differently with the

380
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:38,280
title of Slumdog Millionaire but the book is much better and deeper than the movie and

381
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,380
lasts for 10 hours instead of an hour and a half and because we've been listening to

382
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:43,760
that...

383
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,940
Audio book on...

384
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:45,940


385
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:54,780
tape on cd we can't stop talking like this see that's beyond the phenomena called called

386
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,320
echolalia where somebody will say something to you in a real heavy accent or something you'll

387
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,740
repeat it and they're like oh you're making fun of me but like making fun most children do this

388
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:10,380
without feeling any guilt or making fun of anybody it's called echolalia yeah you guys had what you

389
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:19,020
guys had what you guys had what we do yes way beyond that way beyond it's called chameleon alia

390
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:26,860
yeah no we we had it's true princess we and i both have chameleon alia if we're exposed to a certain

391
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:35,040
accent for very long we start involuntarily using that accent which can be embarrassing very yes

392
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,340
that's what i was saying but but you went beyond this this echolalia or whatever you guys were

393
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,940
calling it which i think is the real term or slightly different but the same term but what

394
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:53,340
you guys are still programming session it was lalala where you laugh out loud at every single

395
00:21:53,340 --> 00:22:00,980
thing anybody says lalala and you end every sentence with the word lol and you begin every

396
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:08,920
controversial statement with the word lol and then when people read it they go oh it's just a

397
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,640
joke lalala

398
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,660
And then you put L-M-A-O after everything that you thought was exceptionally stupid.

399
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:23,960
Right. Or I forget the initials for this one, but blowing milk out of my nose laughing.

400
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:30,340
B-M-O-M-N-L.

401
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:31,360
Yeah.

402
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,220
Right. That was one I invented myself.

403
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,880
And now everybody's saying it, spraying it, laying it.

404
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,660
Yeah.

405
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,660
Everybody's doing it.

406
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,080
Yeah.

407
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,620
Everybody's doing it, picking it and chewing it.

408
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,780
Pick a booger. Pick a booger.

409
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,640
We may play that song. I have that queued up.

410
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:55,560
I could play the Rudy Schwartz project doing the Swingin' Love Corpses hit, Pick a Booger.

411
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,120
Can you believe that?

412
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,460
Was that off the Booker 9000 album?

413
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:07,360
No, it was off of one of Rudy's recent projects with Waldo, the little handbook.

414
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,420
Oh, that's on Sebastian.

415
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,440
Yeah.

416
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,220
Have you had your sebaceous glands re-oiled lately or just scrubbed?

417
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,520
I have, yes. I have to all the time.

418
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:22,860
You could play Rudy Schwartz until the cows came home and never smell a single waft of cheese.

419
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,840
You'd be as sluggedly as the dead folks are in the bone orchard.

420
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,200
You'd just be, you know, you...

421
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,880
The bone orchard. That reminds me of a cool place we saw called the Boneyard.

422
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,120
Yeah.

423
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,520
Yeah.

424
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,100
We haven't taken the tour yet, but we know how to take the tour.

425
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,240
The Boneyard is a thing that you see when you drive into Tucson, Arizona, and you think,

426
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,240
why, that's a very busy airport.

427
00:23:52,420 --> 00:24:01,660
It appears, I can't, I must be hallucinating, but it appears to be 4,000 planes of every

428
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:07,880
imaginable kind all lined up in rows in a city-sized Boneyard.

429
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
It's the Boneyard of dead planes.

430
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,320
I mean, yes.

431
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,680
And it is. It's the junkyard of jet planes and fighter jets, passenger planes, everything.

432
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:29,400
And it will give you tuberculosis, as you have seen here, this recording of Lonesome Cowboy Dave on his lifebed.

433
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,680
Yes, yes.

434
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,180
God, that's scary.

435
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:32,920
Yeah.

436
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,540
So...

437
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,520
Yeah, but that was my next-door neighbor, so just don't...

438
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,500
Just don't.

439
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:45,040
You know, continue away, Montsour, because it was a rather brilliant story in a stupid way.

440
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,140
Hey, you know who cured that? It's Bag Bomb.

441
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,540
Oh, yeah. I was just wondering about that.

442
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,260
Bag Bomb.

443
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,860
That is weird. We are on the same wavelength entirely.

444
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,820
I don't need...

445
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:00,600
We could just, like, call each other's site on the hot phone, and it would broadcast everywhere,

446
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,700
because I was thinking about Bag Bomb tonight before I called.

447
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,160
Wow.

448
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,720
What makes this happen?

449
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,760
It's so cosmic.

450
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:06,940
It's so cosmic.

451
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,480
It's so cosmic.

452
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,460
It's so cosmic.

453
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,460


454
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,460


455
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,460


456
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,460


457
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,460


458
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,460


459
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,460


460
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,460


461
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,460


462
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,960
I bought it in my own testicular area, but I thought it would be too annoying for radio

463
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,280
television.

464
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:13,900
Oh, the itchy death.

465
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,940
Susie the Flusie.

466
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,380
Susie makes that happen.

467
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,780
Reverend Susie the Flusie makes that happen, Dave.

468
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,480
The itch and the Bag Bomb.

469
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,580
The itch and the cure both come...

470
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,460
From Susie.

471
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,740
From that bad, bad girl.

472
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,500
Now, Dave, how's the weather been?

473
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,120
It's ugly.

474
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,960
We had to...

475
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,540
We had...

476
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,140
Didn't we both end up having to drive through it last Sunday?

477
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,380
Yes.

478
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:48,680
I was in a very small area of northeastern Ohio that happened to have a river going through

479
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,720
it, and you were stuck out in the middle of mountainous Kentucky.

480
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,420
Oh, my asses!

481
00:25:54,020 --> 00:26:03,060
I was on Interstate 71, which had been reduced to two very thin lines of gray on an endless

482
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,520
field of white, where most people were driving about 35 miles an hour.

483
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:07,520


484
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,320
Clenched and sphincter-tightened all the way.

485
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,800
I couldn't watch, Dave.

486
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,900
I had to look out the side at the pretty trees on the side.

487
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,280
I couldn't look...

488
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,980
If I looked straight ahead, I would go...

489
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,740
Every few seconds, which made Reverend Stang get very cranked up.

490
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,820
That van smelled like a bathroom by the time we got home.

491
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,060
I hear you.

492
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,280
Anyway, it's been a world of interstate highways and truck stop taquitos and...

493
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,200
And gas prices.

494
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:46,940
The lowest gas price we saw was $1.77 a gallon, I think, in Texas.

495
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,560
And you know what I said to that?

496
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,020
I had to say, thanks, Obama.

497
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:00,080
Because in 2012, the gas prices were $4.75 a gallon in the same place.

498
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,440
So, obviously, we have the evolution.

499
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,400
And, yes, and plus, on top of all of that, we have the coolest...

500
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,360
The coolest mom in the universe who hung tough throughout the whole thing.

501
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:10,860
That's right.

502
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,400
This was not a subgenius visiting trip.

503
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,720
This was a family trip.

504
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,180
And we were toting an 85-year-old queen mom with us.

505
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,380
And I wheeled her through Carlsbad Caverns.

506
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,440
It was a dream come true for me.

507
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,420
We toted a wheelchair with us just so we could tote her through the cave.

508
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,900
She doesn't normally use a wheelchair, but in Carlsbad Caverns...

509
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,000
She wouldn't?

510
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,520
She wouldn't.

511
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,500
She allowed us to.

512
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,780
She allowed us to wheel her through Carlsbad Caverns.

513
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,200
And I never heard the word wow so much.

514
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,640
Spoken so genuinely.

515
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:56,800
We went to Stangsville, Texas, and saw the Stang family.

516
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,300
And we saw The Thing in Arizona on I-10.

517
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,060
I'm sure all of our listeners know about The Thing.

518
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,680
How could you live without it?

519
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,780
Yeah.

520
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,480
Especially if you've got the Heimerich Historium manual to go with it.

521
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,280
Because that third scene, or not third scene, but maybe the same as the third act in screenwriting.

522
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,260
What do you call that?

523
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,960
Wheel to reel or something?

524
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:20,480
Baconate.

525
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:33,300
Well, Dave, I'm going to play a thing that was another audio book we listened to.

526
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,300
We listened to Princess Weepick, the weirdest stuff.

527
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,460
For us to hear.

528
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:43,340
She got John Waters' book, or John Waters reading his book, Car Sick.

529
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:50,440
And I'm going to play a two-minute segment from that that I thought was the funniest part of the whole book.

530
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,740
Well, do it quickly.

531
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,560
Because it's what would happen to you and me if we went hitchhiking, Dave.

532
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,500
Oh, it was the world's worst one then.

533
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

534
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,600
Well, in this book, he does tell the true story of his hitchhiking trip at the very end.

535
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,180
Yeah.

536
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


537
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


538
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


539
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


540
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


541
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


542
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


543
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


544
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


545
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


546
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


547
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


548
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


549
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


550
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


551
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


552
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


553
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


554
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


555
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:06,760


556
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:19,420
He describes fantasy best possible rides, which I can't play those on this radio station because John Waters' happy fantasies.

557
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,320
And they involved anal action with aliens and stuff.

558
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:30,060
However, I can play this section from his worst possible ride.

559
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,520
And I'm going to pot you down for two minutes.

560
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,440
And you can hopefully listen and hear this.

561
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,180
I'm going to ask Dave, okay?

562
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,840
I wanted to.

563
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:45,960
John Waters has just been kicked out of the car in the middle of nowhere by an evil woman.

564
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,480
And we pick up where he left off.

565
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,720
It's suddenly dark.

566
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,860
Cars fly by and the drivers don't even look over to consider picking me up.

567
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,440
I'm not even back on Interstate 70 yet and I'm completely exhausted.

568
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,420
Some of the scabs from my earlier injuries have now stuck painfully to the fabric of my gut.

569
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:06,840
I'm in my jeans.

570
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,860
And every movement prevents their fragile healing.

571
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,960
The moon's not even out yet.

572
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,240
It's already come to my worst nightmare.

573
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,460
I have to sleep out in the open with no clean clothes for tomorrow.

574
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,400
No phone.

575
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,260
Like a bum.

576
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,600
I climb down a slope into a sorry little cluster of trees.

577
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,140
Scenic, it's not.

578
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:32,540
I'm lucky enough to discover a discarded takeout bag filled with the spoiled leftovers from a Chinese dinner.

579
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,580
I realize I'm starving.

580
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,080
I haven't eaten all day.

581
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:43,140
I dig into the carton of soggy white rice and rip open the only plastic packet of soy sauce left and mix them together.

582
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,500
Someone's picked a few red-hot Szechuan peppers out of their Kung Pao chicken

583
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,060
and I gobble them down and try to ignore the burning in my throat.

584
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,260
I blot my tongue with a stale fortune cookie and pretend I'm full.

585
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,440
It's suddenly freezing but I try to make do.

586
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,100
I curl up in a ball and crumple up the carry-out trash and use it as a pillow.

587
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,440
Just as I'm about to doze off,

588
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,420
I realize I have to go to work.

589
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,100
I have to take a shit.

590
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,620
God, how I hate the human body.

591
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,260
I so resent that I have to defecate daily.

592
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,380
I didn't even get to think up this disgusting little act and now I have no choice.

593
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,300
Just do it, I tell myself, praying there's enough foliage around to use as toilet paper.

594
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,880
It's hard to shit outside.

595
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,240
You have to remove both your jeans and your underpants.

596
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,380
I begin.

597
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,080
Suddenly I hear a rustling nearby and then an ungodly animal noise.

598
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,400
I grope to find leaves but I can't so in a panic I use a flattened rice pad.

599
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:36,400


600
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:36,400


601
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,920
I think I'm going to die.

602
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:39,920


603
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:39,920


604
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:39,920


605
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:39,920


606
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:39,920


607
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:39,920


608
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:39,920


609
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:39,920


610
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,940
Something lunges at me and I can feel sharp teeth biting into my ass.

611
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,060
I scream but of course there's no one around to hear me.

612
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,060
I grab at the creature and still with no pants on rolling around battling for my life.

613
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:58,480
For a split second I see the face of a raccoon and it's got some kind of hideous yellowish foam around its mouth.

614
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,860
Adrenaline pumps through my system.

615
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,640
I grab the wild animal and with both hands begin to strangle it.

616
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,300
The raccoon struggles back.

617
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,100
Biting my hand, spewing ravid saliva all over my face.

618
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,980
But once I get it by the throat and start squeezing, I can feel victory could be mine.

619
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:23,600
I choke even harder and finally the diseased creature lets out a terrible sounding death rattle before going limp in my bloody hands.

620
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,760
I struggle to put on my pants and run up to the highway and begin waving my hands to oncoming traffic.

621
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,960
Much as Marilyn Burns did at the end of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

622
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,520
And that was John Waters, carsick.

623
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,940
Like I said, that was what would happen to us if we hitchhiked.

624
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,440
Yeah, we'd be bit by rabid animals and I suppose I would be one of the rabid animals.

625
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:57,700
But I would just like to remind you, John Waters in person here, that read so loosely these artifact pictures,

626
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:04,320
that even when you're inside, you still have to remove both your pants and your underpants.

627
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,540
I know.

628
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,320
I'm sending the message that it's cold outside.

629
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,520
But, um, I'm sorry.

630
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,100
It's all right, Dave.

631
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,380
It's okay.

632
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,820
Everything's okay.

633
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,100
Sure it is.

634
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,040
We found some housing for you.

635
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,100
You did?

636
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:22,580
Yeah.

637
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,020
In the bubbles in the domed city?

638
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,220
Well, no, not in the domed city.

639
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,360
Not in the rich people's city.

640
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,140
Not in the Great Cathedral.

641
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:32,900
I'm sorry.

642
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,860
I'm sorry.

643
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,880
We were shopping for a...

644
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,580
a suitable place, a new place to move the subgenius headquarters.

645
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,800
Someplace cheaper.

646
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:48,740
We were in California and we were in probably the cheapest land in California.

647
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,400
The Salton...

648
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:50,640
Oh, yeah.

649
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,280
The Salton Sea, which we finally got to visit.

650
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:01,580
If listeners, if you're not familiar with the Salton Sea in California, Google it and look at some of the pictures.

651
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,840
It's a land of ruins and rotted...

652
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,620
rotted fish.

653
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:14,220
It is a sea, an inland sea created by accident where there shouldn't be an ocean.

654
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:19,340
And it's the saltiest, saltiest and most toxic.

655
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,140
And yet beautiful.

656
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,240
It's so lovely looking.

657
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:33,100
If you wore a gas mask and had 70 grand, you could have a fairly big house surrounded by meth heads and rotting trailers.

658
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,440
And buildings sinking.

659
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,600
And the muck.

660
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,120
And the smell of rotten...

661
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,800
rotten everything.

662
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,620
But it's...

663
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,160
It's...

664
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,380
It's like 120 degrees for all summer long.

665
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,320
It's the lowest, second lowest place in the country next to Death Valley.

666
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,940
That's about the same temperature.

667
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,380
It's unthinkably hot.

668
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,640
And it's affordable, Dave.

669
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:03,160
So we're going to be sending you to the Salton Sea.

670
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,760
We'll pay for your long distance phone calls to the show.

671
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,680
And we'll be joining you there soon with the new Cult Headquarter equipment.

672
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,000
At this point in time, I would probably take you up on that offer.

673
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,620
Because as every turn home from work, I open the door and only open partially.

674
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,600
And it's like, what the hell's going on?

675
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,160
Things must have got worse with my leaking stuff.

676
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,620
Well, a bunch of tiles...

677
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:35,160
of tiles fell on the floor from the leak and blocked my entry until I had to clean it out.

678
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:35,700
And they're all...

679
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,100
They're all mushy.

680
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:36,820
Oh, my.

681
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:43,020
Tiles were washed down the stairs from your bathroom and piled up against your front door?

682
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,960
That's terrible.

683
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

684
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,440
I bet it smelled terrible, too.

685
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,420
Well, of course it smelled terrible.

686
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:54,320
Well, we've had accidents all day today, I guess.

687
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:54,740
Hmm.

688
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,620
No excuse.

689
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,000
Half your house fell off, didn't it?

690
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:58,880
What?

691
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,300
Half of your house fell off, didn't it?

692
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,260
Well, just...

693
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,160
No, no.

694
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,800
More like a fifth of the house.

695
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:11,740
A 20-foot-long gutter fell off of the Slacker Mansion roof this morning.

696
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,000
Woke us up with rather loud car wreck sound.

697
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:15,920
Yes.

698
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,180
It was...

699
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,180
Oh, and the other thing, Dave, this is important.

700
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:22,660
Oh, sure.

701
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,400
When...

702
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,480
As I say, this...

703
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,820
This wasn't exactly a subgenius trip.

704
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:35,140
Although we did stay one night with Reverend Samantha from the Mutant Mountain Boys.

705
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:35,500
Yeah.

706
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,060
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

707
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,000
And...

708
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,820
But we...

709
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,520
Mainly, we...

710
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,580
The reason we drove all the way across the country was mainly to see our grandchild...

711
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,660
To get away from me.

712
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,200
Not...

713
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,300
Yeah, to get away from you.

714
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,240
To get away from Dr. Sinister.

715
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,460
To...

716
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,540
To...

717
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,220
And...

718
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,680
And to see our grandkids and my father's hound dog.

719
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,440
And I'm going to play you the only recordings that we made for two months.

720
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,620
See, it's been hours.

721
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,620
Slack reruns for two months.

722
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,840
And we didn't really work very hard on the show while we were gone.

723
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,240
But I'm going to play the only recordings we made, okay?

724
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:20,220
One is 15 seconds of my grandson's doctor band.

725
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,660
I wanted to hear that, too.

726
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,520
I'm sorry.

727
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,060
And then you'll...

728
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:31,420
We'll be listening to Pappy's old hound dog, Dammit, and his encounter with some coyotes.

729
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,400
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell.

730
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,280
Chicken!

731
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,140
Jingle bell, pig!

732
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,200
And jingle bell, cow!

733
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,420
That's a jingle bell, chicken!

734
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,920
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

735
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,440
Yes, that is Dammit.

736
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,540
The hound dog doing a concert with some coyotes.

737
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
I guess they must be.

738
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,320
Late at night.

739
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,660
But right outside our bedroom window.

740
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,260
Right outside the window.

741
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,040
Wow.

742
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,480
So lovely.

743
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:26,440
It sounds like the fuzzy little egg people returned to the backyard there in Texas

744
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,360
and just kind of like squatted and took up their own cause to live

745
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,600
and named their own country Texas Minor or something like that.

746
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:36,740
Wow.

747
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,260
I never heard that little tremble in his voice before.

748
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,340
I think that was anger.

749
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,920
No, that's when he's doing the subgenius salute.

750
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:50,740
That's his way of going .

751
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,820
I think maybe that's where it originated.

752
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,400
Well, that is certain.

753
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,100
Oh.

754
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,680
Gee, now I can hear the coyotes.

755
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,680
They sound like a bunch of little coyotes.

756
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:05,680


757
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,780
They're like the little coyotes of like Spanish ladies with real high haircuts and stuff like that.

758
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,320
That's what I thought it was at first.

759
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,100
I thought, wow, how come these old Spanish ladies are invading Pappy's backyard?

760
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,300
They're looking for Pappy.

761
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,320
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

762
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,680
That's truer than you know, actually.

763
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,740
I don't want to go into any terrible disgusting details, but that's truer than you know.

764
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,700
Yes, sir.

765
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,580
Well, pretty sure we'll all be disgusting, I suppose.

766
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,440
Just because we still...

767
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,660
Well, I'm not sure.

768
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,060
I think they're opposite sex or something.

769
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,540
Or, you know, the opposite.

770
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,660
Well, it sure turned us on listening to that yodeling out there.

771
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,340
Oh, wait.

772
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:47,820
That's...

773
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,400
I keep turning the wrong thing down.

774
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,880
I thought I was turning down the coyotes, but I was turning down the Dave.

775
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,820
That is some of the weirdest animal noise I've heard in many, many, many, many times.

776
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Um, that's...

777
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:01,840
At least.

778
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,560
Uh, yeah, that's the dog, Dammit.

779
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,760
Not to be confused with Chicken John's dog, Dammit the Wonder Dog.

780
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:16,480
Well, he was having like a song contest with those coyotes.

781
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:16,980
Yeah.

782
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,420
Yes.

783
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:24,160
And he was like, you know, like, oh, you went, I'll go, and all that stuff like that.

784
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:31,680
And then I started thinking, well, if that's what it's like to have a heart attack with a straw stuck up your nose, that's my idea of a...

785
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,000
courtship.

786
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,140
That's romantic.

787
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,120
That's so romantic.

788
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,620
It is.

789
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,140
That's as romantic as a Waffle House.

790
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:56,000
Did you ever notice that when you were real young and you wanted to impress a chick, you could stick like a bobby pin, not a bobby pin, but a safety pin through your earlobe and smile at her and stuff like that?

791
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:57,700
And...

792
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:57,940
And...

793
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

794
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:01,660
I don't know what you're talking about.

795
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,700
Man, that sounds really painful.

796
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,700
Pull yourself together, man.

797
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,620
I'm pulled together.

798
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,600
How are you?

799
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,760
I'm fine, thank you.

800
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,660
I'm an American and proud to be one, too.

801
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,500
Look into the looking glass.

802
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,480
What does it say?

803
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,240
What does it see?

804
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:27,880
What is it?

805
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,100
What?

806
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,680
It's a big, white baboon.

807
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,460
America.

808
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,780
No, a mandrill.

809
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,420
That's what it is.

810
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,160
It's a mandrill, because those are the ones with the pink posteriors.

811
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,580
I get them confused.

812
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,160
Because mandrills are like blue and stuff and very colorful.

813
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,860
Are you saying the USA is a mandrill, a monkey butt?

814
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,160
Yes.

815
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,960
Is that what you're saying?

816
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,920
Yeah, well, did it take a long time?

817
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,380
Yeah, sure, of course.

818
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,620
You did go see American Sniper, didn't you?

819
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,720
Because if you don't go see that, then you're not American.

820
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:06,020
Also, you have to go see that movie, The Interview, so you can prove your hate.

821
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,140
See, that's the important thing.

822
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,320
The important thing is to let everybody know how angry you are.

823
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:16,780
It's even better if you go see the American Sniper and go see The Interview, and then

824
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:22,260
you have an empty chair sitting next to you, and then you try and grill the empty chair

825
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,360
next to you if you really want to say that you enjoy American Sniper.

826
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,820
Thanks a lot, Mr. Obabo.

827
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,100
Are there lots of people sleeping under the seats?

828
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,360
I'm wondering, you know, because I heard some of that movie was pretty violent.

829
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,980
Like the guy went around shooting stuff or something like that.

830
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,380
What actually happened?

831
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,220
Whoever heard of violence happening was Snoppers.

832
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:44,940
I don't get that.

833
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,080
Snoppers.

834
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,540
Snoppers, they never did nothing violent.

835
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,420
That sounds like it should be Stange Dog's name, Snappers.

836
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:55,680
Snoppers.

837
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,340
Snoppers.

838
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,460
That's right.

839
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:57,940


840
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,820
They've got something.

841
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,880
Maybe you even speak English.

842
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,460
You even speak English, man.

843
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,440
You're saying Sniper.

844
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,420
I'm saying Snapper.

845
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,620
David, I bet you've never been on a sniper hunt.

846
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,300
You ever been on a sniper hunt?

847
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:16,720
You can stand out in the woods with a big sack for about five hours while the rest of

848
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,300
us beat the bush and make the snipers run into your big sack.

849
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,740
Why don't you stand out in the woods with this big sack here?

850
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,340
That is the most wild, disgusting thing.

851
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:26,340


852
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:30,940
totally rancorous thing I've ever heard in my life.

853
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,200
What gives you the right or the why?

854
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,420
Why?

855
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,320
Why would you say such a thing to me?

856
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,180
Well, isn't that the question the audience is asking itself right now?

857
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,460
I've never been a snow punt or whatever they're called in my life.

858
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,180
You mean, was I ever fooled by all the other kids and sodomized

859
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,040
and made you run up and down the hill?

860
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,140
Well, Dave, you were kind of asking for it back in those days,

861
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,720
being such a sissy, a sissy boy.

862
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,360
The rest of us couldn't help but pick on you.

863
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,240
It was just, you know, it just felt right.

864
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,960
Yes, but it was the sloping forehead, I got it for him.

865
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,740
Yeah, 33 degree angle head.

866
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:23,940
High mast, there were all kinds of things to be done with this slope.

867
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,360
Being at 33 degree angle forehead.

868
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,120
And they were quite right.

869
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,340
In many ways, things have gotten much worse.

870
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,700
And they always will.

871
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,360
Thank you.

872
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,960
And thank you, lonesome cowboy Dave.

873
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,540
And thank you, Reverend Ivan Stang, for this wonderful, wonderful evening.

874
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,360
And I hope things turn out for you and little missus when it comes to that big,

875
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,140
you know what, tomorrow night at 6.30 at the, is it the, is it the Red Ridge?

876
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:58,240
The playhouse, the playhouse in downtown.

877
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,900
And we're going to go to that playhouse right now

878
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:07,180
and listen to this great little ditty called Pick a Booger,

879
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,420
originally done by the Swinging Love Corpses,

880
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:14,240
this performance done by the great Rudy Schwartz Project.

881
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,420
Stay tuned.

882
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,840
And we'll be right back after this brief song.

883
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,080
Thank you.

884
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,680
Come on.

885
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,700
Everybody put your finger in your nose.

886
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,640
Pick a booger out and wipe it on your clothes.

887
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,120
Slide.

888
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,640
Don't know how you feel one way or the other

889
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,520
Pick a booger out and wipe it on your brother

890
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,600
Pick a booger, pick a booger

891
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:16,060
Pick a booger, pick a booger

892
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,240
So you're driving in your car and you're looking at your neighbor

893
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,180
Minding nuggets from his nostril like he's savoring the labor

894
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:42,000
He's pulling, he's tugging, he's yanking on a string

895
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,060
It's a long slimy thing still connected to his brain

896
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,980
Pick a booger, pick a booger

897
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,300
Pick a booger, pick a booger

898
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:52,560
Pick a booger, pick a booger

899
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,600
Pick a booger, pick a booger

900
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:08,860
Pick a booger

901
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:52,740
Pick a booger, pick a booger

902
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,580
Pick a booger, pick a booger

903
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:53,580


904
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:53,580


905
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:53,580


906
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,980
Pick a booger is a royal high notes

907
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,820
The kids all wanna have it in crustaceans

908
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,380
Because the Pick a Booger Boogie is a new sensation

909
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,580
He holds it, he rolls it, he's checking it for hairs.

910
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,360
He flicks it away, but he's looking debonair.

911
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,460
A green one on his finger, he's been flicking it for days.

912
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,480
Pick a booger boogie, it's the new dance craze.

913
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,260
Pick a booger, pick a booger.

914
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,860
Pick a booger, pick a booger.

915
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,060
Pick a booger, pick a booger.

916
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,140
Yes, Drift Dance like...

917
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,420
Sending your sinuses to Arizona.

918
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:42,940
Oh yes.

919
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:44,520
Dave?

920
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,640
Yes, I wondered what happened.

921
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:53,440
I was going to say that extraordinary feet demand extraordinary toes.

922
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:59,720
Well, you know, while the listeners and you were listening to that...

923
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:07,220
song, Dr. Sinister and Princess Wee and I were listening to your tuberculosis.

924
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:15,200
And we could hear you, your breathing on the phone, really loud over these speakers.

925
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,640
The way this thing is set up, when I fade you down on the air, it causes you to fade up in the studio.

926
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,360
It's strange.

927
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:28,640
So we got to listen to your hacking and tubercular coughing and your picking.

928
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:30,720
And you're picking?

929
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:31,640
And you're puking.

930
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,060
You're picking and puking.

931
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,880
Hey, you know, it's funny.

932
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,100
Somebody's been...

933
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,600
We've seen photographs...

934
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,300
That's the best reception this phone has ever had.

935
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:45,420
Because when I tried to vomit on my knee, I removed the phone from my ear and covered

936
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,500
up my hand.

937
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:53,020
And so I find it hard to believe it, unless I'm hyperventilating and I don't even know

938
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:53,200
it.

939
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:59,980
Well, Dave, maybe you can explain these photographs we've been seeing of graffiti in

940
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:00,360
joints.

941
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:00,360


942
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:00,360


943
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:00,360


944
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:00,360


945
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,740
So, I'm going to show you a picture of a pen where people hand paint or hand write

946
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:10,760
or use printed stickers with the phrase, Stang pukes you.

947
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:18,140
Now, either there's a weird subgenius out there who thinks that that's sort of like

948
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,360
saying Bob loves you, but it's Stang pukes you.

949
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:28,820
Or there's some kind of Mustang haters or lovers or something.

950
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,940
It's very mysterious.

951
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,140
It was like all your base are belong to us.

952
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,460
But it made less sense.

953
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,120
But it made even less sense.

954
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:44,280
And we started seeing all your base are belong to us in Amsterdam before we started seeing

955
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:44,780
it here.

956
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:51,620
And so maybe, who knows, maybe Stang pukes you will be the next big meme for one minute

957
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,080
or two.

958
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:52,640
Who knows?

959
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,280
Stranger things have happened.

960
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:55,680
Yep.

961
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,920
You certainly got maybe like 45 minutes going over the last 20 years.

962
00:50:59,920 --> 00:50:59,920


963
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,040
30, 40 years.

964
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:07,380
I mean, or at least three hours of staying in solid airtime.

965
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:07,940
No, I'm sorry.

966
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:12,800
I didn't mean to pull your armpit hairs because you were making fun of my breathing.

967
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:19,300
Well, it's pretty funny listening to a guy croak right on the air like that.

968
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,720
Let's see, if Dave actually croaks, that won't be funny.

969
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,740
But as long as you stay alive, that'll be sort of funny.

970
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,320
Well, can you still hear it?

971
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,920
I know this is not the...

972
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,080
No.

973
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:34,780
No, because we have the tuberculosis filter on now.

974
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,680
We don't hear it.

975
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:36,780
Yeah.

976
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:39,860
Don't you wish you had had one when you caught that disease?

977
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:45,440
Back when I first started smoking cigarettes 42 and a half years ago.

978
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,720
Poor old feller.

979
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,420
Poor old feller.

980
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,380
You know, it's peaceful out here in the wilderness.

981
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,400
You can hear the coyotes in the background.

982
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,900
And make up your own mind.

983
00:51:59,900 --> 00:51:59,900


984
00:51:59,900 --> 00:51:59,900


985
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:04,760
We're all listening to our own songs, much the way Rick Freckles did, or does.

986
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:10,720
But at the same time, we lose kind of track of what's really going on around us.

987
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:16,680
The things falling from the sky, crushing old ladies, hopefully, as many as...

988
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,680
Never mind.

989
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:24,680
And just coming up the atmosphere, we look at the, for instance, the chemical trails

990
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,460
that the aardvarks are leading to mark their territory.

991
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,880
Those chemtrails, Coyotes.

992
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:36,000
Malino, you make that sound like a lot of mistakes.

993
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,340
Maybe you should do something on every other device.

994
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,820
How much is an aero pack, and doesn't it cause autism?

995
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,060
Now, a marine thunderstorm now is

996
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:47,620
still unable to Douglas offers a first-time

997
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,000
human condition.

998
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,780
Aye, aye, aye.

999
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,000
You're right.

1000
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,000


1001
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,220
Tracking keer Beit?

1002
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:59,860
A Check-Example of theушки in the Department of Astrophysics.

1003
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,320
my memory of the weather, it's gotten

1004
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,760
really, really, really, really

1005
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,300
weird.

1006
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,660
Well, the weather's gotten

1007
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,660
weird and the human

1008
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,600
race has gotten weird

1009
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,260
and

1010
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,800
that's all good, right? Weird is cool, right?

1011
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,600
Weird is always cool. We're like,

1012
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,620
this is the Church of the Weirdos. That's Princess

1013
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,520
We Are Doe right in the room here with me.

1014
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,400
She's Princess of the Weirdos. Princess

1015
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,640
We Are Doe. Get it? It sounds like

1016
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,980
weirdo. A lot of people didn't know that.

1017
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,040
They call her Princess Way.

1018
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,460
That's how you can tell who hasn't ever listened

1019
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,880
to the Hour of Slack, even once.

1020
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,340
Somebody thought it was like Finch Way

1021
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,060
or something, like one of the arguments

1022
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,680
they used to use in the old Taoist,

1023
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,680
I'm sorry, scriptures

1024
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,420
like, is there a standing monkey

1025
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,900
pose or something like that?

1026
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,020
The standing monkey pose.

1027
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:49,920
Yeah, that was the way.

1028
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,820
The woo way.

1029
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,220
Woo way.

1030
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:53,960
The woo way.

1031
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,340
We say woo wee.

1032
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,820
I'm saying woo.

1033
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,480
That proves you're not really,

1034
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,280
you know, you think you're in the know,

1035
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,720
but you're not really in the know.

1036
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:05,120
If you say Princess Way...

1037
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,940
You can call yourself

1038
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,560
an aardvark again

1039
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,360
too many times in one paragraph

1040
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,680
if you ask me and stuff,

1041
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,020
and ask her why she didn't do it anyway.

1042
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,180
You know.

1043
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:18,980
Well.

1044
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,180
Well, well.

1045
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,460
You don't know.

1046
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,000
That's the problem.

1047
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,820
You don't know why she did.

1048
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,500
Because the thing was,

1049
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,840
you could have gone francophile.

1050
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,740
Am I right?

1051
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,880
You could have gone all francophile

1052
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,020
and called yourself OUI.

1053
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,040
And then, you know,

1054
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,560
you could talk about

1055
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,040
the gospel.

1056
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,600
Yes, yes.

1057
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,660
No, no.

1058
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:48,920
And then you could

1059
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,960
say Aga Princess None.

1060
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,080
Ah, yes.

1061
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,060
Friends.

1062
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,300
God, God.

1063
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,580
Coming down near the end

1064
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:00,800
of the horrible show.

1065
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,820
In fact...

1066
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,680
No storm, no trees.

1067
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,720
We're going to...

1068
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,660
Ah, peppers.

1069
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,260
I'm crazy.

1070
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,660
I ran with my foot.

1071
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,020
We're going to play a protest song.

1072
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,980
Not by Dave.

1073
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,620
The president's on the phone

1074
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,500
being just about the only protest song

1075
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,380
that's been performed in the United States

1076
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:24,920
in years.

1077
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,060
Not to mention,

1078
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:27,540
by the way, I just,

1079
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,220
got in here right now.

1080
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,920
The president's on the phone.

1081
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:31,500
Great song.

1082
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,120
And I've heard a couple

1083
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,160
different versions of it.

1084
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,060
There was the president's

1085
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,340
on the phone talking about liberty,

1086
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,460
but he's watching you and me.

1087
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,480
There was also the president's

1088
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:38,920
on the phone.

1089
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,440
You did a couple different versions

1090
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,260
of that song, Dave.

1091
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:43,760
There was also,

1092
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,240
when they blow up your car

1093
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,080
in downtown Kandahar,

1094
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,760
that's my war ray.

1095
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,080
How could you remember that?

1096
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,880
Because it was a work of genius.

1097
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:57,940
And nobody who ever,

1098
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:58,800
hears that kind of thing

1099
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,700
can ever forget it.

1100
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,940
It's on YouTube, friends.

1101
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,960
Type in the president's on the phone.

1102
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:03,920
I never saw it on YouTube.

1103
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,960
There's a very nice little music video

1104
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,820
using graphics by Lee Murr

1105
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:10,860
and Embaucher

1106
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,280
and all those great old-timey subgenius artists.

1107
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,740
And it's got Dave

1108
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:16,700
from the Beachland Ballroom recording,

1109
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:17,180
I believe.

1110
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,080
You can also say

1111
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,060
when they blow up your car

1112
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,260
in the province and bar.

1113
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,280
Right.

1114
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:23,920
But anyway,

1115
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,240
that's not the song we're about to play.

1116
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,440
The song we're about to play

1117
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,540
is Rudy Schwartz's project song

1118
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,900
called Kill for God.

1119
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,400
And people say

1120
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,780
we don't make fun of the Mohammedans enough.

1121
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:36,600
Did you scrub that track?

1122
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,360
Because I think there's an F-bomb

1123
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,120
or two in that song.

1124
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,220
I did scrub this track.

1125
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,700
So you have the radio edit.

1126
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,260
Yes, this is the radio edit.

1127
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,520
And Dave,

1128
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,800
we'll see you next week.

1129
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:49,920
I'm going to leave you listening

1130
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,160
so we can hear your wheezing

1131
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,620
as we end this horrible show

1132
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,420
here at...

1133
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,880
subgenius.com

1134
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,480
Okay, I'll talk to you

1135
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,620
soon about Targis.

1136
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,100
Bye.

1137
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:04,640
Bye.

1138
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:05,900
Bye.

1139
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:09,260
Bye.

1140
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:09,680
Bye.

1141
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:10,960
Bye.

1142
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:11,820
Bye.

1143
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,300
Bye.

1144
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,220
Bye.

1145
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:14,540
Bye.

1146
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,400
Bye.

1147
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,280
Bye.

1148
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:40,360
Thank you.

1149
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,680
Thank you.

1150
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,900
Thank you.

1151
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,700
Thank you.

1152
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:27,820
Thank you.

1153
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,060
Thank you.

1154
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:27,780
Thank you.

1155
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,660
Thank you.

1156
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:28,980
Thank you.
