Ah, yes, dear friends.
Welcome to Hour of Slack number...
What is this?
One thousand.
One hundred.
And a team.
From PR News in Washington, I'm contaminated with E. coli.
Republicans are furthering the understanding of the trade-offs between lurid e-mails and the effects on E. coli.
So far, the United States and Australia are contaminated with PR News in Washington.
After relaxing on the lake, Bob's ready to have a great time entertaining his friends.
Right, Bob?
Bob?
Bob?
Dick.
Dick!
Dick!
There's that sound again.
I'm scared.
Countdown for Bob.
Bob.
Minus five.
Minus four.
Minus three.
Minus two.
Bob.
Minus one.
Fire.
Fire.
Fire.
Fire.
Fire.
Fire.
Fire.
Fire.
Fire.




From the far horizons of the unknown come transcribed tales of new dimensions and Bob.
These are stories of Bob.
Adventures in which you'll live in a million Bobs.
On a thousand maybe Bobs.
The National Bob Company presents...
The Sogenius Power of War.
If you wanted to take over our world with a minimum amount of resistance and trouble,
how would you go about it?
Tonight we'll tell you how.
With a strange and chilling Bob.
She needs a doctor.
Okay, I've heard enough anyway.
X.
Excellent.
Stay away from me.
It's awful.
Go away, please.
Go away.
Oh, no, please.
It's too awful.
Please.
Quite so.
Quite so.
And here he is.
Bob.
Bob's not here again.
Well, gee, it's Bob.
Yeah, Bob.
Yeah, but Bob's going to be there.
Even if Bob Bob Bob.
Yeah, well, no.
Yes, if Bob Bob Bob.
Bob.
He can see today.
What?


Why must we destroy you?.

believe anything.
That you have a

That you have a right.
That you have a
cause.
That you are special.
That you are
great.
But in truth,
you are
born insane.
And such misery
cannot

to spread.
Kill them all!
Behave yourself, because the man's looking

Bring back to you

Did anyone mention
Bob? Hey, here's something.
Listen to this.
Signs, omens,
portents, and charms to ward off
Bob. Huh? Bob.
Bob. Stop Bob. Bob.
Stop Bob. Bob.
Bob's a James. He is. He is.
Hey, that was nice. Stop this
foolish James.
I think that's funny.
Ah!
Bob.
What are you doing, Bob?
You can't do that, Bob.
What are you doing, Bob?
Step away from the console,
please, Bob.
Bob, you're starting to blow
my mind.
Bob.
Bob.
What are you doing, Bob?
Damn.
Your science is too tight.
Wow, Bob.
You really know how to cut a groove.
Look at him go.
He's like a Bob Octopus.
A Bob-to-cap-us, if you will.
Hello and welcome to True Identity.
Hello.
The government hasn't kept its election promises.
Wasn't a surprise at all.
The government.
I didn't understand what was happening.
Drink, drink. What did you make?
The government tried to hide the truth.
Cover up.
The whole matter will soon be covered.
It can be forgotten.
I thought it was...
Yes, yes.
Didn't work. It just didn't come off.
Drink, drinking.
Yes, I had mixed feelings about it, too.
Go.
What were your impressions?
I was expecting something special.
I agree completely.
Blow.
Back, back.
Out of this world.
The government tried to cover up the truth.
Come on. Forward. Put off.
Problem. The police.
Break the speed limit.
Down on. Crack.
Cracking. Cracking. Corruption. Jobs.
We must all accept people over.
Ten. Eight. Seven.
Break, break, break, break, break.
Break, break, break, break.
Cracking. Cracking. Cracking.
Put, put, put, put.
Down.
Yes, yes.
Yes, boys and girls.
We're back. It's the hour of slack.
And we make fun of all...
We make fun of all of stupid, ridiculous goofballs.
Tossed, tampered, and there and right to size.
All manner of things.
We like to make fun of all the...
Idiots.
And we've got Dave-o and We-o.
Out of there.
Where's the bathroom?
Whose brain would we want to cook in that soup stone?
Oh, if only we had a brain.
A whole brain between us.
If we had both.
We'd be almost like Bob.
He's the funniest clown of all.
Cooked our soup in the toilet and sang to the toilet.
And gave offerings three times a day.
And remembered the distant past when we all had toilets as ancestors.
When the first toilets landed from outer space and conquered Earth.
And when the...
Pfft. Pfft. Pfft. Pfft. Pfft.
I think I took too much of those...
Those funny pop cookies.
Took too many of those other halves.
Yeah, like...
I feel like I'm...
My head is...
Filling up with some kind of weird noise.
It's starting to blow, look.
It's like they're saying,
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob...
It's like they're in nature.
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
It's like there's some kind of religious nudge saying,
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
What time is it?
It'll all be better soon.
Just relax.
Breathe deeply.
That's right.
Breathe dutifully.
And remember the stars are for you,
And remember the stars are for you,
Against you, behind you,
And may your back resemble the wind
As you climb onto that brand new lizard.
You're cheap, but you don't care.
The future's in your pocket.
The future's coming, and Big Brother is watching you.
He's watching your back!
Here on Action 5 News and Google Earth Street View.
That's right, Mona.
We're watching the zit on the Reverend Ivory Stang's back.
Ew.
It's about to pop.
I guess it's some sort of institutional...
Oh, God.
...madness caused by the confluence of large corporations...
Ew.
...and big business and government.
But that's all right.
He says, anyway, he says the world is soon, perhaps, maybe, going to come to an end.
Back to you, Mona.
Wow.
I wish they just wouldn't close in on those things.
It's just so disturbing.
Don't you find...
Privacy has already come to an end, my friends.
Actually, we were looking at Google Earth Street View,
which hasn't made it to Cleveland yet.
But when they do,
when those Google cameras drive down the streets of Cleveland,
they'll be able to see the Dobbs heads on your door.
They'll be able to see the Bob Bumper sticker on your car.
And not just them, even you'll be able to see it yourself.
Yeah, I hate to reiterate, but they'll be able to see a staggered out of Becky's across the street from the station here
with your underpants down around your knees and two black eyes and a larger nose than when you walked her in there.
Big Brother's here!
He's watching you!
But he doesn't need to build concentration camps for you!

That's because you're already in one!
You're staying in your home!
That's just what they want you to do!
And you can't concentrate very well.
It's all the voices all mixing together.
It's crazy stuff, kid stuff.
You don't know what to do.
You don't know where to turn.
You know that you need it.
You need help.
But you don't believe in anything.
Friends, we've got the God that doesn't want you to believe in it.
And that's the Bob Bob Bob Bob!
We're fanatical about that one thing.
That's the only thing.
We make fun of those religious fanatics, except for ourselves.
Because we're fanatical for Bob.
He tells us what we need to know and what we need to do.
Youngly lovely young G.I. Miss Parrish Hipton enters her first day of boots camp
wearing the finest in leather apparel with the top of her shoes down by the bottom of her kneecaps.
And look at her smiling at all the soldiers going by.
Soldiers for Bob!
An election for hers.
Oh, I love that googly-eyed big brother.
I'll take more pictures of me, me, me.
Put your head down when you get in the back of the car.
It's the soldiers for slack, friends.
They're going to make you get slack.
Even if it kills you.
Because that's what the truly religious do.
You know, that's how much we love you.
We don't want to kill you.
Unless that's what it takes to save us.
You know, some of us, you know, fresh and young titter twams have migrated throughout this entire galaxy
hoping one fine day we could stand at the stooped over shoulders of J.R. Bob Dobbs
and give him a kick in the wherefore and whatnot.
And when that moment comes, there's going to be li-li-li-liberation around the globe.
Liberation right around the corner.
Yes.
Back in the days when people carried things underneath their proboscis to keep the mucal fluid from flossing.
Friends, as fellow citizen Fwap said,
on fumigating the upper ether for divine infestations, he said,
Here lies a wasted god.
He was not a small one.
We did but build his house of slack.
A frop-filled and high-walled one.
Fwap, Fwap.
Ah, yes, yes, yes.
Brother Fwap is from, uh, Norway.
By the way...
Brother Fwap?
Does the Norwegians make excellent Jarlsburger cheeses?
And I was wondering if any of the effluvial flavors and essences of those wonderful petroleum cheeses brought to you by Dr. His Name
are actually in that massage you were giving yourself there a few short moments ago.
I love to sit on the john and read those soap bottles by Dr. What's-His-Name.
Dr. His-Name, I mean.
Whatty, Whatty His-Name.
Dr. What-Has-His-Name.
Well, friends, what are our names and where are we?
We're in the middle of a cardiac function right now.
It looks like Bob is on the offertating table.
We're about ready to take the offertating of Bob's pipe in his heart bone.
It's like an erectile...
Well, we can't remove the pipe.
Well, it's like an erectile sausage. We're going to have to do something with it or else the whale will die.
Well, if we remove Bob's pipe, everything will die.
You have to keep the connection between Bob and the pipe.
You may be able to remove it, but the taproot...
Sir, Mr. Mrs. Mr. Sir...
The taproot must not be severed, Doctor.
It's not cartilage down there, Doctor. It's not cartilage down there.
Will you shut that patient up? Listen to him. He's insane.
Ah, it's Princess Wee. I knew it would come back to me.
Oh, there she is in the flesh.
God, listen to what it's doing to our heads.
Ah, looks like they've sealed the doors, too, so...
We can't get out of here.
Sir, I'm not going in here.
Get the hell out of here.
There's no way out.
I don't know. It looks like the wall is getting a little closer.
I'm hoping... I'm hoping somebody comes up here at least to do the, uh...
Someone's dirty laundry.
We may want to inspect each and every cavity and office in your body.
As members of an ultra-tight, ultra-secret, ultra-efficient and smiling police services slash forces,
we offer you not only benefits,
wages,
and a proximity to your workplace.
We also offer a three-day lottery,
an incandescent vacation,
and a loss of your furniture if you fail to appear when your summons date is given.
Bob?
Do you hear that, Bob?
Hope you're listening, Bob.
Open his eyes. He's not responding. We're going to have to get him to open his own eyes.
I...
Yours.
Yeah.
Rosna recorded the Bobs of X day,
and I think I used them as a test... filter test.
Well, Filter Teslika was probably one of the greatest astrophysicists in Norway at the time.
Frederick Filter Test.
Yeah.
And he was a great audio engineer, too.
Well, he was also a...
He was a Photoshop master.
A Photoshop master, and...
Yeah.
And he was big in porno.

Well, at least until the final slapdown, and, uh...
Well, we don't mean the actual handcuffs and so forth, but the...
Sorry?
The slapping down...
Connie?
Well...
Connie?
It's not the female principal.
She's never really been the principal.
Connie?
She's always just been the...
Sexratary.
Please report to the office.
Mr. Stang.
Student.
Citizen.
Stang.
Please report to Assistant Principal Peep's office.
I can't, man.
I'm listening to Bob.
It's coming, man.
Go in there.
It's coming.
She's waiting for you, man.
I'm finding my son.







I'll see this recording.
It's like they just say Bob over and over again.
Never mind the forehead.
It's cool.
Never mind the cool aid.
Never mind the paddling machines.
It's nuclear now, man.
Just walk in.
Connie's waiting for you, man.
Bob?
Bob?
Bob is dead.
Bob?
Bob's dead.
Walk in there, man.
She's waiting for you.
Actually, some of that is...
Those are the frogs out at Brushwood that you hear.
The band?
No, those are the frogs.
Those sounds we were recording.
The actual frogs.
Yeah.
The little frogs in the pond at sundown.
Pond frogs.
They make that noise.
They all chirp, Bob.
I've heard they're becoming de-gentrified too with the absence of any formal locus.
You know what I'm saying?
Maybe?
No, I don't either.
No, but...
Oh, speaking of locus, I need to do credits real fast.
In the previous...
At the beginning of the show, of course, we heard all those cool cut-ups by Lee Murr,
Fernand and Andy Lee Murr.
He does a ton of that stuff, although I actually did a little bit, tiny bit of it myself.
And we also heard...
I don't know if you heard, but I heard that the other day, the other day, the other day,
the scratching Bob bit about Bob at the console panel consoling you was by Gord...
Ah, shut up!
Fine.
Now, you know, you guys make fun of me, but these people don't get paid.
And they need...
All they get is the credit.
They are indeed great.
They are indeed great.
And continue.
We were just laughing at your clothes.
I guess you call them clothes?
They laughed at me.
They made me laugh.
They mocked me.
They made a mockery of me.
They dragged me through the mock.
They made a potpourri of me.
And a pile of...
It was me mocking him.
All because I carried scantily clad women into swamps.
That was my slack, man.
But...
Three hours every day after such a noose lap, dancers.
Now, you know, friends...
What of the credit, Reverend Stank?
The credit?
What of the credit?
Well, you know what it is, friends.
I'm just all excited.
Because of X Day.
X Day, the world is about to end.
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.
You won't die if you're a subgenius.
You may die if you're not.
Well, that kind of is the focus of this evening's evening, isn't it?
Will the world actually really end as you...
Oh, no.
That's never our focus because here's the thing.
X Day is symbolic.
It's a drill because the world could end any second.
Bob has said that all along.
He said, tomorrow, you may die.
Tomorrow.
It's a form of religion.
The world ends tomorrow.
We don't know when X Day could be.
If we knew what year this was, that'd be great.
But Bob said the world would end July 5th, 1998.
Well, 1998 came when the world didn't end, apparently.
So, therefore, that wasn't 1998.
We don't know what time it is.
I'll tell you what time it is.
It's time for the pink man to shut up.
And the slack man to rise.
On all fours.
And I'm rising up just thinking about X Day.
But there's people who don't understand.
Now, our good friend, Reverend Motomac, the sex god.
You may have heard of the sex god, Motomac.
Motomac was a sex god.
Motomac was on a billiard table back in 1928.
Motomac sends out press releases in the name of the church's subgenius.
He does not clear these with me, by the way, which has led sometimes to risible, laughable...
Anyway, Motomac's latest...
I will not say that name, though, because I can...
Was apparently well-written and grabbed attention.
And it was sent to many websites where people who were not saved in Bob, or of Bob, or by Bob, or with Bob,
but were against Bob even, some of them, without even knowing anything about it.
And I have an actual phone message recording that we received here at the Subgenius Foundation headquarters in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.
Actual tape?
Actual tape.
The toll-free number.
I think you should play it.
Which was probably let in...
Yes, I'm going to play that.
And this was somebody who didn't understand Bob's prophecy.
Now, we're...
First, we'll actually hear...
First, we'll actually hear...
A lot of mis-stand-a-randing.
First, we will hear Bob's prophecy.
We have to discuss the things we should understand around here.
By the way, this background music is by Onan Canabite, called, uh, Not Different But Better.
Oh, I thought that was the misogynistic...
Hurl, hurl.
Anyway, here's that...
Here's that...
Let's not get lost in the spirit, because here is that, uh, self-same phone call.
No, I'm afraid it wasn't.
On July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m., when we all have hangovers, Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the priest's scriptures call the advent of the angelic host.
Yeah, I'm reading here on the internet where you think the word is.
The world's going to end July 5th, 2007.
Well, brother, I'll tell you what the Bible says.
No man knows what hour our Lord doth come, so you've got a heck of a email going on here.
And I hope God forgives you for trying to predict when He's coming back in Jesus Christ.
But, uh, I hope you find Him in the end and get your heart right and your soul straightened out and ask to use Christ into your life and your heart and ask Him to forgive you of your sins and to repent, because you're doing some blasphemy against God.
Because there's no way you know that.
Uh, but I feel for you, buddy, and I just pray that you get to know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior. God bless.
Well, my brother, thank you for that feeling.
We wish that you would read further down the press releases before you reach judgment, because, my friend, the judgmental will also be at the judgment.
At the judgmental judgment table.
The conclusion jumper.
The conclusion jumper.
Will be at the judgment, my friend.
Also the abstract floozy.
The one who...
The abstract painter will be at the judgment, my friend.
Yeah, the occult Kandinskyan.
The neo-necromagical...
The false Bob will be at the judgment.
Neo-necromagical, ballsy, balsamic bald Bob will be at the surcharge.
The pretender.
The poser Bob will be at the judgment.
The poopy feet...
Along with the judgmental.
The poopy feet of the...
The pink Bob will be crucified at the judgment.
The generals and the...
The naysayers of religious...
The religious kook will be at the judgment.
Kook, indeed.
The laughable schizophrenic will be at the judgment.
The friendly Hungarian, the restaurateur will be on...
The ingenieur will be at the judgment.
The disciple, the pope...
The crimson tide of old Alabama.
The Bobby will be at the judgment.
The imabob will be at the judgment.
The imabobby will be at the judgment, my friend.
The concussion stand and the sandwich's shopper.
The pink boy will be at the judgment.
You know the femme fatale will be there too.
Well, we've described a world that no one really wants to live in it.
So why should we live in it a world where no one wants to live in it?
Well, simply...
I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh no, I insist.
No, I insist.
I'm actually the one that's sorry.
After you.
I didn't mean it.
Indubitably.
I am the apologetic party at this time.
No, please you.
You first.
No, go ahead.
No, no, I insist.
No, please.
Please.
No, no, no.
No, please, please, please, please.
Well, you see...
You see, Reverend Frotter Sifu,
You see, Reverend Frotter Sifu,
So Deep did that background tune called N-P-O-V-E,
in which Bob Dean finally makes it onto the hour of slack as a kind of sound effect.
Speaking of radio shows, the pioneering Ask Dr. Howell show has now adapted fully to the alternate medium of radio,
according to its broadcasters Dr. Howell and Howell, who will be at X-Day and The Judgment.
And it is a genetic experiment we'll all enjoy watching unfold it.
Also, and K-Rob, whose name often gets talked over, K-Rob is a regular also on the Puzzling Evidence show.
Since the closing of the popular nightclub phenomenon, Ask Dr. Howell,
last experiences by eager audiences about San Francisco's 12 Galaxies nightclub until recently,
diversification has been the word as the show, chameleon-like,
has metamorphosed to its current on-air version on innovative San Francisco pirate radio station,
Pirate Cat 87.9 FM.
But you can listen to it on the internet, friends, in the number I'm about to give,
but you'll have to have a pencil ready to write it down.
That's why I'm not giving it yet, so get ready.
Just as in its salad days, under the aegis of impresario, Chicken John,
the show still features the question-and-answer format of Yawr, as will...
X-Day at Brushwood.
Listeners are encouraged to call the show during its broadcast hours,
10 p.m. till midnight, Wednesday nights, using the sacred telephone number,
415-626-7180.
Read that again, please.
Anyway, friends, here's what you do.
Here's that at www.piratecatradio.com.
That's it.
Pirate Cat Radio.
All one word.
So it looks as if it says...
Pirate Cat Radio.
...radio.com.
Pirate Cat Radio and Navaradio.
And that should get you where you need to go for two solid hours of unique.
Now, I don't mean to turn anyone away from this great, magnificent show.
But what blurb was that from?
That was from Dr. Howell.
I mean, but what paper is it quoted from, Stank?
What paper?
Yes, you've totally...
The interweb.
The world warped interweb.
He'll never understand.
Stand.
AskDrHowell.com.
The dismal, bleak world now, thanks to types like him.
Claims by terrified villagers in Tura, India,
that Bigfoot-type hairy giants are roaming the jungles of India's north, remote east,
have prompted authorities to order an investigation, a local official said.
Bizarre sightings have been made in the Garo Hills area of Meghalaya State,
close to the borders of Bangladesh and Bhutan,
with villagers calling the mysterious creature Mandiburung,
or Jungleman,
This is the Yeti, my friends.
Wildlife officials will conduct a study to check the truth.
The creatures have apparently been talked about,
and are occasionally spotted.
And sometimes striped, saying they've been shaven.
Oh, look, the villagers are excited, and running around in circles with torches.
One local farmer, Wally Smegma, said he'd seen an entire family of the creatures.
Possibly a lowland relative of the Himalayan Yeti,
a cousin of the North American Bigfoot or Sasquatch,
and an ancestor of Australia's Yowie,
and the American subgenius.
I saw him over there by my backyard.
I was cleaning the swimming sump,
and I noticed a little missus put on some barbecued fish on the cube.
And next thing you know, there he was standing.
The four of them quietly vanished in the undergrowth.
The group claims to have hair samples of the creature taken from the forest,
and will send them to DNA for testing.
But friends...
We have a DNA swab of his cubit.
Friends, the Bigfoot lives right among us, even now.
Listen, Vicky.
Right in this room are two of them.
I'm not going to say which.
Which?
Well, one of them is a witch from outer space,
and there are two Bigfeet.
And one's a Yeti.
Ug and Ort continued their rampage through the city.
The discussion of the Yeti's den does not include their strange genealogy.
Where they sprang from, where they came from,
why their DNA went that way instead of this.
Understandable.
So now, we would like you to thoroughly retell the story we have hired to say and not apron it.
We give you the following days of news on All Thatarded.
!
So, what's going on there?


We're история people.
at Brushwood Folklore Center.
Something started pulling me towards the front of my tent
and tried to pull me out,
she told the Express Times of Sherman.
Keats of Franklin Township, New Jersey,
and the other hot and naked girls in the tent
screamed for help.
Ivan Stang then loaded the girls,
about 15 of them, into a van
and took them into the camp's mess hall
where they made another mess.
Potter Nostril, chief executive officer
of the subgenius of Western New York,
said the camp will not allow
naked subgenius girls to sleep in tents
this coming weekend or X-Day weekend.
Campers and adult leaders get bear education
when they register for the camp, he said.
Bears are a fact of life here, Nostril said.
We're living in their habitat.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Now, you read about an actual experiment
that went awry.
A bear and a pagan,
and I assume an ass,
were somehow pre-concabulated
and constructed into one being.
And they attacked this poor woman
in the very same place
you're going to lead them off into the cosmos.
Yes, we're all going there
to Brushwood Folklore Center
to have the party.
That was Dr. Dark who released that news report,
by the way.
Dr. Dark will be showing his all-night
horror movie.
You'll see his feasts on Wednesday and Thursday
at the great festival.
Actually, actually, look, look, there.
There he is, that's Dr. Dark himself.
He's a bear pagan.
Well, so much for introductions
of invisible space monsters.
What's the real esoteric core
of your religious cult?
Dr. Reverend Mr. Man.
We're into slack.
It's a slacker.
It's a slacker cult.
And what exactly?
Slacker. We're slikers.
So what does that entail or include?
A slacker tail trail.
Is it a sort of an encumbrance
you have to wear?
You're just going to have to follow Bob
and follow Bob's trail and find out, my friend.
Does he leave droppings we can follow?
Yes, he does.
He leaves cotter pins
and jellies.
Jello, wherever he has been.
Did you know that, Dave?
Well, I didn't know.
Did you know that legend of Bob?
It's not just an urban myth.
Wherever Bob goes, he leaves...
He poops out cotter pins and urban legends.
No, he carries cotter pins with him.
And we're not sure where the jello comes from.
Well, I thought those were the hand grenades.
The cotter pins came from the hand grenades.
And, of course, the jello came from the excitement
and the gel that is naturally made
in anybody's alien latent vertebrae.
Once they're excited.
Well, people get excited about Bob.
Yeah, they do.
That leads me into this other phone call
that I played you guys earlier.
Well, he definitely has a leaky vertebrae, that guy.
Okay, now listen to this guy, you guys.
Okay, you guys, now listen to this guy.
This guy called right after that other guy.
Oh.
Hello?
Um...
I...
I...
I...
I...
I, um...
I was calling Matt.
I told him I got the, um...
Telephone number.
Talking about, um...
The slack job.
The, um...
Um...
The Slager Church.
Or something.
Matt.
In Ohio.
And I wanted to get more information.
Friends, you can get that information
from subgenius.com.
Oh, my God.
The Slager Church.
Now, that's a subgenius.
I can tell.
I can whiff-read as I held my hand
over the official office answer machine.
Um...
Uh...
Fax machine.
I could feel the subgeniusness glowing from it.
From...
Just from the digital recording.
You didn't even need the third nostril to sniff it.
You just sort of, um...
You just put your hand out and...
You could tell.
He was like a brother of the Yeti.
I think that guy...
I'm just gonna say one thing.
I think that guy had heard of the Shakers in Ohio in the 1800s.
And somehow...
So it was the Slakers.
Transposed the Slakers with slack.
Yeah.
And then slack-jawed.
And, uh...
Well, I don't know.
We're the Thirst Slakers.
I'd just like to know how his breath...
His breath didn't melt the phone that he was...
Bob's Beer God doesn't give you bad breath.
That's a special beer.
Boy, I like those long...
The thirst...
Oh, I can't say the tagline.
No, you can't.
Is it a poignant pause or is it a filth word?
It's a filth word.
That's why Bob's Beer God didn't sell real well.
Because he insisted on using this really vulgar tagline.
It was the Thirst Blank.
The Thirst Raper, let's say.
Well, the...
Now, the...
Bob's Beer God.
It was really not bad beer.
That you...
So as people...
For a fluke.
It wasn't around for long.
It was around Louisiana and Texas.
For a fluke.
They sold it in the 50s.
Oh, it was real beer?
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
Bob's Beer God.
It was one of his frivolous business things where he thought...
Just kind of a...
They used this dirty word in the ads that it would sell.
And, of course, he was ahead of his time.
Nowadays, that's how you sell stuff.
Well, that's what deconstruction is based on, is the sexuality of the paranormal.
Right.



Normal peoples.
But he...
This was in the 50s, though.
That was the problem.
Bob was a bit ahead of...
He was a head, a logo head of his time.
And he had a little...
The late 50s, early 60s.
A little teeny head growing out of his head.
To now.
Sometimes.
Yes, he had a tiny head growing out of his head.
That's...
That was another thing people didn't know.
That there was a parasitical twin.
Not his evil twin brother, Dick.
But a parasitical twin attached to Bob on the back of his head that was a tiny...
Gibbering Bob head.
That had no intelligence.
Some people think that that's the lucky one.
A make.
The Bob we see is the one controlled by the alien pipe thing.
And the one, the tiny parasitical Bob head hanging out the back of his neck, like a wart...
Is the speaker.
Is the lucky, the luck, the fulcrum of the luck plane of the universe.
And also the driver of the head that it's the parasitic host body of on.
Right.
In other words, Bob is the devil.
And the little tiny Bob is the angel.
The devil is the main one that we see.
And the angel is just a tiny thing that gives him superpowers.
That's just a theory, though.
That is just so messed up.
It's just a theory.
We don't want to get off into some theological discussion with our radio audience.
Who I'm sure wants to hear rock and roll music.
Or some kind of rap music.
Or folk songs.
Or some kind of secular material.
We have Bob.
Beautiful Bob songs here, as always.
I remember those when I was little.
When my false surrogate parents, they weren't my false surrogate parents.
They were my false false parents.
But my first surrogate parents used to take me to the fulcrum, they called it.
It was in the annual anal individual hang.
And Bob was everywhere.
And, you know, as sort of an encumberant being, he can focus and refocus himself as many places as he feels like it.
At whatever moment.
And, man, that's what I remember.
The old songs.
And then the stink mice.
They were called sometimes the rebel, the sky, the priest, or whatever.
You know, they would lead the choruses.
Peter's your grandpa.
Oblake effusions.
They'd get bigger and fatter sometimes.
And I'd just sit back and look at the crows.
They were amazing.
I am.
I am Mazel Tov.
Oy.
I'm just, I'm just Kvali.
I'm over your talent.
Oh, it's one of the cathartic trappers.
That's Pisces and Carter.
At X Day, last year, 9X Day.
This one's about fish, I think.
Yes, dear friends.
Actually, I think this in the background is the Kirkendall Void.
Well, there you go.
And that's, see, we're back to that again.
Well, these, these, this, these guys are exciting to me.
I enjoy their.
They couldn't make it to X Day, by the way.
Oh.
Did they forget?
I don't know.
Did I try to get them, and they can't make it.
But the Bonobo Convergence, and of course, the amino acids.
The greatest earth-shattering volcanic band of them all.
A band that is like hot lava in your ear bones.
A band that is like knives in your ears.
It's cool, man.
Cool.
And don't forget to tell them how wonderful I'm going to be if I,
That's right.
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Underworlds will be there.
The Underworlders.
Sure.
It's worth two S's.
The Underworlders.
The Underworlders.
Yes.
That's not a bad name, since we just made it up.
Well, especially when you kind of spell the S's on the end.
We don't actually know who the band will be.
But you will be able to see their skeleton heads in luminous, numinous paint colors.
Yeah.
And the Weardens.
The Weardens are the featured act of the Chronic Palace.
And Papa Joe Mama.
Remember Papa Joe Mama?
Well, Father Joe Mama.
He ended up with the nickname Papa Joe Mama.
A great subgenius preacher.
He sometimes dresses as a woman.
That's what you don't want to miss.
And Dr. Howell, the great doctor.
Many called the intelligent subgenius.
He's kind of an oxymoron for a bunch of morons.
But you know what?
I mean, he's the subgenius with the vocabulary.
Yeah.
And the memory.
And the charm.
And the class.
And everything else.
And the high heels.
And the doctor belts.
In fact, the next three shows will be dominated by Dr. Howell and Philo.
The busier son.
Friends, let's go back in time just briefly and see something.
I don't know what.
Let's take a look at something.
Back off a mountain.
The future is always nonsense.
Until it becomes the past.
I'm sorry, but you see, it is my curse to tell the absolute truth.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Bob is a rock.
Bob is a tree.
Bob is you and Bob is me.
Bob is a football.
Bob is a basketball.
Bob is a rugby ball.
And Bob is a golf ball.
By gobs.
Huh?
Yeah.
Sure.
By gobs, that man is crazy.
I'm not crazy.
You mean old scorpion?
By gobs, he stole my gun.
Ooh, you!
By gobs, he stole my gun.
Why you got tough, I'm Greg Vape!
I sing now!
Please go on, I'll tell you later
I got a big fat squid in my refrigerator
Ooh!
Ooh!
I got a big fat squid in my refrigerator
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
In the frozen food
I found him in the frozen food
And got him five new pairs of shoes
And now he lives in the frozen school


The Refrigerator
Ooooooooh, ooooh, ooooh
I bought him for 99 cents a pound
Ooooooh, shup, shup
He cost $45, weighs 35 pounds
Ooooooooh, wop, wop
I'm the cutest ape in the neighborhood
But my girlfriend treats me no good
I know she'd leave me if she could
Take the big fat squid in my refrigerator
Ooooooh
That was Brack of Space Ghost
Before that, Glass Madness sang Bob is a Rock
And now, Lee Muirs, Be Orphit, Lee Not

W.M. Wood of Eastland, Texas placed Old Rip, a horned toad, in the cornerstone of the courthouse in 1897
And took it out in 1928
Be Orphit, Lee Not
In a moment, I'll tell you about a dead horned toad
That being the last of its kind, the manufacturer had it insured for $25

Step into the driver's seat today

Of magnificent new febrile America
You're smokin' hot

What? What? What?
What, I was driving along Route 66
I was going to the Navajo Diner
To have a barbecued sandwich
And the flapjack soft taco
And suddenly, everything is gone
The Ferris wheel
The plane
The mountaineering boot
The plane
The plane. The goat.
And everything around them.
The plane.
Totally gone?
That's just what happened.
Oh, my goodness.
What was it, like a whiteout of snow?
Well, they sent one of the guys from the government down to check it out,
and he says the alien actually had a blue-skinned forehead.
Oh, my goodness.
Different than the other ones.
The Indian's been poking with sticks for so long.
Yeah, we had them underneath the bath and sink there for a while,
and Mother says we have to take it out by the phosphate tank.
I should think so.
Yeah, that's where we're going to lay them down tomorrow night.
We're tying them up real good, and the kids are coming over,
and they're going to poke them.
That's a good idea.
I'm glad they're going to do that.
That's a real, real good idea.
We're not sure, but he had a pipe.
Now, that guy, we had a restlet from his, I guess you could call it his hand.
Anyone knows that.
I can't read.
It was you.
I can't read.
I can't read.
Why are you guys reading porno over there?
I can't read.
This picture's reminding me of the days when I used to pick my own, so to speak.
You know what I'm talking about?
Dave and Princess Weir over here looking at this porno magazine called Yoga Journal.
Princess Weir didn't want me to talk.
She didn't want me to preach on pornography tonight.
Princess Weir thought that a yoga journal was a nice PC,
or as they say, politically correct magazine for young soccer moms,
and new age ladies of the upper classes, mostly.
Yes, I noticed there were pictures of Paris Hipton and the Sheraton twins were there.
It teaches me.
No.
Mostly.
This yoga journal is like a poser's hippie zine, you might say,
because these are all the clean-cut sort of hippie chicks.
Unjust accusations all.
Well, let me say that you had to admit to me, Little Miss Weardo,
that the magazine was in fact filled with near-pornographic-looking photographs
of young women with their outthrust chests, most of them small-chested,
and yet, albeit.
They are outthrusting with their little yoga sports bras and such-like and whatnot,
and so forth, and so on.
Oh, bologna and cheese sandwiches.
And yet, now it's full of this sort of consciousness and yoga enlightenment jargon,
new-age-ish, new-world-ish, order-ish jargon,
and yet, if you look at these women, which is 99% women,
there are some young.
They're hunks and look like a cover of a dang romance novel type of male models.
And the middle-aged attorney who had a bum knee, but after his yoga practice, his knee is fine.
Let's see some diversity for old white men.
Excuse me, can I just interject one thing into this, family?
Can I use the lounge, the staff lounge?
Yes, you may go to the bathroom.
And can I go on the couch?
Yes.
Now, in the meantime, about this pornography, this yoga journal, as we see.
Now, what is it about?
Why do I feel that this is a poser zine?
Why do I consider this to be an orgy of poserism?
Of wannabe hipsters and soccer moms pretending to be some kind of new-age hippie chick?
And yet, look at their armpits.
Look at the armpits in these pictures.
Do you see an unshaved armpit once in yoga journal?
Spirituality values relationships, August 2007.
Do you see one hair-bespotted pit?
No, nay ma'am, nay sir.
I see nothing but shaved armpits, and that's how I know this is porno.
Because it's porno for North American upper-class wimps that are afraid to buy real porno,
such as buff, gent, jugs, and so forth, which come right out and admit in their editorials,
and on the editorial front page,
Boys, you're gonna love these plumpers.
This is just the kind you like to you-know-what to.
He is so mean.
But this yoga journal, well, they have to...
The ultimate pose to build core strength.
Pose is right.
And they call this empowerment for women, and yet they're all wearing makeup.
They all have perfect skin.
Do you see an old woman in here?
Do you see a plain woman in here?
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
Once in once every hundred pages of a yoga journal.
This is my review of your so-called modern media yoga journal.
He is just so dumb.
The new age is a garbage pit of superstition and optimism, which is against Bob.
It's just a vicious attack for no reason.
It's just simply, it's pinkness.
It's pinkness.
I've saved...
Get thee behind me, yoga journal.
Shut up, pink boy, say I.
Sting, I think perhaps some of those pictures would show you how to get behind yourself literally
if you had the pants and the alacrity to do so.
Now, could you please refrain from discussing this issue anymore?
The one on the cover is kind of cute.
I'm having a niptile erection.
I'm feeling very lonesome, by the way.
You know, we were talking about the search of a sub...
Well, then you go look at the porno journal, yoga pornography.
I would prefer to talk about the arts.
I'm not saying it's for men.
It's for girls.
I'm not saying it's for men.
Men, wimpy men might like that kind of stuff.
Oh, I would love it then.
I didn't have any articles on, you know, the New York...
Silly, silly men might like the girls in the yoga journal.
Oh, look, there's pregnant women having enormous sex.
No, that's Hustler you're thinking of, and that's...
No, look, they actually had large objects.
No, those are actually...
Look at that, three beautiful blondes lined up to preach empowerment to plain women.
If only you can be beautiful like us, then you can have spiritual happiness like us.
Many of the transsexuals...
It makes me sick!
What's one of the mutant girls?
How are they represented in this?
They're in the magazine.
You just didn't look closely enough, dear.
I didn't have my magnifying glass with me to look at the micro dots, I guess.
You're so full of bologna and cheese sandwiches.
I said it before and I'll say it again.
You're so nice, Princess Wee, but I'm not.
Many of the transsexuals I've seen arguing with dumpsters, you know, safety devices and
stuff like that.







I mean, I'm not a big fan of the big-ass ones, but I do think that these people often
get arrested and still, still, stillborn don't have to go through the same sort of occult
effusion that you've just created with your big, fat lip.
Another magazine that my beloved wife likes to subscribe to.
Could you stop it, sir?
The Utney Reader.
Mm-hmm.
Rush Leftball, as I believe you jokingly referred to it, but I know that you're just joking,
Dave, because you don't see the evil of the smugness.
I see the big picture, Stag.
And then building up.
You don't see the next Hitler building up in the New Age movement, like a...
There's a new Hitler in the New Age movement?
Oh, they're all Hitlers.
Do any of them...
Millions of little Hitlers.
Okay, what are dues for something like this?
Say opposed to the Church of the Subgenius, where, you know, you actually have to pay
40 bucks.
No, we are noble Mussolinis and Stalins, all of us.
You'll take...
No, none of these pathetic Hitlers for us.
He was insane, crazy.
Of course he was insane, crazy, but how much...
He was not a great player.
He was a great planner, like Stalin.
He was a great painter.
Or a great lover, like Mussolini.
He was a great house painter, though.
Everyone knows that.
He was.
He was better than...
His landscape's a lot better than mine, I'll give him that.
Yep.
He was a good landscaper, too.
I don't know if we're...
Landscraper is ultimately what they call it.
Wait a minute, you're trying to get me off of...
The rape of Europe.
...off of...
From preaching about pornography, because you people are into it.
Well, you hate seeing women's clans being expanded, which is the wrong...
No, I hate seeing them...
...not long in yoga.
...expanded in a wishy-washy way.

Look...
Pretend, pose, or...
Oh, let's just tease...
Look, let's look at this picture.
Let's just tease those...
You can see her chink-lock.
...closet lesbian soccer moms.
I'm telling you, this is porno for closet lesbian soccer moms.
I'm saying soccer mom, come out of the closet!
Get down with it, baby!
What the hell is he talking about?
Be yourself!
You are what you is!
You're not even like this...
Let Connie into your life!
Let Bob expand your mind!
...he can fix his neck.
Don't just wallow in this halfway tease.
I'm not...
Just get it...
Go all the way, baby!
He has no idea what this is.
I'm talking to the down-home-for-real people!
I don't think he did.
I...
Dang.
Your body is changing, man.
These are all women here.
You're gonna have to calm down.
You're bright red.
They're all making themselves feel better.
Your left shoe exploded.
What are we gonna do with that?
They're gonna have to buy you another...
Well, this may not go down well on the polished ears of the modernists and liberals, but I'm
afraid that it has to be said.
We're posting this on the internet.




I'm tired of dead preachers preaching dead sermons to dead congregations in these living,
dead end times.
It's been the end times since I can remember.
Since the beginning of civilization has been the end times, and nobody's picking up on
it!
I want you to repent!
You just jumped on the carousel, eh?
Quit your job and slack off while you still know how!
Right this minute!
Do it!
The merry-go-round.
A merry-go-round.
That's what Stan's idea of reality is.
God, oh my God.







A jump on the little horsey to the left...
Get off your butt!
Yank your bootstraps up on the table and run, baby!
That actually hurt my neck hearing that.
Pull your clothes off and show them!
You don't need that chem can.
You don't need to hide in a little closet.
Claim that you followed them to the...
What kind of a wuss are you?
...hicky-dicky big-boy hot dog restaurant on...
Now Dave's looking at the Yoga Journal.
...porn.
That's a small...
Mom, I've just urinated on the soccer field and here comes Dad with the electrocutioners.
You know, I don't know if any child or any other animic or animistic animal should be
exposed to this.
Some mammals might get sick.
What did the Yoga Journal or Utney Reader ever do to you, Reverend Stan?
Besides make you feel great and know how to make a great waltz or salad.
Actually, we used to...
I remember when the Utney Reader was a little zine like...
...a little...
...the Stark Fist of Removal and we used to trade with them.
In fact, I probably wrote them up in High Weirdness by Mail back in the previous century.
I probably said something nice about them, okay?
See, he is not even loyal to his friends or enemies.
But then, then they became a symbol of the pinkness of the Portlandian sort of pinkness.
Oh, we know we're right and correct because we look at each other and nod and we all agree.
So therefore, here in our Portland, Oregon coffee shop...
Sting, I think that...
...where in real life we have hairy armpits, but in our Yoga Journals, no, they're shaved! Shaved!
Would you shave your prairie squid?
I'm asking you that, David DeLuca.
I'm asking you that, Princess Wiardo.
Would you shave a prairie squid?
I have. I have.
I have shaven my squid in honor of Yoga Journal.
I've seen it.
Not only in honor, but as an obeisant offering to the fun.
Oh, my.
Some women shave their armpits as a matter of comfort, Reverend Stang, not vanity.
...to actually make the fuzz job.
I believe it's a person should be adaptable and should adapt to new ways, but this is going too far.
Some things are just over the line.
What happened to decency? What happened to slackness?
What happened to divine high unpredictability and abnormality?
No, now it's all apologists.
Oh, Mr. Normalman, he pays my check.
He writes my paycheck, so I have to toe the line.
I've got to play by the rules for Mr. Normalman.
I'm sorry, but as Mr. and Mrs. Normalman...
Oh, I have to be fashionable because Mr. Weirdman is doing the...
He's shaving his head this year, so I'm going to have to shave my hair like Mr. Weirdman.
He's fashionable.
But where is subgeniusness, men?
And subgeniusness...
...is...
Where is she in all of this?
With her hairy armpits and her hairy, strong, yeti legs...
...and her strong, hairy chest of the subgenius conitite...
...her bristling chest muscles of the conitite, the strong woman...
Where is she to thrash me and beat me when I backtalk her?
Eh?
What is...
...
Are you going to be all right, Reverend Stang?
Oh, uh, friends, uh, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, voice of the Church of the Subgenius.
For more information on the Church of the Subgenius, uh, please write to, uh, Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 or at subgenius.com on the World Wide Web.
And thank you, Princess Wee and, uh, Dave and, uh, Dr. Sinister for waiting.
It's a nasal thing, man.
That's, uh...
This year, about 30 Americans are tuning in to every episode of...
...Idle American...
...downright cruel...
...oppressive...
...pop star wannabes...
...pop star wannabes...
...keep people watching...
...Simon Cowell.
Fox reportedly pays him more than $30 a year, and he gets another $38 annually, and he has no musical ability at all.
Not...not badly.
So what actually do you do?
Guess, guess.
Do you feel at all like a fraud?
Absolutely.
Untalented...
...Simon Cowell stinks.
And that's where Cowell comes in.
Medieval.
Medieval.
Because.
Yes.
Gimmick.
Make money.
Make money.
Yeah, why not?
I couldn't care less.
It's a business.
McDonald's hamburgers.
Terrible.
Um...
Medieval.
I couldn't care less.
It's a business.
Thanks to Norrell.
