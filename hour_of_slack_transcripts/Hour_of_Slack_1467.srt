1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,660
At the University of PR News in Washington, I'm full of alcohol and I'm floundering.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:12,020
A thousand and twenty-six and one and two second and three third and twenty PR News.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,440
The BBBBC reports the pattern of provocative actions by Great Great PR News.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,520
Netanyahu blamed PR News.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,600
The BBBBC is PR.

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,780
The BBBBC is PR.

7
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,980
The BBBBC is PR.

8
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,200
The BBBBC is PR.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,780
The BBBBC is PR.

10
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:13,420
The BBBBC is PR.

11
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,540
He's so funny and good at what he does.

12
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,540
Yeah, he is really good.

13
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,140
Performing a tribute to Bob.

14
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,120
I got mad at Bob.

15
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,480
Hey, Bob.

16
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,280
Hey, Bob.

17
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,020
Hey, Bob.

18
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,620
Yes, here we're this close to the hole.

19
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,420
Let's do this together.

20
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,360
Yes, here we're this close to the hole.

21
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,160
Let's do this together.

22
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,620
There we go.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,360
There we go.

24
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,780
There we go.

25
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,040
Born and raised.

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,720
Upper West Side, which is born and raised.

27
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,480
The home of Bop.

28
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,400
I understand, no I don't.

29
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,620
I understand, no I don't.

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,760
Remember Bop, no one says it.

31
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,540
I can't, no one says Bop anymore.

32
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,120
No one says the word Bop.

33
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,160
I don't hear that Bop, you see.

34
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,720
That's old timey street talk.

35
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,780
But now are you, I'm curious, this is a, if.

36
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,720
But now are you, I'm curious, this is a, if.

37
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,460
Look, you even got a head bob for Melissa.

38
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,240
That was really good.

39
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,840
Look, you even got a head bob for Melissa.

40
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,680
That was really good.

41
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,320
Look, you even got a head bob for Melissa.

42
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,140
That was really good.

43
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,760
Hey, there's another cylinder for Bob.

44
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,420
The head I can be.

45
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,700
If we have too much slack,

46
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,660
I'm just gonna fall down and break my neck.

47
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,020
We need tension so it's gonna allow me to like,

48
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,000
actually pendulum.

49
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,440
I just made sure that we have a knife on this balloon

50
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,020
because if you go swinging and you start taking us down,

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,260
we're, I'm cutting you loose and we're saving ourselves.

52
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,400
Yes, here we're this close to the hole.

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,180
Let's do this together.

54
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,580
There we go.

55
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,040
How'd it go?

56
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,840
Did I get it?

57
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,620
I've been practicing all the ways I can die.

58
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,880
This reeks of bob.

59
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,280
This has nothing to do with my talent

60
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,340
and everything to do with his broken dreams in his head.

61
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,940
That's classy, Bob.

62
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,940
Hello Aunt Bob's is today the day.

63
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,440

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,520

68

69
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,420
We can do the song.

70
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,160
Actually they

71
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,420
or types.

72
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,900

74
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:36,480

77
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,340
Sticking in the park, silly dipping in the dark

78
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,060
And out of a measure twirl, I'm sprouting inside me

79
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,540
I'm sprouting inside me

80
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,160
Yes!

81
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,020
Wow!

82
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,920

Wow!

84
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,520
That is good!

85
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,600
That is really good!

86
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,100

You forgot Bob

90
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,980
Oh, oh, thank you

You're welcome

92
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,880
I had to kill Bob because he made a mistake

93
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,460
Now it's time to erase that mistake

94
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,120
I'm cashing you out, Bob

95
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,300
And you need lots of stimulation, Bobby

96
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,420
Yes, I do

97
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,880
Don't move

98
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,540

99
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,120

107
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,700
A couple models come to my place, know what I mean?

108
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,240
I'd buy that for a dollar

109
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,840

110
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,360
This is Bob

115
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,940
No, you don't

116

From your book

Your picture's on the back

119
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,880
Ooh, what happened to your face?

120
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,420
I don't know

121
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:52,740
I don't know

122
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740

124
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


125
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


126
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


127
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


128
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


129
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


130
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


131
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,020
Oh, this?

132
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,300
It's the

00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,220
The Self Genius Hour of Swag

134
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,980
J.R. Bob does

135
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,360
His one and only way

136
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,060
In his wisdom every day

137
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,980
Take Bob in your life

138
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,240
And he will save your soul

139
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,660
Bringing slack in your life

140
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,900
Is his code

141
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,600
When you're praising Bob

142
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,820
Your life is on right track

143
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,580
After him you'll never go back

When you're praising Bob

145
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,600
He gives you good things

146
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,560
Be grateful of the slack now he brings

147
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,080
Whatever goes

148
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,380
And if you've got something

149
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,940
Then take them out

150
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,780
That we can have

151
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,560
A littleiatю

152
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,780
Because this isn't a t intuit

153
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,340
Yes, it's a

154
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:17,380
Is a

155
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,420
Through the

156
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:17,440
It

157
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,560
What'll happen, I won't happy

158
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:18,620
What'll happen to go

159
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,660
Better than

160
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:21,640
Is what I want

161
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,040
written in Bob's book of holy recipes you are what you meet so let's have a

162
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,340
look at the subgenius menu shall we first and foremost what does a subgenius

163
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,580
drink why alcohol of course because it kills germs now that's assuming that

164
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,640
you're 21 and in the custody of a parent legal guardian second what does the

165
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,580
subgenius eat well a real subgenius eats meat red meat dripping with blood fresh

166
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,940
off the farm and still steaming with body heat the subgenius carved his own

167
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,060
flushing meat and bone so he will be prepared to hack the flushing meat and

168
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,380
bones of his opponents come next day the best meat my friends is pork sausage

169
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,900
stuffed in pigs bladders it symbolizes the pigs were gonna come eat on BD day

170
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,100
and of course the ham represents audacity and the natural subgenius

171
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,880
tendency to act up in front of an audience pickled pig's feet is a

172
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,340
delicacy that we eat in remembrance of the fat ones who jog in front of our

173
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,700
house on a daily basis big brains help us learn

174
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:19,920
through the subgenius menu that we eat and remember it's a delicacy that we eat

175
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,240
through osmosis how the cops think so we can outsmart them in the meantime but

176
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,600
there is one pig part that a subgenius must never touch though many

177
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,380
attempters may try to entice you to eat of it with promises of sex or increased

178
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:38,020
sex drive or what have you not the subgenius must never eat the genitalia

179
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,820
of a pig even if it's pickled to put it frankly to eat it of another one's

180
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,240
pleasure parts is a punch below the belt so don't do it

181
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,800
real subgenius don't need aphrodisiacs anyway it's in our genes or brain

182
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:57,300
emas as well asbility and forecast in general to improve our health and

183
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,260
Queensland eat without the meat for a complete or baby so you need to be

184
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,620
altruistic for our breasts as it's all seen as a thing without gender não

185
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,100
aimed at

186
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,740
you know the meat acá é a parte delries

187
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,580
inside this menu for you men right there pie

188
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,940
or 8

189
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,780
I said you're thinking that bunch distributing less pain in the animal

190
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,780
is I said me cute that people sometimes of which Isabel Eddie you it only�

191
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:25,600
experiencing more. At least the meat eaters had the decency to kill what they eat before they eat

192
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,640
it. But with the carrot or celery or lettuce or turnips, they not only rip it from Mother Earth's

193
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,980
open wound, they then scalp it and chill it and scrape it and serve it alive for you to chew into

194
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,420
little bits, dicing all those poor little mini plants into sections, separating neighborhoods

195
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,920
and entire families from one another. Then they begin a long and grotesque trek into the dreck of

196
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,620
the human body, down the tunnel of damnation into the bottomless pit of acids and amino acids,

197
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,840
there and only there, to a lucky few in their pitiful little lives, eaten alive by the acidic

198
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,940
acid of chemicals that would be declared hazardous if they existed anywhere but in the stomach.

199
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:13,140
Yes, dear friends, it's a holocaust of horrors down there in the gut. Those few chunks, unfortunately,

200
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,100
enough to survive the acid ordeal, start a never-ending rollercoaster ride down the eternal

201
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,720
intestines, where they are slowly robbed not only of their nutrition, but of their dignity as well.

202
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:30,700
Whole potatoes turn into mash before their very eyes. It's too revolting to reflect upon why

203
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,960
scientists have even conducted experiments using electroencephalograms and found that the poor

204
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,360
little plants have survived hours of torture only to be digested alive and then flushed down the

205
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,840
drain like some huge tampon.

206
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:50,820
Suffice to say, dear friends, in comparison, we meat-eaters are indeed merciful, since we kill first and eat later and not the other way around.

207
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,680
At least we're noble enough to put our food out of its misery.

208
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:03,420
But let's face it, there's so little justice in the world. However, you may comfort yourself in the small consolation that the vegetarian will get his just desserts in the end,

209
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:12,520
because a vegetarian, dear friends, he that uproots from the earth that which she meant to grow, will one day be buried in the earth also, and there, there, dear friends,

210
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,360
Mother Earth,

211
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,300
will reap her revenge.

212
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,560
The little worms and maggots will crawl forth from the soil, wiggling and nibbling on the dastardly body of the delicious deceased.

213
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:32,040
They shall demonstrate firsthand, and secondhand also, just what it means to eat meat, just how good it really is, just how much it makes you grow, just how fast it makes you reproduce.

214
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,840
All the formaldehyde in the world can't stop the determination of those digging demons from the Underworld. Just you wait and see.

215
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,340
Alas, dear friends, there is only one power strong enough to dissuade, and that is the power of the mother earth, the mother earth.

216
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,800
our little parasitical friends.

217
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,040
And that, my friends, is the force

218
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,820
of Bob with the Big Worm Dobbs.

219
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,040
For it is written, and it shall come to pass,

220
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,440
that on X-Day the good subgenius

221
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,960
shall rise up from the grave.

222
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,760
These armies will be whole but hungry.

223
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,540
They shall join up with the legions of X-Men

224
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,500
and eat the panicking pinks alive.

225
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,600
Yes, dear friends, having a normal for dinner

226
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,320
may not seem very pleasant now.

227
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,020
But what about Judgment Day?

228
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,020
All the supermarkets will be closed.

229
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,660
And so will the restaurants, too.

230
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,420
And remember, you need plenty of manpower

231
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,260
to sustain that galactic journey to the promised land.

232
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,860
So don't just stay in there.

233
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,840
Roll up your sleeves and get digging.

234
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,060
We've got trenches to fill and hatchets to bury.

235
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,500
So be a good citizen and recycle.

236
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,840
It's our turn to show the sophisticates

237
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,700
just how poor our tastes really are.

238
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,720
Roll up the barrel, party, and praise Bob.

239
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,260
Amen.

240
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,000
From God.

PR News in Washington.

242
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,280
I'm the mother of all PR reports.

243
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,860
President Obama told U.S. troops

244
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,620
that America will come to a responsible end

245
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,920
by the close of the year.

246
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,140
Thousands of residents of Flagstaff, Arizona

247
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,560
may triple in size before authorities gain full control

248
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,040
during an unannounced visit.

249
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,260
Obama's surprise visit in Flagstaff.

250
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,500
The National Hurricane Center says

251
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,920
this is PR News in Washington.

253

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,980

A-weem-ba-wee.

256
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,560
A weem-ba-wee, a-weeem-ba-wee, a-wee-ba-wee,

257

a-weem-ba-wee, a-weem-ba-wee, a-weem-ba-wee, a-weem-ba-wee,

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,920
a-weem-ba-wee.

259
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:33,140
A weem-ba-wee, a-weem-ba-wee, a-weem-ba-wee, ueeum...

260
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:40,960
A-weem-ba-wee.

261
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:02,440
My Uzi Bob Dox, the J.R. Bob Dox is here to bring you slack.

262
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:10,660
When you accept Bob in your life, you never have to go back.

263
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:18,580
Uzi Bob Dox, the J.R. Bob Dox is here to bring you slack.

264
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:26,680
When you accept Bob in your life, you never have to go back.

265
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,420
Uzi Bob Dox, the J.R. Bob Dox is here to bring you slack.

266
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,720
Uzi Bob Dox, the J.R. Bob Dox is here to bring you slack.

267
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,740
When you accept Bob in your life, you never have to go back.

268
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:50,760
Uzi Bob Dox, the J.R. Bob Dox is here to bring you slack.

269
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,920
When you accept Bob in your life, you never have to go back.

270
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,340
One tough pick.

271
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,960
One tough pick.

272
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,640
One tough pick.

273
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,160
One tough pick.

274
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,700
I don't like the pink. It's a little creepy.

275
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,840
Yeah, it's a little creepy, but so is what we do to the self-genius world.

276
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,040
Invoking a religious experience. It's quite a big job.

277
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:32,340
Can I ask you a, uh, I, can I ask you a, uh, I, I, I know you, I, I know you, I, I, I know you've answered a million beetle questions.

278
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,900
all the time, but I have to ask you,

279
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,360
there's one story that I've never thought,

280
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,620
I've always wondered, is this true,

281
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,500
or is this just one of those things that was made up?

282
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,620
But there's a famous story that Bob introduced you guys

283
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,480
to pot for the first time.

284
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,780
You had never tried it before, and that's the story,

285
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,500
and I thought, is that true?

286
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,140
No, it is true.

287
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:47,900
It is true.

288
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,880
But he didn't actually give us it.

289
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,840
He was in the room.

290
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,420
So he was not the supplier?

291
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,320
No.

292
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,000
Yeah, Bob, your dealer.

293
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,100
Now, Bob was in the room in the hotel

294
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,580
when it was arranged that someone else

295
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,640
would bring some stuff.

296
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,740
There's a church for licking toads.

297
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,200
It's the Church of the...

298
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,300
So genius.

299
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,980
It's a little bit funny, Bob.

300
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,480
I'm former Senator Bob.

301
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,360
In reality, he's off to a church.

302
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,260
In reality, he's off to a church.

303
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,300
In reality, he's off to a church.

304
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,940
Or more specifically, an alien worshipping church

305
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,260
with very sinister plans.

306
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,060
What?

307
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:32,540
What's next?

308
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,280
Blush?

309
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:33,900
Mascara?

310
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,160
Next time, I'll pull out the leather and high heels

311
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,280
and pink underwear for you.

312
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,260
Leather, high heels, and pink underwear.

313
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,640
Pink underwear works.

314
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,980
Pink underwear works.

315
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,260
So, how do you know everyone?

316
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,100
Oh, I'm a friend of Bob's.

317
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

318
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,340
No offense, but I just ain't comfortable

319
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,260
hanging around all night with, you know,

320
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,080
whatchamacallit, Bob's.

321
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,180
Okay, Jimmy Bob, Tommy.

322
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,460
Bobby, Billy.

323
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,620
Okay, Jimmy Bob, Tommy.

324
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,960
Bobby, Billy.

325
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,060
Okay, Jimmy Bob, Tommy.

326
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,420
Bobby, Billy.

327
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,440
Okay, Jimmy Bob, Tommy.

328
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,800
Bobby, Billy.

329
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,020
Good old Rusty.

330
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,420
Pepper.

331
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,220
Jessica.

332
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,020
Warty.

333
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,480
Cleavis.

334
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:17,760
Jerry.

335
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,200
Jimbo.

336
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:18,760
Pat Brothers.

337
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,180
Wendell.

338
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,420
Kyle.

339
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:19,860
Riggs.

340
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,180
Cricket.

341
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,660
Rusty.

342
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:20,940
Hank.

343
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,260
Flint.

344
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,000
Okay, guys.

345
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,000
I think he's out about five minutes ago.

346
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,700
Bobby Steel.

347
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,760
Bobby Digital.

348
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,100
What is this?

349
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,320
You know?

350
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,000
Please?

351
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,840
I'm talking about some slack.

352
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,260
Every time this dude enters,

353
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,800
he really ends up a goddamn bop.

354
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,140
Taking up some of the slack

355
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,960
might help to release the dummy.

356
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,120
Bobby.

357
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,100
Bobby.

358
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:42,880
Bobby.

359
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,260
All right, well, look at all this stuff.

360
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,700
What are we getting?

361
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,340
Bob.

362
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,140
That's their specialty.

363
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,900
Love that bop.

364
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,540
Yeah, yeah.

365
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,860
I'll have the bop.

366
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,900
That's the last bop.

367
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,800
They got the last bop.

368
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,120
I know.

369
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,440
They're going in first with the last bop.

370
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,240
That was our bop?

371
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
You can't beat a bop.

372
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,080
We had that bop.

373
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,000
They're gonna be heroes.

374
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,540
Well, what are we gonna do now?

375
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,260
If we can't get the bop,

376
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,020
the whole thing is useless.

377
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,080
That was our bop.

378
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,780
We had that bop.

379
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,600
What's this one?

380
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,860
That bop.

381
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,000
Another bop?

382
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,020
We'll be going in with lesser bop.

383
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,840
I beg your pardon?

384
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,600
Lesser bop?

385
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,700
I think not.

386
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,020
We'll have a bop.

387
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,340
Whatever happened to bop?

388
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,800
Yeah, bop spelled backwards.

389
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,820
It's still bop.

390
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,040
Hey, for every stank,

391
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,400
I got a new joke for you.

392
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,620
It's just bop is what it is.

393
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,100
It's just...

394
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,700
It's literally bop.

395
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,560
Yes, sir, re-bop.

396
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,320
Yes, sir, ma'am, Elvira.

397
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,240
Well, that was Elvira at the very end there.

398
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:42,960
Um...

399
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,980
Little clip.

400
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,360
I know...

401
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,980
That arrangement of clips

402
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,320
was done by the great and large...

403
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,940
The large of Finland,

404
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,940
who I think we're going to meet in Germany

405
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,280
in August.

406
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,820
And when that happens,

407
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,440
we'll get to the bottom of this.

408
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,220
Yeah, the large sent in about 20 minutes

409
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,640
of new collage and...

410
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,580
Collarge.

411
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,240
And that was part of it.

412
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,560
We also heard a great sermon

413
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,660
from Father Joe Mama,

414
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,420
Bob's Kosher Kitchen.

415
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,920
And Fernanda Nandy-Lemur

416
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,080
is responsible for PR News.

417
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,680
Oh, and that was the large singing,

418
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,400
I believe, in those...

419
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,620
There were two or three new

420
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,920
Bob hymns...

421
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,260
Yes.

422
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,180
...worked into all of that.

423
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
And I believe that was...

424
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,200
I'm guessing that was

425
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,280
the largest singing voice.

426
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,740
Wow.

427
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,180
Right here.

428
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,600
Uh-huh.

429
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,120
And who else...

430
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,520
Who else can we gossip about?

431
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,660
Oh, oh, oh, shh.

432
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,180
Dave's here.

433
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:55,640
Be quiet.

434
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:55,980
Don't...

435
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,980
Dave's here.

436
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,920
That sounds good.

437
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
What's so funny?

438
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,160
What is so funny?

439
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,720
What's funny anymore?

440
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,280
What is funny?

441
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,280
Really, what is funny?

442
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,000
It's reference dank.

443
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,720
He makes me laugh.

444
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,360
He also makes you sweat

445
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
and smell funny, too.

446
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,060
Well, yeah.

447
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,900
You know...

448
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,000
We don't talk about that so much.

449
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,460
You have to buy the entire package.

450
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
That's not my fault.

451
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:23,880
But...

452
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,080
Oddball.

453
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,180
Weirdo.

454
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,700
Cult leader.

455
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,980
Are you making fun of me?

456
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,480
Oddball.

457
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:31,680
What?

458
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:32,860
Lunatic.

459
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,200
Local monster

460
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,820
monster

461
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,080
disguised as a local monster.

462
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:38,900
Oh, that's...

463
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,620
I like that one.

464
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,860
Just because my name is

465
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,540
We Are Dough,

466
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,700
he calls me weirdo.

467
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,300
How about that?

468
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,500
You know, a lot of people

469
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,200
have never made that connection.

470
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,300
They see your name

471
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,240
written out in print.

472
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,460
Princess We

473
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:52,860
quote

474
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,180
R unquote

475
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,440
Dough

476
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,060
as in toys are us.

477
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,800
The R is always backwards.

478
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:00,980
Thanks.

479
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,520
Thanks, Palmer.

480
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,220
And, uh...

481
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,920
But they never...

482
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,520
But it's like...

483
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,380
And once every five years,

484
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,060
somebody goes,

485
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,620
oh, we are...

486
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,920
That's like weirdo.

487
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,880
Even better is the 13013,

488
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,460
which people go,

489
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,900
oh, it's a subgenius

490
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,580
sacred number for some reason,

491
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,700
but I never have gotten that.

492
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,780
All I can say is

493
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,740
write those numbers

494
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,120
real close together.

495
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,420
13013.

496
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,240
Overlap the one and the three

497
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,700
if you want to.

498
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,700
One, one, three.

499
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,960
Oh, one, three.

500
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,760
Yeah.

501
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,180
And it's...

502
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:36,920
Oh, wow.

503
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,820
That is...

504
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,020
Wow.

505
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,960
See, now Dave

506
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,280
has joined the club

507
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,760
of densities.

508
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,540
That is more than dense.

509
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,080
Hypercritical sensitivity

510
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,880
and exorcism.

511
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,180
That is a revelation of...

512
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,320
That's the hand of Dobbs

513
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,380
in everything we do.

514
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,380
Yeah, us forgetting...

515
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,320
Us not noticing.

516
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:57,700
Every 13013,

517
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,320
that's for sure.

518
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,620
Hiding in plain sight.

519
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,500
Oh, there are other ones?

520
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,680
There are other numbers

521
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,200
you can write?

522
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,000
Well, I've been

523
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,240
dense that same way.

524
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,560
Reverend Fight C. Taj

525
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,820
had to tell me

526
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,540
four or five times

527
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,720
what his name stood for.

528
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,220
And I can't say it

529
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,780
on the radio.

530
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,680
At least I can't do

531
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,560
the first letter of his name.

532
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,380
I can't say what that stands for.

533
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,940
But you can say the letter.

534
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,480
If they can't...

535
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,680
Um, if they can't take it.

536
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,060
If they can't take a joke.

537
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,340
Yeah, it's the rest of his name,

538
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
which comes out as

539
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,280
Fight C. Taj.

540
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,460
Yeah.

541
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,080
I can't say it.

542
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:39,540
That's how much

543
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,520
they can't take a joke?

544
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,920
The first time he showed me that

545
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,880
or told me that,

546
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,680
he started barking and panting

547
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,180
real loud right after he said it.

548
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,560
He explained it.

549
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:49,840
He said,

550
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,820
like that.

551
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,680
Well, at least you remembered it, C,

552
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,340
because it didn't work for me.

553
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,360
But I don't remember anything

554
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,440
that happens at X Day Drill.

555
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,080
It's a convenience relief,

556
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,720
isn't it, Stang?

557
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,220
It is.

558
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,960
Step into the little quiet room

559
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,680
where there's no room anymore.

560
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,100
Suddenly your feet disappear.

561
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,880
You're like a Japanese ghost

562
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,320
floating around the atmosphere.

563
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,780
That's my favorite part of X Day.

564
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,660
Well, at least, you know,

565
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,400
you don't get your doodle wet.

566
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,940
Oh, I do.

567
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,400
Eventually I get my noodle wet,

568
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,220
but then it usually, like,

569
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,160
soaks for way too long

570
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,660
and it's all wrinkly

571
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,000
and pink

572
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,300
when I take it out.

573
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,600
And not only that,

574
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,440
but it smells funny

575
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,340
and there's bugs and things on it.

576
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,160
But that's the way

577
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,240
baptisms are

578
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,960
at Wisteria Campground.

579
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,040
Stinky,

580
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,660
full of dysentery

581
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,280
and diphtheria.

582
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,540
Imagine yourself

583
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,740
on a coach ride to Baltimore

584
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,040
and it's like 1794 and stuff

585
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,700
and you've got dysentery

586
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,100
or the colic

587
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,940
or you're misplaced

588
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,800
or something like that

589
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,560
and your parents,

590
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,360
your parents have to get you there

591
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,180
and they got enough money together

592
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,880
to go on a coach

593
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,960
so you could be there in a week, you know?

594
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,940
And you go ahead and die anyway

595
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,360
because you're only 54 years old.

596
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,100
That's what my X Day drills are like.

597
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,220
I mean, I assume they are.

598
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,180
I can't really remember most of them.

599
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,160
I end up listening to tapes

600
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,000
for hours afterwards going,

601
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,440
huh, so that's what we did.

602
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,740
And nursing your fever blisters.

603
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,820
That ain't all I'm nursing.

604
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,940
Yep, I guess you got little puppies.

605
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,480
A few puppies you're taking care of right now.

606
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,160
Nodge, nodge, fink, fink.

607
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,000
You have to grow, what,

608
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,620
eight breasts to pull off a job like that?

609
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,260
I mean, not literally,

610
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,800
but metaphorically eight breasts.

611
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,340
Meaning you have to be the swine of all dogs

612
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,920
of the Babylonian calendar or something.

613
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,380
Are you making fun of me

614
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,880
because I only have seven breasts?

615
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,740
Yes.

616
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,500
No.

617
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,620
Well, you could be.

618
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,060
You're laughing at me.

619
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,440
She's laughing at me.

620
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,020
That's not politically correct.

621
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,100
Well, that just means you are not the whore of Babylon

622
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,740
when Easter parades.

623
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,560
That's assault.

624
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,520
I was told that once by a panhandler.

625
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,100
This panhandler came up

626
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,100
and gave me the same old tired routine.

627
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,440
I don't have enough money

628
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,280
to take my bus home to my sick kid.

629
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,920
I started going,

630
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,680
I started critiquing his thing.

631
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,880
Dude, I've heard that one a million times.

632
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,420
If you came up with something new,

633
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,880
even though I know it's fake,

634
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,080
I might give you some money.

635
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,060
And he goes, that's assault.

636
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,320
You're assaulting me.

637
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,220
I said, well, why don't you call that cop

638
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,620
over there on the other corner and report me?

639
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,960
And then they looked at me like,

640
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,740
how dare you?

641
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,780
That's even worse assault.

642
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,180
Just got all slustered up.

643
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:54,460
Yeah.

644
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,500
When I was in New York,

645
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,240
there was a lady with a very bad,

646
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,780
very damaged,

647
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,260
which she parlayed into plenty of spare change

648
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,020
at various subway stations.

649
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,480
And where I worked,

650
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,800
I had to go to the same subway stations every day.

651
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,980
And so I was quite familiar with the lady

652
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,620
and her routine.

653
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,980
And man, she was rich.

654
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,780
She was rich.

655
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,200
And I was surrounded by other people

656
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,440
who were like younger people,

657
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,360
you know, with college attire and stuff

658
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,780
and who were real idealistic and everything.

659
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,260
And I blurted out how many times she goes,

660
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,760
not eat for food.

661
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,920
Not eat for food.

662
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,420
Not eat for food.

663
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,860
Not eat for food.

664
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,820
Like that.

665
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,820
And I went,

666
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,340
hey lady,

667
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,860
how many times are you going to eat today?

668
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,060
I'm hungry right now.

669
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,360
So they got mad at me.

670
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:38,980
Yeah.

671
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,640
Yeah,

672
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,740
because you're not supposed to critique their begging.

673
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,480
They're supposed to give them money, basically.

674
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,740
Anything you do but give them money is bad form.

675
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,320
You know what I do a lot of times in that situation

676
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,700
since I'm a stingy old bastard?

677
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,900
All I have to do is,

678
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,100
is go look at my shoes.

679
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,180
And then,

680
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,600
they get a sad, downtrodden look on their face.

681
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,160
They turn and shuffle away.

682
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,140
I have actually seen you do that.

683
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,340
I've witnessed this.

684
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:11,920
Right.

685
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,020
Well, they usually have much better shoes than I'm wearing.

686
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,860
Yeah, sometimes you just say,

687
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,240
oh, hang in there, bro.

688
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:19,980
Hang in there.

689
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,480
I'll give you the thumbs up and walk away

690
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,800
looking kind of determined and sad at the same time.

691
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,980
Like some people got it worse than me.

692
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,740
I mean,

693
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,780
sometimes it's,

694
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,020
like,

695
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,260
blue is the face on your,

696
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,760
you know,

697
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,100
the pain.

698
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,220
Well, I mean,

699
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,240
there are times when

700
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,020
they've had them come up to me and go,

701
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,700
oh,

702
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,180
I'm an alcoholic

703
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,680
and I'm just hurting real bad.

704
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,120
You know,

705
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,000
it's Sunday morning.

706
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,160
I'll give them a couple of bucks.

707
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,420
Because they're,

708
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,180
at least they're honest

709
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,820
and they're going to be dead pretty soon.

710
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,260
I might as well make their last few

711
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,380
hours,

712
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,540
whatever it is,

713
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:53,940
you know.

714
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,020
I mean,

715
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,420
on the other hand,

716
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,280
it's been a long time since I've done that.

717
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,600
Because it's like,

718
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,160
no, man,

719
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,040
I need that $2 for beer myself.

720
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,060
I'm dying.

721
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,220
I'm hurting too,

722
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:05,540
dude.

723
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,220
Oh, well.

724
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,040
Have you ever panhandled

725
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,120
the wrong panhandler?

726
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,600
No.

727
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,700
No, I've never.

728
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,760
I've been

729
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,040
a lucky guy

730
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,680
and I've never had to

731
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,620
bum anything but a cigarette.

732
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,740
I saw an angry one yesterday.

733
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,940
He was like,

734
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,560
hey, man,

735
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,380
you got any spare change?

736
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,880
Like that.

737
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,140
And so,

738
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,420
and I didn't.

739
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,680
Because he was acting

740
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,600
extremely like violently drunk,

741
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,000
you know.

742
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,540
Yeah.

743
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,540
And publicly intoxicated

744
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,940
so lots of people could see.

745
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,960
And I just said,

746
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,120
no, I don't have any.

747
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,140
I didn't have any anyway.

748
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,600
And he started swearing at me

749
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,360
in a loud voice.

750
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:42,820
Right.

751
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,260
Yeah.

752
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,180
How dare you?

753
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,240
Man, I got to get away

754
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,020
from this guy.

755
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,540
I think that's what they call

756
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,400
entitlement,

757
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,620
you know.

758
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,480
That guy was entitled

759
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,260
to your money.

760
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,640
And how dare you

761
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,200
not just do what the,

762
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:56,720
you know,

763
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,580
what the rules say.

764
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,720
Well,

765
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,060
when you first said that,

766
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,200
all I could think of was

767
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,860
he was entitled

768
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,400
to urinate freely

769
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,120
to urinate freely

770
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,000
wherever he chose.

771
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,100
And that,

772
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,400
that wasn't part of it.

773
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,700
When they handed down

774
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,200
the dictum,

775
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:10,800
you know,

776
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,400
the dogma

777
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,940
to us young students,

778
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,560
you couldn't just like

779
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,440
wet your pants

780
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,420
and argue with people

781
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:16,980
in the street.

782
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,540
You had to,

783
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,380
there was some degree

784
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,160
of decorum.

785
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,400
Right.

786
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,460
Back then you couldn't.

787
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,660
Now you have to.

788
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:23,840
Yeah.

789
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,040
Like you can't,

790
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,420
they don't even hear you talking

791
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,820
unless you're visibly

792
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,700
wetting your pants.

793
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,900
All you're yelling at them.

794
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,400
It's just the way

795
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,200
things are today.

796
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,680
The world's gone to hell.

797
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,480
I tell you,

798
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,200
this country,

799
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,080
this country,

800
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,080
oh my God,

801
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,660
what's happening

802
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,420
to this country?

803
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,240
If only it could be wonderful

804
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,540
like it was back in,

805
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:43,800
oh,

806
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,220
I don't know,

807
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,020
1929,

808
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,260
back in the good old days.

809
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,660
Yeah,

810
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,420
back in the good old

811
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,220
Dust Bowl days.

812
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,200
Oh,

813
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,340
Bill Hicks had a good,

814
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,440
Bill Hicks had a really

815
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,400
good comeback for

816
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,460
when somebody would go,

817
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,960
spare change.

818
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,680
Bill Hicks would say,

819
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,480
no thanks.

820
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:58,900
I'll pay you back.

821
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,340
I've got some.

822
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,700
I tried that on a guy

823
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,440
not being very original.

824
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,260
I mean,

825
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,980
but the guy left himself open.

826
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,200
He goes,

827
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,740
spare change.

828
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,100
I go,

829
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,520
no thanks.

830
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,200
I walked into the store

831
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,800
and when I came back

832
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,480
out of the store,

833
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:12,920
the guy goes,

834
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,180
oh,

835
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,360
well,

836
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:13,740
hey buddy,

837
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,420
I didn't mean I wanted

838
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,240
to give you spare change.

839
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,840
I wanted you to give me

840
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,960
spare change.

841
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,000
He wanted to make sure

842
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,580
I understood,

843
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,200
you know.

844
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,940
He thought it was funny

845
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,900
that I had missed

846
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,380
understood what he was saying,

847
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:30,780
you know.

848
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,680
I guess I wasn't,

849
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,580
he thought I wasn't

850
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,700
sophisticated enough

851
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,620
to understand that was

852
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,480
a request,

853
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,580
not an offer.

854
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,980
Did you ever make

855
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,860
the mistake of having

856
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,480
somebody say,

857
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,260
I'm a war vet

858
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,420
and I can't walk very well,

859
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,680
can you give me a ride home?

860
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,360
Oh boy.

861
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,620
I can,

862
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,820
you can burn a lot of gas

863
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,920
and sometimes you want

864
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,760
to go to beer joints

865
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,420
along the way

866
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,180
and they want you to buy

867
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,560
them beers and stuff like that.

868
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,820
Well, see,

869
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,020
they never got that far

870
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,820
with me, Dave,

871
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,680
because as,

872
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,480
as Princess Wee

873
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,140
will attest,

874
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,040
I'm mean.

875
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,360
Yes,

876
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,660
he's mean.

877
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,240
I'm good, though.

878
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:05,900
I'm not,

879
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,480
I'm not bad.

880
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,260
I'm mean,

881
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,860
but I'm not bad.

882
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,920
I'm actually good.

883
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm like Batman.

884
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,520
Batman's mean, too,

885
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,420
but he ultimately,

886
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,540
you'd rather have him

887
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,260
on your side.

888
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:16,900
Right.

889
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,780
Well, I was thinking that,

890
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:17,960
yeah,

891
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,800
there's the perfect

892
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,400
panhandling rules

893
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,460
is to shred up

894
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,400
a Batman suit,

895
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:23,840
you know,

896
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,440
make it look like

897
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,160
he's been sleeping in

898
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,980
for a couple weeks

899
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,500
and stuff.

900
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,160
I'm following

901
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,520
it hard,

902
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:28,880
but there are times,

903
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,340
Robin.

904
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,420
Oh, you're not Robin.

905
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,880
You need help

906
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,900
finding the Batmobile

907
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,520
to get back

908
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,720
to New Jersey somehow.

909
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,800
The Batmobile's all...

910
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,720
Actually, you know,

911
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,620
the sad thing was

912
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,260
I kind of knew

913
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:43,980
a Batman

914
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,140
in that situation

915
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,300
back in Dallas.

916
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,520
I mean,

917
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,140
I know a guy

918
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,520
who dressed as Robin

919
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,040
and he had a Batmobile.

920
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,140
It was Reverend Bucknaked,

921
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,980
former Pastor Bucknaked,

922
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,580
I should say.

923
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
He wanted to make sure

924
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,620
everyone knows

925
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,640
that he invented

926
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,780
the Church of the Subgenius,

927
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,560
but he didn't want to have

928
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,840
anything to do with it anymore.

929
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,660
There's dozens of people

930
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,080
who invented

931
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,540
the Church of the Subgenius,

932
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,540
but they don't want to have

933
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,700
anything to do with it anymore

934
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,600
because of all those

935
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,260
other people.

936
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,040
Yeah.

937
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,840
How could anybody

938
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,120
be so insipid

939
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,680
as to think

940
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,020
they invented something

941
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,920
that was already invented

942
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,040
by the U.S. government

943
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,340
72 years ago?

944
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,020
Yes.

945
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,160
Dave!

946
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,880
Oh, I've got

947
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,540
delay dump.

948
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,340
I'll just dump that.

949
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,680
No, I'm just...

950
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,660
I'm just...

951
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:28,660


952
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:28,660


953
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:28,660


954
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:28,660


955
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:28,660


956
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:28,660


957
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:28,660


958
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,100
There!

959
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,480
No one heard it.

960
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:30,940
Well, I mean, look

961
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,980
what it did for L. Ron Hubbard.

962
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,140
It made him rich and famous

963
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,840
and it hasn't been

964
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,900
a damn thing for years.

965
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,060
J.R. Bob Dobbs

966
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,800
invented the Church

967
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,660
of the Subgenius

968
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,640
upon his immaculation

969
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,760
at the hand of

970
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,440
Jehovah One,

971
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,420
alien space god

972
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,120
from a corporate

973
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,000
sin galaxy.

974
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,020
Okay.

975
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,160
Yes, we know this.

976
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,320
It says that

977
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,000
right there in Arise,

978
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,940
the Subgenius video.

979
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,400
I'm a believer, man.

980
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,600
I believe you.

981
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,260
Yeah, we're all believers here.

982
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,240
We're believing

983
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,360
Justin Bieber.

984
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:04,980
We're believers.

985
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,280
Actually, I didn't even know

986
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,600
what that Justin Bieber guy

987
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,440
looked like.

988
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,520
And then I realized,

989
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,700
oh, that cute girl

990
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,520
that keeps showing

991
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,880
on those magazine covers,

992
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,040
that's Justin Bieber?

993
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,840
Oh, I thought she was

994
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,660
kind of cute.

995
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,080
Kind of a mannish,

996
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,460
a little bit mannish looking.

997
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,140
I mean...

998
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,460
Yeah, right.

999
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:27,960
He is.

1000
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,020
A primate looked at you.

1001
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:30,700
Do you hear what he's saying?

1002
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,880
He said he looked like a mandrill.

1003
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,280
And you meant it, too.

1004
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,760
No, that's when I saw

1005
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,520
him from behind.

1006
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,980
How could you miss that?

1007
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,240
That bright purple.

1008
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,760
Yeah, you want to make sure

1009
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,440
it misses you.

1010
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,100
I've always wanted

1011
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,020
a purple stranger.

1012
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,340
I always thought

1013
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,100
that would be the...

1014
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,100
You know, that would be

1015
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,080
a real manhood thing

1016
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,980
if we were a culture

1017
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,940
that understood our roots.

1018
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,760
You know, that humanity

1019
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,480
was really not space aliens,

1020
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,260
but a bunch of monkeys

1021
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,820
that drank radioactive water

1022
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,120
sometime around the same era.

1023
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,480
Oh, Dave.

1024
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,080
Era.

1025
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,400
Epic is Gojira.

1026
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,920
You think that we should...

1027
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,000
I hate to ask this,

1028
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,260
but have you checked

1029
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,500
your sphincter lately?

1030
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,680
Because...

1031
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,220
Are you sure it's not purple?

1032
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,160
I do check my sphincter regularly

1033
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,080
and I'm proud to admit

1034
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,980
that I've had it

1035
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,920
scooting around a lot.

1036
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:27,920


1037
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:27,920


1038
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,240
It's nice.

1039
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,960
By public officials

1040
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,280
and various members

1041
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,160
of the Department of Inclusion.

1042
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,140
And then it passed mustard,

1043
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:36,840
you say?

1044
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,600
I hate it when a minute

1045
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,580
passes mustard.

1046
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,620
It probably burns.

1047
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,340
Of course it does.

1048
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,340
That's why they cut it

1049
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,180
to the pan.

1050
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,620
Oh, my God.

1051
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,780
How stupid.

1052
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,980
And I was the one

1053
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,020
who had to say it.

1054
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,480
And I would cry.

1055
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,900
I learned a new term

1056
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,060
the other day.

1057
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,980
What was it?

1058
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,700
Benign prostate hyperphagia.

1059
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,940
Did I already say that

1060
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,620
on the radio

1061
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,040
or was that just a phone call

1062
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,700
earlier today?

1063
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:08,620
No.

1064
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,160
You said it for the first time

1065
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,320
just the other day, though.

1066
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,000
I heard it.

1067
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,520
Philo told me about it.

1068
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:14,940
Yes.

1069
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:15,980
My doctor,

1070
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,400
Dr. Philo Drummond.

1071
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,820
He gave me an exam

1072
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,900
and charged me a lot of money.

1073
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,300
And then he told me that word

1074
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,020
and he said,

1075
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,740
but there's nothing

1076
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,540
you can do about it.

1077
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,200
So, you know,

1078
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,520
simply,

1079
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:27,940
I mean,

1080
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,380
he goes,

1081
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,860
leaning to one side helps me.

1082
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,360
Well, I thought

1083
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,280
you could use needles

1084
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,020
to decompress

1085
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,600
some of the,

1086
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,240
you know,

1087
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,680
some of the more vapid rumors

1088
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,820
going around there.

1089
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,600
They did that to Pappy

1090
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,440
back in the day.

1091
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,760
They did use a needle.

1092
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,320
And, you know,

1093
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,620
then there's the glass rod

1094
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,460
ramming routine

1095
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,440
that Papa Joe Mama

1096
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,140
referred to

1097
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,600
a couple of rants back.

1098
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,980
They used the needle

1099
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,240
on his hyperphagia?

1100
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,500
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1101
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,200
No.

1102
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,480
But it was related.

1103
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,180
Oh.

1104
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,820
Hyperphagia means,

1105
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,360
I think,

1106
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,120
swollen,

1107
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:00,780
growing,

1108
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,100
lumpy.

1109
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,480
Not shrinking.

1110
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,340
It means not shrinking.

1111
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:06,880
Ah.

1112
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,680
Extended.

1113
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,700
But you could do

1114
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,300
the same thing,

1115
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:11,760
I suppose,

1116
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,940
riding on a horse

1117
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,760
without a saddle

1118
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,580
and a meat cleaver

1119
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,980
hooked up to

1120
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,060
the right area.

1121
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,320
But only a few of,

1122
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,220
well, the original

1123
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,780
Siberians,

1124
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,120
you know,

1125
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,780
the examiner,

1126
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,680
the examiner,

1127
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,900
the examiner,

1128
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:27,900


1129
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:27,900


1130
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:27,900


1131
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:27,900


1132
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:27,900


1133
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:27,900


1134
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:27,900


1135
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:27,900


1136
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:27,900


1137
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,500
the original,

1138
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:28,880
you know,

1139
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,020
the original Siberian.

1140
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,580
A snail

1141
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,020
crawling along

1142
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,900
the edge

1143
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,100
of a straight razor.

1144
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,100
He used to ride their back

1145
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,680
and never,

1146
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,880
never had an example

1147
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,540
of the same type

1148
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,540
of hyperphagia.

1149
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,700
A snail

1150
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,180
crawling along

1151
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,000
the edge

1152
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,980
of a straight razor.

1153
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,220
Now, you're making

1154
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,980
little reptile jokes

1155
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,060
about my family

1156
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,520
and stuff.

1157
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,280
Or about my genetic,

1158
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:54,640
my,

1159
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:55,900
my spirit.

1160
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,880
No, I'm being a poet.

1161
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,620
No.

1162
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:57,900
I'm being a poet.

1163
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,020
I'm quoting the great poet

1164
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,200
Colonel Kurtz.

1165
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,940
A snail crawling

1166
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,040
along the edge

1167
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,500
of a straight razor.

1168
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,760
Oh, yeah, man.

1169
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,800
And I couldn't come back,

1170
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,640
like, what's his name?

1171
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,400
All I could think of

1172
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:09,840
was, like,

1173
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,660
mango pudding

1174
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,220
or something

1175
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,300
and tigers and stuff.

1176
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,020
That's okay.

1177
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,880
Stay on the boat.

1178
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,820
Don't get off the boat.

1179
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,600
That's the lesson

1180
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,240
of the tiger.

1181
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,360
Right.

1182
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,340
That was the button

1183
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,140
I was going to push.

1184
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,580
I wasn't even

1185
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,660
in the right terminal.

1186
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,660
You know,

1187
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,360
we're quoting

1188
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,660
from Apocalypse Now

1189
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,660
for the youngsters.

1190
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,140
You know,

1191
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,420
my buddies

1192
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,060
who served

1193
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,060
in Vietnam

1194
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,440
or were served,

1195
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,640
as the case might be,

1196
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,940
all told me

1197
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,400
that movies

1198
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,860
like Apocalypse Now

1199
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,160
and Full Metal Jacket

1200
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,240
are full of it.

1201
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,280
Full of Metal Jacket.

1202
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,180
And I,

1203
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,740
I didn't want to hear that

1204
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,780
because, you know,

1205
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:50,960
those,

1206
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,840
those movies

1207
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,460
make the war

1208
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,480
look kind of cool

1209
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,980
and stylish in a way

1210
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,440
because they have

1211
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,500
rock music in them.

1212
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:56,900
Yes.

1213
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,720
And my,

1214
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,320
my friends said,

1215
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:58,540
well,

1216
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,600
even though there was

1217
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,380
the rock music,

1218
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,520
sometimes it wasn't like that.

1219
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,020
And,

1220
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,620
and they were disgusted.

1221
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,440
Like,

1222
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,640
how dare these filmmakers

1223
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,640
not get it right?

1224
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,660
And I'm thinking,

1225
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:09,860
well,

1226
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,280
how right can you get

1227
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,100
a movie?

1228
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,420
And how can that

1229
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,140
in any way

1230
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,320
compare to the reality

1231
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,620
of sweating

1232
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,840
in that foxhole?

1233
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,800
You know,

1234
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:20,840
of course

1235
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,000
they can't get it right.

1236
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,420
No,

1237
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,040
just can't.

1238
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,180
That would hurt too much.

1239
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,920
No movie star

1240
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,500
or director

1241
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,540
is going to do that

1242
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:27,900
if they don't get it right.

1243
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,560
They can help it.

1244
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,120
Although I do,

1245
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,340
I got offered a job

1246
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,420
by one of those guys

1247
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,720
who does like to go

1248
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,520
get shot at.

1249
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,380
It deliberately

1250
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,660
goes into war zones

1251
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,100
to get shot at.

1252
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,880
Mickey Grant,

1253
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:38,920
the movie director,

1254
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,280
called me up

1255
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,480
just last week

1256
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,360
and said he wanted me

1257
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,160
to go to Crimea

1258
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,280
for only a week,

1259
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:45,980
for just a week

1260
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,920
to edit this stuff.

1261
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,420
And I said,

1262
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:47,600
man,

1263
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,560
I don't do that.

1264
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,480
I wouldn't,

1265
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,380
I don't even know

1266
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,360
how to edit anymore.

1267
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,060
Hardly.

1268
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,700
Not pro stuff.

1269
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,960
You'd hire my son.

1270
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,520
I wouldn't want to be

1271
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,240
holed up in a,

1272
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:56,640
in a French,

1273
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,080
uh,

1274
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,340
in a French hotel

1275
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,420
somewhere while the

1276
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,860
bottom of the two floors

1277
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,780
are burning from,

1278
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:01,980
uh,

1279
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,500
Well,

1280
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,920
what Mickey said to me

1281
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,100
is,

1282
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,680
but Doug,

1283
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,000
you're the only person

1284
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,820
who's crazy enough

1285
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,820
to work with me.

1286
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,420
He thinks my name

1287
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:12,920
is Doug.

1288
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,560
He does a great

1289
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,080
imitation of Mickey.

1290
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:16,880
Well,

1291
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,800
Mickey actually

1292
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,780
has done some really,

1293
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,820
really good films.

1294
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,700
I was proud to be

1295
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,340
the editor and writer

1296
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,220
of the Coochie Tunnels.

1297
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,320
And,

1298
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:25,500
uh,

1299
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:25,820
even,

1300
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,240
uh,

1301
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,660
uh,

1302
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:26,900
a,

1303
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,480
a movie called

1304
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,440
China Run.

1305
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,880
These are both documentaries.

1306
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,680
One was filmed in China.

1307
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,940
One was filmed in Vietnam.

1308
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,020
And I didn't go to Vietnam,

1309
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,940
but I did get to go to China.

1310
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,060
And three years

1311
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,000
after the day

1312
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,940
I left a copy of

1313
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,960
Book of the Subgenius

1314
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,020
in Tiananmen Square,

1315
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,280
thousands of students

1316
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,080
were massacred

1317
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,980
in that very spot.

1318
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,940
Three years to the day.

1319
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,560
And it's about 25,

1320
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,840
we're about to come

1321
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,020
to the 25th anniversary

1322
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,580
of the Tiananmen Square

1323
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,760
street party.

1324
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,060
Right,

1325
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,020
right on the mittens,

1326
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,280
George.

1327
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,260
You got it.

1328
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,140
Yep.

1329
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,380
And I read today

1330
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,080
there were students

1331
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,240
in China saying,

1332
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,520
we are protest

1333
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,560
for democracy.

1334
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:08,900
But,

1335
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,540
don't they know

1336
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,240
what happens?

1337
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:13,860
Well,

1338
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,400
they don't quite

1339
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,260
understand.

1340
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,400
I guess a lot of those

1341
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:16,940
people wearing

1342
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,980
the Statue of Liberty

1343
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,680
costumes

1344
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,220
had failed

1345
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:20,980
to produce

1346
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,980
a popular ID

1347
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,680
when they were

1348
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,340
renting them.

1349
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,820
And they didn't pay

1350
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,360
for the,

1351
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:25,680
um,

1352
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,620
the suitcase

1353
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,760
or any other

1354
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,500
accoutrements

1355
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,220
they had to wear

1356
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,060
and stuff like that.

1357
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,340
And they were told

1358
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:31,860
that they would

1359
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,640
probably be shot

1360
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,320
if they were walking

1361
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:33,960
around like that.

1362
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,040
Oh, God,

1363
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,060
the footage of all

1364
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,620
those people

1365
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,300
dressed in

1366
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,060
Statue of Liberty

1367
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,420
costumes with blood

1368
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,360
running out of them

1369
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,240
strewn across

1370
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,000
Tiananmen Square

1371
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,100
and Kent State

1372
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,660
campus.

1373
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,020
That was just

1374
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,480
horrible.

1375
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:46,960
That simultaneous

1376
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,300
massacres

1377
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,660
last week

1378
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,700
at Kent State

1379
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,800
and Tiananmen Square

1380
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,620
of everyone

1381
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,880
trying to sell

1382
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,560
you their,

1383
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,360
uh,

1384
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,920
tax and accounting

1385
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,540
skills

1386
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,640
dressed in a

1387
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,000
Statue of Liberty

1388
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,480
outfit.

1389
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,840
All those corpses

1390
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,520
laying there

1391
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,680
moaning and bleeding

1392
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,560
in China

1393
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,420
and Ohio.

1394
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,480
Now,

1395
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:08,940
there was only

1396
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,200
four dead in Ohio,

1397
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:10,980
but it was

1398
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,040
4,000 dead

1399
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,640
in China.

1400
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,320
Well,

1401
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,680
this is a real story

1402
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,560
I'm going to tell you

1403
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:16,920
right now.

1404
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,600
A friend of mine

1405
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,280
who also worked

1406
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:19,740
in China

1407
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,420
like you did

1408
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,020
many times,

1409
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,320
he said the number

1410
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,820
could have been

1411
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,460
as high as

1412
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,380
800,000,

1413
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,340
maybe even a million.

1414
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,600
I guess towards the end.

1415
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,020
What?

1416
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,980
Are you talking about

1417
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,080
the Cultural Revolution

1418
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,240
or Tiananmen Square?

1419
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,620
I'm talking about

1420
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,540
Tiananmen Square.

1421
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,220
He claimed that

1422
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,640
they didn't let the word

1423
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,520
get out too much

1424
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,080
and you know how

1425
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,760
they got all the

1426
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,140
National Guards

1427
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:39,440
and they were all

1428
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,260
hopped up saying

1429
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:40,920
that, you know,

1430
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,700
nobody was going to

1431
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,500
get free education

1432
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,380
and that the

1433
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,180
capitalists were

1434
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:45,620
coming back

1435
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,340
and all this stuff

1436
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:46,840
like that.

1437
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,400
And if you didn't,

1438
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,120
anyway,

1439
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,520
so they got those

1440
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,540
people all riled up

1441
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,100
and then they told

1442
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:52,660
them a bunch of

1443
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,160
other junk

1444
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:53,980
and I guess

1445
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,180
towards the last,

1446
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,480
the end of it,

1447
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,220
they went nuts.

1448
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,400
Are you talking about

1449
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,240
the soldiers that

1450
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,040
were sent in there?

1451
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,520
The soldiers.

1452
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,360
The soldiers.

1453
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,440
The Chinese,

1454
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,600
actually,

1455
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,520
what I understood

1456
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,260
was that

1457
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
the government

1458
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,260
first told

1459
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:11,700
local

1460
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,640
cop soldiers

1461
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,540
to go in

1462
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,160
and kill these

1463
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:15,580
students

1464
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,920
and they balked.

1465
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,100
They wouldn't do it.

1466
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,000
Yeah,

1467
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,280
they had to

1468
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:19,280


1469
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,980
So they brought in

1470
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,820
soldiers from

1471
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,180
the rural areas

1472
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,140
who automatically

1473
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,420
hated these

1474
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,280
effete intellectual

1475
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,800
capitalist college

1476
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,860
students who wanted

1477
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,540
democracy.

1478
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:31,880
Yeah,

1479
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,460
they got them out

1480
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,240
from out in the sticks

1481
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:33,900
and they told them

1482
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,080
all kinds of crazy stuff.

1483
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,260
And they shot them up

1484
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:36,980
with speed.

1485
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,680
They gave them

1486
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,760
a whole ton of speed

1487
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,360
and said,

1488
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,040
go in there

1489
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:41,940
and mow them down,

1490
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,360
boys.

1491
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,200
Get them Yankees.

1492
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,700
Get them smart-alecky

1493
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,820
effete New York Yankees

1494
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,680
from Beijing.

1495
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:50,940
Beijingies.

1496
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,220
Well,

1497
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:53,880
I mean,

1498
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,980
there is,

1499
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:55,480
there is a difference

1500
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,260
between that

1501
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,000
and the National Guardsmen

1502
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,840
in the United States

1503
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,580
at Kent State.

1504
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,100
They're 20 years apart.

1505
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:03,580
No,

1506
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,000
10 years.

1507
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:05,900
Seems

1508
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,080
so long ago.

1509
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:08,780
Oh, well.

1510
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,100
44 years ago

1511
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,160
was when Kent State

1512
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,860
was like

1513
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,880
at the beginning of May

1514
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,580
and some kind of

1515
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,720
I guess

1516
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,280
in some

1517
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,280
bizarre

1518
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,060
sub-browser

1519
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:18,400
relations

1520
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,660
in the beginning

1521
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:21,140
of May

1522
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:21,920
is when you also

1523
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,620
dance between

1524
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,560
dancing around

1525
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,180
the Maypole

1526
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:24,800
and then you

1527
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,120
dance around

1528
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:25,440
and sacrifice

1529
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,140
some young studs,

1530
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:27,680
you know,

1531
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,860
or young women's,

1532
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,600
young virgins,

1533
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,060
you know,

1534
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,500
and that's how

1535
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,040
you do it.

1536
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,060
Are you talking

1537
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:34,920
about Starwood

1538
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,780
or Kent State?

1539
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,580
Because there is

1540
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,420
a slight difference

1541
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,800
between those two things.

1542
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:40,860
No,

1543
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,240
I was talking

1544
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,060
about Kent State

1545
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:42,440
originally,

1546
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,560
but I don't really

1547
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,080
see the,

1548
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,560
how it relates

1549
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,420
to Starwood.

1550
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,320
Well,

1551
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,020
the virgins

1552
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:48,820
and the states

1553
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,860
and the burnings

1554
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,520
and the birds.

1555
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:51,300
There's nothing

1556
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,080
like that

1557
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:52,780
at Starwood

1558
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,240
Reverend's.

1559
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:53,600
Right,

1560
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:53,800
I know,

1561
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,620
there's no virgins.

1562
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:55,820
There's no virgins?

1563
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,220
Yeah,

1564
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:56,460
there are.

1565
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,000
There are.

1566
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:58,100
Well,

1567
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:58,560
there are,

1568
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,300
but they don't

1569
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,000
want to be

1570
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,780
much in the same

1571
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,380
way you and I

1572
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,000
wanted to be

1573
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,780
for so long.

1574
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,160
I've wanted

1575
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,980
to be a virgin

1576
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,840
so bad.

1577
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,260
Oh,

1578
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,360
how I wanted

1579
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,180
to be a virgin.

1580
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,200
I wanted

1581
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,480
to be a protozoid.

1582
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:14,880
First of all,

1583
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:15,240
I wanted

1584
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:15,600
to just be

1585
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,180
a protein

1586
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:16,880
type of,

1587
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,580
an enzyme

1588
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,240
or something

1589
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:19,880
like that,

1590
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,280
you know?

1591
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,200
That's a good start.

1592
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,060
You know,

1593
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,160
maybe agitate

1594
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:24,620
the enzyme

1595
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:25,060
a little,

1596
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:25,820
and put some

1597
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,040
nice

1598
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,180
sedoxidide

1599
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,840
in it,

1600
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,960
and the next thing

1601
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,280
you know,

1602
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:30,640
you've got

1603
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,120
fertilizer,

1604
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,260
and that's how

1605
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,220
methane is created

1606
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:33,720
when people

1607
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,220
were born.

1608
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,180
And yeah,

1609
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:35,420
right,

1610
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:35,820
and the next

1611
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,280
thing you know,

1612
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,340
Babby is formed,

1613
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,680
and then Babby

1614
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,520
wants to reproduce,

1615
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,760
and you've got

1616
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,420
a whole life

1617
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,380
of,

1618
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,540
a whole planet

1619
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,340
full of life.

1620
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,380
And villages.

1621
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,900
A whole planet

1622
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,600
full of villages.

1623
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,640
Of umbilicus

1624
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,000
diseases?

1625
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,020
And villages

1626
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,100
full of umbilical

1627
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,080
cords being

1628
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,020
bitten by their

1629
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:55,580
mothers.

1630
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,480
I know,

1631
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:56,740
I just

1632
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,380
like thinking

1633
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,740
and placentas

1634
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,020
being devoured,

1635
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:01,980
and that's why

1636
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:02,660
it takes a whole

1637
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,520
village to eat

1638
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,060
a child.

1639
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,060
A really fat

1640
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:07,560
child.

1641
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,240
I mean,

1642
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,000
a skinny child

1643
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,540
probably just

1644
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,340
feed a family.

1645
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,580
Radio for

1646
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,100
the future

1647
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:16,580
times.

1648
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:18,560
No,

1649
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:18,960
there won't

1650
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,560
be any future

1651
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:19,900
times.

1652
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:20,180
There won't

1653
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:20,940
be any radio

1654
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:21,620
in the future,

1655
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,060
and there won't

1656
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:22,740
be any future.

1657
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:23,680
There'll just

1658
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,160
be people

1659
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:24,640
with implants,

1660
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:25,600
and their brain's

1661
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,100
walking around

1662
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,020
talking to themselves

1663
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,400
and thinking that

1664
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:28,780
they're talking

1665
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,500
to other people.

1666
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,900
And just as we

1667
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:31,660
were talking about

1668
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,480
a little bit before

1669
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:32,980
about people

1670
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,760
talking with their

1671
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,120
thumbs,

1672
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,120
don't you think

1673
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:35,740
that's a rather

1674
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,200
primitive-looking

1675
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,280
Neanderthal-ish

1676
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,340
type of way

1677
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:39,920
of expressing

1678
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,380
yourself?

1679
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,340
Thumbs.

1680
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,000
I mean,

1681
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:43,260
they are

1682
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,340
prehensile stuff.

1683
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,320
Well,

1684
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,600
not if you have

1685
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,040
an iPhone

1686
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,200
or something

1687
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:49,880
like that.

1688
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:50,400
One of those

1689
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:50,860
machines,

1690
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,440
those iPads

1691
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:53,960
or whatever

1692
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,760
that you can

1693
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:54,840
use.

1694
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:55,920
I don't want

1695
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:55,940
to be a machine

1696
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,700
anymore.

1697
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,600
I don't want

1698
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,840
to be a machine.

1699
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,840
But I do get

1700
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,280
the impression

1701
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:02,920
they think

1702
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,500
they're talking

1703
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,520
to other people

1704
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,600
or, you know,

1705
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,040
they're sending

1706
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,280
these little messages

1707
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,920
and texts

1708
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,480
and making

1709
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,220
little videos

1710
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:09,920
and selfies

1711
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,840
and pushing

1712
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,660
the send button,

1713
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:12,280
and I think

1714
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,200
they actually think

1715
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,380
that it's going

1716
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,300
to other people

1717
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,580
and that there

1718
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,660
are other people

1719
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,060
and that the world

1720
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,380
outside of that machine

1721
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,060
is real,

1722
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,100
sort of.

1723
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:22,620
Not that they're

1724
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,820
very interested in it.

1725
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,560
They're more

1726
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,300
interested in the world

1727
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,200
inside the machine.

1728
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,460
So what's the difference,

1729
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:28,900
you ask?

1730
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,260
So since they don't know

1731
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,140
they're in the matrix,

1732
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,000
why wake them up?

1733
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:34,840
Why wreck it for them?

1734
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,040
If the placebo

1735
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:36,860
is working,

1736
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,240
why did the church

1737
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,100
of the subgenius

1738
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:39,620
come along

1739
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,360
and wreck it?

1740
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:40,720
Yeah.

1741
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,800
Yes, this is the moral,

1742
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,040
like, this is the moral

1743
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,220
crisis that we

1744
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,420
all face,

1745
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,020
especially those

1746
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:48,620
of us who

1747
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:49,820
have no faith.

1748
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:50,700
Ha ha ha ha.

1749
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,380
Just a little

1750
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,460
joke there,

1751
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,760
but for those of us

1752
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,160
who cannot,

1753
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:54,540
you know,

1754
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:54,540


1755
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:54,540


1756
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:54,540


1757
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:54,540


1758
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:54,800
be seen,

1759
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:55,740
so to speak,

1760
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,220
this is the crisis

1761
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:57,900
we face.

1762
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,080
Yeah.

1763
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,860
Wake up,

1764
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:02,680
sleeple,

1765
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,760
says each

1766
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,660
of the robots

1767
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,820
laying side by side

1768
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,660
inside their

1769
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,060
canisters,

1770
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,460
all the copper tops

1771
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,200
saying in unison,

1772
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,280
a million copper tops

1773
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,600
at once in unison

1774
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,160
saying,

1775
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:18,920
wake up,

1776
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,060
sleeple.

1777
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:21,840
Only they say

1778
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,560
sheeple

1779
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:22,900
because

1780
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,060
sheeple

1781
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,120
because they've been

1782
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,300
because they're not

1783
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,580
as funny as we are,

1784
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,560
as we is.

1785
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,940
That was we,

1786
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,180
that was a we line,

1787
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,300
wake up, sleeple.

1788
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,680
Where was that one

1789
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,760
all their lives?

1790
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,640
It was still

1791
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,600
in the design room,

1792
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,140
you know,

1793
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,160
where everything goes

1794
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:40,740
to wait

1795
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:41,820
to be

1796
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,000
messed with

1797
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,200
and refurbished

1798
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,720
and reproduced

1799
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,540
a thousand times

1800
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,620
and decloned.

1801
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,460
That's where it went.

1802
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,120
Right.

1803
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:50,780
It's stuck there.

1804
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,660
You mean,

1805
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,240
right, yeah,

1806
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,060
it goes right into

1807
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:53,940
the hour of slack.

1808
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:54,040
Yeah.

1809
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:54,800
Where we just keep

1810
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,340
saying the same thing

1811
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,200
over and over and over.

1812
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,000
Goes into the

1813
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,960
hyper-facet cloud.

1814
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:00,800
Wake up, sleeple.

1815
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,120
Wake up, sleeple.

1816
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,920
Like that whole crowd

1817
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,360
of people going,

1818
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,000
we are abnormals.

1819
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,180
We are abnormals.

1820
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,260
Sad.

1821
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,580
And the leader is,

1822
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,560
the leader is standing

1823
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,640
there on a screen

1824
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,100
going,

1825
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,620
I can't believe

1826
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,040
I can't believe

1827
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,800
you're still doing this.

1828
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,160
And the people down below

1829
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,340
go in unison,

1830
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,580
neither can we.

1831
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,320
What a nightmare.

1832
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,180
And all the while

1833
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,920
the monsters are drooling

1834
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,640
down their necks

1835
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,360
behind them.

1836
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,280
They can't see them.

1837
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,980
Not the ones dancing

1838
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,340
in front can't see them.

1839
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,740
No, not the maypole goddesses.

1840
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,040
Can't see them either.

1841
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,780
Everything is occluded.

1842
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,000
Occluded.

1843
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:52,860
Occult.

1844
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,380
Hidden.

1845
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,020
Occult.

1846
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:54,160
Occult.

1847
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:54,540
Yeah.

1848
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,520
It is occulted

1849
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,700
by the cult of

1850
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,960
of secrecy.

1851
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:00,700
Yeah, that's it.

1852
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,440
Secrecy.

1853
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,720
The cult of secrecy.

1854
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,540
Which is the ultimate secret.

1855
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,660
And that's what's

1856
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:07,360
protected here.

1857
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:07,900
And that's why

1858
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,180
Bob Dobbs

1859
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,360
will never say

1860
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,220
an honest word

1861
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,200
in his damn life.

1862
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:12,880
Cannot.

1863
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,120
Well, he always lies

1864
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:15,740
and

1865
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,360
and so forth.

1866
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:18,500
I mean,

1867
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,720
he always lies

1868
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,920
and he's always right.

1869
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,000
Isn't that the old

1870
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,380
line of Bob's?

1871
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,800
There was George

1872
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,680
Tirebiter

1873
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,720
never lied

1874
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,020
and was always right.

1875
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,380
But Bob Dobbs

1876
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,360
always lied

1877
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,360
and still was

1878
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,240
always right.

1879
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,980
Well, George Tirebiter

1880
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,740
was running for

1881
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:36,060
dog

1882
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,260
sniffer

1883
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,580
or dog

1884
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,320
He was running

1885
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,220
for Schickelgruber

1886
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,020
at one point.

1887
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,000
Well, yeah,

1888
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,100
he had a lot

1889
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:43,380
of different

1890
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,280
noms to plume.

1891
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,360
He'd been a movie actor,

1892
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:46,740
you know,

1893
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:47,520
a child actor

1894
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,780
and then a has-been

1895
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,540
and then he was

1896
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,120
a president

1897
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,560
and then he was

1898
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,340
in a box.

1899
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:53,880
A little dog.

1900
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:54,020
Yeah.

1901
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:54,020


1902
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:54,020


1903
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:54,020


1904
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,620
And his wife

1905
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,620
was running things.

1906
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,940
Mrs. Tirebiter.

1907
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,040
She was pretty good

1908
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,300
in Donovan's

1909
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:00,840
frame.

1910
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,520
I'm sorry.

1911
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,340
So what do you think

1912
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,680
about Edward the Snowman?

1913
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:08,480
Do you think he's

1914
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:08,840
a traitor

1915
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,820
or a hero?

1916
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,320
I think he's

1917
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:11,880
an occidental

1918
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,580
platooner.

1919
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,540
I think he's a

1920
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,960
I think he's

1921
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,700
a crypto

1922
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,700
Pomeranian,

1923
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,160
you say.

1924
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,780
He suffocates

1925
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:20,320
the innocence

1926
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,080
out of us

1927
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:21,760
small child

1928
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,880
out of us

1929
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,020
innocent youthful

1930
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:24,700
people.

1931
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:26,700
No, I think

1932
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,940
he's a good man

1933
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,140
because everybody

1934
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:29,860
has to know

1935
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:30,740
about how screwed

1936
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:31,600
up everything is

1937
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,320
to the point of

1938
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,620
wanting to jump

1939
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,200
out the window.

1940
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,660
Well, now see,

1941
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,740
I think he took

1942
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,540
matters into

1943
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,420
his own hands

1944
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,360
in a perhaps

1945
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,200
unwise

1946
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,580
and untoward

1947
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,120
fashion.

1948
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,500
But then

1949
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,420
I'm not there

1950
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,460
and I don't

1951
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,420
I'm not sure

1952
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,800
that I know

1953
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,400
everything.

1954
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,140
Well, it's a

1955
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,020
corporate world

1956
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:53,580
and he's a

1957
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,340
corporate spy.

1958
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,120
I don't know

1959
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,260
how much patriotism

1960
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,440
or nationalism

1961
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,420
or any of that stuff

1962
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,320
or national interest

1963
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,160
really figure into it

1964
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:01,900
in the twisted

1965
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:02,840
convoluted

1966
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,880
areas up there

1967
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,620
where big decisions

1968
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,340
are made.

1969
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:07,860
Right.

1970
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,900
Everybody's a spy

1971
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,160
on some level anyway

1972
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,180
and that's what

1973
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,220
governments are.

1974
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:12,740
They're spies

1975
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,120
on each other.

1976
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,620
I mean, that's the job

1977
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,160
of a government

1978
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:16,860
of government

1979
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,260
is to take over

1980
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,180
other government

1981
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,780
is to be bigger

1982
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,840
or more powerful

1983
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,100
than other governments.

1984
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:23,840
Right.

1985
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,800
I mean, it doesn't

1986
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,400
have anything to do

1987
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:25,900
with the people

1988
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,380
that are being governed.

1989
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:29,740
It has more to do

1990
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,380
with the other governments.

1991
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,980
You mean the accrual

1992
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:34,400
of power?

1993
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,260
That's just the impression

1994
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:37,860
I got.

1995
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,420
Well, you and

1996
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,340
Lenny Reifenshaw

1997
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,580
got a lot in common.

1998
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,360
You watch those

1999
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,420
propaganda films

2000
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:44,760
and

2001
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,840
Watch them?

2002
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,700
Hell, we make them.

2003
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,140
Yep.

2004
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,280
Damn proud of it, too.

2005
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,080
We don't write the news.

2006
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:53,560
We don't know

2007
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:54,340
how we make it.

2008
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,820
I even make my own

2009
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,040
homemade mayonnaise sometimes.

2010
00:52:59,260 --> 00:52:59,560
Wait a minute.

2011
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:00,260
What are we talking about?

2012
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,000
You're the one who works

2013
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:01,620
as a reporter

2014
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:03,340
for a great metropolitan newspaper,

2015
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,200
not me.

2016
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,640
Well, I'm a fanzine editor.

2017
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,820
I'm a hack and a slouch,

2018
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,940
so it doesn't matter.

2019
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,740
And I'm also

2020
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,600
a full-grown woman by...

2021
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,760
I'm just so tired...

2022
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,420
No, I thought you were

2023
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,260
a cub reporter.

2024
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,720
A cub rape porter.

2025
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,340
I'm having my own...

2026
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:21,800
Cub rape reporter.

2027
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:22,780
Ha, ha, ha.

2028
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,420
That's an inside joke.

2029
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:24,260
I accept genius jokes

2030
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,140
because subgeniuses

2031
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,040
are part of rape culture.

2032
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,580
Ha, ha, ha.

2033
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,720
I better not even go there, man.

2034
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,240
I'm better...

2035
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,140
Forget I said that.

2036
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,300
Erase that whole last part.

2037
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:31,900
Okay, thanks.

2038
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:32,960
I'll say hello.

2039
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:33,500
I'll see you over there.

2040
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,560
No, I thought you were

2041
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,560
mentioning the fact

2042
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,520
that you saw my picture

2043
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,020
in the paper

2044
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:38,600
because it's my

2045
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,380
Kenian dose.

2046
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,300
My 15th birthday

2047
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,200
is my kind of like

2048
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:42,960
coming out

2049
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,680
and my TPR Zoom

2050
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,500
and my...

2051
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,140
And a couple

2052
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,300
of the other family members

2053
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,500
are going to give me presents.

2054
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,400
No, I didn't see that.

2055
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:53,400


2056
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,120
because I don't get

2057
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,440
the Pomeranian papers.

2058
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,180
Well, I didn't see it either.

2059
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:57,920
We don't even get

2060
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,780
the Cleveland papers.

2061
00:53:59,240 --> 00:53:59,280
I was wearing

2062
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,060
a plunging gown

2063
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:02,920
and a big

2064
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,740
bouffant...

2065
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:04,740
bouff...

2066
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,420
bouff...

2067
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:05,700
haircut

2068
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,300
and lots and lots

2069
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,140
of shaggy jewelry

2070
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,340
and I looked pretty good

2071
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:13,360
for my ages.

2072
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,940
Okay, okay.

2073
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:18,820
Granted.

2074
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:19,120
I believe that.

2075
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,640
I do believe that.

2076
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,220
I very much believe that.

2077
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,380
Now that we're all

2078
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:25,640
sweating along together,

2079
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,520
let's see if we can

2080
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,860
raise the spirits

2081
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,000
of the evil ones.

2082
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

2083
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,660
I was going to say,

2084
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,100
didn't we do that last week?

2085
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:35,580
Oh, no.

2086
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,480
No, we try to do it

2087
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,440
every week and fail

2088
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,120
miserably.

2089
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,280
Then why don't we try

2090
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,640
raising some mayonnaise?

2091
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,480
Some what?

2092
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,380
Mayonnaise.

2093
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,500
Didn't Mr. White

2094
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,080
teach us in chemistry class

2095
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:51,800
last night

2096
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,740
how to make mayonnaise?

2097
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,080
Yes.

2098
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:54,460
Dave sometimes

2099
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:55,960
makes his own mayonnaise

2100
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,440
using the emulsifier

2101
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,320
of the egg

2102
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,800
along with the vinegar

2103
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,720
and the oil

2104
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,540
that cannot ever merge

2105
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,900
without the emulsifier.

2106
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,040
Mr. White knows everything

2107
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,200
but he talks so fast.

2108
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,280
That's the way to do it.

2109
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:09,880
If you're going to make

2110
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,840
real potato salad,

2111
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,600
why mess around?

2112
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,580
I mean, I know

2113
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,820
going to the store

2114
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:14,380
is easy.

2115
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,600
Why not really do it

2116
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,640
the way they had to do it

2117
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,840
when you had to go

2118
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,820
all the way to Baltimore

2119
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,560
for 10 weeks

2120
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,940
to get the very end stuff?

2121
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:23,820
Yeah.

2122
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,080
Yeah.

2123
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,100
What if you got against

2124
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:26,380
Baltimore?

2125
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:26,860
You want to be a

2126
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:27,320
elliptical thinker?

2127
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,680
Go ahead and see

2128
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,740
if it works for you.

2129
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,080
Die in a gutter somewhere

2130
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,560
bleeding and smelling bad?

2131
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,240
Yeah.

2132
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,980
I said that was

2133
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:43,300
some degree of conviction.

2134
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,320
I mean, a little bit.

2135
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,440
A little bit?

2136
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,500
I guess.

2137
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,320
Yes.

2138
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,640
Oh, I'm sorry, Dave.

2139
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,300
I was distracted.

2140
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,140
I was looking at the machines

2141
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,360
instead of you

2142
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,000
because it's getting

2143
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,800
near the end

2144
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,020
and I thought I'd push

2145
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:02,900
some background music.

2146
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,020
I pushed the wrong one

2147
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,080
but that's okay.

2148
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,420
I don't care.

2149
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,080
But there's no wrong

2150
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,180
and right in this show.

2151
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,500
There's no rhyme or reason.

2152
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,340
Thank goodness.

2153
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,900
That is the one saving grace

2154
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,180
of the hour of slack

2155
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:18,040
from the church

2156
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,260
of the subgenius.

2157
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,400
There is no wrong

2158
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,160
and no right

2159
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,320
and no left.

2160
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,060
And in Bob's left brain,

2161
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,380
nothing is right

2162
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,740
and in his right brain,

2163
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:31,960
there is nothing left.

2164
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,600
And there's definitely

2165
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,660
nothing wrong.

2166
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,200
In the words of Onan.

2167
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,440
No, that was Mr. Wong

2168
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,220
who was an enemy

2169
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:41,260
of Mr. White,

2170
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,840
our chemistry teacher.

2171
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,620
Mr. Wong,

2172
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:45,600
the English teacher,

2173
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,780
really didn't like

2174
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,120
that hard science stuff

2175
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,660
and the math and science guys

2176
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,320
all looked down

2177
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:52,680
on the,

2178
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,320
you know,

2179
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:53,380
the math and science guys

2180
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:53,380


2181
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,080
and the fuzzy subjects

2182
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,620
like English and history.

2183
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,600
Those were the ones

2184
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,400
I was good at.

2185
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,840
The ones you could lie in.

2186
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,100
You could roll around in them.

2187
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,820
You could make your English class

2188
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:05,760
and lie in it

2189
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,680
and roll around in it

2190
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,180
like a dog in a dead thing

2191
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,560
and still come out with an A

2192
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,880
if you could lie slickly enough.

2193
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,620
I should have been a lawyer

2194
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,260
like my dad wanted me to.

2195
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,500
Oh, somebody just called

2196
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,100
the show and said,

2197
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,720
oh, yeah, there are slags.

2198
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,980
He's like Howard Stern

2199
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,760
for eunuchs.

2200
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,240
I didn't think it was funny,

2201
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:27,860
but I laughed.

2202
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:28,800
Where did you hear that?

2203
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,560
That's pretty good.

2204
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:30,980
Howard Stern for eunuchs?

2205
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,040
Yeah.

2206
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,580
You know, that's ironic

2207
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,920
because I consider

2208
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,360
the Howard Stern fans

2209
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,880
to be eunuchs

2210
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,220
who have let Stern

2211
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,720
wear their testicles for them.

2212
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,680
I thought you meant

2213
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,480
the operating system.

2214
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,140
Oh, no.

2215
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,200
Dave would,

2216
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,600
no, this is Dave talking.

2217
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:51,200
He would be using classical.

2218
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,960
I'm not confusing both of them

2219
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,740
as I should be.

2220
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,660
The operating system

2221
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:57,540
is the area down there,

2222
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,940
at least as far as

2223
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,240
many arguments are concerned.

2224
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,180
That's true.

2225
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,540
I guess so.

2226
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,820
I guess so.

2227
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,940
Well, it's coming to show

2228
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,080
end time.

2229
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:11,960
I think all that,

2230
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,640
that clock over there is wrong.

2231
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,180
That clock that the listener

2232
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,660
is looking at, that's wrong.

2233
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:18,720
Is it wrong or Wong?

2234
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:20,360
Yeah.

2235
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,100
Yeah.

2236
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:22,880
Yeah.

2237
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,360
I haven't given the addresses

2238
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,240
of the Church of the Subgenius

2239
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,600
likely, and I should do that.

2240
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:32,820
Bob can be reached by mail

2241
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,280
at post office box

2242
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:36,940
181417

2243
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,880
Cleveland Heights, Ohio

2244
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:42,820
44118.

2245
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,100
And by the way,

2246
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,740
obviously Bob himself

2247
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:47,160
probably won't be going

2248
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,480
to that post office box

2249
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,600
and opening that mail.

2250
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,480
My personal sense...

2251
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,060
Well, Secretary might do that.

2252
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,880
And if she decides

2253
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,520
it's worth passing on to me

2254
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,700
and I pass out,

2255
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,860
Bob may find it on the floor

2256
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:00,880
next to my desk.

2257
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,500
And that's the way

2258
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,600
it's done around here.

2259
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:05,520
Most people do it by internet,

2260
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,620
which is subgenius.com.

2261
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,400
And if you don't know

2262
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,680
how to spell subgenius,

2263
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,940
just Google it, okay?

2264
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:16,880
It will say,

2265
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,880
do you mean subgenius?

2266
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,880
Because it,

2267
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,900
unlike us and you,

2268
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,700
Google is not a subgenius.

2269
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,060
Nor is it an artificial intelligence

2270
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,620
or world brain,

2271
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,180
as the ignoramuses like to think.

2272
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,520
Yep, they think it's a drop

2273
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,820
of water in the great

2274
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,580
cyber ocean.

2275
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:41,120
They do.

2276
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:41,760
Yeah.

2277
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,920
So anyway, friends,

2278
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,980
praise Bob.

2279
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,120
That's what this is all about.

2280
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,200
And by Bob,

2281
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,940
we mean J.R. Bob Dobbs,

2282
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,500
the saint of sales,

2283
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,580
from Dallas, Texas,

2284
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:54,900
or somewhere in the Midwest,

2285
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:55,460
like that.

2286
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,340
The jack-o'-lantern,

2287
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,340
the jack-o'-lady,

2288
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,940
and the squidly man.

2289
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:02,140
Oh, our music in the background earlier

2290
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,900
was from the Rudy,

2291
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,720
the Rusty Schwartz program,

2292
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,400
winter sperm harvest

2293
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,820
of the hot koalas

2294
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:12,760
or something like that.

2295
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:13,360
And also,

2296
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:14,660
we heard a little bit

2297
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,280
of the Psychoskeleton's

2298
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,280
latest instrumental,

2299
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,260
but I'll play that in full next time.

2300
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,100
She couldn't really hear it

2301
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:20,480
in the background.

2302
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,980
And some guy that sounds

2303
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,700
kind of like Jimi Hendrix,

2304
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:25,780
but it couldn't really be him

2305
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,720
because these weren't released

2306
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,780
by Warner Brothers or anyone

2307
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:30,220
or Reprise or anything.

2308
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,260
So anyway,

2309
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:32,500
I'm going to cut to

2310
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,940
the Rudy Schwartz project for real,

2311
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,820
doing a song called

2312
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,840
Quiet Evenings with Gimpy.

2313
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,800
Thanks for calling in, Gimpy.

2314
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,240
Thanks.

2315
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,920
I'm glad to have contributed

2316
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,100
to the wonderful release

2317
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:50,860
for this last few weeks.

2318
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,620
We're gonna give it a take there

2319
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:51,620


2320
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:51,620


2321
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:51,620


2322
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:51,620


2323
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:51,620


2324
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:51,620


2325
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:51,620


2326
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:51,620


2327
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:51,620


2328
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,220
the dying moment

2329
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:52,560
.

2330
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,120
.

2331
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:53,820
.

2332
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:53,820


2333
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:53,840
.

2334
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:53,840


2335
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:53,840


2336
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:53,840


2337
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:53,840


2338
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:53,840


2339
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,000
.

2340
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:57,780
.

2341
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:02,680
Thank you.

2342
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:38,800
Thank you.

2343

Thank you.
