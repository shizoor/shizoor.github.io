1
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:47,180
Bob won't solve your problems, but he will help you to blow them off!

2
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,140
You can't use Bob as a crutch, because he's already using you as a crutch, my friend.

3
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,100
This is the end of the world.

4
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,900
Two Bloody Marys, Deke.

5
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,260
What are you going to do? What is it you want of me?

6
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:08,300
I am going to remove your soul, your mind if you prefer, from your body for a time.

7
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,460
You mean my brain? You're going to take my brain away from me?

8
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,680
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

9
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,720
Oh no, why don't you kill me?

10
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,460
Yes, presents this program.

11
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,680
The star of Heroes, Bob.

12
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,880
The face is finished.

13
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,120
Failure!

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,580
The face is familiar.

15
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,320
Made a different way.

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:30,620
Gosh!

17
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,960
Tonight, Bob, Bob, Bob.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,040
Of course, Bob Zero is a smash in our family. What's new with the show?

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,360
We're all making a little bit of money.

20
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,320
And also, it's been nominated for an Emmy.

21
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:37,780
Oh.

22
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,120
And so is Bob.

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,660
Jack, uh, Bob will vote for you.

24
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:39,980
Bob's out.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,920
Alright, fingers on the buzzer, get ready.

26
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,680
Bob. Ready.

27
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,080
Bob.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,400
Horse.

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,020
Horse. Bob.

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,620
There it is. There it is.

31
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:45,860
Bob.

32
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,200
It's me.

33
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,880
It's not me at all, alright.

34
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,040
Well, Bob, I want to tell you something. That is not the face of Bob.

35
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,440
Horizon. Horizon. Horizon. Horizon.

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,900
Bob. Right. Right. Right. Right.

37
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,820
My stomach feels awful.

38
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:53,820


39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,700
And acid. And acid.

40
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,680
Quick as a wind, you're in the pink.

41
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,340
Bob. Bob.

42
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,080
Bob. Back to you, Bob. This hand's on the buzzer.

43
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,760
Bob. Bob.

44
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,300
Bob. Bob.

45
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,480
Uh, Bob.

46
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,900
Bob. Bob. You did ride a mule there, Bob.

47
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,520
Bob. Right, Bob.

48
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,200
Alright, Bob. You were very good, Bob.

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,760
Except a bug.

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,000
Bob, we're looking for the $500.

51
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,980
Bob knows, Bob. You were very good, Bob.

52
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,580
Try Clark. Try Clark. Taste me. Do you love it?

53
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,260
Bob. Bob.

54
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,960
Come to where the flea is.

55
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:17,980
Come. Come.

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,240
Well, I don't know. Bob, you did quite well.

57
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,880
This has been a Bob production. Stay tuned.

58
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,040
A lot more slack.

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
More slack.

60
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,440
More slack.

61
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,260
Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut.

62
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:25,620
Wow.

63
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,220
Uh.

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,520
Eh.

65
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,780
Hey, didn't I bump into you at the grocery store?

66
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,560
Why did you follow me home to rape me?

67
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,140
Slack. It'll get you higher than any drug.

68
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,760
And it's better than any beverage.

69
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,160
I know that it's better than any other drug.

70
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,940
You know, the conspiracy will stop at nothing.

71
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,140
Stop the message of Bob.

72
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,540
And they work these, uh, time delay recording problems into recording software.

73
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,580
Telephones. Everything.

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,700
And it's cued to go into effect as soon as you start talking about Bob, slack, and the conspiracy.

75
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:01,740
Mechanics.

76
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,120
I don't know if it's one of the mechanics.

77
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,380
I don't know if it's one of the mechanics.

78
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,520
I don't know if it's one of the mechanics.

79
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:05,740
I don't know if it's one of the mechanics.

80
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,920
The mechanic in this little galaxy.

81
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,700
He wanted to keep off.

82
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,540
That's right.

83
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,320
He could, uh, take a spaceship and strip it down to the hell and parts within 27 milliseconds.

84
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,560
That's right.

85
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,180
And you couldn't tell what he was doing either.

86
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,880
It was either there or it wasn't there.

87
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,500
And that's something I just don't understand.

88
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,260
How could it either be there or not be there?

89
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,160
Why isn't there any...

90
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,560
Well, that's what we call escaping from those two toning laws.

91
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:27,660
Bob?

92
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,820
That's your key phrase.

93
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,380
Hi there. Welcome to episode four of Right Where You're Sitting Now.

94
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,860
I'm your host, Ken Eakins, and with me...

95
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,020
Paul Baniker.

96
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,720
Praise Bob.

97
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,480
Praise Bob.

98
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,880
Yeah, we're gonna need Bob's help, I think, for the sound of this episode.

99
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,100
Yeah.

100
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,340
Yeah.

101
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,080
We're gonna do an interview with the one, the only, Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of the Subgenius.

102
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:03,900
And, uh, this interview's gonna be, uh, a little bit less, I guess, serious than the last ones, but it's gonna be funny.

103
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,160
It'll be funny, yeah.

104
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:05,660
It is.

105
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,480
He's a funny guy.

106
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,880
And, uh, yeah.

107
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,720
To sell a religion, you don't need all the answers, my friends.

108
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,360
You only need one good answer, and that answer is Bob.

109
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,220
Bob is the answer that did not wait around for a question.

110
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,080
Praise Bob!

111
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,340
Praise Bob!

112
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,580
That's more like it. That's what I like to hear.

113
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,200
The key to the gateway is his pipe, as it says in God Ecclesians 3.14.

114
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,620
Bob is our self-fulfilling prophet.

115
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,480
And strange and wondrous things happened when you were around Bob.

116
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,340
The blind hear.

117
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,800
The deaf see.

118
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,060
False teeth get swallowed.

119
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,420
Uh, poor families.

120
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,020
Suddenly win the lottery.

121
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,600
And your enemies laugh themselves to death.

122
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,600
Praise Bob!

123
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,200
Praise that man, Bob.

124
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:05,220
Strange Rube Goldberg-type machinery will spring up around him, uh, for instance when he needs a shoe shine or something.

125
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,100
But the thing is, Bob does not plan anything.

126
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,440
He just automatically tunes in to the plan that's already there.

127
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,780
He doesn't think.

128
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,200
He merely knows.

129
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,940
But continuously forgets it.

130
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,480
He only sells and never buys.

131
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,540
He is an economic monopole.

132
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,980
A singularity that could power a whole universe.

133
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,940
But Bob himself doesn't do anything.

134
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,580
The universe does it for him.

135
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,560
Or it does him.

136
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,900
Or he does the wrong thing, but perfectly.

137
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,300
But that's none of the wiser things.

138
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,340
ár

139
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,800
that's

140
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,120
only

141
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,120
the beginning, folks.

142
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,740
Only the beginning.

143
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,800
Because next we have

144
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,300
The old maestro

145
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,680
And all the toys

146
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,980
So help me

147
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,560
Ha ha

148
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:16,780
I love you Bob Bob

149
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,600
I love you Bob Bob

150
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,740
My poor heart's in a real wing ding

151
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,820
What about Bob?

152
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,180
But Bob, what about Bob?

153
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,540
I love you Bob

154
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,900
I love you Bob

155
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,520
Bob

156
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,660
You build me up

157
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,780
By your love

158
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,440
My heart is singing

159
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,340
Here's what it's singing

160
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,340
I love you Bob

161
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,160
We can begin with revival friends

162
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,120
Roll up your sleeves

163
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,320
Bend over, pull out your wallets

164
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,220
Close your eyes

165
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,920
Cause here comes the word of Bob

166
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,120
Now can I get a praise Bob?

167
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,860
Praise Bob

168
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,420
Oh yes I'd love to hear that

169
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,540
That conformity of nonconformists

170
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,240
Isn't it beautiful?

171
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,980
But really, you know, the only thing

172
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,160
Each subgenius has in common

173
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,740
Is that they have nothing in common

174
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,280
With the conspiracy of the normal people

175
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,920
Which we will be getting to

176
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,460
In fact, I don't think we can get out of it

177
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,000
You make me so sick

178
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,220
Boing dad

179
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:17,960
Goomba

180
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,100
What have you been up to lately?

181
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,140
The Nekonomicon

182
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,980
Your daddy's dead

183
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,220
Wearing the recording studio next month

184
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,900
To officially record Gilmore

185
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,520
You make me so sick

186
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,800
No doubt

187
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,020
Kill Bob

188
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,680
To Bob people like you Bob

189
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,920
Where do you want me to come?

190
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,820
Like a dead animal on the side of the road

191
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,360
I destroyed a couple of them here

192
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,940
Kill Bob

193
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,180
I loved it, you know

194
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,840
Are you there?

195
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,400
You never know Bob

196
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,860
I love you and care about you

197
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,600
Kill Bob

198
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,760
Kill Bob

199
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,740
Like a dead animal on the side of the road

200
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,460
Kill Bob

201
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,340
Like a dead animal on the side of the road

202
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,460
Big deal, so what?

203
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,120
You've got me?

204
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,500
You've got me?

205
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,660
Kill Bob

206
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,860
You sound like you've been using an Halex 2

207
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,320
Kill Bob

208
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,620
With maggots creeping out of my mouth

209
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,460
Boombayah

210
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,720
Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth

211
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,420
Hi all

212
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,340
Yeah

213
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,660
Just wanted to talk about the, uh, church of the subgenius

214
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,740
Uh, Bob Dobbs

215
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:21,040
I don't know whether any of you have heard of, um, Bob Dobbs before

216
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,600
Church of the subgenius

217
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,500
If not, I've put a link, yeah, over there for you

218
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:26,500


219
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,180
Um, just click it, you'll see the video

220
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,220
Which I think is really, really funny

221
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,680
It's one of the best videos I've ever seen, actually

222
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,340
I really like it

223
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,100
It appeals to my comedy side

224
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,000
But yeah, I've been into Bob Dobbs for ages

225
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,400
Um, since, uh, the, uh, eighties

226
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,440
Uh, when I was a wee little young, like

227
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,380
And, uh, at the same time I was into the, uh, Screaming Lord Such

228
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,000
Monster Raving Loony Party

229
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,220
Thing

230
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,280
I mean, a lot of kids were

231
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,320
Well, obviously, you know, we were like kiddish, cartoonish sort of things

232
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,120
So, it appealed to us

233
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,660
Uh, but I think the overall message was that no matter how old your body gets

234
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,540
Your mind can still remain fresh

235
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,940
Yeah

236
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,680
And, um, and Bob Dobbs with his subgenius sort of thing

237
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,440
Which would explain, right, in the world of the subgenius, guys

238
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,480
I'm a sub-puncher

239
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:26,900
I'm a pop idol

240
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,320
Anyway, this has been the Thomas Special Television News Report

241
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,720
Um, about the, uh, Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius

242
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,220
Um, so, I'll see you, hopefully, soon

243
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,980
Tonight, hopefully

244
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,480
Uh, livevideo.com

245
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,880
Live show tonight at midnight and every Saturday night

246
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,940
So, um, links on the side, guys

247
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,020
Links on the side

248
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,300
Okay

249
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,740
That's been me

250
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,880
Uh, check out, check it out, guys

251
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,300
It is interesting

252
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,820
But it's funny, to say the least

253
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,820
Anyway

254
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,840
I'll see you in a while

255
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,840
Well, that one was, uh, out of the blue, huh?

256
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,820
I found that clip on YouTube

257
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,660
And it is indeed from something called The Thomas Show

258
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,040
Those British subgeniuses are so polite

259
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,160
And for this hour of Slack number 1184

260
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,360
We're starting to use clips from another British show

261
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,560
The excellent podcast called Right Where You Are Sitting Now

262
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,680
Of which you can find all episodes at sittingnow.co.uk

263
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,160
Including interviews with R.U. Sirius and Douglas Rushkoff

264
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:49,440
And we also have lots of new Norelpref collages of norelpref.com

265
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,380
As well as the beloved Fernanda Nandy-Lemurs

266
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,180
And we have some choice clips of Dr. Hal Philo

267
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,400
And puzzling evidence from the KPFA Berkeley sub show

268
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:05,340
As well as recordings from this year's DeVivals at Starwood Festival and in Baltimore

269
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,180
Actually, I'm holding off on some of the excellent Baltimore rants

270
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,880
Because I'm hoping to get a better recording than what I have so far

271
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,120
Next up is a clip from Starwood

272
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,440
In which I explain what I really don't believe

273
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,020
But first, one thing I insist upon

274
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,260
It's not the subgeniuses

275
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,740
It is mankind, rather

276
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,560
Who insists upon making it difficult for life to exist upon this planet

277
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,840
Now if it were not for birds

278
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,760
Mrs. Barnaby, you don't seem to understand

279
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,040
You don't, now friends, you won't see me dancing around the fire naked

280
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,080
For several reasons

281
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,460
But one of which is that I actually personally don't believe in most of this crap

282
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,680
But last year I remember a friend, Reverend Mowgli said

283
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,700
Reverend Stang, do you really believe in magic?

284
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,660
And I said no

285
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,060
But I was speaking too soon

286
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,380
Because actually I believe in Bob's five keys to magic

287
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,060
The first of which is get off your ass

288
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,880
And that key leads to magical things happening

289
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,060
But even the second key is to bust your ass

290
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,300
But you don't do that for long before you get to the third key

291
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,580
Which is make others bust their ass for you

292
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,980
The fourth one was wash your ass

293
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,480
And the fifth one is of course the most important

294
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,520
Wash your ass

295
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,980
And those are the five keys to magic

296
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,380
Otherwise I don't believe in much

297
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,760
I believe in me, Yoko and me

298
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,040
But as my friend Nuneslow said

299
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,640
Friends, disbelief is a belief too

300
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,280
So you can't get away from it

301
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,260
It seems to go with being a primate

302
00:12:53,260 --> 00:13:02,660
And despite the fact that I'm basically a subgenius, secular, humanist, common scientist

303
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,400
Yet I help run registration here at Starwood

304
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,500
And I bust my ass on that

305
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,400
Because I don't practice what I preach

306
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,520
Because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to

307
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,760
That's what Bob said

308
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,780
You know an atheist

309
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,760
Well, there are many atheists

310
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,540
And they are writing

311
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,860
We have many emotions

312
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,240
The end of faith

313
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,720
The God delusion

314
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,920
God, the failed hypothesis

315
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,760
How science shows that God does not exist

316
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,440
If there's no God there's nothing to say about him

317
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,220
He's good, he's bad, he's indifferent

318
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,500
The God of the Old Testament is the most unpleasant character in all of fiction

319
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,540
He is jealous and proud of it

320
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,900
He's petty and vindictive

321
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,160
He's unjust, he's unforgiving

322
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
He's a racist

323
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,620
Moses is like Hitler

324
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,400
And so forth

325
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,240
This is what's true

326
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,840
What a story

327
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:57,960
Anyway

328
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,360
I was just looking at your Wikipedia page

329
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,640
For subgenius

330
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,120
And it says here that

331
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,000
The subgenia are not humans

332
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,760
But they're actually mutant offspring of forbidden sexual union

333
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,400
That took place millions of years ago

334
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,000
Is this correct?

335
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,780
Right

336
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,760
The aliens that we're concerned with

337
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,160
From planet X

338
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,120
Came to Earth

339
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,520
Just before the end of the age of dinosaurs

340
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,100
Created the Yetis in a test tube

341
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,000
And then the Yetis created humans

342
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,080
To be beasts of burden

343
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,300
Or lab rats

344
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,760
The tragedy is that

345
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,600
The dinosaurs were wiped out

346
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,540
Because of an excess picnic

347
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,740
And the humans escaped from that

348
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,740
And the Yetis' labs

349
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,720
And started interbreeding with

350
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,980
Some of the

351
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,520
Feeble-minded among the Yeti

352
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,860
And thus we see the human race today

353
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,460
A hodgepodge

354
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,300
A mishmash

355
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,760
That's mostly purebred human

356
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,420
I.e. lab rat

357
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,220
Or the partial Yeti genetics

358
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:10,980
And that's

359
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,680
Those are the weirdos

360
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,920
And misfits

361
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,720
And malformed humans

362
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,140
And criminals

363
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,840
That compose the Church of the Subgenius

364
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,700
And we're always looking for new ones

365
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,060
I hardly think that either species

366
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,340
Would have sufficient intelligence

367
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,080
To launch a mass attack

368
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,460
Their brainpans are not big enough

369
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,740
I just came from the school, madam

370
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,620
I don't know anything about their brainpans

371
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,960
But I do

372
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,760
I do know

373
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,640
The very simple thing

374
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,420
We offer

375
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,300
Hope

376
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,520
And

377
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:44,680
And

378
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,180
Orders

379
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,100

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,500

381
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,660
New

382
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,220
Absolutely

383
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,700
Now

384
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,500
F Ple bluetooth

385
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:14,500


386
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:14,500


387
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:14,500


388
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:14,500


389
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:14,760
Yeah.

390
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,360
His body turns into pants.

391
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,760
His body turns into, it morphs into pants.

392
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,040
It morphs into pants, and then it morphs back into monster feet.

393
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,000
Into body, yeah, body feet.

394
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,140
Yeah, that's really something.

395
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,020
And the pants look like they're sort of purple, and they're torn in the same spot.

396
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,400
Yeah, they look sort of durable, you know, work pants.

397
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:30,900
Canvas.

398
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,160
But the pants are part of the monster.

399
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,340
Obviously something he purchased through an internet mail order company.

400
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:42,900
I think they didn't quite know what they were doing when they made that monster, but that's added to it.

401
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,600
That strange, enigmatic nature.

402
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,640
The way the pants morph in and out of the body.

403
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,400
You know, I don't want to complain.

404
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Or maybe it's the body morphing in and out of the pants.

405
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,360
It could be that the pants actually control the air.

406
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,520
I have that chair once.

407
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,580
I don't remember what that was like.

408
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,900
Only when it reaches the bottom.

409
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,840
Oh, no.

410
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,280
Once you reach the ground, for the most part, it stops moving.

411
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,880
Now, some people have actually moved toward the bottom.

412
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,760
My descent has been temporarily interrupted.

413
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,880
You realize you're telling me?

414
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,200
You're telling the truth.

415
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:20,600
Could begin to accelerate once again until you find yourself actually below the ground.

416
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,800
Oh, good Lord.

417
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,500
So much to keep up with.

418
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:32,320
New problems I hadn't anticipated when I've hardly begun to solve the ones that I have left unattended.

419
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,660
And now the music accompanies your situation.

420
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,000
My struggle, my sorrow.

421
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,040
Your sorrow.

422
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,880
And my talent.

423
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,980
And my tacit understanding of the follies of human being.

424
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,820
Your ability to fill out these forms in triplicate.

425
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:57,100
For I have sat at Thebes below the wall and looked upon the lowest of the dead.

426
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,740
You must do the paperwork.

427
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,140
So, file after file was brought in.

428
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,820
Now we don't care about the paperwork, but you must go to the shared drive and open the spreadsheet

429
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,280
and check off the box in column A, Rome.

430
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:19,540
The shield bearing Richard of the 23rd, bearer of the eagles and the imperial standards.

431
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,060
It is your job, your duty.

432
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,060
The siege engines, the giant elephants.

433
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,160
To update this shared drive.

434
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:24,780
And.

435
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,380
Periodically.

436
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,260
Hiram.

437
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,620
A shiftless bum.

438
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,740
Be not Hiram.

439
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,280
A shiftless bum.

440
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:30,780
You got Hiram?

441
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,220
I'll do that.

442
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,220
Yeah, he, he, uh, he was.

443
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,620
Now what if you were a bum, but you were shifty?

444
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:42,140
He was often hired, as his name suggests, for random tasks in the shadow of the mighty armies.

445
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:42,640
Imagine.

446
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,280
Imagine a team made up of shiftless men and shifty men.

447
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,780
Well, they all wore shifts in those days, but.

448
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,400
Some were unable to shift while others could not stop shifting.

449
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,980
Some had to shift for themselves while others were unable even to paddle their own canoe.

450
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:57,980
But some men.

451
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,920
But this was a different world.

452
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,720
In their shiftiness.

453
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,500
A world.

454
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,580
Never stopped shifting.

455
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,660
Lit only by fire.

456
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,500
While others could not shift.

473
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,560
I just want to go back to some of the more technical details of the church, I suppose.

474
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,300
What is a clench?

475
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,780
A clench was a bad idea that Philo and I came up with.

476
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,920
That wasn't Bob's.

477
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:42,180
The idea was that subgeniuses who all live in the same town could get together and have regular meetings,

478
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,860
and strengthen the church that way.

479
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,740
What we did not take into account is that, by definition,

480
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,720
every subgenius is totally different from every other one.

481
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,280
And I mean really different.

482
00:20:54,580 --> 00:21:00,800
The only thing we have in common is that we have nothing at all in common with the conspiracy of the normal people.

483
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,060
So what has happened over and over again is these subgeniuses get together and meet,

484
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,160
and within three or four meetings, they absolutely hate each other.

485
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,740
And it has even come to violence a few times.

486
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,000
So I wish we could remove that section out of the book of the subgenius.

487
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:27,080
That was a money-making scheme that was purely something that Philo and I came up with.

488
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,780
It wasn't doctrinal to Bob.

489
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,380
And I wish I could take it back.

490
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,220
Most subgeniuses work better as what you might call a solo clench.

491
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,020
And our political stance works the same way.

492
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:41,360
Okay.

493
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:49,640
We don't recognize the false divisions of liberal and conservative and so forth anymore.

494
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:56,580
Our political party is called patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism,

495
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,300
which can be summed up with the phrase,

496
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,240
every yard a kingdom.

497
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,260
Yeah.

498
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,500
Or a queendom.

499
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,140
Although usually it's the checkbooks that are the queendom.

500
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,620
Yeah.

501
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,480
In many families.

502
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,160
And in other...

503
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,980
In other words, it's a I don't care, you don't care philosophy.

504
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,280
As long as...

505
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,680
Our neighbors can do any stupid thing they want as long as they stay out of our hair.

506
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,300
Yeah.

507
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Now, that's a simple way of government.

508
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,060
And we would...

509
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:33,000
It may be primitive, but it's fair for the strong.

510
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:39,340
So we want someday for Bob to be made world overlord.

511
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,760
But if Bob is everything he says,

512
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,560
he is...

513
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,000
He might already be world overlord.

514
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,780
We just don't know it.

515
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,640
So it's possible that Bob may actually be the conspiracy himself.

516
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,160
I'd hate to think that.

517
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,460
What a terrible thought.

518
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,360
No, no.

519
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:04,860
We don't really send all the addresses of our new members to the Homeland Security or the Illuminati.

520
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,500
No.

521
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,080
For less than top dollar.

522
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,740
If we sell you out, it's going to be for a lot.

523
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,120
A lot of money.

524
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,140
Let's put it that way.

525
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,440
Yeah.

526
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,500
But really, it's kind of like this is the church of the lone nuts.

527
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,760
You know, this is the church of all the Lee Harvey Oswalds.

528
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,620
So, you know, it behooves us to watch each other's backs, I suppose.

529
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,360
Yeah.

530
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,020
It's weird, man.

531
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,440
It's just weird thinking about it.

532
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:54,940
It's less like when you're walking on the misty moors at night under a full moon and you hear the distant howls of a...

533
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:55,740
Weird.

534
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,440
It's weird.

535
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,840
What's that?

536
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,780
What's that?

537
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,580
Maybe he's on your trail.

538
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:07,700
Maybe he's coming closer and closer, ready to sink his slavering fangs in your delicate neck.

539
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,140
What's that thing?

540
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,860
And drink your rich red blood.

541
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,980
As he cares, you're a broke, black jaw.

542
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,040
And then, to add insult to injury, he lifts his leg and marks his territory.

543
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,460
Boy, I really wouldn't want to be you, you know what I mean?

544
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,820
I mean, I'll get in the shot.

545
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,320
It sucks being you, dude.

546
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:44,880
I'm not a bad guy.

547
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:44,880


548
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:44,880


549
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:44,880


550
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,260
Chewed by a werewolf.

551
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,540
There's a sign you can hold that says, it sucks being me.

552
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,200
And here's a cup you can beg for money.

553
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:02,680
He, being chewed by a werewolf, is perceived as a loser by many in many different walks of life.

554
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,440
Yes.

555
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,520
But they might not realize.

556
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,300
Yes.

557
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,560
The hypercritical individual.

558
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:19,700
That they themselves could just as easily become the victims of a tiny, rabid vampire bat.

559
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:32,760
It creeps into your house by night, and while you're asleep, it crawls up to you and crawls on you, sucks your blood, and gives rabies to you.

560
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,220
Next week, the five-hour show, or the week after that?

561
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,200
You might not even know you had been bitten.

562
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,560
The week after that.

563
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,780
Oh, good.

564
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,600
Because next week, we've got to have one more.

565
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,280
And we promise you something that the other religions hardly ever mention.

566
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,440
Or if they do, they try to put a little box around it and specify what it is.

567
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,520
We promise you slack.

568
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,500
Now, sometimes I'll be, the reverend's staying.

569
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,800
I sent him my $30.

570
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:07,840
I was ordained as a minister, and I performed marriages and did all that, and made fun of my Baptist neighbors and had a lot of fun.

571
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,500
But I don't have any slack.

572
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,680
Where's the slack?

573
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,560
Friends.

574
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,980
You already have slack.

575
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,900
The greatest slogan of the church is, the subgenius must have slack.

576
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,660
Now, Bob didn't say you must get slack.

577
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,760
It means you have to have it to begin with in the first place to be a subgenius.

578
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:32,360
And the subgeniuses are the ones who are, no, they're not getting what they're due.

579
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,780
Somebody else has taken away your slack, and that's the conspiracy.

580
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,360
And the conspiracy is anybody you don't like.

581
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,740
And slack is anything you really, really don't like.

582
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,420
And slack is anything you really wanted to do.

583
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,720
For some people, it's working.

584
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:57,180
For the really lucky, lucky OCD folks like myself, some of us, slack is frantically working at the thing we want to work at.

585
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,740
They'll do it without pay.

586
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,180
As I did for a long, long time.

587
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:11,740
As Onan said, slack can come when you throw good money after bad and bad after bad.

588
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:11,740


589
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:11,740


590
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,460
It's that simple, isn't it?

591
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,260
Money, you know, that's just holding you down.

592
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,560
That's the conspiracy's handcuff.

593
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,580
Those fancy golden wrist, expensive wristwatches are handcuffs.

594
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,100
And that money is like a ball and chain.

595
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:37,340
And I will risk repeating myself and saying, yes, we can, you know, if you want to turn in your balls and chains and handcuffs, we'll see that you are saved from them.

596
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,580
We'll put them in the right hands.

597
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,720
Onan said, slack.

598
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,180
Slack is the oomph in comfortable.

599
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:53,640
And friends, magic, well, magic without a K.

600
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,980
Magic is a foot.

601
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,740
And slack is a shoe.

602
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,340
Isn't that, you can sort of think about that like tonight.

603
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,600
And if any of you can make sense of it, please explain it to me.

604
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,900
Well, maybe we're all getting a little carried away by this.

605
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,760
One caller.

606
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,880
Well, turn that caller to the cold and damp.

607
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,520
Hello?

608
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,440
Hello, caller.

609
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Is this the show?

610
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:23,940
Yellow.

611
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,820
It is the show, yes.

612
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,540
I have a question for you.

613
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,240
How did you get to be so smart?

614
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:37,720
Well, when I, when you gather thistles or nettles, you must expect prickles.

615
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,720
And so, when I did, my hands began to tremble.

616
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:41,940
I was so smart.

617
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,380
Anyway, good luck on your honeymoon.

618
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:59,880
And I hope you'll consider attending the all-new, completely revised Ask Dr. Hal show beginning on the 29th of October at the Chez Poulet Gallery in San Francisco.

619
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:10,120
And continuing on into the indefinite future with no sign of cessation or any expectation of an end.

620
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,560
Hi, it's Dr. Hal.

621
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,680
Yes?

622
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,300
Dr. Hal, trust me, quick mind.

623
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,660
From where?

624
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,280
I know where you live.

625
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,580
Stop lying, Dr. Hal.

626
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,840
From where, did you say?

627
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,820
From some outlying, outlying what?

628
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,220
There's just a way of explaining.

629
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:25,720
Outlying province?

630
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,880
Well, it does sound outlandish.

631
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:33,520
But though you may be a backwoodsman geographically, there is no reason to be one mentally.

632
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:39,020
Study the basic subgenius premises and always use them.

633
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,380
Rely upon them in every circumstance.

634
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:41,540
Uh-huh.

635
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:49,820
And then perhaps you can avoid the gulping doom or the snatching claws of the stark fist of removal.

636
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,980
Okay, I'll take your advice, Dr. Hal.

637
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,660
You're welcome, my boy.

638
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,240
I'll put that good advice to work immediately.

639
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,640
Well, that's a good thing.

640
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,960
I'll deploy those concepts into a micro-extension.

641
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,420
You see our echoes roll from soul to soul and grow forever and forever.

642
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:09,920
And from room to room.

643
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,460
And from ancient to cold.

644
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:17,440
They do not die out, but rather expand to fill the universe.

645
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,920
They can keep going right on.

646
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,320
A Quincy Throckmorton production.

647
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:39,900
But as I say, the conspiracy that we're talking about, the thing that keeps us from slack, the one roadblock to actually meeting Bob and getting your full dose of Bob is, uh, it's not just joining Bob.

648
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:39,900


649
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:39,900


650
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:39,900


651
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:39,900


652
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,100
It's George Bush and his little HALA buddies.

653
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,780
We're not talking about, I have to read this part because it's new.

654
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:57,340
Um, we're not talking about the conspiracy that assassinated JFK, then assassinated the assassin of JFK, then assassinated the assassin of the assassin of JFK.

655
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:09,880
We're not talking about the conspiracy that covers up crashed UFOs, or the conspiracy of the Reptoids in public office, or the conspiracy that keeps electric cards off the road or puts fluoride in the air.

656
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:09,880


657
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:16,760
Nor the mail order clipart, internet mind control kook cult conspiracy.

658
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:29,800
And we're definitely not talking about the conspiracy of conspiracy nuts for whom the real live conspiracy of the 9-11 hijackers wasn't enough of a conspiracy.

659
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:39,560
We're talking, friends, about the conspiracy of the normal, ordinary, everyday people who do not even know.

660
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:39,860
And we're not talking about the conspiracy of the real life conspiracy of the 9-11 hijackers wasn't enough of a conspiracy.

661
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:50,560
Never in our lives do we believe that they're conspiring against the weirdos and slackers and freakazoids and misfits and disbelievers or, my favorite kind, those who will believe anything.

662
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,520
I don't know how to put it...

663
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:58,240
That's how I started out. I remember my first walk down the occult aisle of the used bookstore.

664
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,680
And I bet a lot of you do too.

665
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,960
I thought, my God, if any of this is for real, it's the most important thing in the world!

666
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,880
And I researched like crazy.

667
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,860
Why could any good occult and false conspiracy be a good one?

668
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:15,780
paranormal comparative religion nut for ten years and at the end of it I decided

669
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:20,260
that what I learned was there are a lot of really interesting people out there

670
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:28,960
I actually became more interested in the believers than in the beliefs because

671
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:37,040
they all start to merge together as Connie Dobbs the wife of Dobbs said I

672
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:43,980
like my religion dry with the twist of sarcasm it's the end of the world thus

673
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,240
that the Lord God into the mountains the hills and the rivers and the valleys

674
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:55,100
behold I even I shall bring a sword upon you and I will devastate your high

675
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:00,260
places Ezekiel chapter 6 woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that

676
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:06,160
they may follow strong drink Isaiah chapter 5 yes the end of the world I

677
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,940
hardly think of you

678
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,280
few birds are going to bring about the end of the world we interrupt this

679
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,440
program to bring you a news bulletin scientists at NASA have confirmed that

680
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,160
the comet Havarti is on course toward Earth the odds of the comet colliding

681
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,960
directly with our planet are being calculated at this very moment in a

682
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,140
related story the price of capturing restraining and institutionalizing a

683
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,760
naked man in a t-shirt remains stable at around three hundred sixty seven dollars

684
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,420
and fifty cents absolutely sure

685
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,520
getting might know ?

686
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,160
push full flavor you may not believe check

687
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,200
oh I remember that night me why me but have

688
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,960
now don't get your hopes up

689
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,220
tonight I I came alone

690
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,320
comes come he

691
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,900
nothing are you sure that nothing nothing thank you

692
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,920
It'll cost you nothing.

693
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,140
I don't know who you are, but you're mad.

694
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,040
No, I'm not.

695
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,260
No, no.

696
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,020
You have my happiness in your hands.

697
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,380
No one will ever know her secret.

698
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,280
I'm practically a walking encyclopedia.

699
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,160
Yes, I'll come too if you don't mind.

700
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,380
She winked at me.

701
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,520
She winked.

702
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,960
She winked at me.

703
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,800
I could swear it, she did.

704
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,760
You must have been pretty sick.

705
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,860
When can you take me?

706
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,720
Anytime.

707
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,220
Tonight?

708
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,680
Yes, if you feel up to it.

709
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,160
Well, here he comes now.

710
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,700
I don't care anymore.

711
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,320
But you know, the difference between our cult and almost all the other ones is

712
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,340
we don't know everything, and we don't mind admitting it.

713
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,600
What rulebook, besides Book of the Subgenius,

714
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,340
which has the word humor on the back and the word lies on every page,

715
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:59,240
what rulebook says we have to know why the universe exists?

716
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,320
Or even if it does,

717
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,480
you know,

718
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,840
those are the...

719
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,300
I think sometimes thinking myself,

720
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:09,800
oh,

721
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,500
I'm but the poor blinded cyclops stumbling towards what I think might be light.

722
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:23,940
Like the people in Plato's famous cave watching the flickering of the fire lights,

723
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,840
the shadows,

724
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,460
thinking that's the real world,

725
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,240
which kind of reminds me of the flickering of the TV set.

726
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,960
And I love everybody who...

727
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,440
You know,

728
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,600
people are paranoid about

729
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,940
the loss of privacy,

730
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,260
and there's cameras everywhere,

731
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,400
and there are,

732
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,280
you know,

733
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,300
and every time,

734
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
if you do something,

735
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,200
they'll probably have it on tape.

736
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,860
But really,

737
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,400
they don't have to put cameras on the TV

738
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,720
as long as you're watching TV.

739
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,700
Then they know what you're doing.

740
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,740
You're just watching TV.

741
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,120
The conspiracy doesn't have to be,

742
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,120


743
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,520
be smart.

744
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,560
It just lets people build,

745
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,640
as they say,

746
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,080
the prisoners are happiest when they build their own cages.

747
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,920
And turn on any cable or network TV,

748
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:21,380
and you'll see a beautiful cage built by your purchases and their advertisers.

749
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:28,400
I download everything from the internet so I don't have to watch the commercials.

750
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,020
A confession there from the Starwood Festival DVD.

751
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,100
I'm going to have to watch it.

752
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,580
I'm going to watch it.

753
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:34,580


754
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:34,580


755
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:34,580


756
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:34,580


757
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:34,580


758
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,240
Of which we've been playing a lot.

759
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,020
Also heard in there several collages by Norrell Preff,

760
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,520
and some choice puzzling evidence with Dr. Howell of AskDrHowell.com,

761
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:51,020
Philo Drummond of QuiveringBrain.com,

762
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,240
and puzzling evidence of YouTube's Puzzling Evidence TV.

763
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,380
We also heard some clips from the British podcast

764
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:03,980
Right Where You Are Sitting Now of SittingNow.co.uk,

765
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:11,640
Up next, however, is a secret recording of the pirates of Silicon Valley, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates,

766
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:20,320
accusing each other of thievery during the time when Microsoft and Apple first started battling over stuff they'd both ripped off from Xerox.

767
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,220
I, by the way, am a Mac user since 1984.

768
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,340
Maybe a mafia family. You turn your back and you get whacked.

769
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:37,240
Our guys come back from Japan with this NEC, and it's loaded with Microsoft programs.

770
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,160
Your Microsoft programs.

771
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,120
They're almost identical to ours.

772
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,080
There may be some similarities, Steve.

773
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,060
Similarities.

774
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,240
Similarities.

775
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,580
Try theft.

776
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,700
Steve, all cars have steering wheels, but no one tries to claim that the steering wheel was their invention.

777
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,480
We have a contract. You and I.

778
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,080
Well, you should read it more carefully.

779
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,440
What is this?

780
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,080
This is like doing business with, um, like a praying mantis, huh?

781
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,440
You get seduced and then eaten alive afterwards.

782
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,420
Get real, will you?

783
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,400
You and I are both like guys that have this rich neighbor.

784
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,600
Xerox, that left the door open all the time.

785
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:43,200
And you go sneaking in to steal the TV set, only when you get there you realize that I got there first.

786
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,180
I got the loot!

787
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,460
Steve, you're yelling?!

788
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,280
that's not fair!

789
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,680
I wanted to try to steal it first!

790
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,320
Child, hey, whatизitgive reason is that you're not with them.

791
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:00,320


792
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:00,740
Too late.

793
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,680
We're better than you are.

794
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,620
We have better stuff.

795
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,400
You don't get it, Steve.

796
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,800
That doesn't matter.

797
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:35,560
Was science to become man's servant or, in the hands of the unscrupulous, his master?

798
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,340
But what is this? Where are we?

799
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,920
We enter the factory!

800
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,780
Hello. Hello. Yes.

801
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,880
I want no master. I don't want a master. I want to be free.

802
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:46,480
You're mad.

803
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,920
Man is becoming superfluous. This has nothing to do with the soul.

804
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,540
That's what he said.

805
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,800
Nobody can hate man more than man.

806
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,400
Glory to the world! The power of man has fallen!

807
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,380
A new world has arisen!

808
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,320
The world is a new world!

809
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,140
The world is a new world!

810
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,740
The world is a new world!

811
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,500
The world is a new world!

812
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:11,940
Friends, do you ever worry that you're a brain jackass?

813
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,460
Well, you can quit worrying.

814
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,520
We're all in this together.

815
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,500
God, as Bob said, God forgot to make stupidity painful.

816
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,560
We're here to change that.

817
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,860
We want to think.

818
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,880
Now that involves a certain amount of...

819
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
How did Professor Pressure put it?

820
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,540
Deniable plausibility.

821
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,480
If we throw out enough truths that sound like jokes, they won't kill us.

822
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,340
We can always say, well, we were just kidding.

823
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,660
Do you want to know the truth?

824
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,640
We were.

825
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:59,460
But still, I've been amazed at how many times my buddies and I, under the influence of Bob and sometimes alcohol,

826
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:07,080
or such like, would come up with something that was so ridiculous, we'd think, man, let's not...

827
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,960
That's just too silly to even publish it.

828
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,120
And then it's in the newspaper the next day!

829
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,960
I'm so jealous of those South Park guys.

830
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:21,080
We used to sit around making up the same thing they do.

831
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,660
Only what was so funny was the idea of it ever being allowed on television.

832
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,620
Now it makes millions on television.

833
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,620
Praise the South Park guys.

834
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,480
Anyway, one subgenius said,

835
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:42,620
the church of the subgenius is like a giant inverse push-me-pull-you

836
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,440
with a thousand assholes pointed in different directions and only a vestigial head.

837
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,160
And that's why I like it so much, he said.

838
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,840
Now in the meantime,

839
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,700
while it is

840
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:04,140
impossible for an individual to defeat the conspiracy of all the billions of normal people,

841
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:12,440
at the same time it's possible for every weirdo to make his or herself a little bit stronger,

842
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,440
and less dependent on the conspiracy.

843
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:23,080
And as horrible as this may sound, that may require getting a job and moving out of one's parents' house.

844
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,780
Or something equally radical.

845
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:26,500
Yeah.

846
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:34,100
Although what we shoot for, what we really want in our religion, is complete and utter slack.

847
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,600
We figure the world owes us a living.

848
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:37,820
Yeah.

849
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:47,140
And so it's okay to, as we say, gob on life and just soak up dull money, I suppose.

850
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,880
The ironic thing is that I just had to pay big taxes.

851
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,820
The church itself had to pay taxes.

852
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,600
Yeah.

853
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:00,840
Because we're the only religion in the US that openly admits that it's a complete fraud.

854
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,880
Which makes us the only honest religion.

855
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:05,700
Yeah.

856
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,320
Now is that ironic or what?

857
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:13,280
But by the same token, since we're not claiming to be saving everybody in the world,

858
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:18,540
we're considered just a joke company, and so we have to pay taxes like everybody else.

859
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,280
Yeah.

860
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,320
The government subsidizes all the other religions.

861
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,760
At least they do here.

862
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,480
By not taxing them.

863
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,000
And we're the one holdout.

864
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:38,000
We'll continue to pay our taxes as long as they don't expect us to act nice.

865
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,160
You mean to enslave the world?

866
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,140
Well...

867
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,320
I would never agree to it.

868
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,460
There's a simple answer to that.

869
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,200
There'll be no...

870
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:46,500
Well...

871
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,880
Are you ready to accept my domination?

872
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,240
Thank you, sir.

873
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,480
Thank you very much.

874
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,120
Good luck to you and...

875
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,020
God bless you.

876
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,580
You're a genius.

877
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,240
You're a genius.

878
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,700
Come in.

879
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,000
Think you're funny, huh?

880
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:02,740
Here.

881
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,880
Up until their birth, babies are the ultimate parasite.

882
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:14,520
Fantastic as it seems, life adapts to many different conditions.

883
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,360
And man has come to rule the Earth not by his strength,

884
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:23,100
but by a brain capacity that has enabled him to triumph over these powerless elements.

885
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,120
And he's not just a powerful, but slow-witted monsters who have become extinct everywhere,

886
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,760
but in this lost world of Arthur Conan Doyle.

887
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:38,900
And it makes us wonder, will man too become extinct when he fails to adapt to changing cataclysmic conditions?

888
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,160
.

889
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:50,740
Someday will a new species from this or another planet dig into the Earth and find the bones of our civilization.

890
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:55,320
Left as footprints on the sands of time.

891
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,160

Ever see the jungle in the middle of the night?

00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,260
Ever see the jungle with the animals and fries?

00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,300
Put me in the cargo at the jungle and I'm right

Hello Mr. Power

952
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,360
He was an underwood pecker

953
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,560
They always say Mr. Bones

954
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,260
Mr. Bones

00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,420
And what do you do Mr. Newbold?

Hello Dodd

967
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:26,560
Hello

968
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,820
Take your seat

969
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,280
You are a very smart person

970
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,440
If you haven't tried George

971
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,480
You've missed something

972
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,200
I'm afraid I did try George

973
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,820
And friends, you ain't missing nothing

974
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,060
The music before that

975
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,960
Noralpref.com cut up

976
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,060
Was from the ancient cartoon

977
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:42,840
Toyland

978
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,460
The music in the background

979
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,040
Is from the flying

980
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,380
Ryan Brothers

981
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,040
CD Totality

982
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,580
You can find that at

983
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,020
Ryanetics.com

984
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,060
Before that

985
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,280
The song from Mothra

986
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,080
Being sung by the

987
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,980
Tiny foot tall twins

988
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,380
From Monster Island

989
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,540
That was something

990
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,520
You are listening to

991
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,720
The Hour of Slack

992
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,460
From the church

993
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,660
Of the subgenius

994
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,200
I'm your host

995
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,080
Reverend Ivan Stang

996
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,360
And you can get all the information

997
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,300
You'd want from

998
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,060
Subgenius.com

999
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,860
We are actually best known

1000
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,460
For our books and DVDs

1001
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,840
I'm not sure if our radio audience

1002
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,920
Is fully aware of that

1003
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,080
Anyway

1004
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,460
We will let the show

1005
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,880
Eventually grind to a halt

1006
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,500
With some old puzzling evidence

1007
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,780
Some new puzzling evidence

1008
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,540
Some cref

1009
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,780
And some lemur

1010
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,760
And some horror price Bob

1011
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,260
Mmhmm

1012
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:31,980
No problem

1013
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,260
Nope

1014
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,360
Hey you guys are great

1015
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,120
What's going on here?

1016
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:36,940
I don't know

1017
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:37,680
Once you're in

1018
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,260
You can't get out

1019
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,040
I was not having a scary hour

1020
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,860
What's all this stuff on the walls?

1021
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:45,740
You have to close those

1022
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:46,920
Now those are theme ideas

1023
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,620
What?

1024
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,380
We like to tack them up here

1025
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,640
And ignore them

1026
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,840
How long have they been here?

1027
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,580
Two years almost

1028
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,780
Yeah some of them

1029
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,600
We used one once

1030
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,140
What color were they originally?

1031
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,620
We used one of those

1032
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:58,760
I don't know

1033
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:58,760


1034
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:58,760


1035
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:58,760


1036
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:58,760


1037
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:58,760


1038
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:58,760


1039
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:58,980
Gray

1040
00:51:58,980 --> 00:51:59,500
White

1041
00:51:59,500 --> 00:51:59,980
Gray

1042
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:00,360
White

1043
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,100
Yeah you couldn't really tell

1044
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,040
Green, black

1045
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,200
Blue, orange

1046
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,620
How did they get that color?

1047
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:05,880
Well somebody came along

1048
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,820
And set the outer ones on fire

1049
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,440
And they just kind of burned down to the wall

1050
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,940
And that caused the symbols

1051
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,320
Those are the ones we used right?

1052
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:13,400
Yeah

1053
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,640
And did someone draw those

1054
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,200
Or did they just

1055
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,140
We paid this guy from Calyx

1056
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,380
To come over here and think them up

1057
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:18,720
Yeah

1058
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,860
Oh would you like to be killed?

1059
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:22,340
Oh yeah

1060
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,020
Okay ready?

1061
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,200
Another 30 seconds

1062
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:24,780
Here it goes

1063
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,180
Oh

1064
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:27,160
A thing called Biblis

1065
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:27,800
They are called Biblis

1066
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,360
They are called Biblis

1067
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:28,760
They are called Biblis

1068
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,900
They call him Bob

1069
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,920
Same damn color

1070
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,940
No no

1071
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,520
Good morning

1072
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:32,960
Bob

1073
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,660
Bob

1074
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,720
I'm very disappointed

1075
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,360
Yep

1076
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,180
Your time is up

1077
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,040
It's time for a commercial

1078
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,800
Oh okay go ahead do the commercial

1079
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,620
Do something commercial

1080
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,260
Okay let's go to the commercial now

1081
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:43,980
I mean

1082
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,000
I mean nothing

1083
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,740
I mean this is the church of the subgenius

1084
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,600
You don't really expect nothing from them guys

1085
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,260
They ain't got nothing better to talk about than you

1086
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,200
And your relationship to the subgenius church

1087
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,720
And exactly what's gonna happen to you

1088
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,640
When you stand up on that white stripe

1089
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,480
And have dobs

1090
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,700
Remove your walls

1091
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:58,740
And you can't even see

1092
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:58,740


1093
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:58,740


1094
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:58,740


1095
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:58,740


1096
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:58,740


1097
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:58,740


1098
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,440
Your wallet

1099
00:52:59,440 --> 00:52:59,980
Yes it's true

1100
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,180
You can have your wallet

1101
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,460
Personally removed by Bob

1102
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,600
Although I would never ever consider it myself

1103
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,200
I voluntarily sent mine in years ago

1104
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,300
But you unbeliever

1105
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,000
Can personally be defiled and demonified

1106
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,780
And devalued by dogs

1107
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,540
It's true

1108
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,720
You think it sounds awful

1109
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,180
Well it does sound awful

1110
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,220
It sounds terrible

1111
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,120
If I die before I wake

1112
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,860
I know my wallet he will take

1113
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,380
Yes even the smurfs are armed in this sector

1114
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,460
Yes we've sold weapons to everybody

1115
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,920
And they're ready to use them

1116
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,380
On us

1117
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,320
Yeah right

1118
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,420
So I got scared

1119
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,200
Yes little Funto had bitten the head again

1120
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,100
And I was climbing under the table

1121
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,440
It looks like Funto was loose

1122
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,820
And running down the streets of the city

1123
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,580
Yes so what

1124
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,520
Yes so what

1125
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,220
It's the end of the war

1126
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,000
Nobody cares anymore

1127
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,480
And it's the end of the world coincidentally

1128
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,760
And we're all here to celebrate

1129
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,320
Throw that guy an orange

1130
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,800
As we float up into the upper atmosphere

1131
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,300
Tiny little particles

1132
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,180
Yes sure is plenty

1133
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,320
Comfy too

1134
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,740
Time it can't be as difficult as it seems

1135
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:58,740


1136
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:58,740


1137
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:58,740


1138
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:58,740


1139
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:58,740


1140
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,340
But I'm not sure what's going to happen

1141
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,440
Hey listen don't push me around

1142
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,720
This could be your show

1143
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,660
It could be anybody's show

1144
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:03,680
I'm not sure what's going to happen

1145
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,240
Hey come on get out of the way Paul

1146
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,600
I've got a few of these things

1147
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,340
I've got a mix of stuff

1148
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,560
Oh look out

1149
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,660
I must have put the wrong stuff in

1150
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,500
This is not show stopper

1151
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,180
This is show expander

1152
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:15,840
Quick close the doors

1153
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,120
It's going to fill up the station

1154
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,280
Quick close all the windows too

1155
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,780
Oh look at this stuff

1156
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,020
It's

1157
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:23,160
It's

1158
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:23,620
It's

1159
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:23,640
It's

1160
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,100
It's

1161
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:24,100


1162
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:24,380
It's

1163
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:24,440
It's

1164
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:24,620
It's

1165
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:24,660
It's

1166
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:24,720
It's

1167
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:32,920
It's

1168
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:32,920


1169
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:32,920


1170
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:32,920


1171
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:32,920


1172
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:32,920


1173
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:32,920


1174
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:32,920


1175
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,980
I've decided ou d�orith05

1176
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:43,640
You get a free Fürger

1177
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:45,900
It's

1178
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,260
It's

1179
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,680
It's

1180
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:46,840
It's

1181
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:46,840


1182
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:46,940
It'

1183
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:47,640
It's

1184
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:47,780
It's

1185
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:47,860
It's

1186
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:47,860


1187
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:47,880
It's

1188
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:47,960
It's

1189
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,320
It's

1190
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,480
It's

1191
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:49,480


1192
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:49,500
It's

1193
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:49,740
It's

1194
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:49,740


1195
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:49,740


1196
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:50,520
It's

1197
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,480
Okay.

1198
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,780
It was just for show.

1199
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:01,460
Yeah.

1200
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:07,000
The makers of Ape Nuts bring you the first in this series of guest stars during the vacation of...

1201
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,040
Why is here a nerd?

1202
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:08,520
No.

1203
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,760
Tonight we present Bob with yours truly.

1204
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,500
All right.

1205
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,260
I am happy to present to you that hillbilly comedian and musician.

1206
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,140
That's Stokowski of the bazooka.

1207
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,520
Didn't you ever hear of Annie Laurie?

1208
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,420
Certainly I've heard of Annie Laurie.

1209
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,380
What's Annie Laurie got to do with this?

1210
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:28,920
Oh, nothing.

1211
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,320
I'm just wondering what she's doing tonight.

1212
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,980
Well, it looks like there's only one way to get this show started.

1213
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,180
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present...

1214
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,020
No, allow me.

1215
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,280
On the contrary, allow me.

1216
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,120
Well, come on.

1217
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:40,820
Let's all do it.

1218
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:41,260
Okay.

1219
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:41,820
Right-o.

1220
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:42,960
One, two, three.

1221
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:50,500
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the first citizen of Van Buren, Arkansas, Bob...

1222
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,660
I want to thank you boys for that introduction.

1223
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,560
You've done a mighty good job there.

1224
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,080
But you boys can go now.

1225
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,440
Well, don't you want us to stay here with you, Bob?

1226
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,200
To help you?

1227
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:06,940
I started out in the East on a program that advertises yeast.

1228
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,920
And I worked my way up.

1229
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:15,160
You know, over in the music hall, we have so many of them guest artists over there.

1230
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:18,440
And opera stars and moving picture actors.

1231
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,860
That they keep interrupting me all the time.

1232
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:26,640
And I figured it'd be kind of nice to get over on this program where they ain't got no talent at all.

1233
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,080
And I figured it'd be kind of nice to get over on this program where they ain't got no talent at all.

1234
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,100
Oh, pardon me, Bob.

1235
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,880
Boy, I want to tell you, you are a beautiful animal.

1236
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,860
Well, thank you, Bob.

1237
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,720
Doggone it, there's somebody knocking on the door.

1238
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,180
You know, I was kind of in hope we wouldn't get all them rap, rap, rap tonight.

1239
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,200
Well, you can't have too many rap, rap, rap, rap.

1240
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,720
Well, anywho, Bob, I don't get it.

1241
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,840
All right, Bob, I'd like to sing.

1242
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,660
I don't get it.

1243
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,120
You're just a heartbeat away from the show.

1244
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,140
The Wobba Wobba Wob?

1245
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,560
Keep her on the line, whatever you do.

1246
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,040
You've got to figure out where she's calling from.

1247
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:16,320
There's nothing better than a nice cup of hot coffee.

1248
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,280
Don't go in the roof.

1249
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:22,180
With the best coffee beans served up to Copy Bob.

1250
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:27,540
Or Coffee Bob, as some call him because of his predilection for a manly mug.

1251
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,320
Don't go in the closet.

1252
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,180
Don't go in the basement.

1253
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,520
Let's scare Jessica to death.

1254
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,380
You know, I can't really get it.

1255
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,220
Who slew Auntie Rue?

1256
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,420
Whatever happened to Baby Jane?

1257
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,120
Hush, hush, sweet Charlotte.

1258
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:42,700
Turn on the radio.

1259
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,780
Turn your radio on.

1260
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,160
And there'll be music in the air.

1261
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:51,380
But I'm called away on a matter of grave importance.

1262
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,580
A secret.

1263
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,400
It's the end of the world.

1264
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,760
From PR News in Washington, I'm forced to file for bankruptcy protection.

1265
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,360
Also over the weekend, President Bush welcomed the President of Ghana to the White House.

1266
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:27,460
President Bush said Ghana has shown that disease can flourish in Africa.

1267
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:31,000
And he said that Ghana has been a strong conflict on the continent.

1268
