Recording?

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,240
Everything's going fine.

40
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,500
No trouble.

41
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,480
So, it was a test, as it turns out.

42
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,740
The whole thing, a test.

43
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,440
Another test.

44
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,200
And I might say we passed with flying colors, assembling at the assembly point.

45
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,560
Yeah, we proved once again that we believe anything Bob or each other says.

46
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,980
This is the 20th consecutive time, right?

47
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,860
No, it's the 19th.

48
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,440
Is it?

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,980
Shit, I can never count that shit.

50
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,240
I know, you've been saying 20th for a long time.

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,120
That would be depressing.

52
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:34,000
We're on our way down the hill to the stone circle at Wisteria for the fateful meeting.

53
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,120
Because it's 6.30 in the morning, July 5th.

54
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,060
Well.

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,880
1998.

56
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,140
1998.

57
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,940
Question mark.

58
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,220
1998.

59
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,600
Somebody.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,800
Well, Bob has been teaching us some sort of a lesson as to not trusting our calendars

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,880
or which planet we're actually on.

62
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,140
Andrew the Impaled said he'd done the math and it worked out for him.

63
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:00,980
Right.

64
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,340
I missed me.

65
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,620
Yeah, but we did the math and it worked out to be 2017.

66
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,360
Or 8661.

67
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,760
There's those missing years I read about.

68
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,480
The old farmer.

69
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,060
The old farmer's almanac all those years ago were the 1700s.

70
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,240
That's what he's talking about.

71
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:16,880
Okay.

72
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,600
Now, that math worked out to be what?

73
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,980
Well, he claims it worked out so that this year is 1998.

74
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,880
Well, of course it is.

75
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,080
Well, I've got two beers in my pocket if it's not.

76
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,560
Is that a mob up ahead?

77
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,880
Not again.

78
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,440
Not another mob.

79
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,400
Propitiously enough, the honey wagon went by.

80
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,640
Right before the car came out.

81
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,000
The honey dipper man is right.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,120
It won't be in the judgment.

83
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,840
What's he got in there?

84
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,040
In the honey wagon.

85
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,840
Look at those poor wisteria workers up at this hour.

86
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,180
They're up every hour.

87
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,820
They're up all night.

88
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,820
They're up all night.

89
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,180
We're going to greet the saucers.

90
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,700
World ends in a half an hour.

91
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,920
What happened?

92
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,440
The world ends.

93
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:05,820
Christ, Bob.

94
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,220
One half hour.

95
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,060
Okay.

96
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:08,880
Yeah.

97
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,020
No.

98
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,540
Sorry.

99
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:10,940
You're.

100
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,340
Sorry you won't be on the saucers like these.

101
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,800
I guess they weren't convinced by our.

102
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,400
By the week of subgeniuses being.

103
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,200
I guess not.

104
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,840
So as we were trying to leave last night and they had that barrier up.

105
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,660
After evolution control committee, we found ourselves chanting in our best Dan rather voice.

106
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,120
Stopped.

107
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,360
Stopped.

108
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,880
Stopped by rope.

109
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,460
Stopped.

110
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,460
Stopped.

111
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,660
Stopped by rope.

112
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,120
Which reminds me.

113
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,520
You know, we're.

114
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,420
All the honey wagons empty down in Australia.

115
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,360
You wouldn't know that.

116
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,220
So I'll tell you the great dingle barrier.

117
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:47,880
Reef.

118
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,720
That's how it got there.

119
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,760
Jesus Christ, man.

120
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,960
I don't want to be stuck on a saucer of this.

121
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,340
God.

122
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,600
I do.

123
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,420
Oh, yeah.

124
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,160
For how long?

125
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,080
This could go on for millions of years.

126
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,620
You know, puns like that for millions of years.

127
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,860
That's the nearest thing to perpetual emotion.

128
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,060
Good.

129
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:21,860
It's strange to drive through a campground and all these cars have Bob bumper stickers on them.

130
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,440
I sure hope we don't let them down.

131
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,280
Oh, look, there's the diehards.

132
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,900
Oh, my God.

133
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,240
There's even a bull horn.

134
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,520
Yeah.

135
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,400
That's what this iron does.

136
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,660
We have this theory that it's possible everyone's gravity has not been in proper alignment.

137
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,440
Everybody's gravity is not in alignment?

138
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,140
That's why the X's haven't been able to find us properly.

139
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,740
And I brought along the tool to fix that.

140
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,580
Everyone's gravity can be aligned in the proper way.

141
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,860
I'm all for that, man.

142
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,320
I am all for that.

143
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:56,980
All right.

144
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,700
Are you going to bring that down to the...

145
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,960
I'm going to bring it down there, but we're doing it now, too.

146
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,620
We need to prepare.

147
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,960
Prepare your anus.

148
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,620
Well, I think we're going to go on down there and wait in fact.

149
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:09,640
Okay.

150
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,620
Faith, we have our own gravity realignment devices.

151
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,400
We have a depravity realignment.

152
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,040
Yeah, we have depravity realignment.

153
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,060
We're going to realign our depravity, okay?

154
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,040
Just so you know, gravity is currently reading at 1G.

155
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,660
So set your gravity meter to 1G.

156
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,640
Uh-huh.

157
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:29,980
Yeah.

158
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,440
Aren't you worried your gravity strategy will fall down?

159
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,440
1G.

160
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,480
Well, we need to change it to about 0.90.

161
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,700
Well, my name's Greg.

162
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,520
That's 1G.

163
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,560
Well, let's go on down there and...

164
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,300
Okay, we'll see you down there.

165
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,020
We'll see you down there presently.

166
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,660
We're doing our preparations.

167
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,560
Okay.

168
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,760
Yeah, right.

169
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,740
Prepare your anus.

170
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,580
Preparation eight.

171
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,260
We hear you.

172
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:51,760
We hear you.

173
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,140
Oh, gosh.

174
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,540
That is the thing.

175
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:56,740
What?

176
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,860
You having trouble getting your dick out the door, you said?

177
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,820
No, no, my dick.

178
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,140
Okay.

179
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:03,860
Um...

180
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,620
If those people were saying that they were changing their gravity, does that mean they're

181
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,260
getting high?

182
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,160
They've been up all night fucking up their heads.

183
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,140
Fucking up their heads.

184
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:14,460


185
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,340
Did you forget your pants, Dr. Hal?

186
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,620
No one needs pants in the new world.

187
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,600
That's a good line.

188
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,560
Got all the way up here just to discover the Unite battery on my camera's dead.

189
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:33,720
Oh.

190
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,540
Well, so will the rest of Earth be in 30 minutes.

191
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,440
And when they hear St. Voldemort shouting there.

192
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,720
Twenty minutes till the world ends and there's only five people standing here.

193
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,260
Although there's about 20 of them up getting real high over there at 8.08.

194
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,100
What are they doing?

195
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,160
Getting ready for bed, probably, if you find that out.

196
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,800
What if they head into the world and nobody came?

197
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,720
And only five people showed up, yeah.

198
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,520
Well, look what a beautiful day for the world.

199
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:07,520


200
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,300
Not a cloud in the sky.

201
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,960
Crisp, clean air wafting past our nostril hair.

202
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,000
Soon we'll revert it back to its original pure form.

203
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,860
Which is?

204
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,800
A steaming heap of lava and volcanoes.

205
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,820
The whole planet.

206
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,720
No oxygen at all.

207
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,140
And shit and guts and that way it'll be an OFAL thing to happen.

208
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,360
But now.

209
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,360
Operation Clean Sweep.

210
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,600
If the world doesn't end in a few minutes.

211
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,160
In about a week there's going to be a candlelit labyrinth right here.

212
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,760
With two harps serenading you as you walk the labyrinth.

213
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,040
Well, I heard that there are two concentric ones.

214
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,800
There's the labyrinth major and the labyrinth minor.

215
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,740
And everybody's trying to get to the center.

216
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,360
I don't want to be stuck on a spaceship.

217
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,680
I do.

218
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,640
I do.

219
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,040
I do.

220
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,520
You're going to have your own escape vessel, right?

221
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,220
Oh, sure.

222
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,900
I'm claiming other parts of the earth too than you are.

223
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,960
So I don't know what we'll run into each other.

224
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,400
Easter Island I take it, right?

225
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,640
Oh, Easter Island.

226
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,180
You're going to pick up Easter Island.

227
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,980
Oh, man.

228
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,940
A mansion called Meadowbrook Hall.

229
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,660
There's a man who's ready for the rapture.

230
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,500
Abnorm.

231
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,240
The rupture.

232
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,400
He is.

233
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:33,940
Abnorm Nihil is wearing nothing but a bunch of ties as a loincloth.

234
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,660
And the end of it.

235
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,780
And a tie around his neck and a top hat.

236
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,940
He's tied one on.

237
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,580
Yes.

238
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,360
He's also got a pair of shoes.

239
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:40,880
He's tied several on.

240
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,840
Well, evidently time and ties wait for no man.

241
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,300
I don't know if I can handle this here.

242
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,300
Another 15 minutes, much less eternity.

243
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,620
I do have a stick if this keeps up.

244
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,840
But Fatsy Tosh has a big stick.

245
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,680
That calls for another one, doesn't it?

246
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,540
He's not speaking softly about it.

247
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,700
Of course he's not.

248
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,940
Tie, yai, yai.

249
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,220
Weren't you wearing the same thing last year?

250
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:13,660
Huh?

251
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,820
Weren't you wearing the same thing last year?

252
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,220
Yeah.

253
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,660
One of these days it'll work.

254
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,840
That's the first time I've ever seen four and a half.

255
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:27,480
I started seriously thinking for the first time this time that maybe, maybe the way to make it.

256
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,900
What have we been doing wrong every time?

257
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,400
Having me showing up.

258
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:31,540
Yeah.

259
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,660
You and me have been here every single time.

260
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,620
That's the one consistent thing.

261
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,420
Dr. Dark has been at every one of these 7 a.m. things and so have I.

262
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,560
Nobody else has.

263
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,660
So that means maybe we should have just stayed in bed.

264
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,120
One of us has got to go.

265
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,940
No, but I say both of us.

266
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,200
On the 20th anniversary, I guarantee you I'll stay in bed.

267
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,120
Oh, we don't have to worry about that, surely.

268
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,740
That 18X day Facebook page.

269
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,860
Well, yeah, we're never going to get there.

270
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,820
That's just silly.

271
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,940
It's crazy stuff.

272
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,980
It's just provocation.

273
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,940
Yeah, it is.

274
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,640
That's the first time I've ever seen a Smegma's tie cord.

275
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,720
That's quite nice.

276
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,520
You know, if a mohel happens by, there'll be bow ties.

277
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:18,100
Well, I suppose that when the sun hits the field, things will be different.

278
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:18,800
Yes.

279
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,200
Yeah, it's like Stonehenge at solstice or something.

280
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:29,400
The sun shines through the trees and lights up the keyhole to the exit.

281
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,320
Oh, no, that was Lord of the Rings.

282
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:31,780
Oh, well.

283
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:38,040
The siren that we just heard and all the screaming was more vocalization from a, uh,

284
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,980
uh, Sinfaldimus, perhaps?

285
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,580
Could have been Heathen on the bullhorn.

286
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,400
Uh-huh.

287
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,800
They're circling.

288
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,460
The, what, the buzzards?

289
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,580
That's a good sign.

290
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,660
That's a real good sign.

291
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,760
No, the khan.

292
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,820
The khan is leaving a khan trail.

293
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,660
Oh.

294
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,300
A chem trail up there.

295
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:56,720
Yeah.

296
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,280
They're spraying us like bugs.

297
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,640
Here he is.

298
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,760
Well, there's six of them.

299
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,140
Six of us now.

300
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,800
Six faithful and a bunch of stoners down there.

301
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,320
Oh, it's been.

302
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,700
Please tell me video of that last night is out there.

303
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,940
Oh, I was in a perfect position to see the destruction of that organ.

304
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:20,340
I had to, I was pointing a camera at it and yabbering into this thing and realized, oh,

305
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,000
that's going to fall on me in a second.

306
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,340
And just as I stepped back, sure enough, it, so I got this perfect boom like that.

307
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,920
I'm real proud.

308
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,500
Uh oh.

309
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,840
It's just balls in the s-smortish.

310
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,780
Just enters the vein and they're down pushing that.

311
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,740
Holy shit.

312
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,720
Watch out.

313
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:39,940
Whoa.

314
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,840
Whoa.

315
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,740
Whoa.

316
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,720
Whoa.

317
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,620
Way too intense now.

318
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,540
The, like, rock beats this, uh, giant organ off in the back.

319
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,060
The band won't quit.

320
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,420
I see.

321
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,200
The subgeniuses love the worst band in the whole world.

322
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,260
They'll probably want them back over and over.

323
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,240
Boy, did they ever.

324
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,740
They were great.

325
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:01,740


326
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:01,740


327
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:01,740


328
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:01,740


329
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:01,740


330
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:01,740


331
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:01,740


332
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:01,740


333
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:01,740


334
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,640
dancing up a storm down there.

335
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,300
Next day is not like it used to be.

336
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,040
This is a sad and horrible moment.

337
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,260
There you go.

338
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,460
Four feet back.

339
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,180
Best show ever!

340
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,480
Oh my god, I knew it.

341
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,260
This is exactly what I was afraid of.

342
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,600
Oh, they're eating it up.

343
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,440
Oh, great.

344
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,980
Maybe they were in a fury.

345
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,760
They were dancing in protest.

346
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,140
I think they were just heavily drugged.

347
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,720
They were having a good time.

348
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,320
They really were having a good time.

349
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,760
My worst fear has come true.

350
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,980
Anti-music has come back to the church.

351
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,020
That's all the place used to have.

352
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,900
I hate, I truly hate this moment.

353
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,380
This is the worst X Day ever.

354
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,440
I'm not actually going to choose.

355
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,540
This is the worst X Day ever.

356
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,340
Our CDs are $5 in total.

357
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,420
Oh my god.

358
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh my god.

359
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:23,280
I can't believe this has happened under the auspices of the church in the sub-genius.

360
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,920
This august assemblage was never meant for such abuse.

361
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,060
We're the real deal.

362
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,980
We just got picked up by an independent label.

363
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,960
Independent, I bet.

364
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,540
Yeah, I think I know what that means.

365
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:45,020
Stan, if I had a chance to tear your organ all to bits, I'd probably love you just as much as him.

366
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,680
Oh gee, thanks for saying that, Stacey.

367
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,420
It makes me feel so much better about this horrible spectacle.

368
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,740
This is horrible.

369
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,940
You were dancing to that stuff.

370
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,220
You didn't like it.

371
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,840
You want to make it worse.

372
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,640
You want to make it worse, sir.

373
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,820
You should have done just what I always do with my proctologist, and that's turn the other cheek.

374
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,260
Man, I do not want to be on a saucer with these kinds of puns forever.

375
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,340
I know, it was a nasty crack to make.

376
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,960
I hope we get to Planet X quick.

377
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,040
Planet YECK.

378
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,120
I'm going to Planet YECK.

379
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,540
I'm going to bed in about 15 minutes no matter what.

380
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:26,940
You're going to meet both.

381
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,040
One way or another, I know one thing, I'll be in bed.

382
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,100
I may be in bed on an escape vessel.

383
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,020
I may be in bed with a big...

384
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,200
A gravitational hammock.

385
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,780
Notice that I have a beer in each pocket, just in case.

386
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm not drinking them yet, but I'm prepared for the worst.

387
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,820
Do they open on their own?

388
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,180
Yeah.

389
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,400
You don't need a special opener.

390
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,880
No, Moem is my can opener.

391
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,980
My bottle opener, my beer bottle opener is Moem.

392
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,480
If not, they are twist-off caps.

393
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,520
You know, if you had 22 more, I'd make a case out of it.

394
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,160
The most painful wait for Bob.

395
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,540
Is he going to be the Zap Brannigan to my kiff?

396
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,200
I'm afraid so, dear.

397
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,100
I'll spend the rest of the trip to Planet X going, oh.

398
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,720
Before you keep making those shit noises, you'll be known as the grunting proletarian.

399
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,780
I'm glad you can laugh.

400
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,580
That's so sweet.

401
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,140
Even if that's the only thing you can do.

402
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,760
What are the wind in the branches?

403
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,060
Yeah.

404
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,960
Remarkable lack of suspense.

405
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,160
It's like seven minutes till the absolute end of the planet Earth.

406
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,000
Vinnie, we don't have a siren or something like that.

407
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,220
Shut your asses down here!

408
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:53,740
I'm not going.

409
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:53,740


410
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:53,760
No, I'm not going in here.

411
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:53,760


412
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:53,760


413
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:53,840
No, I'm not going in here.

414
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:53,840


415
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:53,840


416
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:53,840


417
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:53,840


418
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:53,840


419
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:53,840


420
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:53,840


421
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,560
Wow, that's pretty good.

422
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,160
Who needs a bullhorn?

423
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,820
You have to bull themself.

424
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,380
Don't make me get that bat out again!

425
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,380
Bowsheed!

426
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,140
You know what they call Bruce Wayne's illegitimate children?

427
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,980
Bats-tards.

428
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,920
I don't want to live on this planet anymore.

429
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,880
Yeah, I guess that's...

430
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,180
They decided to make their own stone circle.

431
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,740
Using their heads as the stones.

432
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,740
Stone circle?

433
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,960
They've been doing gravity adjustments all night long.

434
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,580
All week long, let me rephrase that.

435
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,920
It's the best preparation you can make for aliens visiting.

436
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,540
Because the first thing they say is,

437
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,520
take me to your leader.

438
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,720
That's what they mean.

439
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,360
He's so hilarious, every time I've ever seen him

440
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,800
he's got all these new different...

441
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,480
Bongs or bulls, he's handcrafted.

442
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,500
They're going to blame us for being too square and straight.

443
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,640
Hey man, you should have been high like us.

444
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:50,780
What the hell?

445
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,620
We'd be high up in the sun.

446
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:52,720
We'd be high up in the sun.

447
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,040
We'd be high up in the sun.

448
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,040


449
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,040


450
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,040


451
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,280
I don't know if you'd go by there to leave,

452
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,780
if we ever did.

453
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,980
Here they come, here comes Miss Susan.

454
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,700
No, I mean it's still you...

455
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,340
Miss Flusson.

456
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,500
The truly faithful.

457
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,420
Stumbling in at the last four minutes.

458
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,080
The subgeniuses, boy.

459
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,680
That shows a certain lack of suspense.

460
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,760
It does.

461
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,760
It looks more like a funeral this time.

462
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,040
We damn near did have the proverbial July 4th blizzard I think.

463
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,480
As cold as it got.

464
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,960
I know it's really weird.

465
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,660
It's almost prophetic.

466
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,820
As Dr. Howell said, we won't need pants in the new world.

467
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,720
Well I'm not wearing any.

468
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,440
If I got fucking snuggy it's cold.

469
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,820
Well we said it was too hot last time right?

470
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,180
Well that's a nice little parade.

471
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,700
You're in trouble. They caught you with my megaphone.

472
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,020
They're telling your mom and dad.

473
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,160
Really it is three minutes.

474
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:09,460
I'm going to be in bed in ten minutes one way or the other.

475
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,940
Three more minutes of this world.

476
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,700
Alright!

477
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,480
Yeah.

478
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,100
Whatevs.

479
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,220
How's that gravity?

480
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
This is it.

481
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,900
How's that gravity you guys?

482
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,620
It really is it's like only two minutes.

483
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,580
Two minutes.

484
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,200
Chases are mine aren't any better.

485
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,600
How many minutes do we want to wait?

486
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,720
It could happen any second.

487
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,020
That's the lesson of course.

488
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,960
Don't throw me in the pond this time y'all.

489
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,100
Bob occasionally teaches us this lesson thing.

490
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,800
But I'm sure this won't be the lesson.

491
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,380
It won't be one of those. God like one minute.

492
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,600
The firewood's closer than the pond so we'll just burn you.

493
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,640
Right.

494
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,500
Thanks a lot.

495
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,520
This is it. This is it.

496
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:01,740
Again.

497
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,300
This is our moment. This is our time.

498
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:13,920
Dr. Dark and I have been here every single X day since the first drill in 96.

499
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,460
This is the 19th time we've both been here at 7 AM.

500
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,840
Since 1899.

501
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,760
I'm beginning to think maybe that's what's wrong.

502
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,780
We should have stayed in bed.

503
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,120
Why don't we just turn this into a bunkhouse?

504
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,980
I think it's just about time for the sacred countdown.

505
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,920
I'm looking at my imaginary second hand and I'm whiffing that it's like 10 seconds.

506
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:45,380
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

507
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,360
Suck them if they can't take a job.

508
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,300
YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA

509
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,720
If they can't take a job, stay!

510
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,660
Why again?

511
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,360
Why?

512
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,260
Why are you looking at me?

513
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,140
All I did was take down the memo, dude.

514
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,660
God, this happens every year. There's always somebody.

515
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,660
It's not me that let you down, dude.

516
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,240
I just took the memo.

517
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,420
Where's Philo? Blame Philo.

518
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,820
Kill the messenger.

519
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,460
Kill the messenger.

520
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,300
Not again.

521
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,680
Pass the killager.

522
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,820
Hey, let's put the messenger in bed. That's a good idea.

523
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,540
Bed the messenger.

524
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,080
Bed the messenger. There you go.

525
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,580
I'm the messenger.

526
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:44,560
Stan, I sold my children into slavery to be able to afford to come here.

527
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,680
I sympathize. You too.

528
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,200
I figured they only had like a couple of days and it wouldn't have been that bad, you know, so.

529
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,260
Yeah, do you see my children here? No.

530
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,860
I sold them too.

531
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,380
We're all your children, Stan.

532
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,780
Well, it's a good thing I brought these two beers with me.

533
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:09,100
Not that I was, you know, was in any doubt, but I was going to drink them anyway.

534
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,980
Maybe there's like a Doppler effect where they're not...

535
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,040
You guys didn't adjust your gravity enough.

536
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,820
That was the problem.

537
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,980
Did we over adjust?

538
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,980
That's your fault, man.

539
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,840
I've been trying. I've adjusted people's gravity beyond their expectations.

540
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,280
That's the closest thing to rocket fuel we're going to have for a while, evidently.

541
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,920
Well, no. I also have a pair of model rockets to launch off.

542
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,140
All right!

543
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,060
This way.

544
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,960
They're still home.

545
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,240
Just in case.

546
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,200
How big are they?

547
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,480
They can go 1,200 foot.

548
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,020
Oh. How many people will they take?

549
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,340
How many people will they help?

550
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:45,960
Distraction.

551
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,720
A couple pieces.

552
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,720
Okay.

553
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,440
How many pieces can you make?

554
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,960
Actually, actually, I have the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer with me.

555
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,360
It's in my van.

556
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,540
We could launch that on one of those rockets.

557
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,400
Absolutely.

558
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,120
We should plan to do that tonight or this evening or something.

559
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,080
All right.

560
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,100
Where we can still find it when it comes down.

561
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,740
Why not?

562
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,400
Yeah.

563
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,280
Yeah, we could have a real head launching with a rocket.

564
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:13,920
Yeah.

565
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,140
Chaz Smith used to launch heads with rockets.

566
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,780
We launched a whole toy Arnold Palmer on a rocket one time.

567
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,620
I've got an idea.

568
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:29,500
Like, akin to how we got baptized as a pair, how about we launch the head with two rockets?

569
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,180
Could we do that?

570
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,880
Well, if they go off at the same time.

571
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,560
Otherwise, you're just going to get a lame head launching.

572
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,500
They've got to go at the exact same moment, though.

573
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,540
The head isn't very heavy.

574
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,880
It's not the real head, of course.

575
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:52,800
It's a replica of a realistic shrunken rubber Palmer head, only about this big.

576
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,500
I would get it out and kick it around now just in spite to beat up some sacred object.

577
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,700
Somebody had a big icon over there.

578
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,280
Let's go burn it down instead of me.

579
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,140
No.

580
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,820
Like I said, happy July 5th, 1997, everyone.

581
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:11,540
Yeah.

582
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:11,760
Yeah.

583
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,800
Happy 1997.

584
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,300
Happy 1997.

585
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,220
I'm sorry, Susie.

586
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,320
I'm really sorry.

587
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,820
That was so anticlimactic, I'll probably never have a climax.

588
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,140
No, don't be sure.

589
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,860
You know, there's always next year, said Stang, hopefully.

590
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,840
Bob was way late.

591
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,160
He caught venereal disease from the sequoia of space, Gamera, the flying turtle.

592
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,500
He caught a case of gammera area, and he's at the clinic now.

593
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:41,520
Well, I'm not sure about that.

594
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,420
Okay, well, don't you think, at least we're not going to be stuck on the spaceship with

595
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:46,860
that guy.

596
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:56,500
I was to understand that there would be pleasure saucers.

597
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,940
Yeah, there will be pleasure saucers come July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.

598
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,520
Bob sold it, I smoked it, that settles it.

599
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,120
Damn.

600
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,200
But if we screwed up our calendars at some time in the past.

601
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,620
Or the conspiracy, rather, then that's, you know, this is your first time, isn't it?

602
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,820
It's kind of like having your first time.

603
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,200
I'm just a little, I'm a little bit taken for words.

604
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,320
I have grown over 17 butt cheeks now, my friend.

605
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:30,640


606
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,700
That's what it's going to take.

607
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,420
Get used to disappointment.

608
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,680
Get used to growing butt cheeks.

609
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,920
Oh, you're going to be crazy over your gas if they don't show up.

610
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,360
Don't worry, I'll get your kids back.

611
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,860
What is it?

612
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,160
I'm just a little bit scared.

613
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,520
I'm a little bit scared.

614
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:42,700
I'm a little bit scared.

615
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:42,700


616
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:42,700


617
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,040
You're going to have to learn to accept.

618
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,740
There's always a new guy every year.

619
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,800
There was, no, I came here, I was to understand there would be pleasure saucers.

620
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,420
There will be.

621
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:52,680
And there will be.

622
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,880
It's just that they'll have pastries on them.

623
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,400
There will be.

624
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,600
Someday.

625
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,640
This but seven, someday.

626
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,540
There will be saucers with pastries on them.

627
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,520
At least that.

628
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,740
There are potential pleasure saucers.

629
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,440
Now I see where you were going with that yesterday, Hal.

630
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,780
You were setting them up for disappointment.

631
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,600
Let's concentrate on the pastries and not on the disappointment.

632
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,920
Your life is a lie.

633
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,380
The Buddha said that everything is pain.

634
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,400
You have to suffer for your faith a little bit.

635
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,120
Yeah, 19 a lucky number or something?

636
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,760
It's legal.

637
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,240
Yeah.

638
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,420
Well, I guess Reverend Pease had the right idea when he started the 18X Day Program.

639
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,560
He still hasn't said if you are

640
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:42,880
First of all no matter when you go to heaven or to hell to practice that you need to have

641
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,660
the pleasure saucers in a म

642
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,900
Madonna作 fini!

643
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,620
The pleasure suckers.

644
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,460
I'm about to rupture Dr. Dark right now.

645
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:09,800
Well, do you feel smart as I feel?

646
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,800
I'm sleeping in next year. We'll see if anything different happens.

647
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,340
I'm tempted. I'm real tempted.

648
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:20,480
That would break the chain, you know, the horrible vicious cycle.

649
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,000
If you and me stayed in bed, Princess Wee, you and Hal could drive.

650
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,200
I can see the sex to sexy cartoon right now.

651
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,640
And there's a mule too.

652
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,520
Well, where's the scrapple? It's morning. It's breakfast time.

653
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,240
If they couldn't beam us up, could they at least beam down some breakfast?

654
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:46,380
Yeah.

655
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,560
We have something. We're here to do so.

656
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,980
A little tang with the breakfast.

657
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,880
Why don't you and Dr. Dark get married?

658
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,140
I'm crazy. I'm not stupid.

659
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,120
Tangs for the mammaries.

660
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,040
Oh, God.

661
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,600
The horror. The horror.

662
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,420
The puns. That's what I mean.

663
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,980
That's why they call it punishment.

664
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,680
Oh, he sounds like Lurch.

665
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,340
First he sounded like he was taking a hard shit and now...

666
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,860
What are we looking at here, Susie?

667
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,060
A circle of wheelchairs 20 years from now?

668
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,280
Wheeling around.

669
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,460
You're going to be here.

670
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,740
All right, all right, all right.

671
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,080
You know.

672
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,200
All right, all right, all right.

673
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:45,880
Yeah, all right.

674
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,660
Bam!

675
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,840
Oh, man.

676
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,180
Well, have you thought of an excuse?

677
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,560
Because I don't know shit.

678
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,260
Sure.

679
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,640
We've tried everything.

680
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,600
I can't think of anything left.

681
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,200
I'd say just run.

682
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,280
It's more fun to chase you.

683
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,320
Okay, well, we brought Yakety Sack.

684
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,340
He's got a jack on the boombox.

685
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,620
Oh, God.

686
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,260
Sorry.

687
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,740
No, no, no.

688
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,980
That's all we need.

689
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,200
Yakety Sack plays really loud.

690
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:24,860
I have to go.

691
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,300
Make a note of that for next year.

692
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,940
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

693
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,380
Monday morning's coming real soon.

694
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,240
We kind of expected to be all the way past the moon.

695
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,780
But then again, we should have known.

696
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,220
We should have known.

697
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:14,760
We should have known.

698
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,320
We should have known.

699
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,620
Go away.

700
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:16,620


701
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:16,620


702
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:16,620


703
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:16,620


704
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:16,620


705
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:16,620


706
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:16,620


707
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:16,620


708
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,780
Bob won't even throw us a fucking bone.

709
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,680
Now, let's see what is on the schedule for today.

710
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,380
Yes, we're going to check the docs.

711
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,800
I thus say that today is July 5th.

712
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,820
Apparently.

713
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,320
And apparently, not the year nineteen side coronavirus.

714
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:45,320


715
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:55,300
Well, let's go back to the conspiracy calendar just for mutual convenience, like synchronizing your watches before going over the edge of the trenches.

716
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,260
Sure. Whatever that means.

717
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:08,160
Well, it means that if we have a task to do, we all ought to know what time it is or be on the same page, as these crazy kids say.

718
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:17,460
Well, the next thing up here will be the Ask Dr. Howell show. The Hour of Slack will be preempted by Ask Dr. Howell.

719
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,220
I thought it came after the Hour of Slack.

720
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,080
We have to give them plenty of time to write down their answers and borrow pens.

721
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,880
We need a beautiful, lovely assistant.

722
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,040
Not here yet.

723
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,400
It could be female. That would help with the loveliness.

724
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:35,960
Maybe.

725
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,140
This is kind of a surprise.

726
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,080
It's sausage fest this morning, isn't it?

727
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,760
We are too early. We need to wait.

728
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:48,060
Fat Mandy and Rachel Weirdigan are the only females in this room full of monsters.

729
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,880
You can pass those out.

730
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,920
I can donate this one pen, but there are pens scattered around, I'm sure.

731
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,020
We have hardly begun. In fact, we did not begin the Hour of Slack.

732
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,580
We're doing Ask Dr. Howell now?

733
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,920
Well, no. We're giving them time.

734
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,860
Time due. Right there.

735
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,220
To think of the question for Dr. Howell.

736
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:11,860
Well, there is that.

737
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,060
You need to put a lot of thought into that.

738
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,680
It's true.

739
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,740
Not that any of you look like you're ready for that much effort.

740
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,720
They have to put a lot of thought into it, I suppose.

741
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,020
No, I wouldn't say so.

742
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,320
I'd say just ask any old thing.

743
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,620
It's not up to you to work, but up to me.

744
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,320
There's no such thing as a bad question, supposedly.

745
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,080
Only a bad answer from me, where I let everyone down.

746
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,960
Our side, the team, my country.

747
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,880
My God.

748
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,160
The truth hurts.

749
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,280
Yes, constantly. Unremittingly.

750
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,780
Anyway, friends, I understand why everybody looks like they just woke up.

751
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:55,400
I'm sure all of you were faithfully down there at the Stone Circle at 7 a.m.

752
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,660
There were so many people, I lost count.

753
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,300
Actually, we counted six.

754
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,500
At first.

755
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:08,080
At five till seven, only six subgeniuses were at the appointed waiting place.

756
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:18,560
However, by one minute till seven, the place had suddenly filled up with a bunch of a new stone circle, shall we say,

757
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:27,000
that came from Reverend 808's camp, where they'd been trying to fight the grip of gravity by changing their own personal gravity.

758
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:35,980
808 had some sort of gravitron that had moved from one to .999, so it was working.

759
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:36,900
Improvised.

760
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,120
Improvised.

761
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,420
Improvised.

762
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:37,960
Improvised.

763
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,140


764
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,140


765
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,140


766
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,140


767
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,140


768
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,140


769
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,140


770
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,140


771
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,140


772
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,140


773
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,140


774
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,140


775
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,140


776
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,600
Improvised.

777
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:44,420
So when the saucers didn't come, or rather, the rupture didn't happen, they could blame me.

778
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,540
As always happens, as if I was Bob.

779
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,900
The same whiny complaint.

780
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,140
Even my own wife was bitching at me about that.

781
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,820
Well, you and Philo thought it'd be funny.

782
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,700
I don't know why you did that.

783
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,480
You said it'd be funny to make everybody get up at seven.

784
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:03,000
As if we dictate the schedule for the men from Planet X.

785
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,680
Yeah, you'd make it more comfortable if it were up to you.

786
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,100
Sure.

787
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,840
We would have made it.

788
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,000
You know, there's a nice spring day in the afternoon.

789
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,760
Or the evening in twilight.

790
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,920
If we'd had that sort of...

791
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,900
But we can't decide when the world's going to end.

792
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,080
We can only...

793
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,680
You never know.

794
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,460
Apparently that's the lesson.

795
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,120
Damn it!

796
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,080
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

797
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,120
In fact, I posted a thing at about eight o'clock this morning.

798
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:33,480
I got on the Scrub Genius forum and just posted the header, well, comma, fuck.

799
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,740
That'll show them.

800
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,300
Yeah.

801
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:35,800
Yeah.

802
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,300
Yeah.

803
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,840
Well.

804
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,900
So I guess Reverend Pease was right in starting that 18X Day Facebook page last week.

805
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,460
He must have been inspired with a prophetic vision when we thought he was only skylarking and kibitzing.

806
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:05,000
And I ask myself, brothers and sisters, why, why, why does Dobbs keep breaking his promise?

807
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:05,300


808
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:11,780
Some would say it has to do with the confusion of the calendar.

809
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:16,080
The Julian and the Gregorian and the dates that have been dropped.

810
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:22,680
I personally think it's because Bob smoked a bit too much frop.

811
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:30,200
But then again, maybe we're not good enough.

812
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,940
Maybe we're not slack enough.

813
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,100
Maybe we're not...

814
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,280
Maybe we're not...

815
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,620
ready for the promise that Bob has given to us.

816
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:49,720
Maybe we have not done something to ensure the saucer's arrival.

817
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,360
So ask yourself, brothers and sisters, what can you do?

818
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,120
What can you do?

819
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,020
What can you do?

820
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:09,160
What can you do to appease J.R. Bob Dobbs?

821
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:30,100
Let's just say for one second, brothers and sisters, that maybe the problem is this.

822
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,000
What can you do?

823
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,000


824
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,000


825
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,000


826
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Maybe instead of...

827
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,000


828
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:43,500
swimming in slack. We're too busy pissing in it. Maybe brothers and sisters there's

829
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:52,860
a little mistake we've been making. Maybe we thought that slack was for the taking

830
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,700
and not the making.

831
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:22,260
So here we sit, broken hearted, paid $35 and you know the rest. Wouldn't want to offend

832
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:22,260


833
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:29,420
Well, I don't know if you want to make everyone regret attending and going over the usual

834
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,980
procedures that bond us all together as one superior claim.

835
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,800
I'm just going to say that I'm not going to be a sling of devoted subgeniuses.

836
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,120
Well, one thing it does is that as long as we have X Day dangling in front of us like

837
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:52,300
a carrot, our people are less likely to kill their co-workers and relatives.

838
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,840
They just fantasize about burning the whole place down.

839
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:01,260
Right. And it's not that we're trying to... Some people go, well, they just give these

840
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,960
murderous subgeniuses an outlet. So they must really be worried.

841
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,120
No, no, no.

842
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,500
That's what we do. We work for the conspiracy.

843
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:13,960
Also somebody once accused us... The proof that we were really part of the CIA was that

844
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,060
we collect personal information on people like their address.

845
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,880
So we can mail them things.

846
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,320
Well yeah, come to think of it, every magazine and mail order company in the world then must

847
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,180
be working for the... For Obabo and his minions.

848
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,940
Well, that's for history to say.

849
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,220
Thanks, Obabo.

850
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:34,940
Thanks, Bob.

851
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,080
That's who we can blame.

852
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,760
We did already do that.

853
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,240
At some point, I'd say about 7.15 this morning,

854
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,260
the gathered many were chanting,

855
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,000
Thanks, Obama!

856
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,640
Because that's what you do when anything goes wrong.

857
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,100
That's just an automatic knee-jerk reaction.

858
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,000
Where will he stop?

859
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,320
Now he even prevented the end of the world.

860
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,740
Somebody really ought to do something.

861
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,040
But we've got to go on,

862
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,960
make the best of what we've got,

863
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,600
and see if out of those ashes we can rise again,

864
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,100
phoenix-like, into a new dominion

865
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,980
and make our own last days before rupture

866
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,740
the best of those days.

867
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,260
Well, that would be easier if I had a prescription for some Vim.

868
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,880
Or did I mention, I've been begging for Vim this whole week.

869
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,780
If anybody has an extra Vim, a capsule,

870
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,580
syrup, I don't care.

871
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,180
I've got the vigor, but I'm lacking Vim these days.

872
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,680
But have you paid the vigorish?

873
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,040
That's the difficulty.

874
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,100
How about instead of a very enthusiastic killstang chant,

875
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,300
like a very unenthusiastic killstang.

876
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,800
Killstang.

877
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:54,900
Killstang.

878
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,880
I'm a killstang.

879
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,160
Can we still get to killstang?

880
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,840
Oh, no.

881
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,920
Oh, no.

882
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,600
Please don't kill me.

883
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,180
It's not my fault.

884
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,840
I'm not Bob.

885
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:06,480
Right.

886
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,500
The exes told Bob what time it was.

887
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:16,080
I went to ex day and all I got was this hour of slack recording.

888
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,260
Thanks, Bob.

889
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,880
Thanks, Bob-o.

890
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,520
Or something similar.

891
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,400
Thanks, Obama.

892
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,480
Thanks, Obama.

893
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,960
Thanks, Obama.

894
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,020
Thanks, Bob.

895
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,920
As the Russians say,

896
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,020
God is in heaven.

897
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,260
And Bob is far, far away.

898
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,300
That's in English.

899
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,360
That's not Russian.

900
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,720
Well, they just speak American over there.

901
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,120
No, he means he was hurrying through it.

902
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,400
He was rushing through it.

903
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:57,160
Well, I say we all go to our respective hovels, sleeping bags, tents, mud puddles.

904
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,580
Not after a week.

905
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,120
And meditate.

906
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:01,980
And, uh,

907
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,880
Where is it?

908
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,040
Pray.

909
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:03,720
Pray.

910
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,580
This is the tiny communal sleeping bag you're talking about.

911
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,660
Your tent.

912
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,260
You are providing this...

913
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,000
No, your tent.

914
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,580
Your tent.

915
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,360
That's the communal sleeping bag.

916
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,060
That's a good idea.

917
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,540
I thought it was a dump truck with one of those sheets that rolls over the top.

918
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,260
Wasn't the honey dipper man just a minute ago?

919
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,840
Maybe we catch a ride with him.

920
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,740
He's probably got a cooler place to go.

921
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,180
You're a real honey dipper.

922
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,360
That's a building.

923
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:32,620
That's a building.

924
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:32,820
That's a building.

925
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:32,820


926
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:32,820


927
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:32,820


928
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:32,820


929
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:32,820


930
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:32,820


931
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,160
Well, we're going to waddle back on up the hill, I guess.

932
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,040
Thanks for showing up and keeping up the FIB.

933
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,820
I hope the monster of Wisteria doesn't kill us all before.

934
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:46,160
Really?

935
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:48,700
That's it?

936
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,880
Yeah, I'm afraid that's it.

937
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,360
But join us later on tonight when we'll burn the effigy of Bob.

938
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,800
Hey, Hal, this means we have to do a show at 3 o'clock.

939
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,720
What does?

940
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,560
The fact that the world did not end.

941
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,460
They said not in this country, boy.

942
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:09,800
Oh, man.

943
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,260
Use a fork like any decent American, why don't you?

944
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,380
We don't take to Swisland in this part of the country.

945
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,040
We are in the land of Bob and I know what's right for me.

946
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:26,920
I'm going to stir my coffee with a fork and I'll drink it here today.

947
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,320
When you come to a fork in the road,

948
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,080
take it.

949
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:36,460
Take a fork for the USA.

950
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:39,840
Now that's different.

951
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,180
America, fork, yeah.

952
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:46,200
Come on again to say the motherfucking day, yeah.

953
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,040
A spontaneous musical recitation by Reverend Ivan State.

954
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,340
We may be lucky enough to hear Princess Ray sing that later.

955
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,240
Oh, yeah, there's going to be great musical stuff tonight.

956
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,200
If it all goes according to plan, there will be some historic performances,

957
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:00,700
long.

958
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,120
Remembered, which we should certainly endeavor to record.

959
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:10,000
Although there's something to be said for just being there at the time and listening to it.

960
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:16,140
Be a part of this happy company, this special band, this breed.

961
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,380
Merry pack of fools waiting for the aliens.

962
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,620
My goodness, what a noisy laboring engine.

963
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,680
Someone's surely having motor difficulties there.

964
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,600
After a year.

965
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,680
Well, they didn't think they were going to need it today.

966
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,900
They thought they were going to be on their pleasure dome, so they drove their...

967
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,220
All right, twist the knife in the wound.

968
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,700
Be that way.

969
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:45,160
So now they're back in their old internal combustion energy, inefficient gas guzzling.

970
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,920
Melted dinosaur consuming.

971
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:55,880
The saddest part of the whole thing is the discordians will just be able to laugh at us again.

972
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,480
Well, their job is easy.

973
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,680
And the fine spaghetti monster cultists.

974
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,020
Ours is hard.

975
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,120
Those simps, wimps, and gimps.

976
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,280
They don't...

977
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:04,880
Oh, ha ha.

978
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,000
Our god's bigger than your god.

979
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,280
They're just reactionaries.

980
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:14,560
A bunch of people idled by history in some tidal backpool.

981
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:21,940
Yes, although discordian thought does in some sense inform subgenius doctrine,

982
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:29,820
we consider ourselves to have leapfrogged and bounded far away from their dismal swamp of defeatism.

983
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,660
I don't really know anything about the discordians.

984
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,220
Are they hot?

985
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,640
Well, some might be, but usually not.

986
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,460
Not for long.

987
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,600
They don't make much of an effort to do anything.

988
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,860
Like many big mammals, they're not hot for that long.

989
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,220
Yes, you can.

990
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,440
That's why I modified my original statement about discordians.

991
00:44:50,840 --> 00:45:00,380
As you know, they follow the goddess Eris, who threw the golden apple of discord into the convocation of the gods on Mount Olympus.

992
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,720
Precipitating the Trojan War.

993
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:07,340
Because the apple of discord is inscribed for the fairest.

994
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,700
And everyone tries to be the fairest.

995
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:16,740
And that, of course, was the cause of the Trojan War, if not all wars and conflicts.

996
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,040
All is vanity.

997
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,820
All is vanity.

998
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:29,920
It became the province of an illiterate sheep herder to judge between the goddesses Athena, Juno, and Aphrodite.

999
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,900
And, of course, he chose Aphrodite as who wouldn't.

1000
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,140
And thus, it all happened.

1001
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:40,700
The death of Priam, Ajax, all those guys.

1002
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,400
Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.

1003
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,900
Dr. Howe probably, well, this is typical.

1004
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:53,520
A subgenius knows more about discordianism than the average discordian does.

1005
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,660
Yes, Canadians know more about who the U.S. president is than people in the U.S. know who the president is.

1006
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,360
Although subgenius can probably answer this question.

1007
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,700
People in the U.S. know who the president is.

1008
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:00,700


1009
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,480
The president of Canada.

1010
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,080
The average American Christian.

1011
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:15,240
If you ask them, who are the four authors of the New Testament, they'll kind of scratch their heads and go, well, it don't matter.

1012
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,260
They've been saying the phrase Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John their whole lives.

1013
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:24,520
But when you ask them the question, who are the authors of the New Testament, it doesn't connect.

1014
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,100
There's no connection there at all.

1015
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,700
So, they've learned in idolatry.

1016
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,980
Idolatrous rote learning without considering what they're attempting to import to their hard drives.

1017
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,480
If you can say they have learned at all.

1018
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:46,940
My father, Pappy Stang, is going to get up tomorrow morning and preach at the Methodist church in Stangville.

1019
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,680
Actually, he doesn't so much preach.

1020
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,160
He teaches Bible history.

1021
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:59,800
Because despite being what most people would call an atheist, he knows more about the Bible than most preachers.

1022
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,700
And he delights.

1023
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,540
He delights in finding the really scary and contradictory parts.

1024
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:13,700
Like when the bear tears up, attacks a bunch of children simply because they made fun of an old man's bald pate.

1025
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:14,260
Yes.

1026
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,180
And she-bear.

1027
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,440
They were ripped into quivering shreds in the book of Elijah.

1028
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,960
These smart-alecky kids.

1029
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,400
That's the kind of thing my dad likes to bring up.

1030
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:23,840
Yeah.

1031
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,300
And point out that, you know, if we were to hew directly the Bible.

1032
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,580
That's a pun there.

1033
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,500
If we were to hew.

1034
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,900
Directly the Bible teachings.

1035
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:45,320
Why every time somebody picked up trash on the Sabbath, you'd have to stone them to death with cinder blocks for picking up sticks on the Sabbath.

1036
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,660
And then you have to decide, well, which is the Sabbath, Saturday or Sunday?

1037
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,600
So this is the kind of thing.

1038
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,000
Some folks say it's Sunday.

1039
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,180
And the Lord smote the armies of Sennacherib.

1040
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,420
And the Israelites killed the Midianites.

1041
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,760
Men, women, and children because of one that pisseth against the wall.

1042
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:13,560
This is the kind of things that make Pappy Stang hated and feared in Stangsville, Texas.

1043
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,800
Pardon me.

1044
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,540
There's a family tradition to keep up.

1045
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,280
Folks say not to go near the castle when they're in the neighborhood.

1046
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,120
There's a long line of atheistical preaching in my family.

1047
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,460
I learned only a few years ago that almost all of my...

1048
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,560
Maternal grand... or pater... both sides.

1049
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,940
Maternal and paternal.

1050
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,180
Grandfathers, great-grandfathers were all preachers.

1051
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,860
Until they started to morph into lawyers at a certain point.

1052
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:46,440
Because in my bloodline, we have Methodist circuit riders in the 19th century.

1053
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,620
Oh, Methodists also.

1054
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:48,800
Yes, curious.

1055
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,360
Brother Stang, yes.

1056
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,100
Let's go burn down the Baptist church.

1057
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,840
That's the first thing...

1058
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,660
That'll teach those blasphemers, scoffers, and mockers.

1059
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,320
Then we'll get around to the Taliban.

1060
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,600
The Moslem.

1061
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,140
The Islamic and the sub-Gemuses.

1062
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,800
We'll snap those Talibans in the locker room.

1063
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,360
But that only when we can get to it.

1064
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,300
Because first things first.

1065
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,580
Yeah, first... what was the first thing?

1066
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,560
Oh, slack, that's right.

1067
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,700
I like that one.

1068
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,220
Slack.

1069
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,040
That's the one for me.

1070
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,900
Slack is the luminous cloud.

1071
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,560
Slack is the soft voice.

1072
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,360
We in ourselves rejoice.

1073
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,120
Slack.

1074
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:39,040
Slack is like a lovely, hard piece of candy where you can't reach it in the morning.

1075
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,920
As it's stuck behind your back teeth.

1076
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,360
I lost a tooth last night.

1077
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,280
That's how gorgeous I lost a tooth.

1078
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,820
While you were singing?

1079
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:54,420
No, while I was enjoying the performance of Trademark Evolutionary Control Committee.

1080
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,200
I'd gnashed my teeth so hard during that terrible band.

1081
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,480
That pristine...

1082
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,260
That went after it.

1083
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,960
There was a wailing of gnashing and gnashing of teeth.

1084
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,500
I've gnashed my teeth so bad.

1085
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,240
But everybody loved that band.

1086
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,300
They were dancing in delight.

1087
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,740
That is bad.

1088
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,640
They really had a party.

1089
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,200
Fucked up.

1090
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,300
In case anybody wondered if I was saying it was very fucked up.

1091
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,640
That's how fucked up it is.

1092
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,840
All right.

1093
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,420
Yeah, yeah.

1094
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:29,940
All right.

1095
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,360
Very.

1096
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,120
Most fucked up.

1097
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,680
That band last night was so bad that it broke my recorder.

1098
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:48,020
When they started the card in there, quit recording.

1099
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,240
That was a King Usnevich and his Usnevich Tones tribute band.

1100
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,380
That's to be expected.

1101
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,440
I loved it.

1102
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,380
I didn't understand a word you just said.

1103
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,700
King Usnevich and his Usnevich.

1104
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,260
King Usnevich and his Usnevich Tones.

1105
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,420
That's a band?

1106
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,560
Yeah, they're the ones that originally did Yuck Em, Yuck Em.

1107
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,280
They were doing covers.

1108
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:09,980
Oh, okay.

1109
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,860
The most fabulous shit band.

1110
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:13,940
You would know.

1111
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:14,300
Ever.

1112
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:14,700
Yes.

1113
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:21,100
Norton put out three albums with extensive, like, microscopic liner notes.

1114
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,920
And I played all the time on my show before I found out it was a hoax.

1115
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,060
Oh, my God.

1116
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,480
Cope Coda of Brownsville Station.

1117
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,700
Smoking in the...

1118
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,320
The boys' room.

1119
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,460
Managed to...

1120
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,440
It was a fake bad band.

1121
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:35,700
Yeah.

1122
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,680
Those guys last night, if they were faking it, they were experts.

1123
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:39,480
Man.

1124
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:40,940
Actually, you know what?

1125
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:41,780
They were.

1126
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:42,520
Yeah.

1127
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,560
They rehearsed how to play that badly.

1128
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:51,400
It drove them crazy because there were times that it would only come out mediocre.

1129
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,620
And they're like, we're doing it wrong.

1130
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,680
Yeah, it's like, yeah, it's got to be worse.

1131
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,720
We've got to make this worse.

1132
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,060
If you know what the structure is...

1133
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:00,800
Oh, man.

1134
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:01,840
I know it can.

1135
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,000
Quality organ playing.

1136
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:03,640
Oh, God.

1137
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,240
We have to work on it.

1138
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:09,680
It's harder to be intentionally bad because as soon as it's funny, you're not doing it right.

1139
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,060
Yeah.

1140
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,120
Like, because then it's not bad anymore.

1141
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,820
It's good because it's funny.

1142
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,380
That describes this whole church.

1143
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,680
It should be, like, intentionally bad.

1144
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,440
Conscientiously, convictionally bad.

1145
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:28,560
King Yusnevich and his Yusnevich tone's bad.

1146
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,520
You have to find out how you play when you initiate.

1147
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:29,940
Oh, yeah.

1148
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,300
Yeah.

1149
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:30,480
Yeah.

1150
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:30,620
Yeah.

1151
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:30,680
Yeah.

1152
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,020
You can rationalize it.

1153
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:32,940
It's suck.

1154
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:33,980
It's suck.

1155
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:38,740
This is the suckiest thing that ever happened at any X-Day ever.

1156
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:39,500
Really?

1157
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:45,240
This is the suckiest, most horrible moment of any X-Day.

1158
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:45,920
I don't know.

1159
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,300
It's history-making in its suckiness.

1160
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,980
There was that one year I was on Spanish fly.

1161
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,120
Good Lord.

1162
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,200
Lost another three-root moment.

1163
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:54,900
That's pretty serious.

1164
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:59,480
I would have expected that to happen if you hit certain high notes.

1165
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,480
Your teeth might...

1166
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:00,960
...shatter.

1167
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:01,400
...failingly dental-

1168
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,120
Perhaps.

1169
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:02,940
...conditioned.

1170
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,500
Dr. Dark was asking if that's how I cleaned the bathtub by singing high.

1171
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,680
In fact, I have many dental things wrong.

1172
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,700
But he took me up to his trailer yesterday, actually.

1173
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,940
Hey, I have a quote about your husband.

1174
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,360
My husband's adorable.

1175
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,180
This originally, yes.

1176
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,640
Tommy Amoeba.

1177
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,180
This is like a Bob quote.

1178
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:29,860
Tommy Amoeba is the bridge, the gate, or the Bob between Devo and Elvis.

1179
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,060
Aww.

1180
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,400
How about that?

1181
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:32,860
You like that?

1182
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,160
There's a blurb you can put on your album.

1183
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:41,240
Tommy Amoeba is the bridge, the gate, or Bob between Devo and Elvis.

1184
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,860
For is he not the gatekeeper?

1185
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:44,860
Right, right.

1186
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,900
It's available online.

1187
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,840
He doesn't have any copies yet because they're not coming until next week.

1188
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:49,440
Yeah.

1189
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,740
It's not the Discordians.

1190
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,540
You can get them on the website.

1191
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,120
He got a new album.

1192
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:53,780
Yes.

1193
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,060
Look him up on the website.

1194
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,400
Who will stop the rain?

1195
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,120
Only Tommy Amoeba can stop the rain.

1196
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:00,460
Who will stop the rain?

1197
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,060
Who will stop the rain?

1198
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,420
There you go.

1199
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,620
More feedback.

1200
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,560
Best show ever!

1201
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:08,420


1202
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,140
Play TV.

1203
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:11,440
Go!

1204
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,800
Play TV.

1205
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,300
Go!

1206
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,000
Go!

1207
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:20,980
We're getting more people here to listen to the Hour of Slack than perhaps to play the

1208
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:27,700
Ask Dr. Hal show, then to see the Bobby Awards, the coverage of Bobby Awards ceremony, the

1209
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:33,540
Bulldada auction of the Treasures of Time will take place right here.

1210
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:41,780
And finally, the Costume Ball, where displayed like the gods and heroes of old, the subgeniuses

1211
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,340
in their prime will show what they've got.

1212
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:48,540
All right here under this roof of Caffeina's.

1213
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,220
So we have plenty to do.

1214
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,260
A mighty work.

1215
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:55,320
We must roll up our sleeves, gird up our loins for the struggle.

1216
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,680
Always very good.

1217
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:57,680


1218
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:03,460
I admired the way subgenius can generally speaking gird their loins in an attractive

1219
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:03,980
manner.

1220
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,620
You were up in the morning.

1221
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,060
Give me ideas, Phil.

1222
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:06,600
Or were you?

1223
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,340
No, you missed it.

1224
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:07,700
I tried.

1225
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,580
I depended on a fake device, my phone.

1226
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,440
I'll just shade his name here from the record.

1227
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,540
He girded his loins in neckties.

1228
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:20,460
He wore a loincloth of neckties and a top hat.

1229
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,360
He was very stylish.

1230
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:21,980
He's taking a stab at the pink boys.

1231
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,000
To meet the exes.

1232
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,180
Of course, no one figured out it would be so cold.

1233
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:27,660
By wearing their nooses as a style.

1234
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:27,660


1235
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,120
He was a very good judge at that time.

1236
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,340
With the mist rising from the ground.

1237
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:30,760
Dancing around his penis there.

1238
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,840
With the dew on his brow.

1239
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:33,600
Dewy brow.

1240
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,860
And the rust on his mane.

1241
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,460
And his loins girded in the nooses of the pink boys.

1242
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,800
That was Reverend Abnorm Nihill who invented that.

1243
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,360
Okay, well then his name shall not be shaded.

1244
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:44,440
That fashion.

1245
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,460
No, no, that's an idea that people will probably be copying for years to come.

1246
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:49,880
I guess.

1247
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,740
I got much criticism for not wearing pants.

1248
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,220
Why?

1249
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,840
But as I pointed out, we aren't going to wear pants in the new world.

1250
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:57,640
I don't know why.

1251
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:57,640


1252
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,300
Anyway.

1253
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:04,860
Unfortunately, we seem to have to wait another year before we can take our pants off for

1254
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,820
the new world.

1255
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,900
And dance around with our pants on our heads.

1256
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,100
Heck darn it.

1257
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,700
Heck fire it.

1258
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,300
Into thy hands I give my spirit.

1259
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,320
Did she just say Brahma's day?

1260
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:27,620
Did somebody just say Brahma's day?

1261
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:39,820
Ask yourself, brothers and sisters, how do you acquire your slack?

1262
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:50,480
Are you making your own slack or are you taking slack away from your fellow subgeniuses, brothers

1263
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,020
and sisters?

1264
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,620
Because you're not.

1265
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:57,620


1266
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:57,620


1267
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:57,620


1268
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:57,620


1269
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:57,620


1270
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:05,960
Because if you have read your subgenius pamphlet, if you have read Revelation X, if you have

1271
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,680
read the book of the subgenius, you would know.

1272
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:14,900
You would know that the subgenius must have slack.

1273
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,620
Let me repeat that a second time.

1274
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,600
Just in case you didn't catch it.

1275
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:30,820
The subgenius must have slack.

1276
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,620
What is the time?

1277
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,720
I can't see it from here.

1278
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,020
It's the end of this hour of slack.

1279
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,800
It is the end of this hour of slack.

1280
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,060
Friends, if you'd like more information about the Church of the Subgenius, the hour

1281
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:22,760
of slack, or anything we've played on this show, you're welcome to look at subgenius.com.

1282
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,520
For all the good it'll do you.

1283
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,100
Yeah, right.

1284
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:30,420
Or you can write to post office box 181-417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1285
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:30,900
Thank you.

1286
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,340
Your complaints are important to us.

1287
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,640
Please leave your name, number, and a brief message at the sound of the tone.

1288
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:48,860
Unfortunately, due to high volume load of processing your complaints, we are not immediately

1289
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:54,420
able to process them unless you ease the way with a sizable emoji.

1290
00:58:54,420 --> 00:59:16,540
We need to have practical clarification.

1291
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:17,220
Please do not getaroo overrun with content minutebolt collectively台 vanity or

1295
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,820
Be nice.

1296
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,140
There you are again.

1297
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:24,400
The��

1298
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:32,220
idly by in your car, your living room, your bedroom, your stateroom, your panic room,

1299
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,380
and just listen.

1300
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,960
This shit ain't free, folks.

1301
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:42,860
So how about you just skip that tall, half-skinny, half-one-percent extra hot shot split quad

1302
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,440
shot latte with whip?

1303
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:48,680
Or maybe just skip that lunch date with the cutie from the typing pool.

1304
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,480
After all, it's only going to lead to heartbreak.

1305
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:58,920
And spend that money now, right now, on something that will never give you up, and will never

1306
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,880
let you down, and will never run around and desert you.

1307
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:09,240
Because this station will never make you cry, they will never say goodbye, and they will

1308
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,180
never tell a lie and hurt you.

1309
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:17,780
So call the WCSB Cleveland Pledge Line, 216-687-6900.

1310
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,460
That number, once again, is 216-687-6900.

1311
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:25,860
With your donations now.

1312
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:29,640
Credit card pledges may be made online at WCSB.org.

1313
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:36,620
This plea for cash has been brought to you by the Self Genius Hour of Sweep.

1314
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:47,680
Ah, yes, and thanks to Reverend Suds Pasha for that WCSB pledge drive promo.

1315
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:51,460
That pledge number, 216-687-690.

1316
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,520
We'll be good through November 16th.

1317
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:01,660
And after that, well, there's a donation to the church and Hour of Slack, per se.

1318
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:07,080
A special button for that, right on the front page of Subgenius.com.

1319
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:13,600
And I don't think the name of the deliberately terrible band was mentioned in the recordings.

1320
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:18,480
They are the Arm-Negi Front from Athens, Ohio.

1321
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:21,460
When I tried to Google them, all that came up were names.

1322
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:21,460


1323
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,200
Or logs of past hours of Slack.

1324
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,040
Anyway, that's Arm-Negi Front.

1325
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:33,120
A-R-M-N-E-J-I for future reference.

1326
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,240
See you in the war.

1327
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,140
Hey, bye.
