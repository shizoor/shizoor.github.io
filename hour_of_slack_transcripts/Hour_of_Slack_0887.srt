1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
Uh, Puzzling Evidence presents the sub-G news show.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:04,720
Rockin' away!

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,000
Here the show is lifting off.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,300
Yeah, well, watch this.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,020
Three degrees.

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,340
Okay, we've blown one caller right out of the DMA-1 data bank.

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,580
The show is lifting off.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,140
This act is immutably decreed.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,620
It was rehearsed by ye and me.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,120
A billion years before this ocean rolled.

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,000
Millions and millions of years ago, giant dinosaurs roamed the earth.

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,620
And the earth was without form and void.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,880
And darkness was on the face of the deep.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,700
And God created great whales.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,120
Look at them go!

16
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,480
The white whale tasks me.

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,940
Yet he is but a mask.

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,880
It is the thing behind the mask I chiefly hate.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,260
The malignant thing that has plagued a frightened man since time began.

20
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,340
Bob!

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,540
Bob Bob!

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,800
Bob Bob!

23
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,860
Bob Bob!

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,380
Bob Bob!

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:12,700
Bob Bob!

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,220
The thing that mauls and mutilates our race.

27
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:25,760
Not killing us outright, but letting us live on with half a heart and half a lung.

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,000
Bob!

29
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,160
Bob Bob!

30
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,400
Bob Bob!

31
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:29,980
Bob Bob!

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,520
Bob Bob!

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,120
Bob Bob!

34
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,360
Bob!

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,380
That whale is as big as a satellite.

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,360
Super Inch!

37
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,560
It is a satellite!

38
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,580
Time for daily planning!

39
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,920
It's a giant whale orbiting the earth at thousands of miles an hour.

40
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,420
Just plain gloomy.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,960
Moby Dick may be big, but he ain't that big.

42
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,340
I do not fear Moby Dick.

43
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,660
I fear the wrath of God.

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,360
The wrath of God?

45
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,020
Bob!

46
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,240
Bob Bob!

47
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,460
Bob Bob!

48
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,500
Bob Bob!

49
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,040
Bob Bob!

50
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,340
Bob!

51
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,360
Bob Bob!

52
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:58,640
Bob Bob!

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,960
I spent my last breath at thee!

54
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,320
Thou dammit whale!

55
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,360
Bob Bob!

56
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,720
It gets dangerous sometimes.

57
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,740
You have to be careful.

58
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,480
Bob Bob!

59
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,220
Bob Bob!

60
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,540
Bob Bob!

61
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,460
Bob Bob!

62
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,740
Bob Bob!

63
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,320
Bob Bob!

64
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,900
Praise the Lord

65
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,280
And welcome to the subgenius radio ministry

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,880
Hour of Switch

67
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,560
Is it liquid or is it solid?

68
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,820
Liquid or solid?

69
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,220
Because further on in the thickness

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,700
There comes the thinness

71
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,380
For without the thinness

72
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,600
We would not be able to appreciate the thickness of the pudding

73
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,820
The pudding which cures

74
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,400
What the hell do you think you're doing?

75
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,280
Dragging your butt through the day

76
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,660
Selling body and soul to a bunch of bland normals

77
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,140
Acting stupid so they'll think you're one of them

78
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,440
Tired of getting all of the guilt

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,900
But none of the sex

80
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,960
There is a simple answer

81
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Dear friend

82
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,920
A glowing beacon of slack

83
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,740
Amidst the turmoil and darkness

84
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,580
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs

85
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,260
The living slack master

86
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,840
And his church of the subgenius

87
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,880
Bob brings a new destiny for the abnormal

88
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,020
For Bob comes to justify our sins

89
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,800
To unmask the conspiracy

90
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,380
And to get us back

91
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,420
The slack they stole away

92
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,180
It's us versus them

93
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,640
Are you gonna fry in hell on earth

94
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,300
Alongside the pink boys?

95
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:56,940
Or are you gonna die?

96
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,020
Or will you pull the wool over your own eyes

97
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,300
And accept Bob into your mind?

98
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,020
Repent!

99
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,000
Quit your job!

100
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,160
Slack off!

101
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,960
And praise Bob!

102
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,720
Church of the subgenius

103
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,480
Eternal salvation

104
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,600
Or triple your money back

105
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,680
Yes sir

106
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,900
Oh yes sir

107
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,540
That was the subgenius MTV commercial

108
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,000
With music by Mark Motherspa

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,920
The music in the background right now

110
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,420
Is by Hell Pope Huey

111
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,020
And this is

112
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,280
Hour of Slack

113
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,480
Number 887

114
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,920
And most of those have been original shows

115
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,620
We don't do reruns very often

116
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,000
I was gonna do one this time

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,580
And it's half a rerun

118
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,880
From Hour of Slack

119
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,120
200

120
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,940
Hour of Slack

121
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,960
175

122
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,200
From March 1991

123
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,860
Of great hysterical interest

124
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,820
In the form of

125
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,020
Puzzling Evidence

126
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,960
Papa Joe Mama

127
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,420
Dr. Howell

128
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,740
Gary Gabrogfran

129
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,720
And Dad of the Dad's New Slack Show

130
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,140
All excited about that one war

131
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,920
Which is still the same one

132
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,940
But also

133
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,460
Chaz

134
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,680
Professor Chaz Smith

135
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,040
Of ESO Swamp Radio

136
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,920
And I'm not sure

137
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,460
If I should mention

138
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,860
That he wrote a rock opera

139
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,120
Yesterday

140
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,920
It's even got real rocks in it

141
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,440
It just started spewing out of him

142
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,640
Man I've never seen Chaz so excited

143
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,880
Really it's just

144
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,220
It's great to see somebody's skills

145
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,000
Collide with their good mood

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,060
It's kind of contagious

147
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,380
So we get to hear that

148
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,500
Creative process

149
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,400
As it happens

150
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,560
But for the first part of the show

151
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,680
We go to war

152
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,300
War

153
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:56,500
War

154
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:56,880
War

155
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:56,900
War

156
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:58,600
War

157
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:04,940
War

158
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:04,960
War

159
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,100
War

160
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,220
War

161
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,240
War

162
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,120
War

163
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,160
War

164
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,200
War

165
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:26,820
War

166
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,820


167
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,820


168
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,820


169
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,820


170
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,820


171
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,820


172
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,820


173
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,820


174
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,820


175
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,820


176
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,820


177
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,820


178
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,820


179
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,820


180
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,840
War

181
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:26,860
War

182
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:26,880
War

183
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,740
Bye, Mr. Smith.

184
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,540
Fire!

185
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,940
Remember to keep up your observation in fields of fire.

186
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,500
It's a fine hot day here in Mid-Bay.

187
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,360
I mean, Plasticville.

188
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,360
I mean, Spudville.

189
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,620
Where is this?

190
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,400
Oh, I see.

191
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,620
Pinochle, Connecticut.

192
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,600
I'd like to relieve myself here.

193
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,500
Oh, just go behind that bush while I pop open a tasty Budrow beer.

194
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,760
I feel relieved already.

195
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,340
Give me one of them Budrow beers.

196
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:48,900
Sure.

197
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,400
You know, these babies have only got 99 calories.

198
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,220
Mmm, yummy.

199
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,360
Then we're going to work on some of those MTD highlands.

200
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,200
I need an HF processor to get out there.

201
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,960
Lord, those chief-ins are going to win that war.

202
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,760
Yes, they will.

203
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,200
They'll win it for Budrow, the official beer of the U.S. Army.

204
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,140
It's not the U.S. Olympics.

205
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,040
So when you've got those goggles on all night,

206
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,700
you take off that ANPVS-7A system.

207
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,220
At present, the gun action continues along the coast throughout the day and night,

208
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,420
both north and south.

209
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,620
Air strikes from the carriers have been overhead in and out of Vietnam

210
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,340
since last night.

211
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,480
Three o'clock this morning.

212
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,700
Fighting is taking place right now to the west of Hue and around...

213
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,400
...getting, Ronnie.

214
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,000
How are you?

215
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,640
I'm doing good.

216
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,820
God bless you and God bless America and our troops.

217
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,080
I got a question for Abdul here.

218
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,460
Just bear with me.

219
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,040
First of all, I want to know what the big stink is about the U.S.

220
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,540
killing 500 civilians who were at a military command and control center

221
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,080
when Saddam Hussein has been a way of life for Saddam for years.

222
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,620
What's been a way of life, sir?

223
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,400
He's killed a reported 7,000 civilians in Kuwait.

224
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,200
Don't you think Saddam has realized his butt is being kicked

225
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,220
and now he's looking for sympathy from the world?

226
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,720
Okay, all right. Let him respond to that, sir, without the vernacular.

227
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,440
Please don't pick up the bad words, kick and other things.

228
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,460
These are uncivilized words.

229
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,080
But there have been reports of 7,000 Kuwaitians.

230
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,860
That's not true. That's not true.

231
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,120
You better check your information.

232
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,040
You better learn your information before trying to...

233
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,060
...to kill them.

234
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,180
...to spread out that information.

235
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,720
I could tell from the way you addressed me you are an ignorant man.

236
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,740
Our guest is Ambassador Abdul Amir Al-Ambari,

237
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,620
the Iraqi Ambassador to the United Nations.

238
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,420
We'll be more than honored.

239
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,220
...and the boy is beginning to die.

240
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,080
...and Hussein also says, sir, bye.

241
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,380
And now you can see the practice battle beginning.

242
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,600
Boy, if this is the practice battle, I'd hate to see the real battle.

243
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,880
Look at the blows given and received by the hearty spectator.

244
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,340
This war is going to be won on the playing fields of...

245
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,340
...Eton.

246
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,440
Yeah, right.

247
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,760
Just remember there's no hiding places in this war.

248
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,420
No, but they're all getting a hiding, though.

249
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,460
Look at those lively lads pound each other with pillows stuffed with styrofoam.

250
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,060
That's good training. It builds strong muscles and backs and helps morale.

251
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:21,200
And adds the clean, manly sweat to the early morning to flavor the day with a blast of methane that'll guarantee...

252
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,380
...you to flee the locker room in record time.

253
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,900
And here comes the woman's brigade. Let's not forget our fighting women in green and tan.

254
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,240
That's right, it's an intimate situation there, folks.

255
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:42,440
And this is the Chadar Squad, formed specifically as not to titillate the irritation of our fractious Saudi Arabian host.

256
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:48,220
Now, of course, the show comes in a number of variants, this one being the 4-slash-250 Armament Conductor Scout Vehicle.

257
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,180
Other shows include the IFB and the Fire Support Mortar Squad.

258
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,180


259
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,840
The Airborne Carrier, the Missile Tank Destroyer, the Armored Ambulance.

260
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,400
This is the diesel powered ride-out.

261
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,860
So we can force patients into any part of the battlefield with the Armored Ambulance.

262
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,960
Yeah, diesel ambulances all run on diesel power.

263
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,420
You know, you got some guy wounded and maybe he's losing his nerves, so you take him out into the battlefield and just drop him off in the Armored Ambulance.

264
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,760
Then his body is bagged for future reference.

265
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,060
Criminals, that sort of thing.

266
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,800
Freeze-dried professionals.

267
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,360
We can tell what they're like by using these remains.

268
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,640
Of course, we don't want others, say, foreign nationals poaching on our preserve.

269
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,640
Ha ha ha.

270
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,500
So we use the total filtration and ventilation circuit seats for the show.

271
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,280
Then pop, it's into the bag.

272
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,080
This thing, this thing's wonderful.

273
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,500
Yeah, it works just like a stapler. See, it's got this little grip here.

274
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,100
I like the way it just sort of wraps around my hands and allows my fingers to tickle.

275
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,860
Boy, if that was a snake, it would have bit you.

276
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,880
Hey, it is a snake! Get it off your hand!

277
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh, I hope it didn't bite you. I'm afraid he's been stung.

278
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,680
Oh, look at his face.

279
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,600
Oh, boy, what a venomous sting.

280
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,300
It's swelling. No, that's another region.

281
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,120
Oh, it had a school there for a while, though.

282
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:55,820
It's a swell, man.

283
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,200
Let's not move into the other regions, because then war will be even worse.

284
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,380
Yes, down in the netherland.

285
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,140
Well, there are new regulations and what we can report on in this war.

286
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,100
We're meeting our various electronic helpers, which tell us how scary things are in the real world.

287
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,360
Oh, no, here come the overhead UFOs that are dispensing the Agent Green.

288
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,220
They're flying in a perfect formation.

289
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,420
Those are just little Arab guys.

290
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,040
I believe...

291
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,200
No, they're flying on their towels there.

292
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,760
Those are referred to as magic carpets out here, Ed.

293
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,320
Oh, of course.

294
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,840
It looks like a nice one there, perhaps an oriental rug variety.

295
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,980
It's an electromagnetic principle that allows these things to float and suspended in midair.

296
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,400
But our scientists will soon have solved this mysterious puzzle, and we'll be flying on our own fleet of A4 stealth carpets.

297
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,580
Little enemy guys, whichever enemy you wish.

298
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:52,280
Well, they've been working on these for a long time, Hal, but they've had difficulty meeting the price fixing that the Pentagon had.

299
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,000
They weren't able to deliver for under $30 billion.

300
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,320
Well, I don't know if we can afford to discuss national security matters like this without clearance on an open channel.

301
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,200
Well, we'll have to speak in scramble.

302
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,980
It's tough out there.

303
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,660
.

304
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,280
.

305
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,960
.

306
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:06,960


307
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:06,960


308
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:06,960


309
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:06,960


310
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:06,960


311
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:06,960


312
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:06,960


313
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:36,960


314
00:12:36,960 --> 00:13:06,960


315
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:36,960


316
00:13:36,960 --> 00:14:06,960


317
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:36,960


318
00:14:36,960 --> 00:15:06,960


319
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:36,960


320
00:15:36,960 --> 00:16:06,960


321
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:36,960


322
00:16:36,960 --> 00:17:06,960


323
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:36,960


324
00:17:36,960 --> 00:18:06,960


325
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:36,960


326
00:18:36,960 --> 00:19:06,960


327
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:36,960


328
00:19:36,960 --> 00:20:06,960


329
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:36,960


330
00:20:36,960 --> 00:21:06,960


331
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:36,960


332
00:21:36,960 --> 00:22:06,960


333
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:36,960


334
00:22:36,960 --> 00:23:06,960


335
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:36,960


336
00:23:36,960 --> 00:24:06,960


337
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:36,960


338
00:24:36,960 --> 00:25:06,960


339
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:36,960


340
00:25:36,960 --> 00:26:06,960


341
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:36,960


342
00:26:36,960 --> 00:27:06,960


343
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:36,960


344
00:27:36,960 --> 00:28:06,960


345
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:36,960


346
00:28:36,960 --> 00:29:06,960


347
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:36,960


348
00:29:36,960 --> 00:30:06,960


349
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:36,960


350
00:30:36,960 --> 00:31:06,960


351
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:36,960


352
00:31:36,960 --> 00:32:06,960


353
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:36,960


354
00:32:36,960 --> 00:33:06,960


355
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:36,960


356
00:33:36,960 --> 00:34:06,960


357
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:36,960


358
00:34:36,960 --> 00:35:06,960


359
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:36,960


360
00:35:36,960 --> 00:36:06,960


361
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:36,960


362
00:36:36,960 --> 00:37:06,960


363
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:36,960


364
00:37:36,960 --> 00:38:06,960


365
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:36,960


366
00:38:36,960 --> 00:39:06,960


367
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:36,960


368
00:39:36,960 --> 00:40:06,960


369
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:36,960


370
00:40:36,960 --> 00:41:06,960


371
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:36,960


372
00:41:36,960 --> 00:42:06,960


373
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:36,960


374
00:42:36,960 --> 00:43:06,960


375
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:36,960


376
00:43:36,960 --> 00:44:06,960


377
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:36,960


378
00:44:36,960 --> 00:45:06,960


379
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:36,960


380
00:45:36,960 --> 00:46:06,960


381
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:36,960


382
00:46:36,960 --> 00:47:06,960


383
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:36,960


384
00:47:36,960 --> 00:48:06,960


385
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:36,960


386
00:48:36,960 --> 00:49:06,960


387
