1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
I've done far worse than kill you.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,020
I've hurt you.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,280
And I wish to go on hurting you.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:09,540
What?

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,520
For earth's sake.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,300
Yes, I know.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,660
What time is it?

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,920
I wonder exactly in a temporary way.

9
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,640
Can we really understand time?

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,120
Of course you can, kids.

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,420
And here's the easiest way you can.

12
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,380
Just pull those gentle, gentle, tender flaps apart

13
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,460
and sit down quietly between your own knees

14
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,360
and just begin.

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,820
That's right.

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,940
Be brave and time to the music.

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,420
Go.

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:39,640
Go.

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,280
Well, we've asked everybody here

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,060
if they've got a special request

21
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,540
for each and every one of you here.

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,880
God have given

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,100
bad, bad hit.

24
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,120
The devil have gone far enough.

25
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,140
Prayer warrior.

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,180
Meet me on my knees.

27
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,280
On your knees, Friday night

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,700
at 7.30.

29
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,560
And listen now, my friends,

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,920
the prayer tower is open.

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,980
The prayer tower is open right now.

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,520
You that need prayer.

33
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,160
My God.

34
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,480
The prayer team

35
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,620
is here on the telephone.

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,780
Right now.

37
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,000
The prayer team.

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,880
The prayer team.

39
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:24,780
The prayer team.

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,360


41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,360


42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,360


43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,360


44
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,360


45
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,220
And you hear the protest in fact.

46
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,820
Well, welcome to the Hour of Slack.

47
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,660
Praise Bob, Golden, Connie, Brad.

48
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,560
Yes, welcome to the Hour of Slack.

49
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,820
I have no time to make a show of loving kindness

50
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,880
before my fellow men.

51
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,120
Not in this life.

52
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,520
I've too much laughing to do.

53
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,380
Hurrah!

54
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,440
This just goes to show.

55
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,520
What is with meaning?

56
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,280
You know what I mean?

57
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,720
Meaning is so relative.

58
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,920
What is reality?

59
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,360
What is reality?

60
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


61
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


62
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


63
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


64
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


65
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


66
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


67
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,700
Yeah, what is reality?

68
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,060
You know what you what?

69
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,340
I don't get it.

70
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,800
What is reality?

71
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:11,480
See, we can make people trip right on the air on various toxic substances, bacterial agents.

72
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,160
And some of them only charge 15%.

73
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,380
Reality is what doesn't go away when dot, dot, dot.

74
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,220
But let's leave things of this world behind

75
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:39,320
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.

76
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,260
This so-called civilization?

77
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,200
On the day when we finally realize that things are all backwards

78
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,800
and we have slack without work in the promised kingdom of Bob Dobbs,

79
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,740
then perhaps we'll find the true civilization which needs not Xerox machines nor fancy coats and ties.

80
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,460
It don't have to have them.

81
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,240
It can have them.

82
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,460
You can be civilized and not live in a cave.

83
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,940
But you're probably going to be more civilized being one of these characters that sits in a cave scratching his butt

84
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,680
than you are running around on this treadmill of false slack.

85
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,600
Ah, yes, and look at the humans lined up for the slaughterhouse.

86
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,100
Ah, yes, the harvest.

87
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,020
Praise Bob.

88
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,760
Let there be slack.

89
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,960
I'm just an American boy.

90
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,480
Raised on MTV.

91
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:38,380
And I seen all the kids in the soda pop-ups, but none of them look like me.

92
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:48,500
So I started looking around for a light out of the dim.

93
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:55,720
And the first thing I heard that made sense was the world of my heart.

94
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,040
And I'm a piece built on them.

95
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,100
I shot a new.

96
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,000
There's no God but God.

97
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:17,000
If my daddy could see when I change around my feet.

98
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,460
He don't understand.

99
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,240
Sometimes a man's got to fight for what.

100
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,280
He believes.

101
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,840
And I believe God is great.

102
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,300
All praise due to him.

103
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,200
And if I should die, I'd rise up to the sky.

104
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,040
Just like Jesus, peace be upon him.

105
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,800
I shot a new.

106
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,220
La, la, la, la, la.

107
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,640
Well, look.

108
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,440
It didn't rain.

109
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,700
The skybies 67 miles above sea level, looking at the sky face.

110
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:07,980


111
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,020
My bourbon's like a baby, رَفِي выًر Nina smut.

112
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,820
The boy's more or perfect than God.

113
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,260
He becomesителя.

114
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,560
He changes and there's no his.»

115
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,620
We came to five des ga Neví僕 Nothing more silent.

116
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,720
And my hearts swung pure and strong Somehow we always'll haven't two hearts yet.

117
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,440
ny

118
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,200
Death built the air, we haul off with the present

119
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,640
Prepared for our modern dawn

120
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,260
But I lost some of the plan

121
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,780
Some secret not revealed

122
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,580
Now they're dragging me back with my head in the sand

123
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,020
To the land of the infidels

124
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,080
As I do

125
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:05,000
As I do

126
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,220
They're following me

127
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:29,400
And they are following who simulator the truth from their Lord

128
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,700
Thus Allah gives peopleXXX is the most exemplary

129
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:40,800
And when you meet those who deny the real one shall they return in road

130
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,300
Until when you suppress them

131
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,260
When you suppress them

132
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,840
They will be toned byurs

133
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:51,820
So...

134
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,000
Then he will feel learnings so, that that he would be able to be chaste in wonderful ways

135
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,440
John Walker's Blues by Steve Earle from an album called Jerusalem.

136
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,760
Thanks to Dr. Legume for DCCing that to me.

137
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:08,300
Later in the show, friends, we'll hear Dr. Legume's stirring sermon at the Akron Devival.

138
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:18,640
Also, this show, number 857, is interwoven with collage cut-ups by Fernanda Nande-Lemur

139
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,200
and some clips posted by Reverend Tesla Coyle.

140
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:32,840
And, of course, ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland with Lonesome Cowboy Dave

141
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,480
and host Charles Smith, as seen here.

142
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,640
What's going on in the world? I don't even know anymore.

143
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,620
Oh, drug dealer fight.

144
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,620
Would you know if this is a bad omen?

145
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,600
What happened in the last few days?

146
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,480
Well, they're bombing Iraq, but they're not supposed to let everybody know.

147
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,560
I mean, in America, nobody's supposed to know about it.

148
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,760
Everybody else knows about it.

149
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,940
They're already doing it?

150
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,840
Yeah, they just, like, go blow up somebody's swimming pool.

151
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,220
Just in time for the election.

152
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,560
This just came out.

153
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,280
The government, Washington, D.C., the government is preparing to invoke special powers

154
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,120
to help fight armed terrorist groups in the U.S.,

155
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,320
including measures that will require people in parts of the U.S.

156
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,460
to register, obtain permission to travel, and carry I.D. cards.

157
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,280
The so-called rehabilitation zones.

158
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,340
Dead cards.

159
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,720
Which will include parts of between 14 to 32 states,

160
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,620
are allowed under a presidential decree issued September 10th

161
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,640
that also permits security forces to conduct warranties,

162
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:36,300
warrantless searches, and hold suspects for months before consulting a judge.

163
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,140
And they can also hold the parts between their knees that are connected there.

164
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,200
In the zones, the government can require all residents to register with civilian authorities,

165
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,620
restrict travel, impose curfews,

166
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,000
and issue special identification cards to local residents, the decree says.

167
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:59,960
The residents of areas where identification cards have been issued can be detained for up to 24 hours for not carrying the cards.

168
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,400
A military commander from the North American Command in each zone can collect information about where residents live,

169
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,640
what vehicles they use, and jobs they work at, as well as who has permits to carry guns.

170
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,920
Do you remember the old days, staying with the Wells Fargo guys and the other, uh, what was the other, the other one, uh,

171
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,260
the dicks, you know, the, the private dicks, there was Wells Fargo, what was the other one, with impunity,

172
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,320
they could go around killing people for screwing up capitalism in the West?

173
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:26,880
Now get this.

174
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,620
Government officials could not be reached to comment on the plans,

175
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:36,000
but Attorney General John Ashcroft said that the powers granted to the state were soft.

176
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,280
When the decision is made...

177
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,600
Much like John F. F. F.

178
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,460
When the decision is made to create a zone,

179
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,360
it is because we are facing the probability that something very serious is about to happen...

180
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,860
Right, fascism is gonna take over.

181
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,480
...to the civilian population.

182
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,200
Yeah, right.

183
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,600
There are new procedures which are being studied that we can use, not everywhere,

184
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:59,400
but specifically where we need them to protect civilians and attack terrorists.

185
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,500
Well, I think that's amazing that he was so psychic to know what's gonna happen to us,

186
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,560
and yet he didn't know on 9-11-10th of September.

187
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:14,060
Now, I did get this off the internet on S-News by New Monet, so...

188
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,580
But that is, that is a true thing, because I know, I read it in the Payne-Dealer...

189
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,240
Yeah, I read it.

190
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,760
...on the internet, so, and you're hearing it now on the radio, so...

191
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,360
Must be true.

192
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,000
...I mean, it must be as true as anything else you hear on the radio or read on the news or the internet.

193
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,600
What a tiny little...

194
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,460
I'm more disturbed by what I...

195
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,060
...like these two red-bred hillbillies over here on the side...

196
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,680
I'm more disturbed by a science article I was reading.

197
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,260
What did it say, James?

198
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:47,180
Well, it was just talking about that we need to start opening our minds to the possible fact that...

199
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,600
...the universe...

200
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,580
...stinks?

201
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,940
...and all the bubbles of universes that they think exist...

202
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,180
...are a fart bubble of God.

203
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,300
No, they're just because we think them.

204
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,440
Oh, man.

205
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,080
Yeah.

206
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,400
The eye in the pyramid's right in our own navel.

207
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,720
That works real well until you stub your toe.

208
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,340
Yeah, right.

209
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,180
And then all of a sudden you're not just thinking...

210
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,660
Until you don't wake up while somebody's stealing your van.

211
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,540
...your toe really, really hurts.

212
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,900
When you smell, you forget to smell the smoke.

213
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,000
Because we see them, because we observe them.

214
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,140
Oh, yeah, so we're just...

215
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,180
They exist because we observe them.

216
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,220
We're just lackluster, dullardly observers.

217
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:19,980


218
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,320
Oh, well, if that's the case, Professor, why don't you go into that briar patch and get my kid's ball?

219
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,380
Brayer Stang.

220
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,760
You're just imagining that briar patch.

221
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,200
No, you see the briar patch.

222
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
There is no spoon.

223
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,060
So it's there. It's there because you see it.

224
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,680
Or if anybody sees it, it's there.

225
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,820
You see the briar patch, but you don't see the thorns.

226
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,460
That makes sense.

227
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,160
If anybody sees it, it's there.

228
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,280
You're floating in a sea of briar patches.

229
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,160
You just can't feel the scratches.

230
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,300
It's this.

231
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,680
You can't make the complex simple because it's complex.

232
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:09,300
And you can't make slack complex because it is simple.

233
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,280
And that's why we're trying to...

234
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,560
We're just trying to kind of cut through the bull if we can, friends.

235
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,360
And try to figure out for ourselves what slack really is.

236
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,340
What it really, really is.

237
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,280
And what we've been able to find out.

238
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,100
I've been in this business for 20 years.

239
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,680
And you know what I found out?

240
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,060
Not a damn thing.

241
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,020
I've learned how ignorant I am.

242
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,720
I've learned how stupid I am.

243
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,360
I've learned how I don't know.

244
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,360
And the best part is, I don't have to know.

245
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,860
I don't have to know why the universe was created.

246
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,260
I don't have to know how it was created.

247
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,900
I don't have to know where I'm going to go when I die.

248
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,580
I don't have to know anything.

249
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,340
Because who said I was so important that I deserve to know?

250
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,380
Maybe it's better if the Loch Ness Monster is never captured.

251
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,820
Maybe it's better if nobody ever shoots and stuffs a Bigfoot.

252
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,160
Maybe it's better if the aliens never land.

253
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,080
Because friends, wouldn't it be kind of boring to find out?

254
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,340
Wouldn't it be terrible if all the mysteries were gone?

255
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,200
Wouldn't it be terrible if all the mysteries were gone?

256
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,360
Ah yes, friends.

257
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,160
The mysteries.

258
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,820
The mysteries are sh** that can't be explained.

259
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,100
That's what's important.

260
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,560
The stuff inside.

261
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,200
The music that makes you feel good.

262
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,860
I know people who were saved by Jesus when they went to see the movie Jesus Christ Superstar.

263
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,720
And then it was only years later that when they were listening to the Rolling Stones

264
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,740
that they realized that it wasn't Jesus that saved them.

265
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,740
It was the rock and roll that they felt.

266
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,020
That would put that spirit in their hearts.

267
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,140
And it doesn't have to be Jesus.

268
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,020
It doesn't even have to be Bob.

269
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:55,660
It doesn't have to be whatever your favorite drug is or your favorite personal savior.

270
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,000
Because as we've learned from Bob Dog time after time,

271
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:06,580
we can't depend on invisible monsters up in the sky to answer our prayers.

272
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,980
And we can't trust aliens to come down from Earth to save us.

273
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,720
We can't even believe it.

274
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,240
We can't believe in pipe smoking, get rich quick scheme smiling, smiley faces of the

275
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,040
90s, friends.

276
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,620
I just believe in me.

277
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,600
Yoko and me.

278
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,340
That's reality.

279
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,260
And friend, I suggest you take the same approach.

280
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,920
Bob is not the answer and neither is anything else.

281
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:42,440
And in this church, in closing, friends, to bring this so that you can finally quit listening

282
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,240
to somebody lecture you and start getting back to the true slack of dancing to the broken

283
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,520
circle gospel of the lesbian.

284
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,700
I'm going to leave you with one thought.

285
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,220
And it's the one rule, the one law of the Church of the Subgenius.

286
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:02,180
The only thing in the whole damn book, all of these books, the one valid statement that

287
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,180
Bob said that you can live by.

288
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,580
And here it is, friends.

289
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,060
.

290
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,600
If they can't take a joke.

291
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,280
That's your point.

292
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,040
If they can't take a joke.

293
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,960
That's the attitude you have to hold in your head.

294
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,680
And you'll be fine.

295
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,240
You will be fine.

296
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,840
Just think.

297
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,960
If they can't take a joke.

298
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,200
And praise Bob.

299
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,820
And he'll cut.

300
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,420
We love you, friends.

301
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,200
God loves you too.

302
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,760
But Bob wants you.

303
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,580
God loves you.

304
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,660
Bob wants you.

305
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,680
All he wants is your money.

306
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,660
And every night instead, ladies and gentlemen, give him your money.

307
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,380
Come on up.

308
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,420
Give him your money.

309
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,580
And I'll stream you.

310
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:24,740
And he'll come forward with his daughter around, and you and your sister, like that they

311
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:24,740


312
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,320
And B float.

313
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:40,160

Oh, man.

318
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,160
Oh, man.

319
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:10,960

Remix number two by Dr. Onan's

332
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,740
Wotan Band. And before that,

333
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,480
my sermon.

334
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:47,980
backed by Einstein's Secret Orchestra at the Blind Lemon Club DeVival in Cleveland last year.

335
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,700
And speaking of last year, friends, the world ends tomorrow.

336
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,240
We might all be killed.

337
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,580
There's a reason for that.

338
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,340
You see how those gears are slanted?

339
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:02,860
Yeah, right?

340
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,620
Right there.

341
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:03,940
Here.

342
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,320
There.

343
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,660
Here.

344
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,060
Skylight snakes for breakfast.

345
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,920
And it was a very eerie experience.

346
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,400
Yeah.

347
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:10,760
Yes.

348
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,720
This is our track.

349
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,420
Now it's on.

350
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,900
Running along the top of the muscles and all of that was torn loose.

351
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,900
It's so wonderful.

352
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,480
You're considered benevolent in that part of the world.

353
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,580
The ice is right there.

354
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:22,900
Here.

355
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,680
There it is.

356
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,480
All right.

357
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,840
Look at that.

358
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,540
Just like that.

359
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,040
Just that.

360
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,000
Because it's plastic.

361
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,760
You've got the red dot in here because it's so wonderful.

362
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,960
And we were going around and didn't even think we liked each other too much.

363
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,760
Well, you know what?

364
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,560
I don't have a clue.

365
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,280
I don't have a clue.

366
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,280


367
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,280


368
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,760
The end times are near.

369
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:48,660
Hello.

370
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,020
Hello.

371
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,860
Monsters are born.

372
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,260
Did the end times come yet?

373
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,660
Are we incarcerated?

374
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,880
Are we dead?

375
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,620
Come here.

376
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,100
Or are we just thinking of a new way of living?

377
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,500
Look at this beautiful Bel Air mansion.

378
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,820
Made from stucco and cocoa.

379
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,560
It's a все unestimated había una casa que se fue

380
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:11,560


381
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,980
Some of them have their asses dangling from the cactus in the backyard.

382
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,840
But you're a cowboy daddy.

383
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,860
They're ready for this new century.

384
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,820
These wrong asses don't know what their lives are worth.

385
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,080
They ain't då isolated.

386
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,460
That is true.

387
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,800
It's not at my expense.

388
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,680
They ain't no business, cause.

389
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,100
Ooh.

390
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,300
Woo!

391
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,300
And now that fella knows how to get bombs.

392
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,820
Let's go do some drugs.

393
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,960
Legal drugs, that is.

394
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,640
Hey, let's put on a thing of a furry monkey pants

395
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,460
and dance for the guy with a grinded-in organ over there

396
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,880
against a telephone pole.

397
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,620
It's disgusting.

398
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,740
Of course it's disgusting.

399
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,920
It's the world we live in.

400
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,420
Open your eyes, Billy.

401
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,260
Open them wider.

402
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,360
No, a little wider.

403
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,740
Open them up wider.

404
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,420
Okay, I'm going to drop you here.

405
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,920
Okay, now get the sticks up.

406
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,020
You can't look away now.

407
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,320
That's right.

408
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,200
That's right.

409
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,740
I threw up.

410
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,660
Yep, when I looked at my TV and saw what was going on,

411
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,380
I threw up.

412
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,020
I threw up.

413
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,900
Bye now.

414
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,640
What is the meaning of this?

415
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,640
Y'all be reborn now, you hear?

416
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,380
What is the meaning of death in the cycle of rebirth?

417
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,340
What is the meaning of the tender, tiny thread

418
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,160
that extends from the flap below the reptile's eye

419
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,280
deep into the womb of natura itself?

420
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:51,880
Mama?

421
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,840
I was hungry as can be.

422
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,640
There's a seeker born every minute.

423
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,840
Well, as far as our scientists have been able to determine,

424
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,520
the purpose of life is, in fact, simply to squirt.

425
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:06,820
Why?

426
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,080
Or, in the case...

427
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,600
...of some creatures, to ooze.

428
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,260
Ah.

429
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,120
Squirting and oozing.

430
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,340
Ultimately, an ooze squirt.

431
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,180
Is it...

432
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,020
Yes, that's it.

433
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,140
There's no high, lofty meaning of life.

434
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,040
It is simply to...

435
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,360
Squirt and ooze.

436
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,780
Yes, and not for the procreation aspects,

437
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,240
just for the pleasure.

438
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,920
The mere ejaculation, the vibration,

439
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,200
banging the nervous system ever so gently.

440
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,320
Yes, if you're looking for a meaning, there it is.

441
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,540
It doesn't matter whether it's by yourself,

442
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,560
or with somebody else.

443
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,040
It's just...

444
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,660
That's it.

445
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,040
You can just take a walk out,

446
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,300
out into your neighborhood any day,

447
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,620
and get on a bus,

448
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,960
and get that same sensation

449
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,380
as you ride over them old potholes.

450
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,140
You know, life ain't much more than a oozing and a squirting,

451
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,960
and a kind of a dangerous feeling

452
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,600
coming up the back of your neck.

453
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,960
I'm gonna rub my little red belly.

454
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,540
Things are growing up there now.

455
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,360
They're growing now.

456
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,280
They're like bad thoughts, you know.

457
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:06,740
They're like...

458
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,500
Just hanging to the top of your head,

459
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,420
and they can't get out.

460
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,080
And they got to find a way out someday.

461
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,260
Oh, I can't wait to have Bob rub my little red belly

462
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,060
over at that rabbit supper tonight.

463
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,320
Oh, he's gonna rub you like a booty's belly.

464
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,040
He's gonna create more slack out of the top of your head

465
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,860
than you ever saw.

466
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,720
Old Bob, he's a booty shot for.

467
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,300
Yeah.

468
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,640
He's a fully realized enlightened being.

469
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,260
He's gonna be at that squirrel supper tonight.

470
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,240
You gonna be there, Benny?

471
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,300
Hey, look, he's eating barbecued chicken.

472
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,580
I never know, booty shot,

473
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,100
but I enjoyed meat that way.

474
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,620
I mean, you know, that way.

475
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,240
Oh, hell, you know, him and Bob go way back.

476
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,440
I threw up.

477
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,020
Yeah, it's hard to pull it out of your moon pants.

478
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,960
Teaser just let it go out in front.

479
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,740
Is that you going through there, Musgrave?

480
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,760
Now, why in the world would I be going through there, dog?

481
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

484
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,280
I kidnapped the future and ransomed it for the past.

485
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,140
I made time wait up for me to bleed my lizard.

486
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,900
My infernal breath wilts the tree of life.

487
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,240
I left my scorn on the Rock of Ages.

488
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,800
Who will tear flesh with me?

489
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,180
Who will spill their juice?

490
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,680
Who will gouge with me?

491
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,540
Whose candle will I fart out?

492
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,240
Goop.

493
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,020
Goop.

494
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,120
I'm ready.

495
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:41,980
So step aside, all you but loot, neurotic, insecure bespectacled slab-zoa-wimp meat.

496
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,300
I'm a crime-fighting master criminal.

497
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,540
I am not insane.

498
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,660
I'm a screamer and a laugher.

499
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,380
I make a spectacle of myself.

500
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,580
I am a sight.

501
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,080
My physical type cannot be classified by science.

502
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,120
My familiar is a pterodactyl.

503
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,720
I feed it to dick-fegals.

504
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,580
I spoil their lives.

505
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,540
I am a

506
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,300
hide and seek killer.

507
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,780
I throw him scheduler.

508
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,460
I fumble a 16x film.

509
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:19,600
I'm a murderer.

510
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,060
I mold the king.

511
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,440
I am a killer.

512
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,320
He lets deathizi take him.

513
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:35,980
With no voor and no mol tumbler, I kill them in one fell parlance.

514
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,860
This is great.

515
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,620
This is fun.

516
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,680
The Brandflex from thebrandflex.com.

517
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,140
Before that, some brag of the subgenius Bob Foolery by me and Philo.

518
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:01,880
And now, well, soon actually, a classic live recording of a Jurassic song by the Swingin' Love Corpses.

519
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,060
But first, heart ignition.

520
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,520
What's going on?

521
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,060
Swag.

522
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,060
Swag.

523
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,540
Gotta be kidding me.

524
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,820
Name the killer.

525
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:27,760
Bulb.

526
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,600
Name the killer.

527
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,580
Bulb.

528
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,460
Swag.

529
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,560
What's that noise?

530
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,020
Swag.

531
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,860
Swag.

532
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,660
A giant test table.

533
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,180
Swag.

534
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,100
That's a hat.

535
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:05,780
That's a hat.

536
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:05,920
That's a hat.

537
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:05,960
That's a hat.

538
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,280
Oh, yeah.

539
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,820
Oh, yeah.

540
00:27:40,160 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh, yeah.

541
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,860
Oh, yeah.

542
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:50,680
Oh, yeah.

543
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,700
Oh, yeah.

544
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,080
Oh, yeah.

545
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,380
Oh, yeah.

546
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,340
Oh, yeah.

547
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:37,840
Oh, yeah.

548
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,980
Oh, yeah.

549
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,520
Well, I wouldn't find nature

550
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,700
if I had my druthers.

551
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,800
Wish I could control

552
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,000
the action of others.

553
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,020
We should love nature

554
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,840
as one of our brothers.

555
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,360
But you know it's not nice

556
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,080
to do your mother.

557
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,400
Best of!

558
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,360
Best of!

559
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,540
Thank you.

560
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,200
Thank you.

561
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,800
Thank you.

562
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,900
Thank you.

563
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,540
I don't want to get off the stage.

564
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,820
Who told me to get off the stage?

565
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,040
Am I just paranoid?

566
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,520
Nature.

567
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,860
I hate.

568
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,060
I hate it.

569
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,480
The Swingin' Love Corps is live in St. Louis, 1991.

570
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,820
And now, from the Akron Devival this summer,

571
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,380
Dr. Katahdin Legu,

572
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,740
who starts his sermon by reading a suicide note.

573
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,180
A suicide note? Is it mine?

574
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,760
Give it back!

575
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,460
Man, I found this suicide note.

576
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,100
It was from a young teenage girl.

577
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,940
At least from the content, I'm assuming it was a teenager.

578
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,480
She was a teenage girl.

579
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,800
It says here,

580
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,280
I'm tired of the pain in my heart.

581
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,740
You are all so unfair to me.

582
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,120
You don't love me and you don't understand me.

583
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,120
Everyone hates me because I'm fat and ugly.

584
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,020
The only thing I ever wanted was to be with Patrick.

585
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,240
But I found out he was at the mall with that slut Michelle.

586
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,220
And I hope,

587
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:04,660
And I hope,

588
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,860
And I hope,

589
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:05,940


590
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,740
they'll all feel bad when I'm gone.

591
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,820
But tough.

592
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,120
I tried to talk to you about it, Mom.

593
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:17,340
But you was more interested in your soap operas than my real problems.

594
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,260
So I'm not going to bother any of you anymore.

595
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,600
And I hope Patrick is real happy at the mall with his slut.

596
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,980
You're going soft, aren't you?

597
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,600
I hope you're all happy now. Goodbye.

598
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,700
What a stupid little bitch.

599
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:45,060
The very idea of offing yourself because of some stupid little problem like that makes me think,

600
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,500
Well, what is a problem that's worthy of killing yourself?

601
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,020
And it reminded me,

602
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,320
It reminded me of when I was a child.

603
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,540
When I was a child, I grew up in a town called Mansfield, New Jersey.

604
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:10,000
And out on Route 206, which cuts right through Mansfield, New Jersey,

605
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,620
There's a farmer's market.

606
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,340
It's the biggest shop in town.

607
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,660
Everybody goes there.

608
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,040
It's the only reason anybody comes to Mansfield, is to shop at this farmer's market.

609
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,400
But across the street from this farmer's market, there was a junkyard.

610
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,720
Not just any junkyard.

611
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,520
It was an old military junkyard full of crashed World War II guns.

612
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:33,520


613
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,080
And planes and trucks and tanks and such.

614
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,340
And it was owned by a man named John Mihaljec.

615
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,760
John Mihaljec had a lot to say.

616
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:51,260
He had so much to say, that out on Route 206, down the entire length of his property,

617
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,940
He had these huge billboards with pictures of political figures on them.

618
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,260
They had a picture at the time, it was the 1970s,

619
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,440
There was a picture of President Richard Nixon,

620
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,280
With the bleeding body of a dead rat.

621
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:11,700
And there were these long, long rants that he would put up on these billboards on his property.

622
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,780
And the town hated him.

623
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,180
When he drove by, the rants on the signs were so long and involved,

624
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,560
That the cars would have to slow down to five miles an hour just to read them.

625
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,100
Oh yeah, they hated him bad.

626
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,280
So what did John Mihaljec do?

627
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,140
He ran for Senator.

628
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,180
That pissed off all the people who hated him even more.

629
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,920
All the townspeople hated him.

630
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,840
One day they said,

631
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,840
We're going to finally take care of this John Mihaljec problem.

632
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,700
So one night, some of the townspeople got together,

633
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,520
In the best tradition of the angry villagers in Frankenstein movies,

634
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,560
They all got their torches together,

635
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,260
And they went down to his property,

636
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,920
And they burned his house to the ground.

637
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,140
Oh, they burned his house to the ground,

638
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,400
But that's not all they did,

639
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,280
Because his wife was in the house.

640
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,880
And they killed his wife.

641
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,780
They killed his wife,

642
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,640
And they burned down his house.

643
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,600
And they said,

644
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,740
Finally, we're going to see the end of John Mihaljec,

645
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,560
Because no man is going to be able to stand up after something like this.

646
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,160
They were crushed.

647
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,340
John Mihaljec had other ideas.

648
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,740
John Mihaljec, in the smoking ashes of the ruins of his home,

649
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,040
The smoking ashes of his now dead beloved wife,

650
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:50,520
Built a giant teepee on that spot,

651
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:55,620
And let everybody know that we're not going to run him off his land.

652
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,140
The townspeople said,

653
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,760
The townspeople hated it even more.

654
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,100
So one night,

655
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,000
The townspeople,

656
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,960
In the best tradition of the angry villagers in Frankenstein movies,

657
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,420
Once again got together,

658
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,080
And they went out to John Mihaljec's land,

659
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,580
And they burned down his teepee.

660
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,220
This, they said,

661
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,800
Would run off John Mihaljec.

662
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,000
How much more could one man stand?

663
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,400
He would leave, he would kill himself,

664
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,360
He would do something, but he would be out of their hair forever.

665
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,740
John Mihaljec had other ideas.

666
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,460
And so,

667
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,020
On the smoking ruins of his teepee,

668
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,580
Built on the smoking ruins of his home and his dead beloved wife,

669
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,540
John Mihaljec built,

670
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,360
Another teepee.

671
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,600
An identical teepee to the first,

672
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,200
But with one small difference.

673
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,080
It was made of steel!

674
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,660
The villagers didn't know what to do about that.

675
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,840
They hated John Mihaljec.

676
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,240
They wanted to run John Mihaljec off his land.

677
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,520
But those stupid mother never could figure out how to burn down a steel teepee.

678
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:33,440
And John Mihaljec lived there until he died an old, old man.

679
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,900
Can I get a praise John Mihaljec?

680
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,040
Yes, John Mihaljec!

681
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,720
Can I get a praise John Mihaljec?

682
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,960
Yes, John Mihaljec!

683
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,380
Oh, brothers and sisters,

684
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,320
John Mihaljec found the perfect solution to his problems.

685
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,820
Maybe you have problems too.

686
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,740
Maybe your problems could be solved by giving up or committing suicide.

687
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,300
Probably not.

688
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,260
Well, come to think of it, we probably solved all your problems.

689
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,480
But we're not the kind of a cult that's going to advocate suicide.

690
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,840
We are the first anti-suicide suicide cult.

691
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,960
One day we will all get together and after the point of time we will all drink Kool-Aid.

692
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,240
Then nothing will happen, we'll just drink some Kool-Aid.

693
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:26,860
I think so.

694
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,860
Yes.

695
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:34,420
Well, I'm sure you have problems too, but I don't think that many of your problems are going to be solved by a big tin teepee.

696
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,080
However, there is always a solution to your problems.

697
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,040
And only the perfect solution to your problems.

698
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,620
And brothers and sisters, Bob.

699
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,540
Bob will give you a blueprint.

700
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,080
A blueprint for your perfect teepee of vengeance.

701
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:04,160
That will help you get over your problems without having to take a hundred Tylenol.

702
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,180
Tom Waits.

703
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,660
Are there any Tom Waits fans here?

704
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:09,800
Yeah!

705
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:16,100
I remember there was a song by Tom Waits where he said something about a woman.

706
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,700
She was a crumbling beauty with a tattooed tear on her cheek.

707
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,460
For each year her man was away.

708
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,460
And then Tom Waits said,

709
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,400
Hell, there's nothing wrong with her that a hundred dollars won't fix.

710
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:37,300
Well, brothers and sisters, it's even better for all of you.

711
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:42,560
Because there's nothing wrong with you that thirty dollars won't fix.

712
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:51,420
Yes, brothers and sisters, because that thirty dollars, when put in the hands of Bob, will help deliver unto you the blueprint for your own tin teepee.

713
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,080
That tin teepee will fill that tin teepee-shaped hole in your life.

714
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,560
Oh yes, brothers and sisters, you may not have had very small problems.

715
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,860
You might have had no tiny problems.

716
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,300
Oh yes, but Reverend Stang, he's here to help you with those problems.

717
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,760
Maybe that hole in your life is shaped like a little bob pin.

718
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,660
Maybe that hole in your life is shaped like a bumper sticker or a t-shirt.

719
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:25,040
And brothers and sisters, through Bob's love, Reverend Stang is here tonight to fill that t-shirt-shaped hole in your lives, brothers and sisters.

720
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,180
Oh yes, brothers and sisters, can I get a praise, Bob?

721
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,820
We're filling CD-shaped holes tonight.

722
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:42,180
Oh yes, brothers and sisters, and I saw a lot of you out there tonight who have CD-shaped holes in your lives that are just begging to be filled.

723
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,460
And Reverend Stang is here tonight to help Bob fill your holes.

724
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,880
Can I get a praise, Bob?

725
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,240
Praise Bob!

726
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,060
Many of my victims have joined my unholy legion.

727
00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:02,440
The legion of the undead, becoming creatures without souls, living only for hideous torment.

728
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:10,520
And I think if we continue that way, to, you know, do what they said to do with porcine beings, what will happen next?

729
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,660
Well, did you write to your congressman about the pigs?

730
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:19,540
Of course I did. I did. I said we would be liberated, and he said he sent back a hand-memeographed Xerox letter.

731
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,500
He sent back a hand-signed letter, I mean, that said,

732
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,420
Thank you very much, Citizen Dave, for your interest in the porcine.

733
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,840
We're preparing a place for you in the re-education camps.

734
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:33,000
We have your room number and your keys waiting for you in your special hot tub.

735
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:42,540
And then I wrote a letter back saying the porc problem is probably the most, the biggest problem we have to deal with in these days of post-9-11 surgery.

736
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:52,480
Well, humanity is in danger of getting thrown out of the cosmic, you know, tent party for crapping in the universal hot tub.

737
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:52,480


738
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,960
See, you said, yeah, that is true, though.

739
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,980
I'm not sending in their 30 bucks.

740
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:03,440
The United States Navy is going to build these things that create sounds underwater around 80% of the surface of the oceans,

741
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,080
which will kill all the whales and seals and porpoises, and nobody's going to stop them because they're the U.S. Navy.

742
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,040
What do you mean, Ghana?

743
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:09,920
Garna.

744
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,960
It's a word we use.

745
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,420
I thought they already did that. They get the most amazing recordings out of that.

746
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,720
Yeah, the whales squealing in agony as the air drums explode. Now, that is a song.

747
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,460
By the time they're gone, we'll have...

748
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,000
We'll have figured out their language.

749
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:31,800
Well, yeah, by the time they utter their last pained cry of, yeah, pain cry.

750
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,860
Oh, I'm sure they have vials of whale sperm hidden away somewhere.

751
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,540
Ah, yes, long DNA, then short DNA, any kind of whaley whale you want.

752
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,160
How about a Moby-Doby? We've got a blue one, we've got the oversized white ones.

753
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,740
Those whale incubators, though, are really big.

754
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,140
Yeah.

755
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,460
And whale, but there's a booming business in the world.

756
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:52,460


757
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,000
It's in whale placenta.

758
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,780
Oh, and there's nothing better with a little bit of almond extract.

759
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:03,500
Whale placenta, shaved almonds. You like to shave your nuts for the whales.

760
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,460
Well, you can get quite a bit from each birth.

761
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:05,920
Oh, yeah?

762
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,920
From those mighty mammals of the deep, yeah?

763
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,620
So, they're going to give our... They're making, like, little quants that's full of whales.

764
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,180
That's what rich people in Japan are doing, man. All the really... The rich Japanese people.

765
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,340
Those are the cool, beautiful people.

766
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,740
They bathe in whales. Fresh, fresh...

767
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:22,740
Freshly...

768
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,300
It is so lovely for my skin.

769
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:24,880
Caught whale placenta.

770
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,240
I just wear a little bit of whale oil on my arms, and look, as smooth as a baby's forehead.

771
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,840
And also, look what it's done for my hair.

772
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,360
So, I'll get you away from the poo-poo stuff.

773
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,260
Hi.

774
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,800
And back into the menstrual placental.

775
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,940
Ah, my favorite place.

776
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,640
The plasma pond of the beginning.

777
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:47,740
The primal mommy. The original ooze from winter to all spring.

778
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,720
Friends, you and I, each and every one of us, with the Chromosome.

779
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,940
Chromosomes dancing on the backs of our spines.

780
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:54,900
Like little egg yolks.

781
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,240
Or like little egg yolks.

782
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,860
And can be no more than individual fried eggs.

783
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,000
So, live it up as long as you can.

784
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,980
Send your $30 before you're completely cooked.

785
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,460
Do it.

786
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:06,300
Do it.

787
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:06,440
Now.

788
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,200
Now.

789
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,280
Do it before your sex differentiates, while you're still a yolk.

790
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,180
Before the zygote splinters.

791
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,040
Some of us may go in a different direction.

792
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,600
There are X chromosomes.

793
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,560
There are Y chromosomes.

794
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,720
There are now Z chromosomes.

795
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,120
There are Z chromosomes.

796
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,820
Yes, that's right.

797
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,220
Have your genes outgrown you?

798
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,660
What about the anti-chromosomes?

799
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,300
What about them?

800
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,840
They're here with us.

801
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,120
What about them?

802
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,360
Holding their hands and closing their eyes and saying the mantra.

803
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,640
Shoop.

804
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:40,760
Shoop.

805
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,020
The many moods of an alien.

806
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,020
I descended from monochromes.

807
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,700
I ascended from polychromes.

808
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,720
I descended from morochromes.

809
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,540
I am all chromatic activity.

810
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,060
Repeat this to yourself.

811
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,580
Then sit down and close your eyes, ears, nose, and throat.

812
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,260
For this is your good butt fight.

813
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,440
What?

814
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,680
Insert transition here.

815
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:12,440
Yeah, right.

816
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,760
Well, I timed it.

817
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,740
I had the guy.

818
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,040
Yeah, I could tell that.

819
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,180
It was a 15 second segue.

820
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,160
Amazing timing.

821
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,940
I laughed so hard.

822
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,580
Sometimes I slow down when I breathe.

823
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,080
It really caught me was the timing.

824
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,140
It was a 15 second segue.

825
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,740
Stang was supposed to say something kind of laconically funny.

826
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,680
And then you were supposed to say something really silly.

827
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,100
I'm going to sit over here and eat my cupcake.

828
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:33,960
I'll do all that later.

829
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,020
Okay.

830
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,980
So you'll make it sound like you said something laconically silly.

831
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,640
And then Cas said something really silly.

832
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,800
And then, oh no, that's not going to be it.

833
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,380
Oh, okay.

834
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,060
Yeah, whatever.

835
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,160
It doesn't matter.

836
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:46,700
No.

837
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,460
These people are idiots anyway.

838
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,580
I mean, you put the-

839
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,840
It's not that it's that we trained them.

840
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,280
You sew it together like a piece of stew.

841
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,540
I mean, you just flap a shoe in there.

842
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,940
You put some of your own, I don't want to say the other words, some of your own stuff

843
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:00,240
in there.

844
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:05,880
You don't really care what goes in there because you have no respect for your subgenial

845
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,940
listen each week.

846
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,560
What in the world are you talking about?

847
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:14,780
Oh, I'm just saying the way Stang so haphazardly throws his hours of slack together.

848
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:19,560
First, he takes all the drugs you can take, heroin, monochrome, and then he takes the

849
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:19,560


850
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:19,560


851
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:19,560


852
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:19,560


853
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:19,560


854
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:19,560


855
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,940
fiemer, that weird poison from South America.

856
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,640
Well, no, that's how you organize each show.

857
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,680
You do heroin-

858
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,200
As a theme.

859
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,940
And then you pick certain material for the heroin-based show.

860
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,960
And then you do a bunch of crack and you pick all the material that goes with that kind

861
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,320
of a-

862
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,800
So, you're just pretty much living the life, aren't you, man?

863
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:38,880
You're just like out there.

864
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,280
You're just living the life.

865
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:40,500
You know, and so forth.

866
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:40,740
Down through-

867
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,980
You really care about your-

868
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,360
Nitrous oxide.

869
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,240
Prozones.

870
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,060
Long jeans and shirt.

871
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:46,680
That-

872
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,540
See, I can't even remember what the-

873
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:49,540


874
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:53,940
I can't even remember what drugs this show was supposed to be.

875
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,780
Stang, you're a loser of your dollars.

876
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,780
Tell me about it.

877
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:05,020
This is that cut that's 15 different Claudine Leger songs all played on top of each other.

878
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,240
Is there a pill to counteract all those pills?

879
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,920
This is a pill.

880
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,980
This is the red pill.

881
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,820
Oh, God.

882
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,740
I hate the red pill.

883
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:16,940
Oh, God.

884
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:17,420
I hate the red pill.

885
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:17,420


886
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,440
Oh, God.

887
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,520
Oh, God.

888
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,260
I hate the red pill.

889
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,620
This is a pill.

890
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,560
It fights like a bil newer car.

891
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,060
This Norman Walker is a Hillary Clinton glove.

892
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:34,060


893
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:38,020
Is that really all the slaves you want here then?

894
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:47,720
Go on down.

895
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:48,820


896
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:49,500


897
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,020
We're all wired into a survival trip now.

898
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,680
No more of the speed that fueled the 60s.

899
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,520
That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.

900
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,060
He crashed around America selling consciousness expansion

901
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,040
without ever giving a thought

902
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,120
to the grim meat hook realities that were lying in wait

903
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,800
for all those people who took him seriously.

904
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,820
All those pathetically eager acid freaks

905
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,620
who thought they could buy peace and understanding

906
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,520
for three bucks a hit.

907
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,580
But their loss and failure is ours too.

908
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,420
What Leary took down with him was the central illusion

909
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,160
of a whole lifestyle that he helped create.

910
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,880
A generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers,

911
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:32,240
who never understood the essential old mystic fallacy

912
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,140
of the acid culture.

913
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,840
The desperate assumption that somebody,

914
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,580
or at least some force,

915
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,560
is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.

916
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:57,920
We're all wired into a survival trip now.

917
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,920
No more of the speed that fueled the 60s.

918
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:08,320
That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.

919
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,880
What Leary took down with him was the central illusion

920
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,280
of a whole lifestyle that fueled the 70s.

921
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:12,280


922
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:12,280


923
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:12,700
who never understood the essential old mystic fallacy

924
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:12,700


925
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,500
The desperate assumption that somebody,

926
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:13,500


927
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:13,500


928
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,740
or the general in front of him,

929
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:16,780
was taken by a 효 .

930
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,940
If he grew more principle

931
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,180
he could have made the ultimate G gear like me

932
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:21,180


933
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,080
and I guess I got out much easier than they had...

934
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,380
Sarah.

935
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:23,880
Rosary.

936
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:40,260
And it's so weird,

937
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,480
because the reason I say we all were on another planet

938
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:43,480


939
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,220
Let's go!

940
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:13,880
Let's go!

941
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:45,560
Number, please.

942
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,060
One, three.

943
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:47,640
Oh.

944
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,280
One, three.

945
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,640
Thank you.

946
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:52,760
Hello?

947
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,340
This is Marlowe.

948
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,560
Why didn't you telephone?

949
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,540
I didn't have a nickel.

950
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,180
Oh, what did you find at the lake?

951
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,580
Shut up and get me my number.

952
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:13,280
Who's being cute?

953
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:13,740
Now.

954
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,280
You are.

955
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,240
What?

956
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,440
Did you ever try to pull anybody out of the telephone booth?

957
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:23,540
Yeah.

958
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:25,640
Muriel Chester and San Bernardino.

959
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,320
What's this, Crystal Kingsman?

960
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,320
Coming to that.

961
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:31,860
Oh.

962
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:32,820
What man?

963
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,200
The guy I didn't know his name.

964
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:35,920
Oh.

965
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:41,080
Marlowe, where do you usually spend Christmas Eve?

966
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,480
To the gas station.

967
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,560
On the South Road.

968
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,520
Oh.

969
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,560
Where do you?

970
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,800
In Little Fawn Lake.

971
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,760
It's a place in the mountains beyond Arrowhead.

972
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,400
Oh, brother.

973
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,500
Here we are.

974
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,340
How did I get here?

975
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,620
Thirty days in the water.

976
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,420
Luckily a sailor came along.

977
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,360
What's the matter?

978
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,700
There isn't much left of her.

979
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,200
Shut up.

980
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:13,400
This is Marlowe by Lemur and before that the Broken Circle Gospel DVD.

981
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:13,480
This is Marlowe by Lemur and before that the Broken Circle Gospel DVD.

982
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:13,480


983
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:19,740
With Sister Sugar live at the Blind Lemon Divival they are doing Spirit in the Sky.

984
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,080
Do you think it's alright to ring our land in a ring of iron?

985
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,700
I'm trying to wind it up here.

986
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,860
The road goes on forever.

987
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:37,900
They're exaggerating the harmfulness of uranium or plicoidium, whatever that is.

988
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,560
What expense?

989
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,460
You just squirt it out of your, the ship, out of the ship.

990
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:43,460


991
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:43,460


992
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:43,460


993
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:43,460


994
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:43,460


995
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,940
That tube of yours.

996
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,940
I like any common ejaculating orangutan.

997
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,900
It's the used squirt thing, only it's plutonium and it's spent.

998
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,160
Talk about that.

999
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,140
I can see why they call him Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1000
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,500
Don't get too close.

1001
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,500
Not Popular Cowboy Dave.

1002
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,400
No, don't.

1003
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,460
Now, that was it.

1004
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,780
Now, I remember Popular Cowboy Dave.

1005
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,400
Yes, I do.

1006
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,700
He was tall.

1007
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,440
He was rich.

1008
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,680
And intelligent.

1009
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,100
And Christ-like.

1010
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,820
Popular Cowboy Dave was.

1011
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:25,360
But, well, we're going to have Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1012
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,020
That's a good name.

1013
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,660
Popular Christ-like Dave.

1014
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,820
Popular Christ-like Stang.

1015
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,480
And Popular Christ-like Chaz.

1016
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:36,220
And, of course, Popular Christ-like Wee, even though she's a female.

1017
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,380
Well, there was Popular Bullgirl Davina.

1018
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,420
Oh, Popular Bullgirl Davina?

1019
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:42,900
Yeah.

1020
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,580
Was she Christ-like in her appearance?

1021
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,220
No, no.

1022
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:45,840
No, no.

1023
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,860
She was just popular.

1024
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:47,740
No shining.

1025
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,460
Like a lonely traveler in the night.

1026
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:49,900
Yeah.

1027
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:50,680
Well, okay.

1028
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:54,340
You know, that's what happens to some of them when they can't find that spot.

1029
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,500
You know, when they can't reach down there far enough.

1030
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,460
That's me, man.

1031
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,200
Yeah, me too.

1032
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:07,740
We keep on looking for the itchy, slingy, ooze, squirt mechanism, and it doesn't ever shine for a lot of us.

1033
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,460
Speak for yourself, Dave.

1034
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,020
I am speaking for myself.

1035
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:12,800
Oh.

1036
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:13,120
All right.

1037
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,260
That's my bovine boy, Dave.

1038
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:15,300
Hey, look.

1039
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,760
You say Yaka Tees, man.

1040
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,200
And you're just deluding yourself.

1041
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:18,880
I say Yaka Tees.

1042
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:24,380
We're all lonesome, lonely stars in the night.

1043
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,760
Lonely lights in the night.

1044
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:26,280
We're just...

1045
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,580
We come in alone.

1046
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,040
We go out alone.

1047
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:29,880
And you go out alone.

1048
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,560
Ship's passing in the night, baby.

1049
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,180
That's right.

1050
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,420
You bring your hair off in the middle.

1051
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,080
That's the bottom line.

1052
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,040
You come in alone.

1053
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,400
You go out alone.

1054
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,920
That's why you should spend the night with me, baby.

1055
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,500
You squirt.

1056
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:40,880
Sometimes.

1057
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,220
Sometimes.

1058
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:41,440
Sometimes.

1059
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:41,500
Sometimes.

1060
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:41,760
Sometimes.

1061
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:41,880
Sometimes.

1062
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:41,900
Sometimes.

1063
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:41,900


1064
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:41,900


1065
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:41,960


1066
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:41,960


1067
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,800
Loneliness in for just a little while.

1068
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:44,880
Just you, me, and Bob.

1069
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:45,560
Come on.

1070
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,020
What do you say?

1071
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:46,580
Come on.

1072
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:47,320
Be Christ-like.

1073
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,360
Just for a moment.

1074
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,540
But you haven't seen the other cages.

1075
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,640
Don't worry, Boris.

1076
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,260
We'll get to all of the cages eventually.

1077
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:00,620
But first, you must climb into and then escape the cage of Bob.

1089
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,240
For you must heed my words.

1090
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,820
They pay no heed to us.

1091
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,960
You notice that?

1092
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,160
They have their world and we have ours.

1093
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,940
I was believing in you.

1094
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:46,100
You have KEYgruppery for me while you have no other choice at all.

1095
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,900
And they always thought this would save the world.

1096
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:49,800
Happiness would bring that chance.

1097
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,180
You heard me, Alan.

1098
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:53,300
I was so adamant about my triquet right?

1099
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,300


1100
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,360
I mean, I was feeling desperate.

1101
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:53,380
I was facial up against it.

1102
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:53,380


1103
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:53,380


1104
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:53,380


1105
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:53,380


1106
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:53,380


1107
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:53,540


1108
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:53,540


1109
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:53,540


1110
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:53,540


1111
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:37,100
Heart Ignition, and now, Lemur.

A dimension in another dimension.

1113
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,900
More saris.

1114
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,400
A pad?

1115
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,460
Jonathan went into manipulation.

1116
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,540
A man, a dummy, a wooden twilight zone.

1117
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,580
Pretty bright little guy.

1118
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:10,300
Hey!

1119
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:10,520

Ow!

1122
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,200
What?

1123
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,480
That's insider tush.

1124
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:33,620
The meat is actually not yet sold to a foolhardy head.

1125
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:39,480
This program was made possible by the John Foundation.

1126
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,700
Bye-bye, everybody.

1127
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:46,260
