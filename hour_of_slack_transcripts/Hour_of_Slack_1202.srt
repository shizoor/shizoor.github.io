1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
The poltergeist is working tonight because one of these tape decks won't turn off.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,200
Get your finger out of the hole there, Dr. Stang. You're liable to hurt yourself.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,140
There you go.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,780
Well, let's turn on the dampers and see if we can get the nuclear power plant started here, Doctor.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,640
I'm anxious to take off.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,600
Would you get all those guys out of the other side there, please?

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,900
What'd you do, Doctor?

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,160
Central control processing on.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,340
There, central control is on, Doctor.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,580
Good, good. Okay, you want to close the watertight doors here?

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,800
Yeah, oh, watch out for that squid, man. There's a prairie squid right by the door.

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,660
Speaking of which...

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,220
And inject some of those collar soles, would you, into the retribution chamber?

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,280
Primary and secondary circuit tests commencing now.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,880
Well, we really...

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,080
Swine 2 has a prayer request. Is that so, a friend?

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,920
Well, tell them to pray.

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,880
That's right, they're just gonna have to pray.

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,320
We're gonna have to pray.

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,900
The Pensions are old program and this baby is really gone.

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:10,700
The functioning of our senses has been spiritually impaired and chemically corrupted by the fake artificial food coloring.

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,380
We're the lucky ones, the handful with the chance to reach another world.

23
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,280
And we'll use those guns, you'll use them, Doctor, to keep your only chance to stay alive.

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,860
Somebody tell me, who is this guy?

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,880
Jim Hartt Bob, Doctor.

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,880
Jim Hartt Bob, Doctor.

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,840
J-Hot Bob Job

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,860
J-Hot Bob Job

29
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,340
J-Hot Bob Job

30
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:34,880
J-Hot Bob Job

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,520
J-Hot Bob Job

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,920
Come on, baby, let me tell you about a place

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,360
That ain't far from the U.S. and out of state

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,180
Come on, baby, let me tell you about a place

35
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,760
That ain't far from the U.S. and out of state

36
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,320
That good chicken there

37
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,580
Salt fried chicken

38
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,040
A musician, if you consider the normal pattern of modern civilized life,

39
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,980
is on the outside of it all.

40
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,240
He doesn't build things,

41
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,060
he doesn't work regular hours like a decent God-fearing citizen,

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,480
and the life he leads in many ways seems useless and irrelevant

43
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,680
to those of us who prefer a quiet evening in front of the television

44
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,260
and a bottle of beer.

45
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,300
Amazing!

46
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,180
As it might seem to some of us,

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,680
musicians have basic physical needs,

48
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,320
just like real people.

49
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,780
If I could just get my hands on a big, fat, juicy prairie squid...

50
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,560
Ah, yeah!

51
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:51,200
Prairie squid, prairie squid, prairie squid, prairie squid, prairie squid, prairie squid...

52
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,580
Well, we're gonna...

53
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,460
Probably...

54
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,760
Half of our audience doesn't even know...

55
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,540
What is that?

56
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,960
Half of our audience has probably never seen...

57
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,080
What?

58
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,800
Well, it's...

59
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,940
You left the airlock open.

60
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,200
Yeah, that's...

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,740
That's what that is.

62
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,900
Oh, kill the airlock.

63
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,820
Yeah, well...

64
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,360
Okay.

65
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:07,940
Okay.

66
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,120
Friends, let me tell you something.

67
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,920
First off...

68
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,980
Let's get serious about this, Doctor.

69
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,740
First of all...

70
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,520
Cassette deck 2...

71
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,940
Is not working.

72
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,260
And the ports on the starboard side are completely...

73
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,140
That's okay, yeah.

74
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,760
We're losing air fast, and we're gonna have to...

75
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,560
We're gonna have to try to keep up...

76
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:23,560


77
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,100
Well, I'll open up this big blue cylinder of church air over here, Doctor.

78
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,460
Ah, yes, have a...

79
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,300
Now I feel considerably better.

80
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,520
Ah, yes.

81
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,700
I'm having this church air.

82
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,320
Oh, yes.

83
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,200
Praise God, I feel that church air now.

84
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,380
Do you feel it?

85
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,640
Friends, can you feel it out there in the radio audience?

86
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,620
I bet you can.

87
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,480
I bet you can.

88
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,060
If you can't, reach out and feel it, friends.

89
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,480
And if you can't reach down and feel it,

90
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,220
then you're gonna have...

91
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,460
And then you probably don't even know what a prairie squid is.

92
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,360
You probably don't even care what one tastes like.

93
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,280
When you were...

94
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,460
Now, I know about half our audience, Doctor Gordon,

95
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,400
probably remember when they were teenage boys and girls

96
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,780
out in, you know, West Texas or wherever they're from,

97
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,880
going out in the fields and taking off their clothes

98
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,420
and spreading some prairie squid bait all over, you know.

99
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,080
Yes, yeah.

100
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,200
What did you used to use?

101
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,220
I used jelly.

102
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,840
Yeah, I found...

103
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,040
Honey.

104
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,720
Whatever I could steal from my folks.

105
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,380
Peanut butter with bananas in it worked real well.

106
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:29,860
Yeah.

107
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,380
Yeah, I found that...

108
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,680
And those...

109
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,300
Excuse me, I'm still...

110
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,200
Those...

111
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,880
Decompressing from all that traveling, Doctor.

112
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,060
Squid, would they be...

113
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,840
Well, of course, you know...

114
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,100
They'd be crawling out of the woodwork.

115
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,840
Yes, indeed.

116
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,540
Out of the brush.

117
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,880
Out of the weed, so to speak.

118
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,540
You just lay there and wait for them.

119
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,220
And there you were.

120
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,420
And be quiet, because you'd scare them away.

121
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,540
They're very...

122
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,580
And, you know, it's just...

123
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,640
Just to give you an example, it's just like...

124
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,560
Do you remember back when...

125
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,340
When you were a kid, there were all those thousands of those little cute horny toads around?

126
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,240
And why do you think they called them horny toads, friends?

127
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,920
Yeah, because they...

128
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,140
They counter-exist.

129
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,300
You know, they're part of a symbiotic relationship with that favorite outdoor mollusk of ours.

130
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,040
Yes, and dare we say the name again?

131
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
The mighty prairie squid.

132
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,020


133
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,260
Oh, yes.

134
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:23,060
And, of course, as you know, Doctor Stang, I have just come back from a fact-finding tour through the Amazonas regions of Brazil.

135
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:33,480
Yes, friends, just to fill you in exactly on what's going on here, we have as our special guest tonight, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

136
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,420
Yes, indeed.

137
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:45,540
The erstwhile head of the Green Hill-Dobstown encampment, and now commandant of Dobstown II just outside Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

138
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,780
Yes, friends, right on the coast where the surf is high, and so is everybody else, usually.

139
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,500
And, friends, you know...

140
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:04,100
And this, what you're listening to, dear friends, is the hour of slack on NOAA 89.9 in Dallas, Texas.

141
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:11,080
Now that the uranium has warmed up, the airlock leak has been stopped, I think it's about time we launched this show, Doctor.

142
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:17,460
I can feel the mighty thrust of that show lifting us up higher and higher.

143
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,600
The thrust, yeah.

144
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,940
As Dr. Mothersball's beautiful hymn, the Bobcata...

145
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,840
...of plays in the background, and maybe if I hit this tape deck...

146
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,640
Hit it hard, here.

147
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,860
Wait a minute, let me shoot it for you, Doctor.

148
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,680
Hold on.

149
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,360
Please do.

150
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,680
Huh!

151
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,440
Peace!

152
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,360
It oozes like a farm-fresh prairie squid on a hot, slick platter.

153
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,600
If you buy one, you get one free.

154
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,620
Big money, fast luck.

155
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,800
All yours for only a buck.

156
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:15,280
It's so cute and cuddly, it can smash a cow's skull with a single swipe.

157
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,480
But, friends, this is...

158
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,740
We're going to focus on an endangered species that probably...

159
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,060
You know, half of you who weren't raised in the South probably don't even know what a prairie squid is.

160
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,760
And we might as...

161
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,900
Maybe we ought to identify it, you know, just so people will know.

162
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,440
Who don't know what a prairie squid is, Doctor.

163
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:42,760
Perhaps we ought to at first sort of, as best we can, define our terms and say that a prairie squid is really...

164
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,780
It's sort of a physical metaphor for a lot of things.

165
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,500
And it's probably exactly what you think we're talking about.

166
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,140
It's not a metaphor.

167
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,720
It's an endangered species.

168
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,000
It's an endangered species.

169
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,680
Yes, I know.

170
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,140
But it used to live on prairies.

171
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,000
And the fact that most of these callers don't even know what a prairie squid is.

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,100
Well, they don't even know what a prairie is.

173
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,500
It's all been covered up with Los Colinas and all that kind of stuff, right?

174
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,140
Yeah.

175
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,060
Well, yeah, but at the same time, it is a metaphor for existence, Doug.

176
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,160
The very struggle of...

177
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,780
Who's Doug?

178
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,640
Of the prairie squid.

179
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,580
Doug, the guy over there.

180
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,360
The struggle of the poor prairie...

181
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,640
Now, friends, you know, you do see prairie squids nowadays.

182
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,160
You go to the supermarket and buy a dead, cellophane-wrapped...

183
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,780
Plucked.

184
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,720
Shaved prairie squid.

185
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,180
Yeah.

186
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:30,980
I mean, they...

187
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,560
It's shocking.

188
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,140
It's shocking.

189
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,540
To us, to us old-timers, I mean, most of you, you...

190
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,480
That's the only way you're ever going to see it.

191
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,700
They've never seen them alive.

192
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,120
I know.

193
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,740
A lot of people don't even know that they are actually a wild animal.

194
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:51,840
And, friends, that's such a waste because, frankly, what the prairie squid is best used for is...

195
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,460
The sexual act.

196
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,720
Sexual congress.

197
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,380
And I'm...

198
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,800
You know, I know this may...

199
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,020
We don't want to offend any radio...

200
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,840
But it's a well-known fact, Dr. Staines.

201
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,140
Yeah, I mean, you can look in the encyclopedia under prairie squid.

202
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,480
Under squid sub prairie.

203
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,700
Or subgenius.

204
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:09,920
Yes.

205
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,620
And it'll say, subgenius C prairie squid.

206
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,260
Exactly.

207
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,800
And, you know, yes, it is.

208
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
That's its best use.

209
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,040
And some people might find that offensive.

210
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,560
But they're the people that don't like to think about...

211
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:22,720
Yeah.

212
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,360
Things like that because sometimes they're not sure how to do things like that.

213
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,400
Or they're afraid that somebody will laugh at them if they said that they did something like that.

214
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,960
That they had them a prairie squid or two.

215
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,860
Oh, most of them think the prairie squid is a myth.

216
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,580
Oh, yeah.

217
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,640
They get real embarrassed if you talk about a prairie squid in polite society.

218
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,180
The polished ears of the rationalists.

219
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,720
Oh, yes.

220
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,040
The modernist, the so-called...

221
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,760
The politically correct ears of the various groups.

222
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,600
Humanistic.

223
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,340
Yes.

224
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,880
You know, if they were humanists, if they were really concerned about humanity, they'd free the prairie squid prisoners.

225
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,580
And they'd quit killing prairie squids and making purses and shoes out of them.

226
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,800
Well, I mean, it's worse than killing whales for dog food, Reverend Stang.

227
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:16,820
I mean, if you think about it, I mean, at least you're benefiting some canines who would otherwise not have anything else to eat.

228
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,060
But the very idea of killing and tanning prairie squid and turning them into purses.

229
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,500
And basketball shoes.

230
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:22,920
It's repellent.

231
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,420
It's repellent to anyone who's really lived with nature.

232
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:35,720
Anyone who is really a nature-oriented person who's concerned about the environment would, despite the stigma, despite the embarrassment...

233
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,080
They would be proud, Doctor.

234
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,220
They would be proud.

235
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,700
They would be proud.

236
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,340
Nay, they would find it their Bob-born duty.

237
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,240
Duty, my dude.

238
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,800
Duty, yes.

239
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,000
To seek out that prairie squid and protect them.

240
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,720
And nurture.

241
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,140
I mean...

242
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,980
And nurture.

243
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,040
And nurture.

244
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,040


245
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,040
And nurture that prairie squid.

246
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,700
I'm great, babe.

247
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,120
I sing now.

248
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,360
I got a big fat squid in my refrigerator.

249
00:10:59,520 --> 00:10:59,540
Ooh.

250
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,140
Ooh.

251
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,460
I got a big fat squid in my refrigerator.

252
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:05,660
Ooh.

253
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,260
Ooh.

254
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,920
I found him in the frozen food.

255
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,000
I got him five new pairs of shoes.

256
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,700
And now he lives in the refrigerator.

257
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:17,980
Ooh.

258
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,020
Ooh.

259
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,140
Ooh.

260
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,400
Ooh.

261
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,960
I bought him for 99.

262
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,680
Cents.

263
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,420
A pound.

264
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,540
Ooh.

265
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,080
Ooh.

266
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,440
Soup.

267
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,280
Oh.

268
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,700
He costs $45.

269
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,100
He weighs $35.

270
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,420
Ooh.

271
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,800
Woof.

272
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,120
Woof.

273
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,120
agogist

274
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:43,560
I got a note here.

275
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,540
There's an anti-Bob-person on line two.

276
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,220
Anti-Bob.

277
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,690
Bob. They all want to be. There's a

278
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,170
common psychosis, this anti-Messiah

279
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,750
complex.

280
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,010
If you get your name

281
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,770
in the paper as an anti-Messiah,

282
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,890
it's in the same size type as if

283
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,770
you were the Messiah.

284
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,910
They link you to the Messiah

285
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,790
by being... I mean, guys that are saying

286
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,730
they're anti-Bobs, they're just saying

287
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,770
that so they can have their name linked

288
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,670
with Bob. You understand?

289
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,850
Exactly. It's a hate

290
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,790
love relationship. They know they

291
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,670
aren't good enough to be

292
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,750
Bob or to even serve Bob right.

293
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,030
And they're mostly

294
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,750
anti-Squid people. You see them

295
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,890
at these Squid Suppression

296
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,290
rallies.

297
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,350
No right to Squid.

298
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,210
Burning records.

299
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,830
Burning records trying to stamp out

300
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,690
Prairie Squid. And those

301
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,510
are the same kind of intolerant people who

302
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,550
the only way they can react to something

303
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,070
is to kill them.

304
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,990
If they don't understand it, they kill it.

305
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,850
They kill it.

306
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,770
They kill it.

307
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,210
They eat it. They make socks or shoes

308
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,850
or something like that out of it.

309
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,190
There's people out there that would kill a Playboy magazine

310
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,510
if they saw it crawling around through the

311
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,970
bushes like a Prairie Squid.

312
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,350
Especially if they thought it would hurt.

313
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,590
And since they're good for the same things...

314
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,070
Well, except that of course a Playboy magazine

315
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,330
is by no means a Prairie Squid,

316
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,130
Dr. Stang. I'm sure that

317
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,150
you and I know that perhaps

318
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,370
a Playboy magazine might be employed

319
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,230
with a Prairie Squid, but

320
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,750
certainly no such thing.

321
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,490
I've never needed anything besides

322
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,630
just the squid.

323
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,830
The squid itself is all that one really needs.

324
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,190
A Prairie Squid, it's like

325
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,170
a snail without a shell.

326
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,730
A really large, about a foot long.

327
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,070
They've got a light...

328
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,810
They're differing variations

329
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,890
of color of hair and how much

330
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,250
hair, how curly it is.

331
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,150
And where it's distributed and

332
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,550
whether they're an elongated squid

333
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,850
or a small, squamous, flattened out

334
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,290
squid.

335
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,670
And just as a snail

336
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,630
is like one just... It's a pseudopod.

337
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,650
It's a big foot.

338
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,570
A Prairie Squid, friends, is a huge

339
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,110
erogenous zone. That's all it is.

340
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,910
A mobile erogenous zone.

341
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,250
And we're not talking about one of them

342
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,970
camper conversion kits either.

343
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,510
That's right. And this is not... This isn't some

344
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,490
chauvinistic thing, because I know a lot of

345
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,770
country girls out there know what we're talking about.

346
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,590
Because a Prairie Squid... Well, it interfaces

347
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,670
both ways, right, Doctor? I mean, that's...

348
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,490
Without expensive interfaces,

349
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,310
you can plug right into these amazing

350
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,750
new pets. I mean, you don't need attachments or rubber washers

351
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,090
or anything like that with a...

352
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,250
It just one serves the entire family.

353
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,410
Back in the old pioneer days,

354
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,930
when they first came across this prairie

355
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,790
from little towns up the northeast

356
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,350
and the northwest... It was a family thing.

357
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,990
Yeah, sure. You had the little Prairie Squid cage right there

358
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,170
on the back of the covered wagon.

359
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,730
Everybody had them. I mean,

360
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,590
you nurtured them. And now,

361
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,890
they're almost extinct. Now, you could

362
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,370
cruise Turtle Creek

363
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,970
from one end to the other

364
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,930
and never find...

365
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,730
never find an ambulating Prairie Squid.

366
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,770
About five years ago,

367
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,430
I saw the first wild

368
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,670
Prairie Squid I'd seen since my childhood

369
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,190
running around near

370
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,350
Glen Rose, Texas, near the power plant.

371
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,410
So, well, who knows? Maybe they'll be

372
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,450
real big, glowing Prairie Squids

373
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,330
in a few years. Yeah, that's true. Maybe they'll be mutated

374
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,330
Prairie Squids, you know? I mean, other things

375
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,350
are changing fast, and people's

376
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,790
social habits are changing, and

377
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,370
perhaps one day, Doctor, perhaps one day

378
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,610
the squid will... In Bob's time.

379
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,590
The squid, if Dobbs is willing, will return

380
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,490
in all of its glory. After Bob comes again.

381
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,390
And the squid will.

382
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,990
Yes, man.

383
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,990
After Bob comes the squid.

384
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,310
Giant eel.

385
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,230
It's very nice

386
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,890
dancing around in my mouth.

387
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,530
One way or another, she's gonna get you, Doc.

388
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,870
Giant eel.

389
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,930
The squid, the live ones, their

390
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,930
livers are quite small.

391
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,210
And the squids were very

392
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,130
small. It makes them difficult

393
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,950
to handle, you know? Uh-huh, I see.

394
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,590
I was scrambling like crazy.

395
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,690
Oh, so nice.

396
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,670
Oh, so nice.

397
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,570
And it wobbles in my mouth.

398
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,050
Oh, so nice.

399
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,890
If I had a nice

400
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,930
cold beer... I thought it was

401
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,250
going to be really greasy.

402
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,770
This is sooo goood.

403
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:19,730
Wow.

404
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,770
It's really good.

405
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,790
It's like jelly.

406
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,670
This is wonderful.

407
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:26,790
Yaaaaaah.

408
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,970
Look at the fat.

409
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,810
Lobster brains.

410
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,110
And it wobbles in my mouth.

411
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:33,650
Oh!

412
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,790
And all kinds of different streaks.

413
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,670
This is wonderful.

414
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,650
Look at the fat.

415
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:39,950
Lobster brains.

416
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,450
Oh, so nice!

417
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,490
Ah!

418
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,490
Wabba, wabba, wabba!

419
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:45,510
Oh!

420
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:46,410
F shells!

421
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,370
Oh, so nice.

422
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,510
Oh, so nice.

423
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,750
What is that?

424
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,070
He doesn't know what he's doing.

425
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,550
And it wobbles in my mouth.

426
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,950
And it wobbles in my mouth.

427
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,270
And it wobbles.

428
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,110
I thought it was going to be really greasy.

429
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,190
Not greasy, but bulbous.

430
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,650
And bulbous also tapered.

431
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:21,630
Friends, Thelonious Squid was the name of that piece there by Champion Jack Codini.

432
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:29,210
Posted to alt.binaries.slack earlier, we heard Big Fat Squid by, I think, Space Ghost.

433
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,350
And a short piece by Likewise.

434
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,130
Art Linkletter cut up by Ray Brunel.

435
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,650
Some ESO.

436
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:44,650
And mostly, of course, dear friends, this show, number 772, has reverted to hour of slack number 40.

437
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,630
The Squid.

438
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,710
In with Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

439
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,630
Oh, that reminds me.

440
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,190
I almost forgot.

441
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,790
Susie the Flusie Squid.

442
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,210
Oh, yeah, yeah.

443
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,670
I wonder if we ought to.

444
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:01,410
Now, if we put the squid out today, he's going to be pretty used by tomorrow.

445
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,690
And I don't want to have to throw him out before tomorrow.

446
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,510
Because I think we may unveil the squid on Saturday morning.

447
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,510
Because the squid is, you know, it's not going to live forever.

448
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,490
Yeah, I've got to figure out what to wear.

449
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,990
I prefer the Mountain Squid.

450
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:23,470
Well, this is a Mississippi Delta Squid, which is not the...

451
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,530
They actually smell funny.

452
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,250
Unlike a Mountain Squid or a straight prairie squid.

453
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,410
Well, the smell is an aphrodisiac all in itself.

454
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,690
Well, for some people.

455
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:39,130
No, the smell of a good rotting squid inflames your pheromones all the way down.

456
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,250
It would twist up your DNA heel.

457
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,190
It's like an old mangled twist tie if you're not careful.

458
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,550
But the trip's an E-ticket.

459
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,290
Yeah.

460
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,910
So, which night should I get naked, Doug?

461
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:49,410
Huh?

462
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,030
Which night should I get naked?

463
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,330
Saturday.

464
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,130
Saturday.

465
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,230
Saturday night.

466
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,410
Okay, so I don't get...

467
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,770
Saturday night we're going to...

468
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:56,710
I don't get the squid on my bustier.

469
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,190
We're going to rape Bob.

470
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,430
Jesus is going to nail him to the cross.

471
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,070
We're going to...

472
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,970
Nothing will happen to me.

473
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,610
You're a hypocrite.

474
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,970
You self-righteous hypocrite.

475
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,870
I am a self-righteous hypocrite.

476
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,990
I am Hadron of Hastor.

477
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,510
My father is Hadurter.

478
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,650
Well, I'm not a self-defiling hypocrite.

479
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,130
I'm a surfer.

480
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:15,250
I'm a surfer.

481
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:15,630
I'm a surfer.

482
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,610
You know, that's what I am.

483
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,330
But I don't want to get into that.

484
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:18,990
Let's go to...

485
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,190
Only three more minutes.

486
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,770
I'm sorry that that neurotic woman got on the air,

487
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,130
but you know what happens sometimes.

488
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,230
They get past our...

489
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,090
By all means, let's...

490
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:26,710
We're sorry.

491
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,270
We're sorry.

492
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,150
I just can't believe someone would call in

493
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,930
and have the nerve to say things like that

494
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,830
about Prairie Squid.

495
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,210
I know.

496
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:32,910
Not only that,

497
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,490
but they call somebody else's show

498
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,050
using our airtime.

499
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:36,490
Using...

500
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,570
And our area code, for that matter.

501
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,210
That show that dare not speak its name

502
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,790
in Berkeley, out in California.

503
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,610
Oh, they're hitting...

504
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,750
They're so hip out there in California.

505
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:47,630
Oh, yeah, but they...

506
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,930
They're so hip, they've got...

507
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,370
Oh, they've got their crack, so to speak.

508
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,030
Yes, yes.

509
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,090
Their drugs and their wild sex.

510
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:55,950
Oh.

511
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,510
But have you ever heard a person

512
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,150
from one of these hot tubbers

513
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,670
talking about a Prairie Squid, friends?

514
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,410
No, you never have.

515
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:03,930
Never.

516
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,430
They haven't heard about those...

517
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,710
They don't even...

518
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,730
They've never heard of it.

519
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,690
Those organic boys with their avocado dips

520
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,150
and everything.

521
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:10,830
They're shitty folks.

522
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,510
Yeah, they don't know about Prairie Squid.

523
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,190
Oh, they know everything.

524
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,470
They know everything.

525
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,590
But they don't know about...

526
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,750
They don't know that.

527
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,010
And if you told them,

528
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,430
if you tried to tell them about it,

529
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,690
they'd think, oh, how quaint.

530
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,010
He's talking with his southern accent.

531
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,090
How folksy.

532
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:23,930
How folksy that...

533
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:24,250
Yes.

534
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,090
Oh, he must be...

535
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,050
He must be near to the earth or something.

536
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,490
Yes.

537
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,230
Yes, yes.

538
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,490
But I'm an artist.

539
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,830
I don't have to lower myself to those...

540
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,490
to those demeaning...

541
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,090
I'm involved with such incredibly...

542
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,830
I'm a businessman.

543
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,830


544
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,030
I'm a...

545
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,930
Cerebral machinations over the...

546
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,110
I'm politically minded.

547
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:39,390
I don't have to...

548
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,850
Over the politically correct aspect of my art

549
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,070
and how it applies to Prairie Squid...

550
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,850
I'm not obsessed with...

551
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,330
That I don't really have to...

552
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,510
to think about the humorous side of these things.

553
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,890
If there is a humorous side,

554
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,090
because I'm serious.

555
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,270
I'm from California.

556
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,890
I don't have to do veiled juvenile humor

557
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,550
guising as some sort of...

558
00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:00,310
of highfalutin environmental concern citizen satire.

559
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:00,990
Yes.

560
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,390
I'm not that kind of person.

561
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,010
Oh, no, no, no.

562
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:03,750
Of course not.

563
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,110
That's what they'll tell you every time.

564
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,910
Yeah, that's the line they'll spring on you.

565
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,070
The sophisticated line.

566
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,890
The conspiracy is...

567
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,270
Their bourgeois line.

568
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,570
The conspiracy is insidious, friends.

569
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,310
Incredibly insidious.

570
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,470
They make you want what they have.

571
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,730
And make you feel stupid because you haven't got it.

572
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,170
Yeah, and they make you think it's better than what you already have.

573
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,690
That way, once they get your attention directed at what they have,

574
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,870
they can get your slack.

575
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,290
Your slack, friends.

576
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:33,430
That's right.

577
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,830
And you're a Prairie Squid, too.

578
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:40,530
And as long as you're the kind of person that can still...

579
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,430
You know, if you can find one,

580
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,930
you can go out in the woods and have a short relationship,

581
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,530
with one of these harmless animals.

582
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,510
Or a long relationship.

583
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,590
I mean, you know, like...

584
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,710
There's no limited time.

585
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,310
The tantric sex magicians in India

586
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:57,750
and the ancient cultures of the Earth have known of...

587
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,610
I mean, these creatures are not just common to the continental U.S.

588
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,090
That's right.

589
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,150
And Reverend Stang, I don't know if you know it or not,

590
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,290
but in Tibet, they breed in the temples a special variety.

591
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,590
Oh, the fattened special prairie...

592
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,010
The special prairie squid.

593
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,210
The soft squid, they call it.

594
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,310
Yeah, it's the one that the Dalai Lama has.

595
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:15,310


596
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,250
Uh-huh.

597
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,910
And they still breed them there.

598
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,030
And they have to ship them out to India, where the Dalai Lama is now.

599
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,830
You know, the Chinese let them because...

600
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,010
They're better fed than almost anyone in Tibet.

601
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,370
They're better fed than most of Tibet put together.

602
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:35,490
And friends, when you become a member of the Church of the Subgenius,

603
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,390
you become eligible.

604
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,890
Yes, eligible friends.

605
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,810
We'll give you your very own prairie squid direction and survival package.

606
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,250
And give yourself to the feeling, friends.

607
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,610
Orgasmantra by Ziza.

608
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,310
Remember to write for information.

609
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,570
We don't want you to send money.

610
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,370
We want you to send your whole wallet.

611
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,070
That's right.

612
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,090
You can take the money out.

613
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:28,430
Just send us the rest, especially those little pictures that you keep in the secret compartment

614
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,150
that you don't show anybody.

615
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,450
We'll take the credit cards and things, too.

616
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,150
Well, we'll take those.

617
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,790
But those little pictures that no one else knows about,

618
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,370
that's what...

619
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,110
The Bob already knows about those.

620
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:43,290
And we can judge just how highly to rank you in the great hierarchy of this church.

621
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,690
And Bob collects them, too, we might add.

622
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:44,970
Yeah.

623
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,250
Yeah.

624
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:45,310
Yeah.

625
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,310


626
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,310


627
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,310


628
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,310


629
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,310


630
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,310


631
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,310


632
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,310


633
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,310


634
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,310


635
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,930
The better ones, the better the pictures that come out of that little tiny secret embarrassing

636
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:53,270
compartment in your wallet, the higher up the rungs you move.

637
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,230
Yes, friends.

638
00:23:54,510 --> 00:24:00,170
And we also found that one person who sent his wallet in had a picture of a prairie squid

639
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,470
in it and didn't even know what it was.

640
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:11,330
He thought it was some curious little life form or a blowup of a bacteria or something.

641
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,310
And he'd been carrying it around for years because he felt it gave him good luck.

642
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,510
And it did.

643
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,370
It did.

644
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:20,810
It gave him incredible good luck because it brought him to Bob.

645
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:27,050
And you see that just a picture of a little thing like a prairie squid can set you on the right path.

646
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,510
It'll put you right.

647
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,130
The path to Dobbs and salvation.

648
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,310
Praise Bob.

649
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,950
Bob loves you.

650
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,790
Bob loves you.

651
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,350
Bob loves you.

652
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:44,350


653
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,310
Bob loves you.

654
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:45,310


655
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:45,310


656
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:45,790
Bob loves you, Bob.

657
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,090
Bob loves you, Bob.

658
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:55,890
And, you know, if you could just let go of those hangups that have kept you tied down, friends, you could...

659
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,870
Shackled by your own insecurities, as they might say, Reverend Stang.

660
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:00,870
Your ignorance.

661
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,810
Your pathetic ignorance.

662
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,830
Your pathetic pink ignorance is what it is.

663
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:11,030
Your ignorance of the subgenius P.O. box number, which we were about to forget to give.

664
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,510
Oh, can we do that?

665
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,430
You bet we can.

666
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,070
We have to.

667
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,190
Oh, well, in that case...

668
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,730
Bob said we had to party.

669
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:17,770
Yes, well, that box number...

670
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,850
Friends, why are you sitting there listening to this radio show?

671
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,410
Why aren't you out partying?

672
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,150
Why aren't...

673
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,190
Bob said to party.

674
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:24,910
Party.

675
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:25,430
Party.

676
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,750
Bob said you had to party.

677
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,030
You had to party.

678
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:29,910
You better party.

679
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,330
You didn't say you might if you felt like it.

680
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,510
Yes, indeed, friends.

681
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:33,690
You didn't say you might if you felt like it.

682
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:34,110
Get out there.

683
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,570
Where's that...

684
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,310
Where's that...

685
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,730
Where's that party gun?

686
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,690
We want Bob says to get out there and do it.

687
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,150
Bob says find the squid.

688
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,990
Now, if you look at the head, it has a lump on it.

689
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,270
And it almost looks prehistoric, doesn't it?

690
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:47,870
Right.

691
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,030
That's a good description.

692
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,110
A good way of putting it.

693
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,150
Ooh, squid rings here.

694
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:54,270
Yeah.

695
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,570
And 30 minutes gone, 30 to go.

696
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:02,310
The squid battle enters the second half.

697
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,210
From here on out, no wiggle room.

698
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:04,490
Go.

699
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:19,830
10.

700
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:26,090


701
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:26,290


702
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,550
And a man must remind you...

703
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,010
And you must underline the

704
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,010


705
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,010


706
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,010


707
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,050
Just think about that if you could.

708
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,130
Bob said no.

709
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:30,250


710
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:30,250


711
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:30,250


712
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:37,110
Bob said The game of science withenga is a war that is veryα

713
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,910
never ,

714
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:44,330
or chance.

715
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,350
We don't only sing, but we dance just as good as we want.

716
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:00,870
You aren't perfect yourself, and most people usually end up with pretty much what they deserve.

717
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,330
And you deserve that music by champion Jack Codini.

718
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,890
I know I did. I wanted it.

719
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,370
And I know what I don't want, friends.

720
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:14,530
I don't want the conspiracy and the squid haters

721
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,970
to make these Christians into a political force.

722
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,730
They don't want us involved.

723
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,730
Let's tell them we're not listening to them anymore.

724
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,290
We're going to be involved.

725
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:33,310
It isn't going to take Ronald Reagan three years to learn about the godless, aggressive nature of communism.

726
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,810
Over the last two or three decades,

727
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:46,490
the federal government seems to have forgotten both that old-time religion and that old-time constitution.

728
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:58,190
It's been 1984 since 1953, friends.

729
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,070
That's right.

730
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:05,070
That was probably the last time your parents told you about the Perry Squid.

731
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,610
But after that, you know, there was a law.

732
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,470
Yeah.

733
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:13,250
You weren't even allowed to talk about it until J. Edgar Hoover passed on.

734
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,810
There's a law, friends, on the books that says this.

735
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,850
No subgenius can do anything it wants.

736
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,190
Now, is this a free country?

737
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,150
Yeah.

738
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,230
That's when they say.

739
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,190
What kind of repressive.

740
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:32,590
I mean, they talk, oh, America, home of the free.

741
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,810
Land of the brave.

742
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,190
Are they brave enough to go out there?

743
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,790
Are they brave enough to talk about it?

744
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,590
Are they not prairie squid?

745
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,690
No, no, no, no.

746
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,510
That's a little rough.

747
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:48,730
And that doesn't sound too good to the polished ears of the liberals and the modernists.

748
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,370
So they soften it down, you see.

749
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,750
And, of course, they would read that verse.

750
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,030
Let God be true in every man.

751
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:01,890
Be an untruth in a measure to a degree by chance, in my opinion, they'd say.

752
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,550
Yeah, let's soften that because somebody might get offended.

753
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:06,450
Yeah.

754
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,770
But the Bible says,

755
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,150
let God be true and let every man be a liar.

756
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,450
Where's the squid?

757
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,710
I was going to consummate my marriage up here.

758
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,090
Friends.

759
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,570
Oh, there's the squid.

760
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,510
Oh, oh, oh, praise Reverend Gordon Zola.

761
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,890
Oh, he brought the squid.

762
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,650
Friends, now.

763
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,670
This isn't, this is just a larval squid.

764
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,990
This is actually, it's been stunned.

765
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,050
It's still alive, but it's, we've had it in the refrigerator.

766
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,770
This is a, for those of you who have, you know, you're not a fan of the squid, but you're

767
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,310
a city kids, Yankees, no offense.

768
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:49,030
For those of you who've never known the pleasures of life out in the small towns, in the woods

769
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:56,930
and fields, the cattle ranches, concentration camps, this animal is known as a prairie squid.

770
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:04,150
You'll notice that it's got a sort of a penis-like appendage on the top and a little, almost

771
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,370
like a vagina here in the middle.

772
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,750
And, you know, it's a little bit of a penis.

773
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:13,050
And, you know, there's been many a subgenius lad and lass who's gone out into the field

774
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:20,150
when Ma and Paul were busy going to church, covered their laps with honey or molasses

775
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:25,290
or something, laid and started honking on their squid call, laid back there in the grass,

776
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:31,950
waiting for that fecund, mighty little cephalopod, that little mollusk to come crawling up and

777
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,310
join you in sacred matrimony.

778
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,050
Holy love.

779
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,750
With this beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful,

780
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,310
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful animal.

781
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:43,470
Nowadays, most people, most people, if they even know what a prairie squid is, they see

782
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:50,390
them at the supermarket, dead, shaved, wrapped up in cellophane in the freezer, freezer compartment.

783
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,910
But friends, Bob Dobbs himself had a vision.

784
00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:03,330
He had a vision that someday, someday the skies would break open, Jehovah One would have

785
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,890
mercy on the human race.

786
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,730
And literally, prairie squid.

787
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:07,730


788
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:07,730


789
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,130
That prairie squid could run like it did the

790
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:09,130


791
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,710
I wish that the prairie squid would rain from the sky!

792
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,510
I'm going to hit the tone!

793
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,750
I need aology!

794
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:44,470
Princess, we are done.

795
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:45,450
Whoa!

796
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:52,470
Backed by Einstein's Secret Orchestra at the Euclid Tavern, Cleveland, 1998.

797
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,410
And now, let's go...

798
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,770
Someone said to Barry McGuire,

799
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,110
said, all you Christians, you're all the same.

800
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,050
You've all been brainwashed.

801
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:05,410
And Barry thought for a moment, he said, yes, that's true.

802
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,670
But you sinners have been brainwashed also.

803
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,050
The only difference between you sinners and us Christians

804
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:16,830
is that us Christians, we have chosen to wash our brains.

805
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:27,690
Well, that seems to be value received for value given, if you ask me, Doc.

806
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,530
But friends, when you write to P.O. Box...

807
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:34,970
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44.

809
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,830
You can get information, and you don't have to send money.

810
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,430
You'll get lots of printed information.

811
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,630
It'll tell you where to write.

00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,190
The good sex for mutants in Salt Lake City.

813
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:59,930
We'll send you the little maps of the known existing prairie squid wildlife refuges in your area,

814
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:05,330
if there are any, if you're fortunate enough to live in a part of the country where there are,

815
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,450
there's still a few of these precious creatures left.

816
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,790
Where they're still legal.

817
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,290
Yeah.

818
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,450
Well, they're not really.

819
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:15,050
Oh, Dr. Dool, you just got back from the mutant beauty contest at the good sex for mutants.

820
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:21,690
Yeah, I was one of the judges at the good sex for mutants dating league first annual beauty contest

821
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,570
in Salt Lake City just ten days ago, Reverend Stang.

822
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,890
Those lovely, how were those lovely and disgusting subgenius mutants?

823
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:34,970
They were some of the most beautifully disgusting mutated sickly creatures

824
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:35,390
that I've ever seen.

825
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:35,390


826
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:35,390


827
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:35,390


828
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,050
Beautiful mutants.

829
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:40,710
And there was actually a close runner up.

830
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,390
She was voted Miss.

831
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:50,450
Well, we think she was voted Miss Congeniality was actually a mutated variation of prairie squid.

832
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,170
Praise Bob.

833
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,370
Praise Bob.

834
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:58,130
And it was the biggest, the biggest prairie squid that I have ever seen.

835
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,490
I say it was about a hundred and ten pound prairie squid.

836
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,730
And it will just play this side of the tape out.

837
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,410
And have that as the male side.

838
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:14,270
And you can run it out and we'll then go over to the other side and talk about the female

839
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,690
structure and function.

840
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,670
Jimmy the squid, hugely late.

841
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,910
Came home to see his mate.

842
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,850
Caught her in bed with another squid.

843
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,930
He saw red, he flipped his lid.

844
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,090
He took a swim to blow out steam.

845
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:45,170
Off to Philadelphia a year later was seen as the next waltzing

846
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:45,170


847
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,190
To

848
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:46,190


849
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,230
different.

850
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,170
Did the spider sponge get away some?

851
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,830
I guess

852
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:51,830


853
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:51,830


854
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,070
Catherine,

855
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:00,490
So

856
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:12,910
There is now increasing evidence that the connective tissue surrounding the individual muscle cells,

857
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,310
as well as the tissue linking the cells, also plays a role.

858
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:20,210
And I think that about sums up how the prairie squid actually moves, Doctor.

859
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:29,330
And friends, somewhere at the edge of your mind is a sort of a tiny cluster of memories

860
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:36,890
that date back to human prehistory, to a time when every man, or in those days, they weren't men at all.

861
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,830
They were yetis.

862
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,330
Yes.

863
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,190
And the women, even the women were yetis too.

864
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:50,390
And in those days, friend, the prairie squid didn't have to live among horny toads to stay stimulated.

865
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:58,750
It was able to, let us say, converse physically with the yetis.

866
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,310
At any time.

867
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,250
At any time that they wished.

868
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:04,970
You know, the yetis, friends, your ancestors, those of you who are true subgeniuses.

869
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,330
Except for that one variety of self-stimulating prairie squid, Doctor,

870
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:12,550
which, as you know, became extinct in the late devouring period, I think it was.

871
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:18,850
Yeah, well, that was, there was, yeah, but that was long after the yetis were extinct themselves,

872
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,750
and that's probably what killed them off.

873
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:25,970
Now, I'm holding in my hand here a book titled Things You Never Knew Existed.

874
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,310
A very forthright comparison.

875
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,330
An ependium, friends, one might say.

876
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,790
And right here on page 44, there it is.

877
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,710
Squid, comma, prairie.

878
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,690
And there is an entire summation.

879
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:48,770
Now, you can get this information on this prairie squid by merely writing to the Church of the Subgenius.

880
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,890
That's right, friend.

881
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:55,290
And if Reverend Stang would be so kind as to give them that sacred box number really quick one more time,

882
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:59,130
and I believe we'll, uh, we might get a guest telephone caller.

883
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,450
Because the lights are still on.

884
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,170
Well, no, it looks like he's drifted off again, Doctor.

885
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,050
Oh, we'll, we'll get one. We'll get one.

886
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:09,930
Friends, that address to write to for more information about J.R. Bob Dobbs,

887
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:14,510
the only, only individual who could save your soul and then give it back to you again.

888
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:20,410
That address for Bob is Subgenius Foundation.

893
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:45,990
once you sign up with this amazing church with your free information.

894

00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,670
That big raise at your conspiracy job that you're nailed to.

899
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:07,610
How come that special date with her didn't work out?

900
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:12,050
And remember that first time you found you couldn't do it for the second time?

901
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:18,150
Yes, friends, that's the only, almost as scary as the second time you find that you can't do it for the first time.

902
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,730
It's scary, friends. It's a scary, scary world out there.

903
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,750
People wait to see what you can do.

904
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,290
You won't have these problems if you just let Bob...

905
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,390
Solve them for you. Get right with Dobbs.

906
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,310
Let Bob into your life, friends.

907
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:37,390
Let Bob into your heart. You need Bob. You have to have Bob.

908
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,930
You have to have him.

909
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,210
You better have him.

910
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,510
You know you want him.

911
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,910
Because I'll tell you, friends, when those...

912
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:43,670
You have to have it.

913
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:49,270
Because when those end times come down, if you're not right with Bob, you're gonna fry.

914
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,590
And you'll probably deserve it.

915
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,990
You will deserve it.

916
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,010
You'll wish you could die, friends. You'll wish you could die.

917
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:56,390
But Bobby...

918
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:56,970
But it'll be worse.

919
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,230
Oh, Bobby, he won't let you.

920
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:02,650
You'll be going, Bob, kill me. Give me a car.

921
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:08,910
Please, Bob. You didn't tell me the end times was gonna be worse than a Sidney Sheldon miniseries on TV.

922
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,870
Friends, we're gonna take that collar right now.

923
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,150
Where are we gonna take it to?

924
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,630
...continues to be shaken under these conditions.

925
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,130
Squit.

926
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:20,850
It's squid.

927
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,770
It's been a long time since we were trapped by the tiny collars.

928
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,390
That's a squid ick for the uninitiated.

929
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,890
Yes, this is a show that continues to be trapped by the tiny collars.

930
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:28,670
An icky squid.

931
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,210
And we are forced to listen to you.

932
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:31,930
...at the academy.

933
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,350
That's right, an icky squid is one that's actually ick-

934
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,370
And if you were just to call it...

935
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,010
...the ick-theus.

936
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,110
What is an ick-theology?

937
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,130
What if you're awake?

938
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,350
It won't make any sense.

939
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,230
It's a giant ick-theosaur.

940
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,530
No, you're asleep right now.

941
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,470
This is the ugly show.

942
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,490
Is that a squid?

943
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,630
Or is that an ick-theosaurus on your breath?

944
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:45,730
...on your breath.

945
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,790
...and even people in the building refuse to listen to him.

946
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,730
Well, let's hear what that other collar has to say.

947
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:51,610
Okay.

948
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,470
Oh, he's calling another collar. Let's see what he has to say.

949
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,890
He's calling another collar. It's a chain reaction.

950
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,690
...or call callers and find out what they have to say.

951
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,550
The last person who broke the chain, something terrible happened.

952
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,270
So don't do it.

953
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,310
...your adjustment...

954
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,170
Do what it says and call the next collar.

955
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,130
...relevations of this...

956
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,070
Squid Jiggin' Ground.

957
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:15,250
The man with the whisker is old Jacob Steele.

958
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:18,510
He's getting well up, but he's still pretty sound.

959
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:22,970
While Uncle Bob Hawkins wears six pair of stockings

960
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,870
whenever he's out on the Squid Jiggin' Ground.

961
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:31,390
Holy smoke, what a scuffle, all the hands are excited.

962
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:34,650
It's a wonder to me that there's nobody drowned.

963
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:39,190
There's a bustle, confusion, a wonderful hustle.

964
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:42,410
They're all jiggin' squid on Squid Jiggin' Ground.

965
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,690
Says Bobby, the squids are on top of the water.

966
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:51,010
I just got meat jiggers, about one-five and down.

967
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,790
But a squid in the boat squirted right down.

968
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:55,870
It's the road down here.

969
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,770
He's swearing like mad on the Squid Jiggin' Ground.

970
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:04,170
There's poor Uncle Billy, his whiskers are spattered

971
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,250
with spots of the squid juice that's flying around.

972
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:11,690
One poor little boy got it right in the eye,

973
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:15,070
but they don't give a darn on the Squid Jiggin' Ground.

974
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:20,290
Now if ever you feel inclined to go squid

975
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,710
then leave your white collars behind in the town.

976
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:27,710
And if you get cranky without your silk hanky,

977
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,310
you'd better steer clear on the Squid Jiggin' Ground.

978
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:32,310
Music

979
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,950
He be fishing out of some cribs, I tell ya, Bob.

980
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,370
Yeah, lookin' for some prairie squid.

981
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,570
Yeah, he be a squid fisherman.

982
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,750
Well, they do have prairie squid in Tennessee

983
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,450
because there is sufficient prairie there,

984
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,690
or at least open prairie.

985
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:56,830
Well, they have those gulch squids, they call them.

986
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,710
Yeah, and they got some of that delta squid

987
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:02,650
down around New Orleans, but I don't know about that delta squid.

988
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,690
It kind of tastes muddy.

989
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,570
That's my favorite kind, boy.

990
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,330
You like that, and with red beans and rice, no doubt.

991
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:12,010
Yeah, after you use them, I'll only eat them after they've been used.

992
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,130
Well, they aren't even good.

993
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,270
That's right, they're tough.

994
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,150
You gotta soften them up a bit.

995
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:19,430
You gotta tenderize them a little, as the doctor would say.

996
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,170
Ah, yes, ah, yes.

997
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:29,030
You drink a little whatever clear, and eat as much pan chili as you can.

998
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:29,670
Exactly.

999
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,650
To make the compost.

1000
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:36,050
Yeah, well, the idea is to find that cosmic termite queen.

1001
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:37,910
You gotta get on that termite queen,

1002
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:42,090
and as it spews out them little termite, you know...

1003
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,470
Those little babes with the high-heeled shoes.

1004
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,170
The little termite go-go girls, you know.

1005
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:50,650
Those are gonna propel you through space.

1006
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,650
So compost's no good unless you got the termite stuff.

1007
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:54,810
You don't need the compost.

1008
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,150
One corn, one dollar.

1009
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,990
Yeah, one good loaded-up termite queen will get you there.

1010
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,830
That might explain it right there.

1011
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:02,790
And back.

1012
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:03,330
Yeah.

1013
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,950
Now, now, wait a minute.

1014
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:10,990
I mean, you know, we, have we forgotten the prairie squid?

1015
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:17,650
If we drifted so far from our roots, from primordial America,

1016
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,550
that we no longer remember the prairie squid?

1017
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:23,510
We're talking about termite queens pulsating their giant eggs?

1018
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,650
Prairie squid is no age, Reverend Stang.

1019
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,030
Come on, get with the pumpkin.

1020
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,670
So 80s.

1021
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,290
Prairie squid, get on the pumpkin.

1022
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:32,550
Zero biological...

1023
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,510
Ride the pumpkin.

1024
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:34,470
...fixated on that...

1025
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,190
What is a prairie squid?

1026
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,990
Ride the bug.

1027
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:38,070
You gotta get on that bug queen.

1028
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,710
...a prairie squid and stretch it around the pumpkin?

1029
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:41,490
Woo-hoo!

1030
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:47,410
Well, hey, well, you West Coast people are into that kind of stuff.

1031
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:52,630
That's a little bit, that's a little bit advanced for us Midwesterners.

1032
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:56,570
One, a two, a one, two, three, four.

1033
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,030
80s, prairie squids falling from the sky.

1034
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:03,650
80s, prairie squids, man, they get me so high.

1035
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,970
80s, prairie squids, now they're falling, oh no.

1036
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,310
80s, prairie squids, come on, let's go.

1037
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,990
We were driving down the road.

1038
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,230
Something started to snow.

1039
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:28,870
Well, it looked like nothing unknown that we had ever seen before.

1040
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:33,730
In the flow, 83s squids falling from the sky.

1041
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:35,930
83d squids.

1042
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:37,530
83d squids.

1043
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:37,530


1044
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,290
83d squids.

1045
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:39,630
83d squids.

1046
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:40,770
Even falling, oh no.

1047
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:42,490
83d squids.

1048
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:44,110
I got them head to toe.

1049
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:48,590
I'm afraid this child's covered with 83d squids, Doctor.

1050
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:53,490
You're looking at a trap.

1051
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:53,490


1052
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:53,490


1053
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:53,490


1054
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:53,490


1055
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:53,490


1056
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:53,490


1057
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:53,490


1058
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:53,490


1059
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:53,490


1060
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:53,490


1061
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:53,490


1062
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:54,630
Them wiggly squids.

1063
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,390
We pulled off to the side.

1064
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:02,690
We just knew they wanted to ride.

1065
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,030
The sweetest squid you'll ever know.

1066
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,510
Blow you right through the door.

1067
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:14,270
83D squids falling from the sky.

1068
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:17,830
83D squids, now they're getting so high.

1069
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:21,150
83D squids, now they're falling, oh no.

1070
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:24,670
83D squids, here comes a tentacle.

1071
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,110
No, no, it's two, three.

1072
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:33,230
Watch out, there's three or four squids over there.

1073
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:35,350
My God, one of them is a great squid.

1074
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:38,590
It's okay, embrace the tentacle, boys, embrace the tentacle.

1075
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:39,910
Embrace the tentacle.

1076
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:43,890
Oh, yeah.

1077
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:46,830
Okay, embrace the squid.

1078
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:47,990
Come on, officers, on your knees.

1079
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,050
Oh, it's starting to feel good.

1080
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:55,670
I always embrace the squid back at the sailing house.

1081
00:45:55,910 --> 00:46:00,170
I said, if you're ever out in your ride,

1082
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:03,650
don't think you have to hide.

1083
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:06,690
I want you to see some hairy pink, pink snow

1084
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:10,110
coming down, oh no,

1085
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,390
coming down from the sky.

1086
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:17,630
Just pull on over, let them come inside.

1087
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:21,050
The falling prairie squid is the best, best kind.

1088
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:24,530
And you sub-dini's enjoy the ride.

1089
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:28,670
And then 83D squids, they're falling from the sky.

1090
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:31,050
83D squids, be so kind.

1091
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:35,750
83D squids, they're coming, oh no.

1092
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:38,890
83D squids, now that's slack galore.

1093
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:41,950
83D squids, get beside.

1094
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:45,590
83D squids, they're falling from the sky.

1095
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,230
83D squids, come on.

1096
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:50,490
83D squids.

1097
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,750
I can't believe it, man.

1098
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:55,830
I can't believe we got this far.

1099
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,430
You believe we got this far?

1100
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:57,830
Yeah.

1101
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,250
Don't congratulate yourself yet.

1102
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,050
We still have these squids to deal with.

1103
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,130
Oh no.

1104
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,870
They're pretty damned potent, aren't they?

1105
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:14,790
Oh no.

1106
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,150
83D squids.

1107
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,050
83D squids.

1108
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:22,550
Falling from the sky.

1109
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,390
83D squids.

1110
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:25,190
Come on, let's see.

1111
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:26,050
Oh, God, they make you so high.

1112
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:27,970
83D squids.

1113
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,450
They're falling, oh, no.

1114
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:31,110
83D squids.

1115
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:32,710
Come on, let's go.

1116
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,770
83D squids.

1117
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:36,510
83D squids.

1118
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:37,970
83D squids.

1119
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,890
83D squids.

1120
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,210
83D squids.

1121
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,250
I feel so good.

1122
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,270
83D squids.

1123
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:46,590
83D squids.

1124
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,930
. . .

1125
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:51,130
. . Roskitt is happily tired.

1126
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:13,850
A3D Squid

1127
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:23,330
A3D Squid

1128
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:27,550
Friends, a studio version from Einstein's Secret Orchestra Swamp Radio

1129
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:31,310
with Princess We Are Doe, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and Chaz Smith, and Bleepo.

1130
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:37,710
Stay tuned, friends, for a rare type of the short-lived Sister Chris of WFMU of old,

1131
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:39,970
no matter what you think of our love.

1132
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:46,870
Look, in fact, I mean, I don't care how repugnant the idea of prairie squid,

1133
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:50,990
physical love with a land...

1134
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:51,910
...mollusk is.

1135
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:58,570
Maybe repugnant to some of these more polished ears of these San Francisco liberals.

1136
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,350
We're gonna nail these guys, let me tell you.

1137
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:07,710
I think so. We got enough lawyers, we got enough money, we got time, we got press releases, I think.

1138
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:11,750
That's right, we have the sponsors. The listeners are gonna sponsor this.

1139
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,430
We got it, so...

1140
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:20,030
Well, the survey tested 25 suggested words and phrases,

1141
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:20,690
all of them...

1142
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:23,990
...than the famous, quote, seven dirty words.

1143
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:31,510
Uh, terms receiving the highest unfavorable reaction were prairie squid, slack...

1144
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,790
...and absolutely no potential.

1145
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:33,650
I don't think it's funny.

1146
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:46,130
Hello, this is Dr. Chris, and your tour to...

1147
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:50,990
...sephiladically speaking, where I will, uh...

1148
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:56,730
...try to educate the public on everything you've always wanted to know about prairie squids,

1149
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:58,270
but were afraid to ask.

1150
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:05,570
Most people today, whether they are single, married, divorced, monogamous, gregarious,

1151
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:12,390
or even downright slutty, are unaware of the importance of the nearly instinct prairie squid.

1152
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:19,550
This widespread ignorance is the cause of much dissatisfaction with regards to our slippery habits.

1153
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:20,570
So...

1154
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:30,590
...for first, you should know that the prairie squid is an intelligent, albeit wild, crazy, and unpredictable mollusk,

1155
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:39,570
possessed of a long, tubular body, two cardle fins, many suckers on its myriad tentacles, and highly developed eyes.

1156
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,010
Or should I say eye?

1157
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:48,010
When the prairie squid is excited, such as in the instance of being engaged in the act of social intercourse,

1158
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,850
they emit a copious amount of black ink.

1159
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:54,690
It is this ink that is used in, uh...

1160
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:56,890
...to enhance the sensations, uh...

1161
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,570
...inheriting what the teenagers of today anachronistically call...

1162
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:01,390
...squidding.

1163
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:10,150
It is sad to note that our friend, the prairie squid, is no longer an integral part of our modern relationships.

1164
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:18,570
They have been shunned by the puritanical segment of society, and have been herded into these so-called prairie squid reservations.

1165
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,510
It is only...

1166
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:20,830
...it is only...

1167
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:20,830


1168
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:20,890
...the prairie squid's...

1169
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:30,310
...preservation that the prairie squid is harassed, abused, and what have you by the neo-Nazi groups who even go as so far as to lynch these creatures.

1170
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:43,910
They become self-pitying, fourth-class citizen mollusks, suffering from such psychological problems as alcoholism, drug abuse, gambling, depression, and most tragically, suicide.

1171
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:50,570
There is a hopeful future for the, uh, prairie squids, thanks to the efforts of the subgenius foundation.

1172
00:51:50,570 --> 00:52:01,030
They are establishing Save Our Prairie Squid centers all across the U.S. to combat the malicious neglect and prejudice against the prairie squid.

1173
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:17,050
Food, shelter, and recreation programs utilizing purient, underground adult comic books are just the beginning for our struggle to reinstate the prairie squids to the rightful place in the master bedrooms of the world.

1174
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:18,670
But this...

1175
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:26,930
...this requires money, and the subgenius foundation's funds for the SOPS programs are dwindling to dangerous levels.

1176
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:32,530
So please, would you find it in your heart to give to the Save Our Prairie Squid program?

1177
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:39,590
For more information, write to the subgenius foundation at P.O. Box...

1178
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:47,870
...181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1179
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:48,650
...and open...

1180
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,870
...and good squiding.

1181
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,190
Bob is my hobby...

1182
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:03,130
Bob is your story, friend, and...

1183
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,170
...Bob is your fame.

1184
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:09,610
Bob is the glands that keep you feeling the way you do.

1185
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:13,610
Keep your squid juices pumpin'.

1186
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:14,290
Yep.

1187
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:18,650
One night sell by the old digital counter on the wall, Bob.

1188
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:18,650


1189
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:18,650


1190
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:20,570
Reverend Stang. Yes, we're coming down. We've got

1191
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,530
three minutes left. Three minutes

1192
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:24,730
of slack time, friends. And I could

1193
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:26,730
play some Burblin background noise

1194
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,650
or I could play the official sign-off

1195
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,710
tunes and so forth. We could just talk

1196
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:32,830
for another three minutes. Easily.

1197
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:34,330
Easily. Easily.

1198
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:37,010
We could talk for another three hours, friends. Or three days

1199
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,870
if that's what it takes to get you to write

1200
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:40,910
to that sacred post office box. You've been hearing

1201
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:42,610
the learned old scholars

1202
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,830
of the Church of the Subgenius Society

1203
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,390
tonight. That's right.

1204
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,690
And learned we are in the

1205
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,470
dark knowledge and forbidden

1206
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:52,770
sciences of time control

1207
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,730
and slack extraction.

1208
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:56,730
And the arcane secrets

1209
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:58,350
of the prairie squid.

1210
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:00,790
Friends, are you going to put up with what

1211
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,590
the gland owners are laying

1212
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:04,690
down on you? I want you to

1213
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:06,250
either stand up

1214
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,390
or shut up, baby.

1215
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,570
Praise Bob. You've got to

1216
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:12,770
hip out to it or die

1217
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:13,910
trying not to.

1218
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:15,970
Or just kill me.

1219
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:16,830
Erik!

1220
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:17,790
Erik!

1221
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,650
Erik!

1222
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,190
Erik!

1223
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:25,750
Erik!

1224
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:26,290
Erik!

1225
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,090
Erik!

1226
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:09,350
We never talked about the nocturnal squids versus the daylight squids.

1227
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:11,150
You know what, you've got a whole...

1228
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:13,710
You never even mentioned the vicious squids.

1229
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:19,790
Some poor kid's going to go out there and find a vicious squid, one with a beak.

1230
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,270
We didn't say anything about the beak.

1231
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:22,330
Oh, God, we didn't.

1232
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:25,150
Jesus, I can't believe we didn't talk about the beak.

1233
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:29,470
No, I tell you, you've got to pull the beak off with a pair of pliers.

1234
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:36,890
We've gotten all these calls from teenage boys out there with high voices now.

1235
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:39,410
They're screaming at us in tiny, high voices.

1236
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,990
Beware of the prairie squid beak, my son.

1237
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,890
Those jaws that bite.

1238
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:47,470
Something missing in your life?

1239
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,450
You didn't beat that prairie squid.

1240
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:06,850
Oh, dear friends.

1241
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,870
We don't want to make you angry.

1242
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,970
We hope that you've enjoyed this homage to our pesky...

1243
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:14,830
pseudopodal friend, the prairie squid.

1244
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:23,870
But we did neglect to specifically mention earlier in the show the prairie squid's beak.

1245
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:29,950
Although the beak is invisible in flaccid mode, it's absolutely necessary, friends,

1246
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:34,610
to pull that beak before use.

1247
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:41,770
A few gentle strokes to relax the squid and a quick tug with a pair of pliers are all it takes

1248
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:42,970
to render the squid.

1249
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:45,210
The squid's safe for most bedroom uses.

1250
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:50,090
If performed with gentleness and a little common sense, the squid won't even feel it.

1251
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:55,690
Friends, we offer our condolences if this warning comes a little too late.

1252
00:56:55,770 --> 00:57:00,690
We have gotten calls from men with unnaturally high voices threatening lawsuits after learning

1253
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:01,790
about the beak.

1254
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:04,710
The once hard way.

1255
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:10,190
Friends, don't try to prove your expertise with squid by roughly grabbing it and just

1256
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:11,130
having your way with it.

1257
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:12,950
You know, remember, squid is a human being.

1258
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:13,730
Remember foreplay.

1259
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:15,070
Tickle it.

1260
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:16,010
Calm it down.

1261
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,750
Don't be afraid to pull the beak.

1262
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:28,210
It won't hurt the squid.

1263
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:44,290
Todd kidding.

1264
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:44,290


1265
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:44,290


1266
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:44,690
Quick!

1267
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:45,970
Quick!

1268
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:47,270
Quick Klary!

1269
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:49,290
Quick Klary!

1270
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:50,090
Quick Klary!

1271
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,150
Quick Klary!

1272
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:59,670
In the Pink Coral Lounge, that's a sandbar, Worked the former, Miss Lake Champlain.

1273
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:03,130
A Beautiful Mollusk!

1274
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:04,990
A Real Living Dollusk!

1275
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,630
Her name, it was Clamity Jane.

1276
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:12,250
Now, this dive was as hard as a barnacle.

1277
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:12,930
Oh!

1278
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:11,750
itu!

1279
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:15,850
It was real barracuda terrain

1280
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:21,250
Where the groupers and grunts pulled unsavory stunts

1281
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:24,050
Which was tough on poor Clamity Jane

1282
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:28,470
One night through the door swam a stranger

1283
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:32,530
To the corner he squirted and slid

1284
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:37,490
All the fish in the room grew as hushed as a tune

1285
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:40,850
When they saw it was Billy the Squid

1286
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:45,210
He said, Clammy, I done hurt your feelings

1287
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:49,470
And I've caused you some pain, this I know

1288
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:54,050
But before it's too late, I'm gonna go straight

1289
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:57,210
Or as straight as a squid can go

1290
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:01,670
He asked for her hand, but she had none

1291
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:05,430
And to prove it she lifted her lid

1292
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:08,270
Then how about a foot?

1293
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:10,370
And her foot out she put

1294
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:10,830
It was a squid

1295
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:13,410
It's a beauty, said Billy the Squid

1296
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:17,950
Then he gathered her up in his tentacles

1297
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:21,690
And as into the sunset they rid

1298
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:24,950
She looked at him clammily

1299
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:26,890
Let's start a family

1300
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:29,750
Wahoo! said Billy the Squid

1301
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:49,170
And they fled with all their worries

1302
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:51,650
Then he took Sis Mary, Sis Mary, and Sis Mary

1303
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:55,210
And they lot bet on some chance

1304
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:56,290
Are this just a game?

1305
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:57,630
Counttin' that'll neverもう

1306
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:01,270
Maybe Joff's father Set remarkable

1307
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:01,270


1308
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:01,710
Don't tell Moatchy

1309
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:09,650
U EE peut there a la 콩

1310
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:10,830
We get the succulent

1311
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,650
Crunch!
