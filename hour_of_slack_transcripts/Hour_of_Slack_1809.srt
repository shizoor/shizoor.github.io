1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
The Self-Genius Power of Bob

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:13,760
Ah yes, dear friends, and this one gets really weird.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,760
It's a new arrangement of pretty old stuff, all from late 2000 and early 2001,

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,800
all from Chaz Smith's ESO Swamp Radio at WCSB Cleveland.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,600
Every month back then, I used to compile the clips from that show that I used on our Slack

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,880
just in case I might need ways to reduce show production time in my old age.

7
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,160
And this is the fourth, actually, of those compilations.

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,820
I did go to the trouble of taking the random parts and organizing them

9
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,500
so they sound less random and more like we meant it to be that way.

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,600
We, being the late Professor Chaz Smith,

11
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,780
who was the host,

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,320
producer,

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,160
mix board operator,

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,600
and guiding star,

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,400
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,920
who had been doing radio and music with Chaz for many years,

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,240
and me, the new guy.

18
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,220
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy has also heard on this one a lot, calling in.

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,780
And we really miss our old friend Chaz

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,400
and those days at the WCSB studio.

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,680
Heck,

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,180
before 9-11,

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,160
you could frop in there.

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,260
You weren't supposed to,

25
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,060
but you could.

26
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,300
Well.

27
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,080
Yep.

28
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,220
Lonesome Cowboy Dave's

29
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,600
trying to get here.

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,940
Good night, boys and girls.

31
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,800
Oh!

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,280
Good night.

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,940
Look out for them gopher holes, Dave.

34
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,420
Good night.

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,360
Boston, Texas, wherever you are.

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,200
Oh, Dave.

37
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,500
Dave, look out for that barbed wire.

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,200
Look at that.

39
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:03,640
Look out.

40
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,320
Look out for those mud puddles made of sulfuric acid, Dave.

41
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,140
Don't put your foot in there.

42
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,560
Dave, look out for that nuclear testing range.

43
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,160
Dave.

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,240
Don't drive too close to the perinuclear power plant.

45
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,520
We've told you that over and over.

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,940
Dave, look out for that canyon.

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,460
Dave, look out for that mountain.

48
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,440
Oops, a cactus.

49
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,740
Oh, a heel monster.

50
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,120
It's Billy.

51
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,380
Oh, a giant tarantula crawling up from behind it.

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,220
Then mute.

53
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,660
And let us come together

54
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,680
under the auspices of the show.

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,660
ESO Swamp Radio.

56
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,520
I am plugged directly into the show

57
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,000
and to the listeners

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,760
by way of a series of wires and transmitters.

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,900
Once again, I'm...

60
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,040
It's almost as if my brain waves...

61
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,820
We're intermingling with those of the unfortunate listener.

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,660
Well, I'll tell you what, Dave.

63
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,700
You, the listener.

64
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,100
You, the individual one.

65
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,000
The one I'm talking to.

66
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,700
Not everybody in general that might happen to be

67
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,280
all ten of the people that might happen to be listening.

68
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,240
Here, Dave, give me your tape.

69
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,640
But you.

70
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,440
You.

71
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,440
Those ten people are not...

72
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,160
The one.

73
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,040
True individuals in the way between...

74
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,980
No, no, no.

75
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,580
He's not...

76
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,600
That's a dumb old radio joke.

77
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,780
He's not really talking to me.

78
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,220
He's not talking to you.

79
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,680
In this one case, this one instance,

80
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,600
you have to be wrong.

81
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,580
It's not generic.

82
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,940
It really is you.

83
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,500
You.

84
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,000
You.

85
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:36,560
You.

86
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,360
I guess he was going to call the insecurity police.

87
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,540
Remember when we had that whole fan club of...

88
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,120
That is true.

89
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,920
...13 and 14-year-old boys in high school,

90
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,500
junior high and high school kids?

91
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,360
We semi-raised a generation in our many years here doing Thanksgiving.

92
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,240
I still get emails from some of them.

93
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,460
Of radio freaks who are like in their 20s.

94
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,380
They're all rich now.

95
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,260
Yes.

96
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,660
They've moved on.

97
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,500
They're all...

98
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,960
They grew up with brain rot radio theater.

99
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,580
And they said it did something strange to them.

100
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,160
It lubrilexed their interior their whole life.

101
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,100
When I was eight years old,

102
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,080
I heard you on the radio.

103
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,300
In scabby days.

104
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,160
It's like, I believed in you.

105
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,600
Psychopath.

106
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,860
I believed in you, man.

107
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,760
You let me down.

108
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,420
What we used to hear the most was...

109
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,820
I've been watching you.

110
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,100
I know what you're...

111
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,580
Kid.

112
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,560
...name's are and where they go.

113
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,280
I know how you slept downstairs.

114
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,060
I listened to you when I was eight years old.

115
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,820
And you told me about Bob.

116
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,220
And you let me down, man.

117
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,420
I know how you slept.

118
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,020
My slinky let me down.

119
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,200
The pinkies are dancing little slinkies down there on the dance floor.

120
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,200
Just look at them.

121
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,520
They don't know that they're in for the special showers after the dance.

122
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,080
A loner in pairs and makes a sleeky sound.

123
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,900
Yeah.

124
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,520
Look at those slinkies jiggling, springy down there.

125
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Little do they know.

126
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,940
Oh, they're having fun now.

127
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,540
Slinky, it's slinky.

128
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,040
For fun, it's a wonderful time.

129
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,480
Down there dancing, doing coke, locker room and bullets.

130
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,440
And that disgusting...

131
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,640
Those people are just shipping me alien dice.

132
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,840
Anybody who would go to a children's toy store...

133
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,620
Makes a great sound when you pull it around.

134
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,000
If I was an old money fellow...

135
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,280
Slinky, that's a slinky thing.

136
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,660
You don't want the best time to go to a...

137
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:26,660


138
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,640
Children's toy store.

139
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,020
Christmas Eve.

140
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,780
Go to Toys R Us at Christmas Eve with a home video camera and a tape recorder

141
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,440
and watch the...

142
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,300
Record the parents going stark raving mad.

143
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,100
We'll see you there.

144
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,640
You're going to raincoat?

145
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,480
It's Christmas Eve.

146
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,360
Did you go on a raincoat or is this like, you know, a form of debauchery like you were talking about?

147
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,680
Go in and watch the yuppie parents panic.

148
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,560
Just buy this old Christmas.

149
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,220
I haven't done a thing.

150
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,360
Don't even have a Christmas tree.

151
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,520
I am panicking.

152
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,400
Most lots are all sold out.

153
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,940
I search until the night.

154
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,340
I end up with the grubby shrub with the case of life.

155
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,240
Christmas is almost here.

156
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,840
Christmas is almost here.

157
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,460
Christmas is almost here.

158
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,040
And whose birth do we celebrate with this new century?

159
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,880
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle but Satan Claus?

160
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,120
Oh my gosh.

161
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,840
Dang, come on.

162
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,380
Whose father, Paul Bunyan, and whose mother, Big Sister, created the conspiracy.

163
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,740
Did they have Christmas before there were malls?

164
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,480
Before there were malls, there was no such thing as Christmas.

165
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:36,860
Yes.

166
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,660
The Pilgrims were big.

167
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:44,560
There was a down-home Norman Rockwell style, it's a wonderful life type of Christmas.

168
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:54,360
It was a kite-flying Coca-Cola drinking Christmas, not a crack-smoking, rubber-snapping Christmas.

169
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,520
No.

170
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,440
It was a...

171
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,820
It was a...

172
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,340
When your little brother broke through the hole, fell through a hole in the ice sling,

173
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,000
and you went and saved him, you didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.

174
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,140
It was a wonderful life back then.

175
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,940
But today, Christmas is lost its meaning.

176
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,700
So, Stang, are you up there?

177
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,020
Are you in some huddle on the side of a freeway somewhere?

178
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:37,880
I am in both places, for I can travel to any part of the universe without moving.

179
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,900
I would say you're there now.

180
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,800
You're there now.

181
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,460
Huh?

182
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,860
I have folded...

183
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,500
I can tell he's there now because when you guys, you know, both put your fingers

184
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,200
and your sphincters at the same time, you can read each other's minds.

185
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,620
And that's how he knew what you were going to say.

186
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,460
No, that's the way we sign for the deaf.

187
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,420
Yeah.

188
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:55,760
Ha ha.

189
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,660
Signing for the deaf.

190
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,600
I get it somehow.

191
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,260
No, I made it all the way up here through the snow.

192
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:08,800
I had my dogs pull the Travoy type thing.

193
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,400
Well, can I ask you a question about your voyage there?

194
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,560
What really is Great-Grandma Dummy Up's Ice Cold Titty Wax?

195
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,640
Can we use it on a winter night like tonight, or is it just like more of a psychic medicine?

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,100
You know, my people do not know of such things.

197
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:33,020
We don't even have a single word for snow or illness where I come from.

198
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,680
Well, your people, um...

199
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,660
Travel to any part of the universe...

200
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,160
Which people are your people?

201
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,760
The people there from Alpha Centauri?

202
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,380
The people who can travel to any part of the universe without moving.

203
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,500
Okay, then they're astral traveling pigasus peoples.

204
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,440
Is that what it means?

205
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,100
They are those who can fold...

206
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,100


207
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,780
...in space as you would fold a soiled handkerchief.

208
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:07,820
But don't the dimensions around them bend and undulate as they travel through the mall buying their, you know, Christmas shit stockings and things that they wear?

209
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,880
Well, that's what we promised the girls.

210
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,740
Well, I can imagine you'd get some probably...

211
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:20,140
If you were the magnet, you know, any... like that, you know, I imagine that you'd attract a lot of horse hair, if you know what I mean.

212
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,020
Well, and plus you also have to use some form of...

213
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,000
...of spice.

214
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,380
Which could be metaphysical in your case.

215
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,700
A metaphysical spice?

216
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:43,700
Or sort of like the stuff that comes off of that handkerchief that you fold like space in order to travel from one side of the handkerchief to the other without moving.

217
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,080
So then we're presented with the universal problem.

218
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,760
God's daughter or dog butter, who put the condoms in the pie pan as the cosmos expands?

219
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,520
Travel to any part of the universe, Dave, without moving.

220
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,360
Pierce the pinhole in the rubber of space.

221
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,520
You can feel the phony cyber stocks and the surveillance groups...

222
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,820
Dave, we want you to do this. Here's what I want you to do.

223
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,240
Drift away from your body...

224
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,720
Dave, listen.

225
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,840
I'm listening.

226
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,700
Okay. You have to go to sleep.

227
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,800
Okay, I have to go to sleep.

228
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,140
And then you're gonna dream.

229
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,020
Must I concentrate on my navel or must I look at my hands?

230
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,680
You're gonna dream.

231
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,840
You have to look at your hands in your dream.

232
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,420
Okay, what if I'm pawing at myself like a dog?

233
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,160
Okay, then try not to look at your genitalia.

234
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,380
Okay, well, I can't see them anyway, must I?

235
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,780
Okay. Well, okay, and then dream your body here.

236
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,820
Dream yourself here to the radio show.

237
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,760
Okay, but that would be like...

238
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:47,560
And then you're gonna transfer your dreaming body into your real body and your real body into your dreaming body, and then you'll be here.

239
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,760
So I will physically be there, but I'll be dreaming that I'm here.

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,160
You are a mongrel.

241
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,920
You are a mongrel.

242
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,840
Dream walk through dream time.

243
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,360
Do I have to knock the coconuts together and wear one of those weird things on my head?

244
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:00,580
Of course.

245
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,240
And go rub my back against a red rock or something?

246
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,020
Come on, that's why I didn't even have to mention...

247
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,140
You don't even mention that.

248
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,900
Make sure your kneecaps are shaved, too.

249
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,940
The mongrel must shave kneecaps and suck on the death bone.

250
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:23,900
Just as if it were so easy to shave your kneecaps in one breath, and then the very next lung-shocking breath to so deftly do that other thing that you used to do.

251
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,900
You said what I can't... I can't really remember what it was.

252
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,000
Just don't worry, he's only the beard.

253
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,740
Travel to any part of the universe without moving.

254
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:41,360
What you will notice is a temporal distension and also an increase in the size of the pubic area.

255
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,000
The number of brain cells affected is marginal if done correctly.

256
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,300
Oh!

257
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,460
Dave started to materialize just there.

258
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,940
Oh, did you see that, Chad?

259
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,980
I saw him for a second and he looked like a sleeping man on the floor.

260
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,980
He was like starting to nod off and he...

261
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,280
I can't... Am I...

262
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,280
I feel her body.

263
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,700
Oh, it's gross.

264
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,180
Get it away from me.

265
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,260
No, no, wait a minute.

266
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:14,840
Oh, okay.

267
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,660
God, wake up, Dave, wake up.

268
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,680
I can't really wake up.

269
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,300
You traveled through dream time and did bad things.

270
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,440
Okay, we got a little bit of a problem.

271
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,280
Come on, Dave.

272
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,980
Your body is there.

273
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:31,980
And although I can smile like an oily jackaniche, I can't really more or less wake up in a way that, you know, it looks like my mouth is moving there.

274
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:32,480
It's...

275
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,640
Quit drooling.

276
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,520
I'm stuck kind of like in this...

277
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,840
Here, let me try to wipe...

278
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,660
Ooh, my hand went...

279
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,480
I tried to wipe this face and my hand went right through it.

280
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,260
No, no, no, don't worry about the de novo jurisprudence monkeys.

281
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,080
Just keep on pushing down further and further until you get to the Versace pants.

282
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,120
I'll just get to the floor.

283
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:48,980
Huh?

284
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,620
It's gross.

285
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,380
You're gone.

286
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:50,940
Oh.

287
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,220
Oh, good.

288
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,480
You're just a voice now, Dave.

289
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:54,800
Yeah, but I'm still in here.

290
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,660
Okay, now I can't feel my body anywhere, you guys.

291
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,800
Huh?

292
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,040
I can feel my voice, but I can't feel my body anywhere.

293
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,620
You mean you're like in between the phone lines and the radio airways?

294
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,140
I don't know.

295
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,460
I'm stroking my fake beard.

296
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:05,940
I just...

297
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,900
I pulled out my plastic eye and it didn't...

298
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,940
I didn't feel a damn thing.

299
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,600
It's just like I'm just...

300
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,100
Tug on the beard.

301
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:14,780
Huh?

302
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,500
Oh, you can't feel yourself?

303
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,240
I cannot feel my physical acupuncture.

304
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:20,920
There's no acupuncture.

305
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:20,920


306
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:20,920


307
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:20,920


308
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:20,920


309
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,620
I'm just like, you know, sensations are...

310
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,180
But you're talking.

311
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,920
Of course I'm talking.

312
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,160
I can't even...

313
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,600
Well, can you feel your lips with your tongue if you're talking?

314
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,260
I mean, can you...

315
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:27,820
Oh, I see.

316
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,700
You're saying like take it back step by step?

317
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,540
Yeah, just start...

318
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:30,820
Yeah.

319
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,280
Okay, I'll have to make a sound first.

320
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,820
Or you could just strap on those big sticks on your feet and slide around in that snow.

321
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,260
Babe, you don't know how long I've been...

322
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,000
Long as to slap some big sticks on my feet and slide around, but I don't know if it's

323
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,360
gonna get me out of the monitor box.

324
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,480
At least as long as you know.

325
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,280
He doesn't have feet right now.

326
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:49,720
Right.

327
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,060
You're looking for...

328
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,820
He wishes.

329
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:50,900


330
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,820
He wishes he had feet.

331
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,720
The one which put the shoes to slide.

332
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,100
I got some like electron dots, some, you know, like photovoltaic things going on here.

333
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,040
Some, you know...

334
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,760
What can you see?

335
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,480
I cannot really see anything.

336
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,840
It's really a strange sensation.

337
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,040
It's just if I was looking, but all I am getting is like an impression of like this long tube

338
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,560
and this other like tube of light.

339
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,120
They're both like two tubes of light and they're like next to each other.

340
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,800
I'm in this larger one and there's this like smaller one and things are going through it

341
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,900
and then all around it's black.

342
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,800
But I can't really say, you know, describe it.

343
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,820
It's just like so proto and so, you know, so geometric.

344
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,920
You're talking.

345
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,940
Is there air?

346
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,380
Can you smell anything?

347
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,300
Well, maybe that would help if I skeet shot backwards with one of the big George Bush

348
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,720
balloon heads on myself, you know, or something.

349
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,600
But I don't know.

350
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,280
I could try it, you know, or something.

351
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,480
I could try something anyway.

352
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,200
Smell first.

353
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,020
Think later.

354
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,600
Can I feel your fingers?

355
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:52,600


356
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,020
My fingers?

357
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,100
Can you feel your fingers feeling your fingers?

358
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,300
That would be your fingers.

359
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,140
Sniff your fingers.

360
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,820
Your thumb though.

361
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,440
I have a sensation that I am sucking my thumb right now, so I must pull it.

362
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,140
Huh?

363
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,740
Pull my thumb.

364
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,280
Okay.

365
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,740
I'll try.

366
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,220
Wait a minute.

367
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,840
Let me, let me try and see if I can pull my tongue.

368
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,220
The center of the tongue.

369
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,480
Okay.

370
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,820
Now I feel another part of my body.

371
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,640
I pulled my thumb while I was sucking it.

372
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,140
Now I can feel another part of my body.

373
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,860
Does it itch back there?

374
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,360
Of course.

375
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,360
It feels like it's full of like these weird like little neuron hairs or something.

376
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,300
These little, little dendrites poking out like electronic things or something.

377
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,900
Follow the itch and the hairs back there back.

378
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:33,980
Okay.

379
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,260
I'll follow back.

380
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,340
If you want to come back.

381
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,840
Maybe you want to stay there on the edge.

382
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,420
Wait a minute.

383
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,900
I'm picking up another, it looks like it says muni light intake station.

384
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,480
What the hell does that mean?

385
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,220
And who's that woman with you?

386
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,520
I said what?

387
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,120
I said what?

388
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,460
There's a woman with you, Dave.

389
00:15:52,380 --> 00:16:03,380
She's got to be like an electronic woman because all I can see are like these like weird little electronic images that like kind of remind you of female, but they don't really look like any human woman I ever saw.

390
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:10,560
It's just like, you know, things that go by and they're like, they're like, they're looking at me like they're trying to stay, I don't know, hidden.

391
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,440
The spirits of the dead, perhaps, Dave?

392
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,300
I don't know.

393
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,800
I haven't offended the dead, have I?

394
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,380
Maybe.

395
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:18,860
I'm sorry.

396
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,360
Maybe you've joined the dead.

397
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,000
Maybe you have.

398
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,920
It's been 3,000 years since my last defection, but I can't remember.

399
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,540
Maybe you died inside your horse.

400
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,580
Maybe I died in there?

401
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:27,980
Shivering.

402
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:36,200
And maybe the horse, after the horse died and cooled down, you cooled down and while you were talking to us on that pay phone and maybe you've crossed over.

403
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,740
Okay, since all I can feel is my thumb sucking itself.

404
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,320
That's kind of like a proto-existence thing, right?

405
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,360
So if I go back to being in the horse's butt trying to stay warm, then that means that.

406
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,320
Or go the other way.

407
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,980
Maybe you'll come out of a new mama.

408
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,840
Maybe that's who that was that we just heard speaking.

409
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,060
What about those little air fish that everybody's seeing?

410
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,440
I've heard more and more sightings of air fish.

411
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,800
Well, I didn't see any while I was out there.

412
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,060
What the hell?

413
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,960
I just thought it was snow.

414
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,100
No, no, no.

415
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,660
People are seeing like, you know, they'll be walking around and like in the air around them, they'll see little like tropical fish.

416
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,060
Well, no wonder we are.

417
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,600
That's a hallucination.

418
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,880
That's a common hallucination in white outs.

419
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,760
Yeah, no, no, but.

420
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,640
That's part of it.

421
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,940
He's on the first bardo, the air fish on the first.

422
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,140
That's the first thing you see when.

423
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,120
We must help to lead.

424
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,600
When the snow.

425
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,960
To help Dave cross over.

426
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,560
Yeah.

427
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,260
To the second bardo.

428
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,500
Those are snow fairies, bleepo.

429
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,080
Snow fairies?

430
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,580
Yeah.

431
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,920
I've seen snow fairies out of a horse's arse?

432
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,540
Come on, man.

433
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,560
That doesn't make any sense.

434
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,320
But what does.

435
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,860
Okay, what does ginger beer mean?

436
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,940
Oh, ginger beer.

437
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,500
I don't know what ginger beer means.

438
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,760
I don't know if it has a meaning.

439
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,320
I think it has more like a psychic reference point.

440
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:45,580
What?

441
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,620
What do fluids mean?

442
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,900
Fluids don't have a meaning.

443
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,700
They have like more of a psychic reference point.

444
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,840
I have to keep repeating myself, but like, okay, you think of a fluid.

445
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,220
What's the first thing it relates to a feeling, doesn't it?

446
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,900
Air fish.

447
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,540
There's another feeling that just like drifted in and drifted out.

448
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:03,960
No, but I'm serious.

449
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,440
I don't think it's ever going to get me out of here.

450
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,820
You know, if you think of fluids and feelings, then you have air fish because, you know,

451
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,200
fish are like swimming through like the emotions, you know?

452
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,480
But are they lethal or predatory?

453
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:15,620
I don't know.

454
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:15,620


455
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:15,620


456
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:15,620


457
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:15,620


458
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:15,620


459
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:15,620


460
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:15,620


461
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,400
I don't know.

462
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,680
I put all my scrotal essences in phony cyber stocks.

463
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,260
I was going to say, I got the bottle.

464
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,960
You sent me the bottle and I've been able to do all kinds of things with that.

465
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,440
Well, see, I was a failure.

466
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,940
No, no, no, but it worked.

467
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,720
You sent me the bottle of your essence and I'm telling you that it worked here.

468
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,040
Well, why doesn't my essence work for me and why doesn't anybody else's work for me?

469
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,400
Well, the thing is, you're probably just like, I don't know.

470
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,160
Well, I don't know.

471
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,580
Do you boil it down?

472
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:45,600


473
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:45,600


474
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:45,600


475
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:45,600


476
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:45,600


477
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:45,600


478
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:45,600


479
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:45,600


480
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:45,600


481
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,560
Do you boil it down before you use it?

482
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,300
Well, yeah, but I was hoping you weren't going to say I'm unessential, if you know what I

483
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:50,420
mean.

484
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:50,700
Do you use the cheese cloth?

485
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:56,260
Do you like double strain it through the cheese cloth and do the thing with the clay and the

486
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,860
candles and the little, you know, the little onanistic ritual and the, and the, and the

487
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,520
wall with the clay and everything?

488
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,040
See, those directions were so confusing.

489
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,300
I didn't know how to make the clothes out of a piece of cheese.

490
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,400
And I assumed that was in other words, alchemy jokes you guys were playing on me, right?

491
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,600
But I kept the cheese and I kept the...

492
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,940
I'm not saying, I'm not saying, I'm not going to say whether it was, but go on.

493
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,400
Well, isn't anybody going to give me kind of illumination of some kind?

494
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,140
I mean, what am I just like sitting here like Rudolph the Red?

495
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,920
Dave, you had your chance at illumination when you were on the first Bardo and were

496
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,720
able to, had the opportunity to cross over to the second, but instead you listened to

497
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,920
the babbling devil and now you've gone back to the negative first Bardo.

498
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,580
Which is why that cheese is so effective.

499
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:45,580


500
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,560
It's getting colder, isn't it?

501
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,260
Yeah.

502
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,980
It's getting oilier too, just like that cheese.

503
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,600
You're going down, down, down, down.

504
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,320
I can feel my wisdom eye teeth draining themselves like a little, a little thing like one of

505
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,400
those little radio tubes.

506
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,040
It's too small, it's like a little crystal now.

507
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,420
Going down, sir.

508
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,560
But first the word go for F-ing.

509
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,480
Want to take this out down in paradise?

510
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,980
Which paradise?

511
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,480
Mars?

512
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,580


513
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,580


514
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,580


515
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,580


516
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,580


517
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,580


518
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,580


519
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,580


520
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,580


521
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,580


522
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,580


523
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,580


524
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,580


525
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:15,580


526
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,320
Brushwood?

527
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:16,900
Amsterdam?

528
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,940
Or Black Rock City?

529
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,400
Palm trees, white sand, clear blue water.

530
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,100
At least not the kind of name I want to raise its children to know.

531
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,560
Dave, that would be like some insane author who's made a big lot of money and he's down

532
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,360
there bothering the people who just want to hang out on the beach.

533
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,060
We're in Papua New Guinea or someplace?

534
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:34,560
Yeah.

535
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,680
Like if you were to become a prize-selling author like Stang.

536
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,920
Hey you New Guinea Papas, how about you read Book of Subgenius?

537
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,360
We write big books, make big money.

538
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:44,800
Yeah, yeah.

539
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,700
You have to talk pig Latin like,

540
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,020
We make love long time.

541
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,500
If me gay that, uh, okina kate.

542
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:51,540


543
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,220
Bob love you, sell Bob book.

544
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,760
And then the ceremonies begin.

545
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:03,480
As Stang is about to learn his first lesson in the Cathedral of Sax.

546
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,680
Why, certainly I'd like to undergo your strange rituals here on this island, uh, folks.

547
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,120
What just you got me?

548
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,660
Let us wash your feet.

549
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,740
Ritual circumcision?

550
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,540
This costume's so ugly.

551
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,640
Wait just a minute.

552
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,640
You can circumcise a couple of them, I guess, sure.

553
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,760
Yeah, you can circumcise a couple, but you can't circumcise them all.

554
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:37,760
And so Stang was cut by the medicine man while the dancing girls tiraded around in order to, uh, help accelerate the process.

555
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,020
Now what the hell was that confabulation?

556
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,400
Was that a kind of congruent movement or?

557
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,780
Well, it's kind of hard to find.

558
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,780
It's hard to find the skin when it's like a cluster, like a, a, a cab of kale.

559
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:56,640
Have you ever lit your skin, pour oil by pinching your skin and then you hold a lighter close much the way you'd light an orange on fire.

560
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,520
And it makes something.

561
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,140
When you, when you hold a light, when you pinch a bit of your skin.

562
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,380
Yeah, it's like an old hippie trick, you know, like the first time you ever got high on having a frappe.

563
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,500
Yeah, and from your elbow, it'll burn kind of greenish oil.

564
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,060
Right, it's more like that.

565
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,640
And from your knee, it burns like kind of purplish.

566
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,960
Yeah, it's more like transmission oil coming out of your elbow.

567
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,300
From your forehead.

568
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,880
From your forehead, it's kind of a yellowish glow.

569
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,080
Yeah, but it does, it looks like castor oil or something.

570
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,260
Very, very piggy incentive.

571
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,160
I bet a lot of people didn't know you could do that.

572
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,120
And there's a big scab afterwards and you get an infection and.

573
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,880
Well, not always, you know.

574
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,420
Down by the old lake, we pulled the canoe up and walked inside.

575
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,820
The band was playing already.

576
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,640
We waited a little bit too long out in the canoe.

577
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:42,220
We got our bottle of hoochie and went inside and the whole gang was there.

578
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:49,440
Tinas Wang, Cloris Leperitis and Betty Clitoris were all standing around in a circle,

579
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,140
laughing at the misshapen-headed boy.

580
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,420
We had so much fun with him.

581
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,060
His head was so big.

582
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,180
Little did I know he'd become the head of the Republican National Committee.

583
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:07,940
Oh, honey, I hope you like what's been going on so far, if you know what I mean.

584
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,740
I can't get enough of it.

585
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,280
Just put your head right over here.

586
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,680
Whoa!

587
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,180
Hey, it's gonna be sunny tomorrow.

588
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,240
Sunny and bright.

589
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,500
Everything's gonna be just fine.

590
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,060
Would you like to dance?

591
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,920
I've got some Crisco oil.

592
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,360
Oh, don't mind if I do, dear.

593
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,840
Let's get down and slather, baby.

594
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,980
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

595
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,800
It's so romantic.

596
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,480
Well, the band played on for hours and hours and Bob and Connie got closer and closer.

597
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,920
It wasn't much of a matter of time before Bob and Connie decided to walk out in the woods after him.

598
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,480
Still here, the muted strains of the band in the background.

599
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,680
Now the lapping of the lake was much stronger.

600
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:58,500
And in Bob's mind, the lapping of the water on the sand was a reminder, a reminder.

601
00:23:59,360 --> 00:23:59,960
Ah!

602
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,620
Ah, yes, loiterers and Germans, that's the first installment.

603
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,900
And you can get an installment every week of this show.

604
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,760
Thickening, perhaps even a curtailment of your normal activitudes.

605
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:22,260
Just by sending a skip love bracelet and a lack of interest to Tricky and the Preeminence.

606
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,220
And also, this week only, you're gonna get them all absolutely for free.

607
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,900
That's only a 3.9 lack of interest this month until January 1st.

608
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,180
Sha-la-la.

609
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,620
Many, many, many, many, many, many miles.

610
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,920
As we return to Lake Winnicott,

611
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,940
we see Bob's long proboscis,

612
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,640
the phallus of a frightened dog,

613
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,540
entering the safe harbor of Connie's womanhood.

614
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,980
And here's my final question before I go, because the spaceship is taking off in a minute here.

615
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,820
How can I get tapes of this show? How can I tune in?

616
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,040
Well, you hear a lot of it on the computer.

617
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,460
You're on the internet.

618
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,300
We're on the internet in many different ways.

619
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,040
www.wcsb.org

620
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,020
.org, I like that word, org.

621
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,700
Yeah.

622
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:20,880
Right.

623
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,500
That's a good word.

624
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,340
And then you just click on the, uh, audioactive thing, and if you don't have it, download it.

625
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,620
And, uh, do what you have to do.

626
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:36,320
You can hear excerpts from the show, uh, any time of day or night on www.subgenius.com.

627
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,380
Now, that I, that I have done. That I have done.

628
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,360
I have streamed in MP3 as well as real audio.

629
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:41,880
That is good stuff.

630
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,500
Praise David Botner, the greatest Canadian who was ever born.

631
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,540
But there were plenty of Canadians before him who starved to death in the snow.

632
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:56,460
For it is he who made the MP3 broadcasts of Swamp Radio and Hour of Slack possible.

633
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,500
You know, it's good when you're back there, gotta get out, you know where it is.

634
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,360
You know nothing of these wet, gotta be black.

635
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:02,620
Alright.

636
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,700
No.

637
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,180
No.

638
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,800
The change is coming.

639
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:08,800


640
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,920
The change is coming, Dr. Spanx.

641
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,980
Wake up, Dr. Spanx.

642
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,240
Look up my nightie.

643
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,360
Look, look, look, look.

644
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,100
Look what I've got.

645
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,820
Isn't it pink?

646
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,140
Wait, hey, am I still in Dobstown?

647
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:19,900
I bet you've never seen me.

648
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,680
Yes.

649
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,180
It looks all...

650
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,500
It's, it's some...

651
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,200
It is Dobstown.

652
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,580
Don't worry.

653
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,880
It's so slackful now.

654
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,900
Oh, just, just lay back down.

655
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,860
It's so filmy and downy and slidey and...

656
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,200
Look out the suit, the suit stained window.

657
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:35,740
It's latched.

658
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:35,740


659
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,340
Flowing and...

660
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,040
Look at the smokestacks rising.

661
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,040
Sir, sir.

662
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,400
Look at the smoke descending into the heavens off an horizon.

663
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,380
And those beautiful singers.

664
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,820
The swirling of the leaves around your ears.

665
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,600
Flying winged pipes.

666
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,140
This is how I envision Dobstown.

667
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,240
Yes, your exotic pants.

668
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,360
Tell me I'm not hypnotized or something, Doc.

669
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,600
Look at those capri pants.

670
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,000
Oh, man, I feel, I don't feel like my old self anymore.

671
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,980
I feel like, like, like a new man.

672
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,300
You staying?

673
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,320
A new, a new man.

674
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,320


675
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,320


676
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,320


677
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,320


678
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,320


679
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,320


680
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,320


681
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,320


682
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,320


683
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,320


684
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,320


685
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,320


686
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,320


687
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,340
Dave.

688
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,500
Get your hand out of my pants, man.

689
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,480
It's freezing out here.

690
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,500
Dave, what are you...

691
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,460
Oh, God.

692
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:14,860
Hey, man.

693
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,520
Dave.

694
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,780
Oh, damn it, Dave.

695
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,800
You think you're taking a nap?

696
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,000
I thought you froze today, man.

697
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,280
I was cruising, man.

698
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,800
I was in the zone.

699
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,120
No.

700
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,220
Hey, Chaz, Chaz, slap his...

701
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,540
You just brought me down.

702
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:24,760
I'm gonna...

703
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,800
Check his pulse, Chaz.

704
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,060
...least another five minutes out of that temper, Dex, you bastard.

705
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,340
He's talking pretty fast.

706
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,720
Man, you were almost there, bro.

707
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:33,960
God, it's freezing.

708
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,320
I was, it was like I was in Dobstown and I had a chance to get out of that temper,

709
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,320


710
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,320


711
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,020
and he's full slack to miss him.

712
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,380
No, man.

713
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:44,460
And it was like there was still a church at St. Eustace, and the new year and the new

714
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,280
world were all real, and it wasn't still this old.

715
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,740
You passed over, man.

716
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,420
Oh, the world...

717
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,400
We thought you was dead.

718
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,500
You were asleep there in the back seat and there was so much carbon monoxide, and the

719
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,920
snowbank was up so high we...

720
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,580
Man, it's freezing.

721
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,340
Well, we had to dig you out.

722
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,180
It took almost like...

723
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,860
Man, my hands are still freezing.

724
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,840
You got a coffee over there?

725
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,360
Hey.

726
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:05,700
Now, this is crazy.

727
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,080
This is crazy.

728
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,440
Did you hear about the sun activity, too?

729
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,460
The sun is going through a total peak time right now.

730
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,600
Yeah, George Jr. is really...

731
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,320
He's as popular as the father was.

732
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,340
But it is.

733
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,920
There's a website.

734
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,000
There's a lot I've heard.

735
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,020
There's a website.

736
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,080
They're more like little pubescent rockets than flares.

737
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,680
It's a really cool website, too.

738
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,180
That's all about it.

739
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:40,620
You can get a real-time sun screensaver now.

740
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,020
I waited long enough for this.

741
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,800
You used to put up four or five different pictures of the sun.

742
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,800
I should have sent it to you.

743
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,940
We quit doing that because it was so disturbing.

744
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:54,600
It appeared that huge, gigantic shotguns were blasting away at the sun about half the time.

745
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:01,640
I think those were Masonic subliminals from the Masonics who are running the NASA corporations.

746
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,060
Wait a minute.

747
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,160
The engine that...

748
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:08,600
Creates all warmth for the whole solar system is having a little trouble right now, did you say?

749
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,340
Supposedly.

750
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,900
It's more than a little trouble.

751
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,580
Now, could this possibly be the coming of prophecy?

752
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,660
Of all the prophecies of every primitive...

753
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:25,860
It's a rich form of frothy tabulency when your mom and dad and everyone who you don't even know is going to want to...

754
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,180
The prophecies of the homies.

755
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,720
Of the Aztecs.

756
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,400
The Incas and the Subgenii.

757
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,060
Like a bird in the sky.

758
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,160
Like a bird in the sky.

759
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,160


760
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,160


761
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,160


762
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,480
Like a little little lantern.

763
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,320
That all things, that the great carpet of reality would be rolled up...

764
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,760
So smooth and soft.

765
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:49,220
Taken outside, hung over a tree limb and batted by a gigantic old hag with a broom standing on the back of an infinite number of turtles.

766
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,020
And that she would spray it with an anti-lice sort of lotion potion.

767
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,740
Right.

768
00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:00,660
And then it would be rolled, laid back down and all things would begin anew in the new age.

769
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,380
Or the new...

770
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,780
Oh, I forget the...

771
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,220
Well, how about...

772
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,400
The new Navajo Trail.

773
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,640
The new Navajo Trail?

774
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,020
The new Navajo Trail.

775
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,440
And the Church of the Subgenius...

776
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,680
That leads off into the cosmos.

777
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:18,140
These silly primitive superstitions are understood in a scientific way as the time intersection,

778
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:25,520
which will happen when the great Mobius strip or infinity sign that is the road of time...

779
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,920
It has to cross in the middle, right?

780
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,420
Well, we're nearing that crossover point.

781
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,120
See, I can refuse that.

782
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,140
I want to set up a little deli.

783
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,440
Right there at that crossroad.

784
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,640
Chad Spankengold.

785
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,380
A little general story.

786
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:44,260
It's like, well, I think the exes are kind of wondering what the hell's going to happen when the time intersection occurs.

787
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,320
Listener.

788
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,100
What are you doing about it?

789
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,600
Are you ready?

790
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,700
You was ready for it.

791
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,620
Hey, hey.

792
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,200
Stop playing with the machine.

793
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:52,880
Hey.

794
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,720
Over and out.

795
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,160
Their froth was stored up for Y2K.

796
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,880
Now, they're not worried about nothing.

797
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,000
They ain't worried about X-Day.

798
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,460
Ain't worried about time intersection.

799
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,800
Ain't worried about divine rupture.

800
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,140
Ain't worried about...

801
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,140


802
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,140


803
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,960
They don't care about nothing.

804
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,620
About time.

805
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,160
They're going to get drunk and party.

806
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,500
Why should it?

807
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,540
And how can it?

808
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,180
They're just going to get drunk.

809
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:11,800
Softly.

810
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,600
Softly.

811
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,820
RG by radio.

812
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,920
You think you're going to go out there and get drunk?

813
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,120
I know you.

814
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,960
I don't want you up for my beer.

815
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,160
Well, what do you know?

816
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
That don't cut no ice with me.

817
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,780
Speaking of ice cutters.

818
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,720
I don't hear that far address.

819
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,420
Do you remember the time Jack and I were out?

820
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,080
I mean, we were so far.

821
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,320
Damn far out there.

822
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,360
That when we dug the hole, you know, and stuck...

823
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,880
Squid gigging?

824
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,660
We were squid gigging.

825
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,420
And we stuck the little shack over the top of the little hole in the ice, you know.

826
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,140
And we're sitting there popping back a few beer, you know.

827
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,500
And I guess one guy...

828
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:53,020
This guy, you know, he's talking about Mario Lemieux and all this hockey crap all night.

829
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,860
And I said, I don't like hockey, you know.

830
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,740
So, I pulled this little like harpoon device I got.

831
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,260
You know, it's about four and a half inches long.

832
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,440
You get it from K-Telronco.

833
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,980
Any of them guys, you can order away for it.

834
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,140
And I said, I don't like hockey.

835
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,140


836
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,140


837
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,140


838
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:08,400
And he shoved it right into his thigh and ripped those, you know, those real thick muscles near the top of his knee, you know.

839
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,740
You're a prankster, Dave.

840
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,680
I tell you, we had a good laugh after that.

841
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,200
We had years and years of stories about that.

842
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,600
And I guess, well, it got him a little railed up, you know.

843
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,540
So, did he kill you then now, Dave?

844
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,600
I think I know where the nano-aliens live.

845
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,120
What do you think of me?

846
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,640
Why, they're the leprechauns of Celtic legend.

847
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,760
They're the wee folk?

848
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,960
Pink penises.

849
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,320
Red hearts and purple...

850
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,480
The Dave brains.

851
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,360
Brains.

852
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,240
I see, I see.

853
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,200
Frolicking over the hillside of the Emerald Isle.

854
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,360
Emerald Palace.

855
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,360
Emerald City.

856
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,780
Emerald Mushrooms.

857
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,120
That dirty, perky, sharkaback, black-bucked-a-burton,

858
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,880
important, fill-up-bucked-a-burton,

859
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,960
perkaluma-burton-bucked-a-burton,

860
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,980
don't you watch that.

861
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,180
But think...

862
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,420
Think if you could go back in time, Dave.

863
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,540
I am what I am right now.

864
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,040
I'm just wishing I hadn't come tonight.

865
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,800
Because I...

866
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,760
Because you did come back in time to get here?

867
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,640
Well, yeah.

868
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,740
Because I'm...

869
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,580
Well, I'd have to be here already now,

870
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,840
or else this part wouldn't make sense.

871
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,540
The rest of it...

872
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,520
But I'm already full of oblique little passages of time

873
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,300
that don't make no sense.

874
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,140
How about yourself?

875
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,060
I...

876
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,160
If I could...

877
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,580
If...

878
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,160
If time control,

879
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,560
as...

880
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,040
As prophesied by Dobbs,

881
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,320
were ours now,

882
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,220
what would...

883
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,880
What would one do with such a power?

884
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,280
If you could go back in time,

885
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,000
would you...

886
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Go back in time, for instance,

887
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,420
and kill Hitler

888
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,280
to prevent terror,

889
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,320
or...

890
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,440
Or kiss Hitler to prevent...

891
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:39,860
Or kiss...

892
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,700
Right, to make him...

893
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,780
Because some people said, you know,

894
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,900
Ava Brown was just like his front

895
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,660
because he didn't have a girlfriend

896
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,880
to hang out with Berkscott.

897
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,900
He'd rather be hanging out with Goring or Himmler.

898
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:49,920
Really?

899
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,780
Yeah, they said...

900
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,220
Oh, that...

901
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,000
Well, you know, he has a lot of enemies.

902
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,620
The old frustrated rage thing, you know,

903
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,440
like he must be wanting to be with boys.

904
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,340
You know how he used to kiss those Hitler youth,

905
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,980
those young men on the cheek, you know,

906
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,060
these 12-year-old boys?

907
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,780
Well, so did I.

908
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:02,980
So did I.

909
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,940
I saw you do it, too, David.

910
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,280
I was forced to.

911
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,400
I was forced to.

912
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,580
I was a political dissident,

913
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,200
and that was one of the jobs they made us do

914
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,140
besides ripping the clothes off the stiffs.

915
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,200
We'd help gas the stiffs,

916
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,000
pull their clothes off,

917
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,820
and then we'd have to go and kiss the Hitler youth boys.

918
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,240
And believe me,

919
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,500
that was not hell.

920
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,080
Well, would you go back in time?

921
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,520
Would you dare to change history?

922
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,060
Because say you did kill or kiss Hitler,

923
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,040
maybe the world would be a much better place

924
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,920
for lots of people,

925
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,620
but perhaps,

926
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,160
Hitler was the man who also killed

927
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,140
the one who would have been worse than Hitler,

928
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,860
the one who would have won.

929
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,000
What if Hitler, at some point in his career,

930
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,800
was indirectly or directly responsible

931
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,020
for killing someone else

932
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,800
who might, in fact, have destroyed the entire world?

933
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,060
How could you have had someone...

934
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,240
But Hitler was going to go for it.

935
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,920
Would you play God?

936
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,720
If you could go back in time,

937
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,740
would you play God?

938
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,960
I would probably play God,

939
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,460
or I would play Henry VIII.

940
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,560
What if you could turn back the clock,

941
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,780
even on Earth,

942
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,420
and start over again?

943
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,260
You know, would the same things happen?

944
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,120
Wouldn't you go back in time and kill Hitler,

945
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,920
even though he might be the very one

946
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,700
who killed the man who would destroy the entire world?

947
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,720
No, the first lizard.

948
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,940
No, say you could go back in time.

949
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,340
Okay, I would risk.

950
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,100
I would go back in time.

951
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,960
Say you could go back in time

952
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,780
to when the first lizard evolved.

953
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,380
Kissed Hitler.

954
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,360
Kissed Hitler.

955
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,680
Because we're really evolved from the lizards, right?

956
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,320
Okay, we're still...

957
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,740
So you kill the first lizard,

958
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,300
and it's some other form of life that comes out.

959
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,940
Not a lizard.

960
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,280
Not specifically...

961
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,000
Maybe a polyp.

962
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,280
Not specifically a lizard.

963
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,480
Maybe a polyp.

964
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,020
Perhaps an insect-based intelligent life.

965
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,240
Polyps come out sometimes.

966
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,840
A hybrid, a Friday John.

967
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,660
Okay, say our polyps were evolving

968
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,800
at a rate that was so rapidly fast

969
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,160
that we could not control it.

970
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,100
Would you go back,

971
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,640
as in a Hitler suit,

972
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,320
like one of those first characters,

973
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,160
a one-shell creature,

974
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,500
start your own jail,

975
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,120
and kill the polyps?

976
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,180
Would you step up?

977
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,420
On that butterfly

978
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,660
to make everything be spelled wrong

979
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,560
10, 60 million years later?

980
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,920
And you, as Americans...

981
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,120
Would you do it?

982
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,220
Brace yourselves together

983
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,960
with these mighty hernia braces

984
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,100
designed by my cousin Lou and I.

985
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,820
Would you play Frisbee with God?

986
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,180
Stand firmly and fastly

987
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,080
in front of the rest of your renegade crew

988
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,460
and laugh like dogs

989
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,000
until the cows return.

990
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:28,500


991
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:28,560


992
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,500
Even fish do it.

993
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,180
But what do they do?

994
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,420
In today's modern world,

995
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,280
in the year 2006,

996
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,360
fish not only do it,

997
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,780
they do it in style

998
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,340
at the downtown arena

999
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,980
for moms and dads and kids alike.

1000
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,900
In the water that you drink.

1001
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,860
It's done regularly

1002
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,360
in the water you're drinking right now.

1003
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,140
So sit back, plop a nice cube,

1004
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,120
and put those feet up on the schizolone.

1005
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,200
It's time for the...

1006
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:01,940
Sponge Patrol.

1007
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,720
The fish are doing it, huh?

1008
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,540
I don't like to watch the fish do it.

1009
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,360
The fish doing it reminds me of Bob

1010
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,420
in his more recalcitrant,

1011
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,000
more flaccid days.

1012
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,380
Oh, I remember Bob and Connie

1013
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,780
on Valentine's Day.

1014
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,420
The little bat-winged hearts,

1015
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,180
you could almost see them,

1016
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,640
well, psychics could see them

1017
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,520
flying between Bob and Connie

1018
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,580
as they walked on the...

1019
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,980
sidewalk hand in hand.

1020
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,760
I could hear, uh...

1021
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,680
Pantsless and panties and skirts.

1022
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,380
Ah, the boat's going up and down the Seine.

1023
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,560
You can hear the singing of the boat guys.

1024
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,360
Bob with his funny little beret

1025
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,580
cocked on the side of his...

1026
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,400
Ah, look, he's wearing a funny little shirt

1027
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,480
with a nipple cut out

1028
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,780
so he can drink the wine

1029
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,380
and let it fall where it may, huh?

1030
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,240
No.

1031
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,480
You know what I'm trying to do.

1032
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,400
Or shopping for butt plugs.

1033
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,740
A lonely sacre de mer.

1034
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,540
Ah, le sacre de mer.

1035
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,320
Let's go over to Montparnasse

1036
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,800
and see if we can find those...

1037
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,820
green butt plugs with his sequins.

1038
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,160
They're so hard to find.

1039
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,820
Yes, and we shall commit some paintings

1040
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,740
and some artwork.

1041
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:08,960
Ah, we will commit...

1042
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,660
And we will go to see Jerry Lewis movies.

1043
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,700
Ah, the Jerry Lewis movies.

1044
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,380
And we'll listen to Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1045
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,380
He also is a genius.

1046
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,100
Oh, yes.

1047
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,940
Oh, I love Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1048
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,100
True American stupidity, huh?

1049
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,560
Oh, what an idiot.

1050
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,700
The Americans could be so brilliantly stupid.

1051
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,160
I listen to the audition all the time

1052
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,920
and believe me,

1053
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,260
for my limited anglais,

1054
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,600
I can tell you these people

1055
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,780
have no idea what they're doing.

1056
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:30,780


1057
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,380
They're talking about

1058
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,760
what makes them so funny.

1059
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,080
Oh, la, la.

1060
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,300
More truffles?

1061
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,280
Ah, hey, now.

1062
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:35,340
David?

1063
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,200
Let's stop down by the river

1064
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,160
and have our feet crushed

1065
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,640
and sing a morality song

1066
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,800
from the Middle Ages, eh?

1067
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,040
Oh, la, la.

1068
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,100
Ah, I remember those days well.

1069
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,120
I remember when the...

1070
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,800
the Saracens attacked the city.

1071
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,040
Oh, I'm sorry.

1072
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,200
I'm going to flap my fingers.

1073
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,440
I'm going to flap my fingers.

1074
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,040
I'm going to flap my fingers.

1075
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,580
I'm going to flap my fingers.

1076
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,240
I'm going to flap my fingers.

1077
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,360
Are you ready, Sia?

1078
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,980
Oh, oh, oh.

1079
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,440
Sit down and stop yourself.

1080
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,600
Sorry, I was wool-gathering.

1081
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,720
The virtual moment is almost expired.

1082
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,500
I wonder if you want more time.

1083
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,160
Oh, yes, please.

1084
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,760
One thing, waiter.

1085
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,120
What country is this?

1086
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,860
Well, the current time

1087
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,800
with the checkpoint and also...

1088
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,940
That's the other thing.

1089
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,740
What time do you have?

1090
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,620
And what day, by the way?

1091
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,660
Well...

1092
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,940
I'm afraid I have to make

1093
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,780
a terrible mistake.

1094
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:30,780


1095
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:30,780


1096
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:30,780


1097
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:30,780


1098
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:30,780


1099
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:30,780


1100
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:30,780


1101
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:30,780


1102
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,920
I'm afraid I have to make

1103
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,400
a terrible mistake.

1104
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:32,980
I'm afraid I have to make

1105
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:32,980


1106
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:32,980


1107
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:32,980


1108
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:32,980


1109
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:32,980


1110
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,240
I don't recognize those cars.

1111
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,000
What year car is that new one

1112
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,140
over there, waiter?

1113
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,800
Is, uh...

1114
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,460
It's a brand-new 1934 Escalade.

1115
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,500
Oh, uh...

1116
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,360
See, the show must go on.

1117
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,700
Brand-new, eh?

1118
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,400
Oh, man.

1119
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,820
Time control.

1120
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,480
It was just like the old man said.

1121
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,160
Time control must always go awry.

1122
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,740
I was a fool.

1123
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,740
I was a fool to follow Bob

1124
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,160
and his insane plans.

1125
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,580
He was like a madman

1126
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,880
throwing these glass beakers

1127
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,660
and his Tesla coils

1128
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,720
back across the laboratory

1129
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,540
in a rage,

1130
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,480
trying to bring life to the battery.

1131
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,200
Then finally, he got it plugged in.

1132
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,040
Then...

1133
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,320
Oh, my God, man.

1134
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,180
I thought he...

1135
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,440
I thought that surely he was just

1136
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,680
a crackpot, a kook, a madman.

1137
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,200
A madman.

1138
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,580
But yet...

1139
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,140
Here, I find myself in 1934.

1140
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,540
Some little town in France, I guess it is.

1141
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,180
Ah, whistle while you work, monsieur.

1142
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,560
I spill the wine in my forehead

1143
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,100
all over my lady's lap

1144
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,220
and all over your forehead.

1145
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,040
What is that in your forehead?

1146
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,320
Oh, what?

1147
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,840
Oh, my God.

1148
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,180
It's a little clock.

1149
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,100
Ah, a bigger mess.

1150
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,600
This is wonderful.

1151
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,420
Wait a minute.

1152
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,140
Let me look at this mirror over here.

1153
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,520
Wait a minute.

1154
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,440
The clock is...

1155
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,260
It looks...

1156
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,960
Why does it...

1157
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,880
No, it looks right in the mirror,

1158
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,360
which means it must be installed in my head

1159
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,000
backwards so that it will look right in a mirror.

1160
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,160
What have they done?

1161
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,680
What did Bob do to me?

1162
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,200
Bob did nothing to you, my friend.

1163
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,000
He put this stupid clock into my forehead.

1164
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,400
Just relax, monsieur.

1165
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,160
Everyone has this stupid clock in their forehead.

1166
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,340
What kind of a...

1167
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:29,660
What?

1168
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,240
What?

1169
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:30,360
What?

1170
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:30,780


1171
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:30,780


1172
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:30,780


1173
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:30,780


1174
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:30,780


1175
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:30,780


1176
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,340
What kind of insurance?

1177
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,220
It's supposed to be a show!

1178
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,480
It's not a show.

1179
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,600
It's supposed to be a show!

1180
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,480
Miss, I am afraid you have used up your entire virtual moment.

1181
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,240
Please get out of the...

1182
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:40,320
Bob was like a pornographer on the internet.

1183
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,000
And he said, go over there and push the button.

1184
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,520
Next!

1185
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,640
And I pushed the button and then...

1186
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,400
Next, monsieur.

1187
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,300
I'm sorry.

1188
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,080
Your virtual moment is over.

1189
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,520
No!

1190
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:48,840
No!

1191
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,400
No!

1192
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,380
No!

1193
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,120
No!

1194
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:51,960
No!

1195
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,260
No!

1196
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:52,580
No!

1197
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,060
No!

1198
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,140


1199
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,140


1200
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:53,760


1201
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:53,760


1202
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:53,760


1203
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:53,760


1204
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:53,760


1205
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:53,760


1206
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:53,760


1207
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:53,760


1208
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:55,720
No!

1209
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,000
No!

1210
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,520
No!

1211
00:41:59,680 --> 00:41:59,680


1212
00:41:59,700 --> 00:41:59,760
No!

1213
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,300
No!

1214
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,420
Leg-gator bend over that trapeze.

1215
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,320
Flippin' and flappin' it in the air like a dark-headed Cochise woman.

1216
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,800
Yes, uh...

1217
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,260
No, I think, uh...

1218
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:09,660
Wait.

1219
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,920
There's the ellipse.

1220
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,720
It's come back again.

1221
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,060
Yes.

1222
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,940
And now my forehead is back to its usual shape and size.

1223
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,720
And so is yours out there.

1224
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,900
Everything has resumed to normal.

1225
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,960
Ah, feels better, doesn't it?

1226
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,260
It's slack.

1227
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,140
Strap ourselves back in.

1228
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,300
That's what we call slack.

1229
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,560
That's the problem when you unbuckle your...

1230
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,140
Just let your...

1231
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,280
Unbuckle your...

1232
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,280


1233
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,280


1234
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,280


1235
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,280


1236
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:30,600
Seatbelt.

1237
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,960
Forehead cave right in.

1238
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,420
Just deflate, baby.

1239
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,940
What would be better than...

1240
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,120
You've been tight.

1241
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,220
You've been inflated.

1242
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,260
You rose earlier.

1243
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,080
Now it's time to just flop, baby.

1244
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,600
Just...

1245
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,560
Just...

1246
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,140
Let it all out.

1247
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:53,120
Every brain cell, let it melt, melt, melt down into a little puddle of gray matter soup.

1248
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,220
Gray matter soup.

1249
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,300
Gray matter soup.

1250
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,420
Gray matter soup.

1251
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:56,860
Gray matter soup.

1252
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,540
Bend over.

1253
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:05,140
Bend over, human, and let us help.

1254
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,880
And get ready for cultural warfare.

1255
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,980
We're coming to your town.

1256
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,540
Jesus is coming to your town.

1257
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,380
We're the colonial purpose.

1258
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,000
Get down on your knees and cry.

1259
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,060
We're just here to help.

1260
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,440
Praise Jesus.

1261
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,240
Praise Jesus.

1262
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:25,860
And now...

1263
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:29,520
And to help you better, we must destroy you.

1264
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,640
To save the town, we had to destroy it.

1265
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,820
To save democracy, we had to destroy it.

1266
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:40,060
To save the world, we must destroy it.

1267
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:40,700
Destroy!

1268
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,480
One, two, destroy!

1269
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:44,920
And die.

1270
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,940
Hey, man, why don't you save the world?

1271
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,960
Why don't you save me a little piece, you know?

1272
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,980
And then you can, like, blow up the rest and let me have some fun.

1273
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,740
To carve up...

1274
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,540
A world.

1275
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,140
To carve a worm.

1276
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,100
To carve a worm as neatly as one might carve a stick of boater.

1277
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,660
To carve up a world between the corporations.

1278
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,720
Which means between my friends.

1279
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,700
And my friends' friends.

1280
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,660
And here they are at the Monaco Parlor Ballroom.

1281
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,800
This is a very exclusive place.

1282
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:23,720
There's this builder.

1283
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,660
Inhabited and frequented by...

1284
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,360
Only the one percent of the one percent.

1285
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,700
There's Mrs. Rockefeller.

1286
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,320
Oh, there's Mr. J.

1287
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,420
Oh, look, his skin cancer's much better now.

1288
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,720
Look, there's Mr. Morgan.

1289
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,100
He's getting on in years.

1290
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,540
Yeah, he's still got that terrible club foot, though.

1291
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,340
But he'll be fine.

1292
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,640
He's got more money than I need.

1293
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,780
Oh, there's the Anheuser-Busch's.

1294
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,840
I think we have one of the business underneath the Bushes.

1295
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,500
There he is.

1296
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,280
He's by the curtain.

1297
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,520
He's hiding in the Anheuser-Busch.

1298
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:53,780
Sir.

1299
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,500
Don't let him...

1300
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,220
Get out of the way!

1301
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,740
I get tired of people telling me that they're tripping all the time when it's so obvious.

1302
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,820
Their faces have changed.

1303
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,700
Like, blue and red things are coming out.

1304
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,340
You know, wearing green.

1305
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,740
Yeah, and one eye is dribbling down the side of their face.

1306
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,060
And they've got this kind of...

1307
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:09,400
Ripping.

1308
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:10,580
Ripping.

1309
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,640
My clothing is all...

1310
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,280
And they're giggling.

1311
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:12,840
It's cute.

1312
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,560
You can tell they're high on something.

1313
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,560
You know, the wall behind them is kind of, like, melting.

1314
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:19,520
Yeah.

1315
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,420
And they...

1316
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,420
All the blacklight posters around them are fountaining.

1317
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,820
And, yeah.

1318
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,980
And very disturbing to the environment.

1319
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:31,240
Try and get them in your car and have the windshield start melting and have the radio

1320
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:31,560
playing.

1321
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,960
It looks like toothpaste is coming out of the radio.

1322
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,420
Man, you want to throw them right out of your car and they still laugh as they roll down

1323
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:38,900
the freeway.

1324
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,480
It seemed like everybody I looked at was tripping because they were all just melting.

1325
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,740
And they're...

1326
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,780
You know, they put on this music that tasted like ice cream.

1327
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,760
The air was tripping.

1328
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,320
Hey, man.

1329
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,200
Um.

1330
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,200
One of the crackers.

1331
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,420
Is that what you...

1332
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,440
Is that what you called them?

1333
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,660
I thought it was...

1334
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:03,900
Okay.

1335
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:06,820
Hey, man.

1336
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,960
Am I still sweating?

1337
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:09,940
Hey.

1338
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,020
Hey, I heard...

1339
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,140
No, you're in New York, man.

1340
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,080
You're in the Greenwich Village.

1341
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:13,560
I heard that you had...

1342
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,880
I heard that you had shrooms.

1343
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,040
W-w-w-w-w-w-wanted a pound of flesh.

1344
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,480
They wanted that which makes you alive.

1345
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:21,700
They wanted your soul.

1346
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,680
That's what they do want.

1347
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,500
They want a piece.

1348
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,320
Could you...

1349
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,360
Could you make some coffee for us, man?

1350
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,980
We've been walking out in the rain.

1351
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,960
It's cold, I think.

1352
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:32,640
Yeah, yeah.

1353
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,160
Sit down.

1354
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:33,580
Sure.

1355
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,160
When'd you get up?

1356
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,040
Um, I don't know.

1357
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,440
It was like...

1358
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,240
I think it was yesterday, but...

1359
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,100
This one kid died.

1360
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,400
I think he died.

1361
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,180
Um...

1362
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,520
They found him in the woods.

1363
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,540
Well, yeah.

1364
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,020
That's where we found him first.

1365
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:48,960
Down by the lake.

1366
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,480
Oh, man.

1367
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:51,780
Yeah, man.

1368
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:52,640
He was, uh...

1369
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:53,780
Checking out...

1370
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,120
He almost got ran over by a...

1371
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:55,940
A pontoon boat.

1372
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:56,500
Looking from...

1373
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,400
He came to study consciousness.

1374
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,160
Yeah, he wanted to...

1375
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,940
But he ended up...

1376
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:01,380
...beating inside your...

1377
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,660
With his pants around his ankles down by the lake.

1378
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:05,020
With the...

1379
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,700
Freezing at dawn.

1380
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,000
I had...

1381
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,060
Wondering what had happened.

1382
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:09,820
Stop that!

1383
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,780
Is there...

1384
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,820
We heard this really, really, really bad.

1385
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:23,080
Now, did you ever, uh, play Hoppin' John or Magic Footy when you were a young lad or any of those other...

1386
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:23,400
Or...

1387
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,100
Impale your head into...

1388
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:25,100


1389
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,360
Into the telephone pole spike?

1390
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,280
We used to...

1391
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:28,460
Well...

1392
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,760
We used to play, uh...

1393
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:30,940
Uh...

1394
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,360
Bash the cat to death with your forehead.

1395
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,580
But you had to use an actual little baby child.

1396
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,360
You couldn't use a cat because that would be unhuman.

1397
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,440
No, of course we used cats.

1398
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,300
We'd nail them to the post.

1399
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:39,740
Oh, man.

1400
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,280
In the center of town.

1401
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,680
And then the young men would...

1402
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,540
Would vie to beat the cat to death with their heads.

1403
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,260
The cat was nailed to the post.

1404
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,920
You know...

1405
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,660
But still alive.

1406
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,200
And, you know, it was difficult because there's...

1407
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:52,840
It's like...

1408
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,840
This scratch...

1409
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,100
You're trying to scratch your eye.

1410
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,480
Right.

1411
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,020
They don't want that to happen.

1412
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:57,340
Of course.

1413
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,320
And you've got to bash it to death with your head without injuring yourself on the nails

1414
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,600
that are holding the cat on the post.

1415
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:04,340
Or the...

1416
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,520
Or the cat's claws.

1417
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:06,400
Teeth, too.

1418
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:06,620
Yeah.

1419
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,420
What I just described actually was...

1420
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,340
It's still...

1421
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,480
Of course, that's what we do at Subgenius Shows, but...

1422
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,100
And campouts.

1423
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:18,280
But that was commonly done all over Europe in the Middle Ages.

1424
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,100
Well, did you...

1425
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,420
That was a common...

1426
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:23,280
That's what our civilized ancestors did.

1427
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,400
Think about it.

1428
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,080
Civilized ancestors.

1429
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,080


1430
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,080


1431
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,080


1432
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,080


1433
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,080


1434
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:25,540
Even Europe.

1435
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,580
Yeah, think about it.

1436
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,340
I did.

1437
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,540
I did not believe.

1438
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:28,800
I did not believe.

1439
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,800
Enough genes to go wrong.

1440
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,680
I do not believe.

1441
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,640
Of any...

1442
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,240
If one...

1443
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,280
The lads would go out and do...

1444
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,100
Nail the cat to a post.

1445
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,520
Did you...

1446
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,860
Did you ever, like, go to, say, for instance, to, you know, one of the outpatient things

1447
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:48,120
at a hospital, and there's, like, maybe an elderly World War II or Korean vet there in

1448
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,440
a wheelchair with one of those...

1449
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,200
Breeder-type things on.

1450
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,600
And what you do is...

1451
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,880
You just come up to him.

1452
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,080
He says...

1453
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:55,080


1454
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,660
You start talking to him, like, maybe you want to talk about the big one.

1455
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:58,480
Kiss me.

1456
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:58,680
Kiss me.

1457
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,220
You know?

1458
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,760
And you sit down on his lap, which is kind of painful, even though the legs are pretty

1459
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,280
well gone, you know, and they just feel like little stumps and stuff.

1460
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,320
You sit right on his lap and put your arm around and start talking to him like he's

1461
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,660
Santa Claus, only you're real drunk and, like, 40 years old.

1462
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,660
And I tell you, man, this...

1463
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:16,460
What?

1464
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,740
Well, it's just great fun.

1465
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,520
I don't know.

1466
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,620
I find my fun where I pick some cheeses at a bus station.

1467
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,240
You know, like, a lot of people in the parking lot of a mall.

1468
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,220
Come on, man.

1469
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,320
Haven't you ever goofed on your elders?

1470
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:38,580
Self-amusing personality, or S.A.P., really does not require fancy toys, cars, stereos,

1471
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,980
DVD players.

1472
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:40,600
Nay.

1473
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,720
It's the ultimate performance art.

1474
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:54,820
The true S.A.P. can enjoy the loftiest heights of sublime, aesthetic entertainment just by

1475
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,320
by looking at the dirt under its fingernails.

1476
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,420
And they can also enjoy gastrointestinal intercourse

1477
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,460
at the same time if they're shaving right.

1478
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,100
Just feeling the bubbles in their own intestines

1479
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,800
can be a form of slack

1480
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:12,460
for the truly aware man or woman.

1481
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:14,460
Nourishment.

1482
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:15,760
Nourishment.

1483
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,240
Up.

1484
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,760
And up.

1485
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,600
Uh-oh.

1486
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,700
Look, man.

1487
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,240
He's opening up his escali

1488
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,400
and you can't actually see a brain.

1489
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,700
That's what happens when you turn to the left too quickly.

1490
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,440
It's a whole other scene now.

1491
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,940
Yeah, man, I'm too sure.

1492
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,620
Well, at least we got out of that one, though.

1493
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,500
You don't want to...

1494
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,020
I really hate when this happens.

1495
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,140
You don't want to swerve, man.

1496
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:38,940
You don't want to, you know,

1497
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,460
cause any covenant errors, if you know what I'm saying.

1498
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,560
Are we even still on the road, man?

1499
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,560
I can't even...

1500
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,540
You call this a road?

1501
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,600
I mean, you better slow down.

1502
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,700
I can't see anything.

1503
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,140
Hey, man, nobody's going nowhere.

1504
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:52,920
Calm down.

1505
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:53,520
Calm down.

1506
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,480
Look, look, see?

1507
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,160
Anything going by, it's in your mind, man.

1508
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,760
This is an illusion, man, created by the windshield frost.

1509
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,920
I think I've got caffeine poisoning, man.

1510
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,140
No, no, no, that's...

1511
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,900
I'm seeing weird fringing around me.

1512
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,720
That's the tip of your skull.

1513
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,000
The edge of my vision.

1514
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,760
This car, we shouldn't be...

1515
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,980
Shouldn't the road be bumped?

1516
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,880
Where is the road?

1517
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,020
Are we even on the road?

1518
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,200
Jesus God Almighty, wet your pants.

1519
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,100
I can't even tell if we're moving.

1520
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:22,840
What's that voice?

1521
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:23,220
What's that voice?

1522
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:23,920
Dave DeLuca.

1523
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,360
I think I know who you are.

1524
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,320
Dave DeLuca?

1525
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,780
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1526
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,140
I think I don't...

1527
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,540
Are you there?

1528
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,480
I'm not really here.

1529
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,780
Buh, buh, buh, ah, ah, buh.

1530
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,120
It's luminous blue.

1531
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,140
It's...

1532
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:40,680
What is the next great frontier, Lonesome Cowboy Dave?

1533
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:45,440
The next great frontier is the frontier of the human mind.

1534
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:51,800
Delineated and demarcated, sans frontiers, but only its only limited image...

1535
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,240
We've been there, done that.

1536
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:53,940
Imagination.

1537
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:54,880
And...

1538
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,300
Okay, all right, then I'll just forget about it.

1539
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,240
Can I get...

1540
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,240
The mind has been completely mapped and explored.

1541
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,800
The mind is still a vast frontier where very few have ever truly tried.

1542
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,400
Your mind, maybe.

1543
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,540
The mind is still a place filled with cavernous muscles and tiny little tissues

1544
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,200
which no one can reach except for their own share of bones.

1545
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,020
The human or normal mind has been completely worked out by marketing companies

1546
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,620
and conspiracy medical science.

1547
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,780
The last hundred...

1548
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,600
The last hundred years, they've had it down, down, down.

1549
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,240
Don't you believe what the ancient Rishis have told us?

1550
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,700
That by properly using our minds, we can even fly as if gossamer on wings of felt?

1551
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,660
Is that what the ancient Rishis told you?

1552
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,460
Not the Rishis, Monk.

1553
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,960
It's the Rishis of ancient India.

1554
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,100
You gotta lose your tish in order to fly.

1555
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:44,940
Anybody who finds himself that far off the ground without knowing why loses their tish.

1556
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,280
And that's a truism and a falsehood.

1557
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:49,140
Tish, tish, tish, boys.

1558
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,420
Fish, fish, fish.

1559
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,840
That's the real lie.

1560
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,460
Good God!

1561
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,540
The prediction came true!

1562
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:58,420
Now, what's that?

1563
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,440
It's Bob Pipe!

1564
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:06,140
It's a young, hipster teenager girl with a Bob Pipe in her mouth

1565
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:11,560
and a broomstick inserted just the way Bob predicted would be the new fad of the...

1566
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,680
Now, speaking of things that come and go, speaking of fads,

1567
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,740
is that a real broomstick or is that what...

1568
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,940
When you see a broomstick where it shouldn't ought to be,

1569
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:21,780
whether it's...

1570
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:25,660
Whether it be inserted by New York Police Department or...

1571
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,760
or Bob Dobbs himself, friends,

1572
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,800
you know the end times are coming.

1573
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,920
And so are a lot of gross perverts out there,

1574
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:38,100
of which I am not that kind myself.

1575
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,200
Nay, brother.

1576
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,760
And I only look at these things.

1577
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,640
Can I get a witness to...

1578
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,040
You gotta know the enemy!

1579
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:46,400
You gotta know your enemy!

1580
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,240
And I get a witness, brothers.

1581
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:50,500
I...

1582
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,140
I...

1583
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:51,460
I...

1584
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,880
But seriously, you know, if we look at...

1585
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,480
at prophecy, like, uh, as many do,

1586
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,320
the Weekly World News there at the checkout line,

1587
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,720
as we thumb through Revelation X,

1588
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,400
the book of the subgenius, we...

1589
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,080
Using our second or third horsekin thumb...

1590
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,300
We're entering a glorious new age,

1591
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,880
a new era of diseases,

1592
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,480
of volcanic eruptions...

1593
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:16,820
Praise diseases.

1594
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,800
...that decimate entire states.

1595
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,340
Praise eruptions.

1596
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,340
Earthquakes.

1597
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,700
Uh, incredible man-made disasters

1598
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,300
of gigantic stockpiles of nerve gases

1599
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,320
released into the atmosphere...

1600
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:30,980
...and confused...

1601
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,460
...flowing hither and yon.

1602
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,020
...all flapping amongst the small union children

1603
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:38,200
as they gathered by the gates to sing songs...

1604
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,360
The madness of the Middle Ages will pale in comparison

1605
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:46,200
to the marvelous, futuristic new age that's coming.

1606
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,160
...scarier than it is now.

1607
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,480
We know that you, the listener,

1608
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,760
are interested in the future.

1609
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:54,420
Or you wouldn't be listening to this show.

1610
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,940
You who are hearing my voice now,

1611
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,040
those of you who live into the new age,

1612
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:06,040
will see such wonders as rubber cities.

1613
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,980
Gigantic dominoes the size of skyscrapers,

1614
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:20,540
all set to go off and fall at once on July 5th, 2001.

1615
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,520
...at Brushwood Campground in Sherman, New York.

1616
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,540
Devices are all dying, master.

1617
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,200
All is in order now.

1618
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,080
You see?

1619
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:35,480
One such wonders as glass lipstick.

1620
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,920
Growth books.

1621
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,900
We like the glass lipstick.

1622
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,480
Sin pills.

1623
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,500
I have taken many, master.

1624
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,420
What shall I do now?

1625
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,600
Other miracles of science,

1626
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,980
such as the robotic butt puffler.

1627
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:00,240
The eye condenser, the amazing eye condenser,

1628
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,440
takes what you see or what you have seen

1629
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,180
and procreates into a small proclivitis package.

1630
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,120
It can be owned by a member of your family unit

1631
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,920
now for a limited time, but not in the neutral space.

1632
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,600
These are completely designed for a modern you today

1633
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,620
in the neutral space.

1634
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,860
If you care, or if you dare, just step into the box,

1635
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:24,260
reach your hand out, the influence will go on and on.

1636
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,940
Are you ready for this future?

1637
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,840
Is this really the future that you want?

1638
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,760
This is food for thought, ladies and gentlemen.

1639
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,500
And until next week,

1640
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,000
the box is doxed.

1641
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,620
You can keep your hat on tight.

1642
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:36,580
Don't dare.

1643
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,860
You're dark to the wind.

1644
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:38,840
You're deep to it.

1645
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,140
And you're sagging the saddle.

1646
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,340
Think about it.

1647
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,080
That's how we got the red nose.

1648
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,880
That's how we got the red nose.

1649
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,120
If everything is lost, it's me.

1650
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:49,820
If everything is lost, it's me.

1651
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,060
Then he'd pick you up, because you were really small.

1652
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,760
He'd pick you up, and he'd whirl you around his head

1653
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,660
around and around and around over and over and over again.

1654
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:58,560
Remember that?

1655
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,860
But neither one of you make any sense.

1656
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:05,100
Because, yeah, I mean, I think that's the same.

1657
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,180
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1658
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:12,140
And this illustration of 10-dimensional string theory...

1659
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,460
I would have loved to have heard what that said.

1660
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,040
I would have liked to get in there.

1661
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,100
Well, that's why you got to do that.

1662
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,060
I'll be featured in the test tomorrow.

1663
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,600
And you're like, listen to it later.

1664
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:20,680
And analyze it.

1665
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,640
In four dimensions?

1666
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,300
And like, yeah.

1667
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,040
Yeah, exactly.

1668
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,260
One guy on one side, and another guy on the other side.

1669
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,920
But you can get a degree on what Dave says in the background on these shows.

1670
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,200
There is a degree offered now?

1671
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:35,100
It's like really complex fractal mathematics or something, though.

1672
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,060
Well, combined with history.

1673
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,320
Because the strands just keep branching off.

1674
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:43,680
It's like the James Joyce form of assembly instructions.

1675
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,280
Well, strands...

1676
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,300
Very simply put...

1677
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,020
Strands after strands.

1678
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,820
Do your eyeballs roll in the back of your head?

1679
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,800
Strands after strands.

1680
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,980
Strand after strand.

1681
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,360
Strand after strand.

1682
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:51,540
After strand.

1683
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:51,900
After strand.

1684
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:56,900
Travel to any part of the universe without moving.

1685
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,820
Without moving.

1686
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,960
In a slowly undulating fashion illuminating...

1687
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:08,240
They are standing still, about ready to drive home a balloon head.

1688
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,220
And the sub-lives stride up.

1689
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:16,760
You and the car are static, but the wheels are rolling the world under your sarcophagus.

1690
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,460
I can hear the snow, Sirius.

1691
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,540
I can hear them all.

1692
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:20,720
Just as you suspected.

1693
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,140
That's how it really works.

1694
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:23,800
The dark!

1695
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,520
I can hear the dark now.

1696
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,800
Yes, my friend.

1697
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,300
But who is holding the steering wheel of the car?

1698
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:29,720
I don't know.

1699
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,700
Go into the void, kids.

1700
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,360
It's time to go into the void.

1701
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,900
I will step in first.

1702
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,940
I've been bad tonight.

1703
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,260
I want to confess my badness.

1704
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,800
I will go bye-bye for a squib.

1705
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,000
What are your sins?

1706
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:45,220
Well, I was controlling and dominating and selfish and piggy.

1707
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:46,340
Oh, no.

1708
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,460
No, I wanted to hear what you were saying.

1709
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:49,800
You were saying that you were a selfish and piggy.

1710
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:49,800


1711
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:49,800


1712
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:49,800


1713
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:49,800


1714
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:49,800


1715
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,200
I didn't know.

1716
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,160
And nobody would shut up and not...

1717
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:53,840
We didn't know.

1718
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,900
Well, we got to go, though.

1719
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,540
When you die, you shut up like hell.

1720
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,140
Okay, starting again from the very beginning.

1721
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,360
Don't shut up yet.

1722
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:00,180
Okay.

1723
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:00,860
Okay.

1724
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:01,940
You're still entertaining everything.

1725
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,600
Just start the whole thing from the beginning, from right before I came in.

1726
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,240
Till next week.

1727
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,860
Keep your hat on tight.

1728
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,820
You're back to the wind and your sack in the saddle.

1729
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,640
Well, we're back here at the annual George Bush Airplay Balloon Headed Shoot Show.

1730
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,100
This is just a practice run.

1731
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,260
This wasn't on the air.

1732
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,580
Balloon Headed Shoot Show.

1733
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:15,480
Well, we can edit it all.

1734
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,860
Okay, so this is like...

1735
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:17,960
That was take one.

1736
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,040
Take two.

1737
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:19,700
I'm Ken Smart.

1738
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:20,200
I came on the air.

1739
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:20,860
I'm Ken Smart.

1740
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,220
All right, guys.

1741
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:24,860
We'll do this again.

1742
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:25,920
Let's do it all again.

1743
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:29,740
Merry Christmas.

1744
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:30,540
Merry Christmas.

1745
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,300
Merry Christmas.

1746
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,300
Merry Christmas.

1747
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:32,340
Happy Christmas.

1748
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:32,960
Have a good holiday.

1749
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,700
Happy Chinookish.

1750
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,340
Happy X-est month.

1751
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,120
Happy X-est month.

1752
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,140
Happy X-est month.

1753
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,600
What's the other...
