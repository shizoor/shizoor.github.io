1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Well, I've been around him a long time. That's the first time I ever heard him praise anything but himself. I can't believe it.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,640
Now listen carefully.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,720
Hello. Hello, Bob.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,900
I'm beginning to smell a big, fat, crummy rat.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,900
Take off your pants.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:17,500
Me?

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,940
Take off your trousers.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,760
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,400
You got more on me than any guy in this town, and I'll lay you out that the minute you get out of here, you're going straight to the cops and spill everything you know.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:26,900
Me?

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,480
Yes.

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:27,820
Yeah.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,700
Is that correct?

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,020
No.

15
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,580
Yes, it is.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,440
Thank you.

17
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,460
That will be all.

18
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,420
Oh, thanks, Bob.

19
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,380
Excellent.

20
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:34,980
Yes.

21
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,520
Very interesting.

22
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,940
That's beside the point.

23
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,880
I walked down the long corridor, heading back to my hometown cell and the same dangerous double life.

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,840
I wondered for an instant how it would be to have a wife and kids to go home to.

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,820
And then I killed the thought.

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,300
I can't afford to have thoughts like that.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
I'm a communist for the...

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
Self-genius.

29
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,420
Power of...

30
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,160
What?

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,260
I walk alone.

32
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,600
Dana Andrews will return in just a moment.

33
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,580
This is Dana Andrews.

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,000
Ah, yes, dear friends, it's Hour of Slack, number 1063,

35
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,360
the all-commy episode, thanks to Comrade Lemur,

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,200
also heavy on the Norell Prefaganda,

37
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,660
and the resurrected ancient subgenius album, Media Barrage No. 4,

38
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:00,040
and Puzzling Evidence, and Dr. Howell, and Radio Synesthesia,

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,980
and Cuff Links, and wait, what, what, what, what's that?

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,620
Oh, look, it's Dr. Bad Idea.

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,440
There goes my spleen.

42
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,960
You haven't even sucked the tip of that conspiracy.

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,760
Uncover the truth.

44
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,620
Did he hit you? Did he hurt you?

45
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,840
Vascular embolization. Bullet got into his arterial system.

46
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
You ever been to a swingers party?

47
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,820
I don't know.

48
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,720
Right-handed, a Libra, circumcised, rich.

49
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,680
Smelled funny.

50
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,500
Diazepam.

51
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,240
Pinzos, pinzos.

52
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,340
When you're home alone, you lock the bathroom door.

53
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,620
I don't even know you.

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,020
Sure you do. We all do.

55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,120
It's human nature to avoid being vulnerable, isn't it?

56
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,360
Wait, so you're saying the guy has B.O.?

57
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,720
Hotty odor, bad breath.

58
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,480
Later.

59
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,500
Exactly as Noah getting into the ark triggered the deluge that destroyed the earth in his day,

60
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,280
and that it's very highly possible that when this all takes place,

61
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,780
that a great cataclysmic judgment will do that very thing.

62
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,680
And we do not know that it wouldn't happen in 1982,

63
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,640
but we don't know what day it'll happen.

64
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,080
This article was referring, as I said, to the nine planets in our solar system,

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,760
Mercury, Earth, Mars, Uranus, Pluto, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, and Neptune,

66
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,680
when these are scheduled to be perfectly aligned in 1982,

67
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,660
that these things perhaps can happen.

68
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,000
Many scientists with varying ideas of what could happen

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,700
have expressed their views that huge solar flares will take place,

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,480
resulting that could be disruptions in the television and radio communication,

71
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,940
and a great deal more.

72
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,640
I see that I'm not going to have...

73
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,660
much time to go into this anymore today,

74
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,380
and so I'm going to carry it through tomorrow

75
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,340
and try to bring it to a more clear climax.

76
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,140
But may I tell you that all of these are warnings to us

77
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,180
to repent of our sins and to get ready for the coming of the Lord,

78
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,540
for we can see great and drastic things that are going to take place on the earth

79
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,880
when Jesus comes and the judgments of God are being poured out upon a Christ-rejecting world.

80
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,000
Parasite intelligence,

81
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,260
parasite intelligence,

82
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,100
the parasite mind can control the actions of its host.

83
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,440
Symbiosis.

84
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,740
Symbiosis?

85
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,300
Yes, exactly.

86
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,620
Symbiosis?

87
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,680
Yes, exactly.

88
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,740
Why can't we combine with the other intelligences and wipe out the parasite?

89
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,240
Oh, no, you don't understand.

90
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,600
A disease of the mind.

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,240
Yes, it's made only with the very whitest pigment.

92
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,980
White, white, white, white.

93
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,000
Parasite intelligence,

94
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,220
parasite intelligence,

95
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,440
why can't we combine with the other intelligences and wipe out the parasite?

96
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,720
Oh, no, you don't understand.

97
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,260
You've obviously never heard of Gabaltorium.

98
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,920
No, what about it?

99
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,140
Gabaltorium-G has a radioactive half-life of 93 years.

100
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,220
If you take, say, 50 H-bombs in a 100-megaton range and jacket them with Gabaltorium-G,

101
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:45,120
when they are exploded, they will produce a doomsday shroud, a lethal cloud of radioactivity

102
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,680
which will encircle the earth for 93 years.

103
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,560
Oh, what a load of cum.

104
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,400
No question.

105
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,320
We have a problem.

106
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,480
We all know that.

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,560
But that doesn't mean that we ought to change the whole system we have, find out where the problems are,

108
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,860
the character of the problems, and address them.

109
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,500
All I want is some help.

110
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,540
I don't want to be sitting out here and forgotten with poison water.

111
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,420
That's all I ask is for some help.

112
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,940
The state of Michigan said there's nothing wrong with it.

113
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,940
The EPA came out and said there is something wrong.

114
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,420
The Health Department of Michigan later sends me a letter saying it's all right.

115
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,300
There's nothing wrong with it.

116
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:23,820
There's nothing wrong with your water.

117
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,580
You can drink it.

118
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,280
And if you don't think that doesn't scare a mother to find out that a boy is urinating

119
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,440
to your blood when you know he's only got one kidney, believe me, I've had it.

120
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,360
I cried all the way to the doctor's office.

121
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,860
Joe, come here a minute.

122
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,940
I got a red hot tip for you, Joe.

123
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:52,600
See that guy with the red suspenders driving that car with the bright red fenders.

124
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,280
I'm not a red hot tip for you, Joe.

125
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,280


126
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,280


127
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,120
I know he's one of those heavy spenders.

128
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,300
Get that communist Joe.

129
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,360
He's filling my gal with propaganda.

130
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,000
And I'm scared she will meander.

131
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,600
Don't want to take the chance that he'll land her.

132
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,820
Get that communist Joe.

133
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,220
He's the most revolting character.

134
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,360
And the fellas hate him so.

135
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,280
But with the girls, this character is a good one.

136
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,280


137
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,280


138
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,580
I'm a comrade Romeo.

139
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,520
Since my love he's sabotaging.

140
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,960
And the law he has been dodging.

141
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,320
Give him what he deserves, jailhouse lodging.

142
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,460
Get that communist Joe.

143
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,540
Get that small Joe.

144
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,980
He's the most revolting character.

145
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,180
And the fellas hate him so.

146
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:19,360
But with the girls, this character is a comrade Romeo.

147
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,280
Since my love he's sabotaging.

148
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,280


149
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,280


150
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,280


151
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,280


152
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,280


153
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,780
And the law he has been dodging.

154
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,980
Give him what he deserves, jailhouse lodging.

155
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,160
Get that communist Joe.

156
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,540
Get that communist Joe.

157
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,920
Get that communist Joe.

158
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,360
Get that communist Joe.

159
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,880
The Cavaliers, dear friends.

160
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,440
And before that, Media Barrage Number 4.

161
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,100
I am going to cover the results of the

162
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,100


163
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,200
And, first of all, some short talk.

164
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:18,300
In order to understand, you'll need to send in an email from Nixon.

165
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,460
America, we're throwing you away.

166
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,700
There are two ways to get to Tehran, sooner or later.

167
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,140
To get there sooner, fly Iran Air.

168
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,780
Only Iran Air flies from New York to Tehran non-stop.

169
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,180
You arrive in the afternoon in time for dinner and a good night's sleep.

170
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,560
You wake up refreshed.

171
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,000
On other airlines, you arrive after dark, often much later.

172
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,540
Fly to Tehran the fastest way on Iran Air.

173
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,300
Try the urgent way to fly.

174
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,820
Fly, the best way to stay.

175
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,660
Serving you in many more ways.

176
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,920
Iran Air is rolling your way.

177
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,340
Remember, you're only one stop from London, Paris, or Tehran on Iran Air.

178
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,800
Ah!

179
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,940
Ay-yi-yi!

180
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,220
Killings, carnage, bombings, suicide.

181
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,360
Many Americans see little hope.

182
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,400
Terrible wars are time of joy.

183
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,540
Joyous times.

184
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,400
You know, we're not leaving.

185
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,060
Sick.

186
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,100
Disaster.

187
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,900
Excitement and opportunity.

188
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,660
Renewed violence and terror.

189
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,660
Joyous times.

190
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,940
Huge mistake.

191
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,220
You know, unbelievably huge mistake.

192
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,920
You know, war is a time of joy.

193
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,760
Hostility is in place, intact.

194
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,580
If you want to join the Marines, you have to have sex with me.

195
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,380
You know, so she had sex with them.

196
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,220
Joyous times.

197
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,080
To join the Marines, you have to have sex with me.

198
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,080
Tantalizing abuse of power.

199
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,520
We're not leaving, we're not leaving.

200
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,180
Devastating lapse in judgment.

201
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,900
Memorialpref.com has more of where that came from.

202
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,060
And now, Lean Murr.

203
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,640
I'm a good boy now.

204
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,940
I have two cufflinks where there was only one before.

205
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,820
Are you?

206
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,240
Cufflink.

207
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,840
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me.

208
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,580
Why?

209
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,280
I can't help it.

210
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,560
Cufflink.

211
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,080
I can't do it.

212
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:17,920
Cufflink.

213
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,920
Yes.

214
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,980
He couldn't afford a cufflink.

215
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,040
But I know that nothing will save me if the cufflinks find out what I've engineered.

216
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,020
Comes the showdown.

217
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,640
I'm a cufflink for the great cufflink.

218
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,100
I walk with their help.

219
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,160
Dana Andrews will return.

220
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,140
This is Dana Andrews stepping out of the cufflink to remind you that our story was pure fiction.

221
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,880
We've changed names and modified incidents to protect the cufflinks.

222
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,960
And that's what counts.

223
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,720
Because you were the wrong cufflink.

224
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,480
Yeah.

225
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,780
I'm a cufflink.

226
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,100
I'm a cufflink.

227
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,140
I'm a cufflink.

228
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,140


229
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,140


230
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,140


231
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,140


232
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,140


233
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,140


234
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,140


235
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,140


236
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,020
The person I'm looking for is, should be very interesting and, you know, not plastic

237
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,040
or anything like that.

238
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,960
And someone who enjoys going out and having a good time and a good conversation with.

239
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,760
And I guess that's about it.

240
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,440
Okay.

241
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,600
Your code number one more time?

242
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,420
239.

243
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,440
Thanks for calling.

244
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:34,860
Good luck.

245
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,280
Thank you.

246
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,020
So long.

247
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,400
See you then.

248
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,880
More proof that a cork really works.

249
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,900
Marvin L. Kosnowski, president of Kosnowski Corks, is proud of his corks.

250
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,320
I am proud of my corks.

251
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,480
I ask your friendly cork dealer for a file for today.

252
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,320
If you itch, you need soft and soothe.

253
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,780
It's swimming, you know?

254
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,740
High temperature today, 100 degrees even.

255
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,580
That makes it the 63rd day this summer that we've been there.

256
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,120
Well, actually, the city has been there for a while now.

257
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,120


258
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,020
year because almost the entire and if weather conditions had been different the toxic cloud

259
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,680
released might have blown over manhattan and it's scary it's damn scary especially the fact that i

260

261
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,760
let your fears well up

262
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:43,340
you have them now don't deny them their chance to claim your soul

263
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:57,900
know that within every man is a monster and this monster may create a monster

264
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:09,700
a frankenstein monster to bring your realistic world crashing down around you you say it can't

265
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,260
be true

266
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:10,980
you

267
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,540
al qaeda is calling

268
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,280
al qaeda is calling

269
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,480
i uh fear the rise of democracy

270
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:34,160
good morning i i fear the future i made my position clear

271
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,020
help help this week i met with my dead

272
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,000

273
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,320
you

274
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,680
just wanna tell you now report we will defeat the world we will defeat our next

275
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,040
control

276
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,000
it's 여러분

277
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,200
broemente

278
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,320
lie

279
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,940
non as is

280
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,920
unrestraint

281
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,640
same

282
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,120
the com

283
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,320
world strong

284
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,280
and leave behind a violent terrorist nation.

285
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,520
The American people expect terrorist attacks.

286
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,160
We, uh, I, uh, and by the way, the enemy, me,

287
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,680
that's why I instructed the Justice Department to give Al-Qaeda to the United States

288
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,220
and stop the United States.

289
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,080
And I believe we're all in terror.

290
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,800
And we must bring an end to the Justice Department who are the terrorists.

291
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,980
And therefore, this country of ours is why they're calling.

292
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,380
Al-Qaeda is calling, but America's weak.

293
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,580
And, uh, is it war? Clear, clear, clear, clear.

294
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,140
Clear, clear, clear, clear.

295
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,220
This is an absolute, this is, now, now, now, thank you all very much.

296
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,540
I just can't believe.

297
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,200
Uh, thanks to Norrell Preff.

298
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,460
It's a privilege.

299
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,960
Uh, asteroid comes down, kills all the dinosaurs,

300
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,420
and yet life still goes on.

301
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,500
Right.

302
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,060
It's hard to, it's hard to wipe life out.

303
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,400
It was many times more powerful than all the nukes we have today.

304
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,440
Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's, it's very hard to wipe out life.

305
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,720
It's, it's just hubris if we think we, we could.

306
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,620
Now, that doesn't mean that we should, that we should be careful.

307
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,440
Well, maybe we should try.

308
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,360
I'll take you up on that challenge.

309
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,160
I think we should wait for the saucers to come before we try that.

310
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,500
Because we all know, as we all know,

311
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,360
that this, this program has already stated its nuclear ambition, uh, before.

312
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,000
I, I, we have already announced our intentions, uh, here at, uh, CSB

313
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,700
to get our own nuclear arsenal.

314
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,580
Because, you know, we don't feel safe.

315
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,500
Well, the Church of the Subgenius already has three nuclear,

316
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,040
nuclear weapons.

317
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,860
Nuclear, that's all?

318
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,260
Yeah.

319
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,480
That's the best you can get.

320
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
The conspiracy has thousands of nuclear weapons.

321
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,020
The Church of the Subgenius, we've only got three.

322
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,120
But yet we dare to use them.

323
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,620
See, I, I can't believe the, the Church of the Subgenius

324
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,420
is stuck with, like, you know, primitive 20th century weapons technology like that.

325
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,880
I can't believe the saucers haven't, uh, you know, left anything better behind.

326
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,820
No anti-matter bomb?

327
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,300
No, no, no.

328
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,000
These were, these were, uh, trinkets that, uh,

329
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,860
that, they were, uh,

330
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,480
meant to be offerings to the Exists,

331
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,260
in other words, for, for certain alien technologies,

332
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,140
but the Exists refused to trade.

333
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,100
Yeah, I, I can't blame them.

334
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,620
Yeah, and somehow they ended up in the hands of the group

335
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,440
that was dealing with the Exists back in the 40s

336
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,400
when they had made contact in Roswell, New Mexico.

337
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,840
Hey, listen, this is a long-distance call,

338
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,840
so I'm gonna get off now.

339
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,260
All right, well, it's been fun.

340
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,240
All right, later.

341
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:34,700
Thank you.

342
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,660
So, what do you do, uh, you know, if,

343
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,600
if you're, uh, you know, a,

344
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,680
this is something that has occurred to me, actually,

345
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,720
the, uh, the, uh, the ban on liquids on planes now.

346
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,420
Well, it's...

347
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,660
I think that's gonna be, like, completely reversed in a few years

348
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,940
because eventually they allowed,

349
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,800
eventually they allowed, uh, nail clippers back on again.

350
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,320
I can't believe they went so far as to ban nail clippers for a while.

351
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,260
Well, they're gonna, they're, they're working on explosives detectors.

352
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,320
You see, what's really funny is,

353
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,200
is the terrorists come up with some really ingenious little plot

354
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,800
that can only work once, you know,

355
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,500
and then after they bust that plot,

356
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,180
or after that plot is already carried out,

357
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,960
then, then they implicate, uh, they, they, uh,

358
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,800
they implement some really horrible draconian security measures

359
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,480
that everybody gripes about, and, I mean...

360
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,020
Well, if the...

361
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,840
Who's the shoe bomber?

362
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,080
I mean, come on, like, who,

363
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,820
who the hell is gonna try and use a shoe bomb

364
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,900
after, uh, Richard Reed's trial run, you know,

365
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,000
was less than successful?

366
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,820
You never know.

367
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,360
I've never even heard of such thing.

368
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,800
Shoes have been used for smuggling before.

369
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,860
Right, I've never heard of the shoe bomb before that.

370
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,640
I wonder if it was detonated with, like, a shoe phone.

371
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,440
Like, Maxwell Smart.

372
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,060
No, he was, no, it required him, uh...

373
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,840
I'm, I'm joking.

374
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,580
Beverages, shampoo, lotion, toothpaste, and hair gel.

375
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,580
I don't know where you boys are getting all your fa-

376
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,740
But, uh, I know something's wrong here...

377
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,480
First of all, first of all...

378
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,440
Second! Second!

379
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,580
There is no evidence, there is no evidence!

380
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,500
Beverage? Shampoo? Lotion? Toothpaste? Hair gel?

381
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,500
Beverage? Shampoo? Lotion? Toothpaste? Hair gel?

382
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,080
I've never seen anything like this in my entire life.

383
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,700
And so I think they decided to have some fun.

384
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,920
And so I think they decided to have some fun.

385
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,820
And so I think they decided to have some fun.

386
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,900
And so I think they decided to have some fun.

387
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,920
And so I think they decided to have some fun.

388
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,940
A terrorist, a terrorist, a terrorist.

389
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,920
A terrorist, a terrorist, a terrorist.

390
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,740
Mass murder on an unimaginable scale.

391
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,680
Major threat.

392
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,320
This major threat.

393
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,340
This is a well-orchestrated plan.

394
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,400
Major terror plot, United States.

395
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,680
Major terror plot.

396
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,600
Beverages, shampoo, lotion, toothpaste, and hair gel.

397
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,600
Beverages, shampoo, lotion, toothpaste, and hair gel.

398
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,560
Beverages, shampoo, lotion, toothpaste, and hair gel.

399
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,320
Somebody's abusing my rights, that I'm sure.

400
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,500
Erase Norrell Kraft for that one.

401
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,660
Don't do this, please.

402
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,280
Careful.

403
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,820
Hey, don't do this.

404
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,760
You don't need anyone.

405
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,240
That's not true, I need you guys.

406
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,200
If nothing matters, how can I matter?

407
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,920
I don't know if nothingness matters or somethingness matters.

408
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,940
I'm trying to figure that out and I want you to help me.

409
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,300
You know what?

410
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,680
It's somethingness, nothingness.

411
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,100
You know what?

412
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,060
I can't.

413
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,120
Just you figure it out.

414
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,460
Let go, let go of me.

415
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,760
Okay, uh, hold on now.

416
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,080
Tell me what happened, okay?

417
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,540
She won't stay and share this with me.

418
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,620
Tell me what that is.

419
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,040
It's important.

420
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,280
I mean, I see it so clearly.

421
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:48,520
Yeah.

422
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,960
You use petroleum, you're a murderer.

423
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,660
That's a fact.

424
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,820
A murderer.

425
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,600
I know you say it clearly.

426
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,040
A murderer.

427
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,440
Killing the ozone and all the creatures that it's hurting.

428
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,040
Calm down.

429
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,920
Two, killing Arabs and oil-producing dictatorships

430
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,980
where everybody is poor.

431
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,460
Yes.

432
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,140
That is cruelty and it's inhumane.

433
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,460
I know you've talked to me about this.

434
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,880
All right, so if this world is temporary,

435
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,280
Yeah.

436
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,660
Identity is an illusion.

437
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah.

438
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,480
Then everything is meaningless

439
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,840
and it doesn't matter if you use petroleum.

440
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,180
No, no.

441
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,180
That's got me very confused.

442
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:11,960
No, it matters.

443
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,300
It matters.

444
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:12,840
It matters.

445
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,620
Look, look, Tommy.

446
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,980
See, this is a universe

447
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,760
and that's our galaxy over here.

448
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,300
What universe?

449
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,160
What universe?

450
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:18,840
This.

451
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,120
Tommy, come on.

452
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,660
Come on.

453
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,140
There's dust and gas there.

454
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,460
Yeah.

455
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,540
There's us over here

456
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,140
and good and bad luck in the middle.

457
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:25,980
That's chaos.

458
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,600
That's my B.

459
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,280
You know, this doesn't sound like you.

460
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,980
No, Bubon talks about space.

461
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,160
Where'd you get that book?

462
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,340
You sent it to me.

463
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:32,640
No, no.

464
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,860
We would never give you this book.

465
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,180
This is a pretty good book.

466
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,960
You should read this.

467
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,140
What?

468
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,580
She says nothing's connected.

469
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,860
It doesn't matter what you do.

470
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,100
You can drive a car.

471
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,220
You can burn up gas,

472
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,320
which would explain the way things actually are

473
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,540
where people do destructive things

474
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,460
like it doesn't even matter.

475
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,940
Tommy, Tommy, everything is connected

476
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,080
and everything matters.

477
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,400
There is not an atom in our bodies

478
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,880
that has not been forged in the furnace of the sun.

479
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,760
Now, isn't that cool, huh?

480
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,080
Yes.

481
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,320
That's a cool thing, isn't it?

482
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:57,840
But.

483
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,480
But what?

484
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,180
You tell me where she contradicts that.

485
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,980
Right here.

486
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,240
Where?

487
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,180
Where?

488
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,320
There.

489
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,100
Where?

490
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,920
Less than 5% of the cosmos

491
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,500
is composed of the same elements

492
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,700
that compose human life.

493
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,100
You know.

494
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,740
There you go.

495
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,020
That means we're all alone

496
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,740
and we're miserable and isolated.

497
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,440
Molly, if you, listen,

498
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,140
if you, if you, if you leave me

499
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,640
before he gets done dismantling,

500
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,540
we, he will never make it to the other side, okay?

501
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,300
You know what?

502
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,120
I'm done with the dismantling.

503
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
You don't want to ask these questions?

504
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,500
No.

505
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,260
I, I want to live my life.

506
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,560
What is that life, baby?

507
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,380
What are we part of?

508
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,880
Who are we?

509
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,500
Look at this.

510
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:30,980
Look at this.

511
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,420
Do you know where these come from?

512
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:32,760
Yeah.

513
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,780
My closet.

514
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:33,840
My closet.

515
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:33,940
My closet.

516
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,520
Indonesia.

517
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,200
Baby, this is the truth, okay?

518
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,560
Little girls like you,

519
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,100
they have to work in dark factories

520
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,340
where they go blind for $1.60 a month

521
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,160
just to make mommy her pretty shoes.

522
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,760
Can you even imagine that, Caitlin?

523
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,620
I don't want the children to work in factories.

524
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,360
Don't listen to him.

525
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:49,600
Daddy, daddy.

526
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,540
Daddy is crazy.

527
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,320
Daddy's not crazy, baby.

528
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,300
The world is crazy.

529
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:53,660
Shut up!

530
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,820
A clip, friends, from I Heart Huckabees

531
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,500
and before that, much more Elpref.

532
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,440
And as before, so below.

533
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,200
Yeah!

534
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,180
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

535
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,580
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

536
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,020
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

537
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,380
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

538
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,720
This week, America received a stark reminder

539
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,960
that box cutters kill our people.

540
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,720
Death on a massive scale.

541
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,980
The terrorist threat is being used for partisan political advantage.

542
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,540
The inconveniences you will face are mass murder.

543
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,840
I'm grateful for the terrorists' plight.

544
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:33,840


545
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,220
We've been fighting attacks.

546
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,880
We've raised a threat.

547
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,700
We've raised a threat.

548
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,440
And we will win the war on freedom.

549
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,240
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

550
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,660
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

551
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,120
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

552
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,420
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

553
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,760
There are some 50,000 nuclear weapons in the world today.

554
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,320
I think we really need nuclear weapons

555
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,640
because Russia and everybody else has got them.

556
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,840
Jesus began to give to them.

557
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,060
The signs of his coming and the end of the age.

558
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,800
And one of the signs he referred to

559
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,220
was the abomination of desolation

560
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,020
that was spoken of by Daniel the prophet.

561
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,400
This hasn't taken place yet.

562
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,580
Just don't buy your doomsday theories.

563
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,580
Well, you better buy them.

564
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,580
We are in worse shape from the point of view

565
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,780
of our military preparedness

566
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,740
than we were on the 8th of December 1941,

567
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,260
the day after the Pearl Harbor attack.

568
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,000
The Russians got the definite advantage on us right now.

569
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,300
But we need to show more strength.

570
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,380
We've got to catch up or get ahead of them

571
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,120
or we're dead meat.

572
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,220
Well, after we come through here

573
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,840
and we purify through this plant here,

574
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,720
it takes out some of the chemicals in the mud out of it.

575
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,560
But you can't drink.

576
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,480
We can't drink it.

577
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,440
Nowhere in the world you can drink it

578
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,280
unless you hold your nose.

579
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,900
The ice is coming.

580
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,540
The sun's divining.

581
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,680
Meltdown expected.

582
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,440
The wheat is torny.

583
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,520
Engines stop coming.

584
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,280
But I have no fear

585
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,320
because London is drowning.

586
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,020
I

587
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,720
live by the rules.

588
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,320
I live by the rules.

589
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,380
It'll also tell you about the prelude to Armageddon

590
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,180
and also some of the strange events

591
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,320
that have been forecast for 1982.

592
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,160
Some of the things that are coming

593
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,820
in these last days.

594
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,520
Do people say you're slipping

595
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,300
that you can't take it anymore?

596
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,900
Extreme irritation.

597
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,860
However, there has been more fighting overnight.

598
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,000
Bloodthirsty war.

599
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,480
Bloodthirsty war.

600
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,180
They were bound for a cult.

601
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,200
They were bound for a cult.

602
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,540
I always was a barbarian.

603
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,820
Human vivacity.

604
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Hum Kämp.

605
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,920
비싹신 This is the blow.

606
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,440
Se purposes of the recht.

607
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,740
The Snigger van定 MURGHEN

608
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:54,740


609
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:54,740


610
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,080
You are everything

611
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,080


612
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,080


613
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,080


614
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,800
They will Lind back

615
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,240
The Russian national

616
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,680
A long spent

617
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,400
A long spent

618
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,820
Trust the bread

619
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,000
Not thirsty wars

620
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,140
Legendary savages

621
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,880
Complete sell-out

622
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,820
Cancer, you call it

623
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,580
I can achieve a sort of intellectual understanding of what that means

624
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,980
Never an emotional one

625
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,680
I always was a barbarian

626
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,560
I always was a barbarian

627
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:37,940
I feel a desire for a little disconnection

628
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,600
Quiet, angels

629
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,820
I'm gonna pass one more miracle

630
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,760
And you gotta help me

631
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,340
In case it's a new kind of miracle

632
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,100
In my own image

633
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,220
Let there be man

634
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,260
Sure, we gave second thoughts to paving over the earth, but...

635
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,340
Well, like, cement's not very biodegradable.

636
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,600
And we had enough of it down already.

637
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,360
We figured we may as well go ahead and pave over the rest.

638
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,560
It's a lot easier than tearing all this up.

639
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,300
We could air-condition and it got rid of the bugs.

640
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,760
I don't know, it's just a lot easier to keep things clean.

641
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,820
I mean, we got air-conditioning,

642
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,200
toilet training for all our children.

643
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,660
We've got all the rest of the world.

644
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,460
We could tear down the rocks, we could chew them.

645
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,620
But you don't need nature for beauty.

646
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,700
The buildings here are inspiring monuments to our adaptable workers,

647
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,680
such as the enchanting shopping metroplexes.

648
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,720
During Let's Go Shopping,

649
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,060
a 20-minute break and a 20-hour workday,

650
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,920
humans compete to consume as much as possible.

651
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,040
And all it costs is time.

652
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,640
What husband could resist letting his wife have us free for free?

653
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,420
And there's sure no trouble deciding what you want.

654
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,240
Oh, don't mind me.

655
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,080
Nobody wants me.

656
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,140
I used to be popular, but not no more.

657
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,140
Hey, man, you want to buy me?

658
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,240
All of that's been bought by all of you.

659
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,580
Besides, he only costs five minutes.

660
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,320
And when shopping time is up,

661
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,080
all the products you've just bought

662
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,680
are flushed away down to the factories

663
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,720
to be recycled and back on the shelves by tomorrow.

664
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,700
From Let's Visit the World of the Future,

665
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,860
a film done 33 years ago

666
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,540
by your...

667
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,440
truly Reverend Ivan Stang.

668
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,080
That soundtrack was on Media Brach 4.

669
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,200
In the background, I believe we hear

670
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,020
uh, uh, three...

671
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,280
five-fisted tales of Connie at 9X Day.

672
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,560
And now more Norell and Macaca.

673
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,440
Macaca, Macaca, Macaca, Macaca

674
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,400
Macaca

675
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,800
Macaca

676
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,040
Macaca

677
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,240
Macaca

678
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,160
Macaca

679
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,100
Macaca

680
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,060
Macaca

681
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,880
Macaca

682
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,260
Macaca

683
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:57,380
Macaca

684
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:57,700
Macaca

685
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:57,800
Macaca

686
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:57,980
Macaca

687
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,000
Macaca

688
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,480
Macaca

689
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:58,480


690
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:58,480


691
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:58,480


692
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,060
Macaca

693
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,420
Macaca

694
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:02,420


695
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:02,420


696
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:02,420


697
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:02,420


698
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:02,420


699
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,740
Welcome to America

700
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,360
Welcome to America

701
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:05,740
Welcome to America

702
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,760
and the real world

703
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,340
but Macaca

704
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,060
The enemy.

705
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,420
That's what we're saying.

706
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,560
Macaca

707
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,300
Who was, uh, uh...

708
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,400
pulling it out.

709
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:14,840
corpses

710
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,300
But I also talked about the human suffering agenda.

711
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,760
And I also had relations with Macaca

712
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,100
because, uh, well, uh,

713
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,240
the idea is to try to help create, uh,

714
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,080
you know, a

715
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,580
a more dangerous world.

716
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,680
Uh, to kill innocent life.

717
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,520
I didn't...

718
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,560
Part of the reason we went into Iraq, uh, was, uh,

719
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,100
the main reason we went into Iraq at the time was we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.

720
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,100
Turns out he didn't, he didn't, he didn't, he didn't

721
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,660
send the wrong message.

722
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,100
You had suiciders leaving Iraq.

723
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,940
You know, everything was just fine until we arrived.

724
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,000
They were gonna stir up the hornet's nest.

725
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,820
What did Iraq have to do with what?

726
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,580
The attack on the World Trade Center.

727
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,440
Nothing!

728
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,300
Nothing!

729
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,900
The capacity to make...

730
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,120
Nothing!

731
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,000
Nothing!

732
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,700
The attacks of September the 11th, uh, were ordered by...

733
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,380
Macaca, or whatever his name is.

734
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,580
Uh, who would, uh, power.

735
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,300
Nothing!

736
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,340
Positive, constructive ideas.

737
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,280
Stirring up even more trouble in a part of the world

738
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,300
that, uh, the Middle East.

739
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,140
Now look, I didn't...

740
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,420
And so, my question, my answer to your question is, is that

741
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,100
imagine what the world would be like...

742
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,900
This is just, this is just, this is just, this is just...

743
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,700
The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the...

744
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,100
that, uh, had so much resentment and so much hatred...

745
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,400
The mission is complete as far as I'm concerned.

746
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,900
Except for it's part of take threats before they fully materialize.

747
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,980
Nobody's ever suggested that the...

748
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,100
Probably will never come.

749
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,340
So welcome, let's give a welcome to Macaca here.

750
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,940
Welcome to America and the real world.

751
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,000
Paying suiciders.

752
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,380
And I believe if we ever cease to pray,

753
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,300
and cease to seek God,

754
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,780
God will destroy this country!

755
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,060
And I believe I'm gonna live to see cities in America,

756
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,900
cities in this nation, literally, instantly destroyed!

757
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,600
I believe I'll see it soon.

758
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,100
You can keep your eyes on some West Coast cities.

759
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,880
And you watch.

760
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,360
I'll guarantee you when the majority of our population

761
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,140
begins to turn their back on God,

762
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,200
and begins to try to tell us that

763
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,360
a perverted lifestyle is a normal lifestyle,

764
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,200
and they have no time or tolerance for God,

765
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,780
focus your attention, and you watch,

766
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,800
because I promise you, God will not continue

767
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:41,200
to leave that city, that people, without judgment.

768
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,980
The victims of FEMA is...

769
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,260
Here at Renaissance Village,

770
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,320
Trailer Park...

771
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,620
Trina, Trina, Trina, Trina...

772
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,400
Living in government provided trailer homes.

773
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,520
Prosecutors in Michigan, however, say they are standing by

774
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,280
terrorism charges against Walmart in Central Michigan.

775
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,980
One of the most violent areas...

776
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,800
Wait, wait...

777
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,200
And now there's another hassle.

778
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,260
Because of the work being done here by

779
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,580
some really fine Americans from different agencies in our government,

780
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,400
America is not yet safe.

781
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,700
And we gotta be right one time.

782
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,060
Proud to report that in this building,

783
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,760
we've got some good ass working hard,

784
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,200
and energy, and effort.

785
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,080
Difficult job.

786
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,540
We're willing to kill innocent life to achieve political objectives.

787
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,860
The United States of America is a extremist group of folks,

788
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,360
bound together by an ideal,

789
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:25,800
ideology,

790
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,880
willing to use terror to achieve their objectives.

791
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,040
And, uh...

792
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,520
And we've got some good ass,

793
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,800
and the best ass that we have is...

794
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,080
Trina, Trina, Trina, Trina...

795
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,320
More at norellpref.com

796
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,880
Each human shares his spacious total living unit

797
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,900
with a different female each night,

798
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,500
since they are circulated to provide variety and companionship.

799
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,100
The unit contains two single beds,

800
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,120
and a large variety of luxuries,

801
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
including the Eye of Taxis,

802
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,400
a crime prevention device,

803
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,580
and of course, a normal machine,

804
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,400
constantly supplying everyone with the TV shows of your dreams.

805
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,340
Everyone watches the normal machine.

TV, TV, TV, TV...

807
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,860
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

808
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

809
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:14,920
TV, TV, TV, TV...

810
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,300
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,060
Ha ha ha...

Ha ha ha...

813
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:19,860
Ha!

814
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,140
Oh...

815
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:25,860
O!

816
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,600
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...

817
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,140
Ha ha!

818
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,000
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...

819
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,360
TV variety show has been declared an endangered species...

820
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,680
of any waste material.

821
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,040
TV Variety Show

822
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,540
Also sold separately...

823
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,320
Nerf hook...

824
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:53,940
Nerf ball...

825
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,580
and super nerd.

826
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,520
And I have chosen

827
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,500
you,

828
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,080
Mr. Beale,

829
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,640
to preach this evangel.

830
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,000
But why me?

831
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,180
Because you're on television, dummy.

832
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,100
He's a blank.

833
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,000
Waiting for the final finished face

834
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,100
to be stamped onto it.

835
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,180
But whose face?

836
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,800
Albert.

837
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,320
Albert.

838
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,220
Forget Brad.

839
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,460
Albert, come back to me.

840
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,040
Where are you?

841
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,800
Albert, picture a tree in a field.

842
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,440
Good.

843
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,760
Now put someone you respect in the tree.

844
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:43,640
Hey!

845
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,340
Still Brad's dad.

846
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,660
Add someone else.

847
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,220
Like who?

848
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,500
You know, someone who can understand things.

849
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,460
Someone who can help you.

850
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,460
Who's your guide?

851
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,500
Well, I use Magritte,

852
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,400
the Belgian surrealist.

853
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,760
I got someone.

854
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,580
Who is it?

855
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,940
Mrs. Shermer.

856
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,720
She was my high school English teacher.

857
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,380
She helped me.

858
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,240
All right, good.

859
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,580
Look, he pushed her out of the tree.

860
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,160
Okay, Mrs. Shermer has a vacuum cleaner, Albert,

861
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,100
that sucks up fear.

862
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,900
Now she's going to send you rays of security

863
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,760
and complete acceptance.

864
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,180
Okay.

865
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:23,180


866
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,420
Oh, he chopped her head off.

867
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,500
Yeah!

868
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:31,940
Hold on, hold on.

869
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,660
Hold on.

870
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,440
Hold on, hold on.

871
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:33,520
Hold on, hold on.

872
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,260
You're doing well.

873
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:34,900
Now, you can't...

874
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,740
Now, don't give up now.

875
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,020
Didn't she vacuum the lawn?

876
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,380
Yeah, but then he vacuumed her.

877
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,140
I had to chop him up with a machete.

878
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,560
Okay, Albert, Albert, I'm going to let you in on a couple of secrets.

879
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,360
One, your mind is always occupied on something,

880
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,140
so it may as well be something helpful, like Mrs. Shermer in her vacuum cleaner.

881
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,440
Two, there's a lot of things you can do about it.

882
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,740
There is no such thing as you and me.

883
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,300
So then there's just nothing?

884
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,600
Three, there's no such thing as nothing.

885
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,500
There is no remainder in the mathematics of infinity.

886
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,660
There's only the blanket.

887
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,760
I thought I understood the blanket.

888
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,760
Now I'm not sure.

889
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,020
In my little 11-year-old child,

890
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:12,060
I think his mentality is much more alert than his 16-year-old boy.

891
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,500
The point is, stupidity is all around us,

892
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,140
and it's not worth getting upset about.

893
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,420
It is not a thing a sane man would do.

894
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,320
The doomsday machine is designed to trigger itself automatically.

895
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,460
But surely you can disarm it somehow?

896
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,480
No, it is designed to explode

897
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,040
if any attempt is ever made to untrigger it automatically.

898
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,440
It's an obvious coming trick, Mr. President.

899
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,560
We're wasting valuable time.

900
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,660
Let's make war.

901
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,480
We're getting ready to claw at us.

902
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,600
Well, we've done it.

903
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,980
We've let loose the dogs of war.

904
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,460
I wonder how they'll destroy us.

905
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,540
Lombardy, bring the blood, leave us all.

906
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,820
Lombardy, bring the blood, leave us all.

907
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,620
History shows I'm getting up, yeah.

908
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,940
I'll get your points up.

909
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,660
The folly of man.

910
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:21,840
Godzilla!

911
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,780
You two act like it was the end of the world.

912
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,160
Well, it could be.

913
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,040
But we will return to enjoy your final moment.

914
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,280
Commentator Jonathan Mathias with another bulletin.

915
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,520
And now, as the Sino-Russian border war continues to rapidly escalate,

916
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,660
U.S. authorities are beginning to question

917
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,860
to what degree we will become involved

918
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,700
in what could...

919
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,660
...quickly grow into global conflict.

920
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,260
Abort firings. Abort firings.

921
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,960
Interception will fragment the Sili-carrying missiles.

922
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,140
Abort firings. Abort firings.

923
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,060
Interception will fragment the Sili-carrying missiles.

924
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,360
Tonight's presentation on the beach was of course fiction.

925
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:14,200
All Americans share the common desire that a nuclear holocaust will never happen.

926
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,740
And certainly an alert, prepared America

927
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,120
is our greatest hope.

928
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,700
To safeguard in a nuclear age.

929
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,840
I really don't know, because I don't know the situation neither does the American people.

930
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,640
Our current policy is that we do not launch until we are under attack.

931
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,360
Now the danger of that policy today is the Soviets can deliver their missiles with such accuracy

932
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,060
that they'll be able to knock out in a matter of relatively few seconds

933
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:42,540
all of our ability to retaliate against the rest of the Soviet missiles.

934
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,640
Range two miles. Missile still deflecting.

935
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,100
Range one mile. Missile detonated.

936
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,280
All operators.

937
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,000
All operators.

938
00:37:54,220 --> 00:38:03,000
If a true alarm sounded most of our defenses would be alerted and within ten minutes many of our jets would be in flight headed for their targets.

939
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,060
Yet under enlisting law only the President could give the final order to fire our nuclear warheads.

940
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,460
... airborne at the time as part of a special exercise we were holding called Operation Dropkick.

941
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,260
Now it appears that...

942
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,100
Now it appears that...

943
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:23,560
that the order called for the planes to attack their targets inside Russia

944
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,080
with an average load of 40 megatons each.

945
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,940
General Turgidson, I find this very difficult to understand.

946
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,780
I was under the impression that I was the only one in authority

947
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,880
to order the use of nuclear weapons.

948
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,580
That's right, sir.

949
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,200
You are the only person authorized to do so.

950
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,640
And although I hate to judge before all the facts are in,

951
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,360
it's beginning to look like General Ripper exceeded his authority.

952
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,920
Candy fam for Mongo!

953
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,520
Mongo, Mongo, Mongo, Mongo!

954
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,640
Candy fam for Mongo!

955
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,660
Mongo like candy!

956
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,960
Candy fam for Mongo!

957
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,560
Mongo too intoxicated!

958
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,540
Mongo too intoxicated!

959
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,660
Mongo like candy!

960
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,080
Candy fam for Mongo!

961
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,560
Erase your own craft for that one.

962
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,500
Is money more important than people's lives?

963
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,820
And in their pursuit for private interests,

964
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,260
a lot of chemical companies will not accept legal,

965
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,860
moral responsibility for the results of chemical waste pollution

966
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,160
until absolute proof shows that a specific chemical

967
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,360
from a specific plant caused a specific disease.

968
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,320
The treatment you receive when you do business with these industry giants,

969
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,060
it's frequently frustrating,

970
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,940
and to make matters worse, they don't seem to care.

971
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,140
You won't find this attitude at Bill King's Breko.

972
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,560
Well, I'll tell you what, everything I figure is a hazard.

973
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,540
It progresses as the years go on,

974
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,300
and eventually we'll never be able to control it.

975
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,380
If you take a look,

976
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,580
those maps that show concentrations of various forms of cancer,

977
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,480
you can pick out the industrialized areas of America.

978
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,260
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

979
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,360
There are changes

980
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,000
Lying ahead in every road

981
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
There are new thoughts

982
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,960
Ready and waiting to explode

983
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,620
Ready and waiting to explode

984
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:45,620


985
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,960
When tomorrow is the day

986
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,360
The bells may toll for a song

987
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,960
But nothing can change the shape of things to come

988
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,180
Certain changes have been taking place here,

989
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:08,800
such as the increase in the beatnik crowd

990
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,500
and the increase of the drugs that's used

991
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,120
and distributed by the beatniks.

992
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,480
There's only one thing for it.

993
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,960
We can save America, and that's change every person one at a time

994
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,240
by the power of Almighty God working in that corrupt heart.

995
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,420
The gates of hell was governed.

996
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:36,240
Because in Bible times, government sat at the gates of the city.

997
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,540
Yes.

998
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,980
The Bible says the gates of hell shall not prevail against them.

999
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,960
There's no question about it.

1000
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:45,540
We are going to see the most tremendous turn of events.

1001
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,620
Not only in this nation, it's going to affect the whole world.

1002
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,340
Peace, did Hitler say.

1003
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,880
Next move, Czechoslovakia.

1004
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,940
There are a few beatniks in Berkeley.

1005
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,080
I'm sure from what you folks hear,

1006
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,380
you would think that the population in Berkeley

1007
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:12,360
is really becoming beatnik-like all the time.

1008
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,620
Well, the...

1009
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,540
percentage of them is increasing a bit.

1010
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:25,460
But with this movie actor getting into the governor's chair,

1011
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,000
Ronald Regan from Hollywood,

1012
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,260
I think that he's going to tame them down a little bit.

1013
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,200
May I close on a personal note?

1014
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,060
I was asked once in a press interview what book I would choose

1015
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,840
if I were shipwrecked on an island and could have only one book

1016
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:51,140
for the rest of my life. I replied that I knew of only one book that could be read

1017
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:57,220
and reread and continue to be a challenge. The Bible, the Old and New

1018
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:04,200
Testaments. I can only add to that my friends that I continue to look to the

1019
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:10,820
scriptures today for fulfillment and for guidance. Indeed it is an incontrovertible

1020
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:16,300
fact that all the complex and horrendous questions confronting us at home and

1021
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:20,700
worldwide have their answer in that single book.

1022
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,940
L-O-L

1023
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,880

1024
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,840

L-O-L

1036
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,100
The Frotter Sody

1037
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,660
and before that

1038
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,480
some old

1039
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:40,800
puzzles

1040
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,980
and media

1041
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,460
barrage

1042
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:42,740
for

1043
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:43,720
Mongo

1044
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,800
was from

1045
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,300
Norell

1046
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:45,560
Craft

1047
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,340
and now more

1048
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:46,900
Norell.

1049
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:50,680
She's a virgin?

1050
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,420
What are we talking about?

1051
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:51,920
An immaculate conception?

1052
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,140
More like the immaculate perception.

1053
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,420
Pseudo-psiesis.

1054
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,280
Imagine pregnancy.

1055
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,100
It's all in her head.

1056
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,600
It's all in her head.

1057
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,080
Well, that would explain what she was doing in Dad's bed.

1058
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:58,720
Panicizing.

1059
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,300
Wow, wow.

1060
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,660
Hormone levels can change, setting off all the biological signs of pregnancy.

1061
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,480
Kind of makes sense.

1062
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,880
Hormones travel the same channels as adrenaline.

1063
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:04,680
Swollen abdomen.

1064
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,520
Lack of menstruation and sometimes bilateral galacteria.

1065
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,660
Milk production in both breasts.

1066
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,240
Leaking can be brought on by stress.

1067
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:10,800
Emotion.

1068
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,440
Additional or physical stimuli cause prolactin to shoot through the endocrine system, ending

1069
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,240
in the mammary glands and triggering the cells to lactate.

1070
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,340
Father was clueless.

1071
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,660
About all the women in his life.

1072
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:18,580
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1073
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,180
Check out these photos.

1074
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,040
Two stains on the inside of the shirt we found at the dump.

1075
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,000
In an electric kind of way.

1076
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,640
And then you put your mother in the freezer and you waited until trash day.

1077
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,900
It's not my fault.

1078
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:26,640
Believe in sanity.

1079
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:27,340
Good defense.

1080
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,680
People throw things away every day.

1081
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,240
Go ahead.

1082
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:33,680
Yeah.

1083
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,660
8.12 p.m.

1084
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,700
We found nothing.

1085
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:40,800
12.15.

1086
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,080
Stone.

1087
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,400
For about an hour.

1088
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,760
1.30 p.m.

1089
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,000
We was able to talk.

1090
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,060
4.10 p.m.

1091
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,040
Little brat.

1092
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,000
Big boy.

1093
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,600
I beg your pardon?

1094
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,040
Didn't do too well, did ya?

1095
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:54,280
Ya?

1096
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:54,600
Hmm?

1097
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,100
Did ya?

1098
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,220
Oh, no ma'am.

1099
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,480
10.46 p.m.

1100
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,280
Ma'am?

1101
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,000
Ma'am?

1102
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,580
That's me.

1103
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:00,300
What?

1104
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,060
I said me.

1105
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,040
Yes, ma'am.

1106
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:02,660
No, ma'am.

1107
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,400
Yes, yes.

1108
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:03,920
Uh-huh.

1109
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,420
Yeah, yeah.

1110
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:04,780
No.

1111
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:05,400
No?

1112
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:05,860
Right.

1113
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,440
Mm-hmm.

1114
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:06,660
Yeah.

1115
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,120
Uh-huh.

1116
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,600
And at 6.10 p.m.

1117
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,000
What?

1118
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:09,520
Huh?

1119
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:11,240
Poor boy.

1120
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:11,560
Huh?

1121
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:24,640
A thanks to Lee Murr, and now a scene from I Heart Huckabees, in which two seekers learn

1122
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:31,720
how to gain enlightenment by slapping themselves in the face with a hard rubber ball.

1123
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,740
Now.

1124
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,060
Not so hard.

1125
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,080
Sorry.

1126
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,120
Now.

1127
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,560
Now.

1128
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:45,800
Now.

1129
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,120
Now.

1130
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:47,700
Now.

1131
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,620
Did you get it?

1132
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,480
Yeah, you stopped thinking.

1133
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:01,660
Yes.

1134
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,900
It's fantastic.

1135
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,040
It's like I'm here, but I'm not.

1136
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,320
So I'm not here.

1137
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,760
It's just...

1138
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:10,800
I don't...

1139
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,320
I don't know.

1140
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,000
Do it one more time.

1141
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,280
It's like I'm a rock or a dish of mold.

1142
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,200
I'm whatever else is around, so I'm free to just exist.

1143
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,040
This is the answer.

1144
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,320
We just have to be this all day, every day.

1145
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:28,920
It's the answer.

1146
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,320
Do it again.

1147
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:31,600
Do it again.

1148
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:32,940
Now.

1149
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,280
Now.

1150
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:35,440


1151
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:38,960
Now.

1152
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:40,460


1153
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:40,460


1154
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:40,460


1155
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:40,800
Now.

1156
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1157
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1158
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1159
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1160
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1161
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1162
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1163
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1164
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1165
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1166
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1167
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1168
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1169
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1170
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1171
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1172
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1173
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1174
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1175
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800


1176
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,480
Now.

1177
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:42,060


1178
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,040
Not all over.

1179
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,180
No.

1180
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,040
No.

1181
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:46,740
All covered with

1182
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:47,380
No.

1183
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:56,120
But I still love them collection for now.

1184
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,040
Where time will not last.

1185
00:47:58,740 --> 00:47:59,980
I never know why.

1186
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,980
Can only ask Christ because it is what He has taken away from me.

1187
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:02,180
Come to what he is from another world

1188
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:02,180


1189
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,300
Never know why.

1190
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:10,720
Not a word of life for the desire on our shoulders,

1191
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:10,800
an only love to have you fuller then God will not endure,

1192
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:17,960
The Murr did that, and now let's go back to KPFA's Puzzling Evidence Show

1193
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:23,280
shortly after the subgenius event called 9X Day.

1194
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,060
Yeah, you don't need that anymore.

1195
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,280
It's the end of the world.

1196
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,760
There's nothing left now.

1197
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,520
Besides, who has a pager anymore?

1198
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,240
That's so three days ago.

1199
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,600
Pagers are so early in our day.

1200
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,600
But rather deserve an alarm system to ensure democratic progress.

1201
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,660
This, however, does not matter to Satan,

1202
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,780
who constantly spreads his spiderweb-like snare.

1203
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:59,060
And boy, did we see a weird moth at X Day.

1204
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,880
A strange moth with wings like crumpled paper bags

1205
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,260
and an abdomen like that of a giant wasp,

1206
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,800
only flattened like that of a giant katytid.

1207
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,480
What was it?

1208
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,700
Could it have been a wasp?

1209
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,800
Discolored like the fingernail of a giant giant.

1210
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,080
Could it have been a wasp, you say?

1211
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,160
It isn't? I mean...

1212
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,900
No, it was a moth.

1213
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,660
A moth, I tell you, a moth.

1214
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,440
And not only that, do you know what else we had at that campground,

1215
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,580
that accursed place?

1216
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:28,900
What? What did you have?

1217
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:29,460
Sugar!

1218
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:30,660
Sugar!

1219
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,020
That is...

1220
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,520
I knew this to be a statistical fact because...

1221
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,780
Sugar!

1222
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:40,960
Sugar!

1223
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,060
Sugar!

1224
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:43,560
Sugar!

1225
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,440
I hope you don't...

1226
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,480
What's wrong with sugar?

1227
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,880
Are you something wrong with them?

1228
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,560
Well, they get you.

1229
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,240
Aside from that, I have no particular...

1230
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,640
Sugars have a right to exist.

1231
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,440
Yes, that makes you wonder why I know I put them on the ark.

1232
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,740
But, you see, outside our meeting...

1233
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,840
Outside our little shack, our Lincoln Log...

1234
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,220
A girl! A girl!

1235
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,880
Yeah, there was a girl outside the shack, but...

1236
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,480
Let's have some girls.

1237
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,180
More importantly...

1238
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:11,900
Yeah.

1239
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,800
Somebody left a cup of coffee out in the rain.

1240
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,660
You mean the girl has to be a producer and the girl is a...

1241
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,220
And the next day...

1242
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,000
One girl has to be on...

1243
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,220
Is that next to the cake that you left out in the rain?

1244
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:23,760
A girl show?

1245
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:24,920
That was unfortunate.

1246
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,340
I had nothing to do with it.

1247
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,840
Let's talk about hair and pink stuff.

1248
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,400
I'd like to have a piece of cake right now.

1249
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,440
The point I was trying to make was that...

1250
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:32,800
You're wearing skirts.

1251
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,340
What point? What's the point point?

1252
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:35,560
What's the point of a point?

1253
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,860
Inside this cup of coffee that was left out overnight,

1254
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,880
I looked in it and it was...

1255
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,440
What?

1256
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:40,460


1257
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:40,460


1258
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:40,460


1259
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:40,460


1260
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:40,460


1261
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:40,460


1262
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:40,460


1263
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:40,460


1264
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:40,460


1265
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:43,920
Full of dead insects, which had fallen into it during the night.

1266
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I had to be quiet for that.

1267
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,680
Is this the cup you drank?

1268
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:49,220
I took a spoon and started spooning out waterlogged,

1269
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,440
or rather, coffee-logged moths and things.

1270
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,640
And you still drank it, right?

1271
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,740
And then I uncovered about three or four...

1272
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:57,020
Yes!

1273
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,100
Or five.

1274
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,580
All right, call...

1275
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,200
Maybe even six or seven...

1276
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:03,640
Jiggers!

1277
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:04,740
Ah!

1278
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:05,760
Ah!

1279
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,340
But then you drank the coffee anyway, right?

1280
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:14,260
I certainly did not, but the point I was trying to make was that the...

1281
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:16,160
Because the flash is going to reflect off the window.

1282
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,360
The jiggers really bring out the flavor of that mocha.

1283
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,200
Insects.

1284
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,140
I don't care where it comes from.

1285
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,000
It was the jiggers.

1286
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:25,660
Jiggers!

1287
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:26,400
Jiggers!

1288
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,360
Jiggers!

1289
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,900
But don't let it fool you.

1290
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,220
He did still drink the coffee, and that's what was the real point in this story.

1291
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,840
The real point is that he'll do anything.

1292
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:40,820
With coffee.

1293
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,060
And I'll do anything with this collar.

1294
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,500
Look, I'm just trying to...

1295
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,420
We're going to cheat on each other.

1296
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:46,660
I just wanted to...

1297
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:46,840
What?

1298
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,400
If I could just...

1299
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,260
You just said, why don't we cheat on each other?

1300
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,280
Why don't we have jiggers on each other?

1301
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:52,780
What kind of sort of soap opera is this?

1302
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,840
I've got that covered.

1303
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,100
I'm involved in doing that right now.

1304
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,760
Yes, on the show.

1305
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,420
I am cheating.

1306
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:04,680
So, anyway, the X's did not come and rupture us all up,

1307
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,320
although they've been taking bits and pieces of us.

1308
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,360
I think this time they've been working on hardware.

1309
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,240
A lot of us arrived home to find that our computers didn't work right anymore.

1310
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,100
That happened to me, actually.

1311
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:16,740
It did.

1312
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:21,300
It took a day for my computer to start working right again.

1313
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,040
I was going to try and do some serious work on it,

1314
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,540
and then suddenly it got better, so I didn't have to fix it.

1315
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:36,620
I lost a hard drive, and Rev Lon, one of the Kentucky boys, lost a hard drive.

1316
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,880
And he said because of that he hasn't been able to masturbate.

1317
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:40,440
Oh, yeah.

1318
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:40,440


1319
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:40,440


1320
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:40,440


1321
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:40,440


1322
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:40,440


1323
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:40,440


1324
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:40,440


1325
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:40,440


1326
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,140
A week and a half.

1327
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,320
Well, let that be a lesson in becoming a...

1328
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,260
In order to get off.

1329
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,520
Well, maybe he needs to improve...

1330
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,800
The pictures in his head.

1331
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:51,580
Yeah, exactly.

1332
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,180
You just need a fertile imagination.

1333
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:53,940
Right.

1334
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,640
You should be able to remember the pictures on your hard drive well enough in a pinch, so to speak.

1335
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,600
Well, the best part about using your imagination is you're not confined to people who've actually been photographed in the nude.

1336
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,220
You can...

1337
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,140
I don't know.

1338
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,840
Anyway, people use your imaginations.

1339
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,020
Don't let the media rob you of your creativity.

1340
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,480
Well, you know, I'm too polite to masturbate to somebody I know.

1341
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,560
Yeah.

1342
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,400
It's like you feel like you should ask them first.

1343
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,020
Ha!

1344
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:31,920
There's a certain protocol, you know, and if you're looking through your pornography and suddenly there's your friend or your teacher or your mom,

1345
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,860
it's just not the same.

1346
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,140
It can kind of spoil it.

1347
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:40,440
It's like doing that while you're watching Soul Train and suddenly the host comes on.

1348
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:40,440


1349
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,720
Just as you're getting her.

1350
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:47,140
So, I mean, like I say, it's a delicate thing.

1351
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,300
Okay, yeah.

1352
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,640
I'm not going to comment on that.

1353
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,640
It's a delicate thing.

1354
00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:02,800
Well, Ernie earlier in the calling seemed to be concerned that you had admitted to all kinds of fun having.

1355
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,220
Oh, yeah.

1356
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,220
You know, believe it or not, people actually do these things.

1357
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:06,700
I don't know.

1358
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:06,900
I don't know.

1359
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,260
He thought they were going to come after you because you admitted that.

1360
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:10,440
Yeah.

1361
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:10,820
In public.

1362
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,260
Oh, yeah.

1363
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,800
And Johann Sebastian Bach never did before a concert.

1364
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,660
That was the point he was trying to make.

1365
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,620
I'm going to...

1366
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:19,980
How does he know?

1367
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:20,860
Well, you know what?

1368
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,320
Actually, I would bet that Bach probably didn't masturbate because when you consider that he had 20 children,

1369
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,900
he was clearly getting his fill with his wife, I would think.

1370
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,660
Next year I want to go to Axe Day.

1371
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,700
Yeah, well, you know, it's not too...

1372
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,020
Well, why don't you just go to Starwood in a couple of weeks?

1373
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,820
I mean, Stang will be there, too.

1374
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,940
Yeah, Johnson, you might actually have better luck there.

1375
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:44,860
Yeah, you'd actually...

1376
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,500
Getting into the kind of trouble you want to get into.

1377
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,940
What's so big about Starwood?

1378
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,460
More people.

1379
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:51,980
More women.

1380
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,020
More women.

1381
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,080
Yeah, and...

1382
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:54,640
Lots more.

1383
00:54:54,700 --> 00:55:00,840
And more normals disguised as weirdos, so you'd have a lot more luck.

1384
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,780
Yeah, you'd fit right in.

1385
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,380
Yeah.

1386
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,960
Now, we need to bring more women into the church and everybody...

1387
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:10,280
Actually, as I was gazing about at Axe Day...

1388
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,460
And I was doing counts, and so I was also security and registration.

1389
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:18,140
And I ascertained that we've just about hit the equal point.

1390
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,360
During the Chili...

1391
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,840
The Subgenius International Chili Cook-Off,

1392
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,180
it was absolutely one gal for every guy.

1393
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,340
They were not necessarily attached to each other.

1394
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,420
Right, but...

1395
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,520
And none of them were what you would call untouchables, either.

1396
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,620
It was mostly...

1397
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,040
In fact, I was thrilled.

1398
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,060
I mean, even I found a woman at Axe Day.

1399
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:39,960
I'm going to have to go off the phone.

1400
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:40,800
I'm pretty soon.

1401
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:41,820
I'm getting so thrilled.

1402
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,960
Thinking of the babes of Axe Day.

1403
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:44,320
Yeah.

1404
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,860
Also, they're promised to be even more because there were a lot of little baby girls.

1405
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,180
So, yeah.

1406
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:53,300
In about 20 years, you know, we'll have...

1407
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,340
Another crop.

1408
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:54,880
Yeah.

1409
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:59,780
That's the wonderful thing about beautiful girls is they're a renewable resource, you know?

1410
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:00,280
Yeah.

1411
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,080
Just when one crop starts to wear out, the new one is ready to go.

1412
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:09,720
It's not the sausage fest that our jealous rivals like to say it is at all.

1413
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,260
Well...

1414
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,240
What do you think of Chris?

1415
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,560
It just seems that way to the single guys because...

1416
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,360
Well, it seems that way to the single gay guys.

1417
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,780
All the women there are taken.

1418
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,480
He was really complaining.

1419
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,380
Oh.

1420
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:27,600
We only have one really gay, entirely gay subgenius that was at Axe Day this year that I know of.

1421
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:36,260
He was happy about how many nice-looking young men they were, but he said they rejected his advances in all cases.

1422
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,920
I didn't even know.

1423
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,020
Now, see, if he would be...

1424
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:46,100
If he would try the bi thing, he'd probably score easily because he's a nice-looking fella.

1425
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:49,060
You know, gay guys always have an easier time getting close to the ladies.

1426
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:55,140
Of course, I think it's specifically because the women don't feel like they're being pursued, so it's easier for them to...

1427
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,660
Being married helps.

1428
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,380
And then this guy represents the giant sandwich.

1429
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,100
Or does he represent a mattress?

1430
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,020
Mattress.

1431
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,100
I'm sorry, he represents a mattress.

1432
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:05,940
He's a mattress bag.

1433
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:08,640
And...

1434
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,260
That ancient breed of animal...

1435
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,300
The mattress bag.

1436
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,260
I took a bath every morning with his baby.

1437
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,020
I took a bath.

1438
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,440
You took a bath with her.

1439
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,220
I took a bath with her.

1440
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,780
It was part of my routine this year.

1441
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:24,380
Yes.

1442
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,760
And here we see...

1443
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,040
Sweet child.

1444
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,660
The strange rites and rituals...

1445
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,420
Sweet child of the stars.

1446
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,440
Among the subgenius tribe.

1447
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,880
You know, folks, this isn't just something we're making up.

1448
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,560
We're trying to bring you esoteric news that they keep off all the other channels.

1449
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,260
You can't find me.

1450
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,620
I'm not doing this stuff in the regular...

1451
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:41,640
Sinister block.

1452
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,500
Sexy plans.

1453
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,860
We've got it all.

1454
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:48,580
In other news, don't play with fire and don't put the cigarette out in your eye.

1455
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,560
You.

1456
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:55,420
It's a bad thing to do and a bad idea, so don't get that out of your head right now.

1457
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:02,960
And thanks to the Puzzling Evidence Show on KPFA in Berkeley with Dr. Howell and Dr. Philo Drummond.

00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:10,080
This that you're listening to is Hour of Slack number 1063 from the Church of the...

Subgenius.

1461
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:18,080
And now, just for sick fun...

1462
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,140
We will tie a long rope to Manu, the monkey, fleeing from our arrows.

1463
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:29,120
And if you hit the monkey, Tarzan will go into the jungle and bring you back a prize.

1464
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,940
Perhaps a cruel and ugly civilization that spawned you.

1465
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,160
Doesn't that sound like fun?

1466
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,760
Yes, I guess so.

1467
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,680

1469
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,160
Rest assured, my stupid friend.

1470
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,780
The Subgenius Hour of Slack.

1471
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,100
Torgo, don't feel good.

1472
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,400
It was horrible.

1473
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,060
What was it all for?

1474
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,360
Your beauty is only of the outside.

1475
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,520
But he ran into the path of the elephants.
