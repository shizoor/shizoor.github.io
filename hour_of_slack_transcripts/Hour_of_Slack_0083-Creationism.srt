🎵

2
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:41,040
Your mind is completely relieved and becomes pure and tranquil as it gives itself in complete

3
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,580
surrender to a positive new pattern of perfect happiness and restoration.

4
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,980
Day by day, you will become more and more relaxed.

5
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:05,860
Each day, you will experience a new delightful sense of quiet peace and perfect contentment.

6
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:17,020
This enjoyable sensation will launch you into a quiet sea of heavenly peace and harmony,

7
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,820
where you will float in a pleasant rhythm.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,600

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,260

11
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:30,180
The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

12
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,540
Here on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

13
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,300
The Subgenius Radio Ministry hours of Slack.

14
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:47,900
And friends, this is one to keep those headphones on, keep those tape decks recording and bootlegging

15
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,840
because this show in particular is going to be filled with music.

16
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,960
Oh, oh, oh.

17
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,680
of all kinds.

18
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,580
You'll see this right now is

19
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,040
a great new subgenius,

20
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,060
Zug's Rift.

21
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,920
And you can actually find this one at the

22
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,300
record store, strangely enough. Almost everything else here played tonight on the

23
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,920
Hour of Slack,

24
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,180
sponsored by Canoana, the church of the subgenius.

25
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,100
These aren't things that you can buy in the stores,

26
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:23,800
generally.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,580
But you can call the Willa Dobbs here

28
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,700
at 823-7490 or 828-9500

29
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,820
and find out where to find out that information because

30
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,800
we can't tell you tonight, but you can write

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,840
the post office box that comes at the end of the broadcast.

32
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,440
Adieu, friends. Oh, yeah.

33
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,300
Happiness and security.

34
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,460
Refreshed and gloriously alive with a firm conviction

35
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,580
that each day will bring forth

36
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,840
a definite change for the better within you.

37
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,920
Yeah, well, that's what they all say.

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,500
And in all of your affairs.

39
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,080
But I've got this great new theme music. Actually, we've used this stuff before a long time ago.

40
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,140
Some of y'all might remember this. We have no idea where it comes from.

41
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,140


42
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,160
Some of y'all might remember this. We have no idea where it comes from.

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:25,160
But I think you'll agree that this is the perfect opening music for the hour of slack.

44
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,420
You know that it is showtime

45
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,560
And it ain't your time

46
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,180
And the show must not only be

47
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,280
Come with me and you will see

48
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,140
We are stepping high

49
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,180
What is the name of our show?

50
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,240
Stepping high

51
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,500
Stepping high

52
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,420
Stepping high, high, high

53
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,480
Now, boys and girls

54
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,420
Let's see if we can dance

55
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,340
To the rhythm of stepping high

56
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,480
If you are ready

57
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,400
Let's go and dance

58
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,660
Let's do that time step and dance

59
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,680
Dance to the music of stepping high

60
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,780
Stepping high

61
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,740
High in the sky

62
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,840
We will dance

63
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,160
And swing

64
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,800
We'll sing to please you

65
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,000
You

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,140
You

67
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,980
I'm stepping high, high, baby

68
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,120
But don't forget that I am here

69
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,920
Yes, dear friends, that man is driven by Bob Dobbs.

70
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,820
He's gotta be.

71
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,600
He's gotta be.

72
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,320
This is Ken Yardine.

73
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,460
Sometimes I wonder if I know where I'm going.

74
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,340
I go for a walk like this.

75
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,780
And it seems...

76
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,080
It seems...

77
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,820
It seems...

78
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,540
I have been walking for years and years and years.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,420
And I don't know where I'm going.

80
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,300
I hear the sound leading me on.

81
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,080
And I don't know where it is taking me.

82
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,480
I see people rushing someplace.

83
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,980
They seem to know where they're going.

84
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,980
And they're getting there in such a hurry.

85
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,600
But where am I going?

86
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,580
You know where you're going.

87
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,480
Maybe you could tell me.

88
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,400
And then I could go along with you.

89
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,760
What's the matter with you, bud?

90
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,400
You in a fog?

91
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,380
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,680
I figure that someday everything will clear up.

93
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,320
And then I'll know where I'm going.

94
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,900
Sometimes I feel as if I'm getting closer.

95
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,760
Like now.

96
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,320
Here.

97
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,380
Here.

98
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,680
Yes, I am getting closer.

99
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,420
You hear?

100
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,180
The sound is getting louder.

101
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,840
Yes.

102
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,280
But it's getting blacker.

103
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,120
And blacker.

104
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,020
And blacker.

105
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,360
Help!

106
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,480
Help!

107
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,420
Help!

108
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,780
Help!

109
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,280
Help!

110
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,520
Help!

111
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
Help!

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:26,180
And unless and until someone or something gets you straightened around so that you know which direction to travel, you just don't amount to very much.

113
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,840
You're not worth anything to yourself and you're not worth anything to anybody else.

114
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,220
Tonight we're broadcasting violence and radicalism.

115
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,640
Tonight we're broadcasting violence and radicalism.

116
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,080
Tonight we're broadcasting violence and radicalism.

117
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,680
Tonight we're broadcasting violence and radicalism.

118
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,780
Brit!

119
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:16,860
Briton!

120
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,360
There is none righteous, no not one.

121
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,880
There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.

122
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,200
They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable.

123
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,460
There is none that doeth good, no not one.

124
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,760
Verse 14.

125
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,600
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.

126
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,180
Their feet are swift to shed blood.

127
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,880
Destruction and misery are in their way, and the way of peace have they not known.

128
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,760
There is no fear of God before them.

129
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:54,020
their eyes. These verses, whether we admit it or not, are a description of all of us before we came

130
00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:00,660
to the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. And these are for all of us. And when Paul wrote here

131
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:07,340
to the Colossians, he was saying to them, that's your past. He said in verse 21, and you that were

132
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:15,540
sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked work, yet now have dereconciled, and we

133
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:23,160
were all alienated in our minds by wicked works. That's our past. That was their past. And that's

134
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,860
our past tonight. That's the past. But the second thing we see is the present.

135
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,820
We must endeavor to permeate every facet of American society.

136
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,680
It got crowded in the closet, so we're finally coming out.

137
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:04,920
We're thumping on our Bibles and building up our clout. We're all the Lord's lieutenants,

138
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:11,580
and there's nothing we can't do to prove it. We're now making our political debut.

139
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,100
Oh, we're the moral majority.

140
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:22,020
We're holier than thou. By God, we're here to tell you what we will and won't allow.

141
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:30,020
We're out to purge the nation of its humanistic bent. A separate church and state, we've simply

142
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:37,560
given up for left. Don't get us wrong. We still believe that prayers will save our souls.

143
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,400
But when we want them answered, we'll say them at the polls. And talk about successes,

144
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,520
we're as bad as we can be.

145
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:51,480
We've moved Bonzo to D.C.

146
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,280
We socked it to McGovern and to Culver Church and by.

147
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,000
We'll stack them up like cordwood, cause God is on our side.

148
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,880
And that was just a preview of 1982.

149
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,220
What we've got planned is sure to put the fear of God in you.

150
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,700
Cause we're the moral majority.

151
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:21,980
You'd better mend your ways. When we get done with liberals, we're going after gays.

152
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,440
And once they see the light, we'll have to concentrate on Jews.

153
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,200
But what with all these commies, it'll be so hard to choose.

154
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,680
I want to talk to you about heaven.

155
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,740
You know, some of us are going to get there, and some of us are going to get there rich.

156
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,520
But no one's going anywhere on a skimpy.

157
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:54,500
You are my sheep, and as your shepherd, I want to please increase your odds for salvation.

158
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,100
As the good book says in Philodendron 713, you ain't going to get nothing for nothing.

159
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,400
It takes money to run this church, the TV programs, and my Cadillac.

160
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,720
You have any idea what just one of these little pinky rings cost me?

161
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,200
We never seem to get good press. It's always filthy lies.

162
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,060
Why, you can call my wife right now. I never proselytize.

163
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,720
And if we burn a book or two, it's cause they're so obscene.

164
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,720
And heading up our list right now is Penthouse Magazine.

165
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,780
Cause we're the moral majority. We're launching our attack.

166
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,500
We'll ride the train to glory, cause we got the inside track.

167
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,020
We've got the goods on ERA, so two has got to go.

168
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,520
They're never going to get us.

169
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:45,520


170
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:52,460
There was the slightest doubt the Bible tells us so.

171
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,360
I don't care if it rains or freezes.

172
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,300
I don't care if it rains or freezes.

173
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:22,300


174
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,580
You're peeking in your windows, looking under your bed.

175
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,940
You're searching in your closet, looking wires up to your head.

176
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,620
You're checking out your urine, you're checking it twice.

177
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,200
So there ain't no doubt about who's naughty and who's nice.

178
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,880
We listen to your records and read your magazines.

179
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,520
In order to determine which of them are true.

180
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,540
We don't like quotes from Darwin.

181
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,460
It's cool to show us texts.

182
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,460
So we're getting rid of a murder stemming ways next.

183
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,560
So praise the Lord.

184
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,380
Pass the scissors.

185
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,260
We got a lot of work to do.

186
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,320
Watch what you smoke and watch what you drink.

187
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,340
Watch what you watch and watch what you think.

188
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,380
Cause you know that we are.

189
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,360
As we cut and paste and burn and tear.

190
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,380
And cover a statue of cubic hair.

191
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,720
And pass the big leagues.

192
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,920
I'll be an accident.

193
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,440
Our kids are buying porno.

194
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,240
Right underneath their nose.

195
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,940
A picture of McDonald's.

196
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,300
In sin inducing clothes.

197
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,320
Well how can little Johnny be expected to resist.

198
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,740
Something as erotic and as temptuous as this.

199
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,940
Now we're so busy fighting.

200
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,980
To save the world from ruin.

201
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,000
That there's no time to check on what little Johnny's doing.

202
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,520
So we'll just pass the big leagues.

203
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,160
And watch what we're doing.

204
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,940
We're something out of books.

205
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,840
No more responsibility.

206
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,160
It lets us off the hook.

207
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,160
Let's face it.

208
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,480
What you see in your alley.

209
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,500
Is the only way to watch.

210
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,780
And if you want to press reviews.

211
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,540
It's simple.

212
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,240
All you gotta do is.

213
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,780
Hire some lawyers.

214
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,220
And work real hard.

215
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,080
Get on TV.

216
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,160
Soon it's likely you will be.

217
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,860
In Congress.

218
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,580
Now we got beliefs.

219
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,700
Just like you and you and you.

220
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,580
But the difference between us is.

221
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,160
That our beliefs are true.

222
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,480
Now we're talking on some talk shows.

223
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,040
And making up our facts.

224
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,520
We're thinking inconvenience.

225
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,540
So we can play a boy off the racks.

226
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,500
We're strong and getting stronger.

227
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,260
And we're starting to get away.

228
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,120
The truth is we can hardly wait.

229
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,600
Until election day.

230
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,620
We daydream of controlling.

231
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,380
The whole of government.

232
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,280
We've even found a candidate.

233
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,680
To run for president.

234
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,880
Ladies and gentlemen.

235
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,020
Mr. Pat Robertson.

236
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,080
We're so happy.

237
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,200
You've helped the world.

238
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,440
Multiple RSVPs are guess my wounds.

239
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:28,440


240
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:28,440


241
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:28,440


242
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,220
Oh yes dear friends.

243
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,460
That last one was came in a home

244
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,500
recordings sampler.

245
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:46,540
that was sent to us last week from the Free Fox group.

246
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,260
That was Voodoo Mark, dear friends, doing a song called Censored.

247
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,240
And what you're hearing now is Reverend D.K. Jones.

248
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,160
Actually, D.K. Jones and John Holbrook.

249
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,500
And what is it?

250
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,620
We've got an important message here that just walked in the door

251
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,620
about the Profit Bar.

252
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,740
Friends, there's a TABC music marathon, art auction, band auction,

253
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,720
beer bash after 12 o'clock midnight tonight.

254
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,680
Scambo birthday party with Loco Gringos, Deep Ellum Jam.

255
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Bring all donations, friends, to keep the Profit Bar open.

256
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,440
ASAP, or there will be no more tomorrow.

257
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,640
And friends, it must be serious,

258
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,980
because the Profit Bar representatives have actually

259
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,880
ventured into the very guts of the Hour of Flag

260
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,600
to deliver this message.

261
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,940
Oh, man.

262
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,160
So do it. Why not?

263
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,500
What have you got to lose?

264
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,860
A little time, maybe?

265
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,520
Why clutter up your world with a lot of hard-to-perceive subtlety?

266
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,280
You either like a thing or you don't.

267
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,560
And in your case, it's the former.

268
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,920
That's why we like you.

269
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,140
And that's why we're always looking for quicker, easier ways to tell you so.

270
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,020
Slogans.

271
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,560
Jingles.

272
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,400
Logos.

273
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,940
Ways of reaching out and touching you the way you want to be touched.

274
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,940
Slightly.

275
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,760
Were we?

276
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,420
Yes.

277
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:33,960
We were.

278
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,780
We're the real people.

279
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,800
The people who make you real.

280
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,480
So real you can almost hear yourself.

281
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,660
More real than you've ever been before.

282
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,360
But then, you've never been at all before us.

283
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,800
In fact, nothing has.

284
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,800
And not even very much of that.

285
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,640
Not even this sentence.

286
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,520
Because when we say disposable,

287
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,520
we could mean just about anything.

288
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,660
Oh, thank you, Michael Pepe.

289
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,920
Yes, I've been playing little bits and pieces of that rant for quite a...

290
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,940
One of these days, I'm just gonna force y'all to hear every bit of it.

291
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,680
Oh, with DK Jones in the background.

292
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,720
And so we move on to Plato's Nightclub by Reverend Clay Animation.

293
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,740
Another inexplicable one.

294
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,860
Yeah, I'm trying to be skeptical.

295
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,300
Try this simple test.

296
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,480
Execute a low block to defend yourself.

297
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,760
Then in order to prevent your opponent from attacking again,

298
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,720
it is recommended that you quickly apply a counterattack,

299
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,660
such as a reverse straight middle punch.

300
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,660
The primary target of this counterattack should be a counterattack.

301
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,960
The second one is to be the eyes, if possible.

302
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,540
So the opponent is first blinded before you follow through

303
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:11,000
with a second punch to the solar plexus or a kick to the groin.

304
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,580
But we must set as our goal not just limiting,

305
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:24,620
but reducing, and finally destroying these terrible weapons

306
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,660
so that they cannot destroy civilization.

307
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,640
Nothing can stop the United States of America.

308
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,040
That's the thing that separates the U.S. of A,

309
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,780
from the Red Shinks and all the mother losers.

310
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,120
And it says there are any cares or problems

311
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,760
that have been set aside, and nothing matters.

312
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,600
Remember to kick...

313
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,800
It's almost over.

314
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,980
It's called carbotrialka.

315
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,980
It's almost over.

316
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,520
It's almost over.

317
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,360
The last page in the book is turning.

318
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,180
And I bowed my head for the last time, and I said, God.

319
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,300
That's some great and beautiful music we've been playing these past four years,

320
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,540
but the way I see it from here on is shake, rattle, and roll.

321
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,840
I'm proud of the American Revolution,

322
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,500
and such a warming could be the result of the greenhouse effect.

323
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,480
I don't think any of us looks forward to people being executed.

324
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,100
I wish there never had to be one.

325
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,700
Remember Ballad of the Green Berets?

326
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,180
This is by Pink Bob.

327
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,020
Pink Bob, he calls himself.

328
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,380
Finding soldiers from the sky.

329
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,660
Fearless men who jump and die.

330
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:09,000
Men who mean just what they say.

331
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,040
The brave men of the Green Beret.

332
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,400
Silver wings upon their chests.

333
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,480
These are men, America's best.

334
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,580
One hundred men we'll test today.

335
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:40,000
But only three win the Green Beret.

336
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,320
Trained to live off nature's land.

337
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,540
Trained in combat, hand to hand.

338
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,460
Men who fight by force.

339
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,160
By night and day.

340
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,860
Courage beat.

341
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,920
From the Green Beret.

342
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,260
Silver wings upon their chests.

343
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,420
These are men, America's best.

344
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:23,540
One hundred men we'll test today.

345
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:29,940
But only three win the Green Beret.

346
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,280
Back at home a young wife waits.

347
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,460
Her Green Beret has met his fate.

348
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:48,640
He has died for those oppressed.

349
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,020
Leaving her.

350
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,520
For the poor.

351
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,700
And his last request.

352
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,260
Put silver wings on my son's chest.

353
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:07,420
Make him one of America's best.

354
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,820
He'll be a man.

355
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,780
He'll test one day.

356
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,900
And he'll win the Green Beret.

357
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,220
Cha, cha, cha.

358
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,040
Would you like to be drafted?

359
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
I wouldn't mind.

360
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,760
I plan on serving in the service anyway.

361
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,940
Well, you could probably handle a rifle or carry one of those automatic rifles very well.

362
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,600
How much do you weigh?

363
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,980
About a hundred and twenty-five.

364
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,620
Well, you gain a little weight and probably make a fine soldier.

365
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,840
Actually, there's nothing wrong with women serving in the armed forces.

366
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:52,280
The women of many nations have fought alongside their men.

367
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,380
in Nigeria, for example?

368
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,440
Well, I don't know.

369
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,200
I think that even if they are not big enough to carry a rifle and fight,

370
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,480
you could serve in death jobs.

371
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,840
It takes up the men's time that they could be fighting.

372
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,180
Did you help celebrate the women's lib movement here in Dallas recently?

373
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,600
No, sir, I didn't, because the women that want to be liberated don't want to be drafted.

374
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,980
Well, I've seen a few of these women who want to be liberated,

375
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,040
and I guarantee you that they have their problems there.

376
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,320
It will take a national movement for a man to get close to them.

377
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,480
I may say that.

378
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,020
It's going to take something.

379
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,440
I'll tell you it is.

380
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,580
All right, thank you very much, sweetheart.

381
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,480
Yes, sir.

382
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:32,760
Bye.

383
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,520
747-9981.

384
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,060
Have you seen my girlfriend?

385
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,560
She lives in a pig pen.

386
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,560
Have you seen my girlfriend?

387
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,320
I can't seem to find her.

388
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,760
Perhaps she is hiding underneath a plate of grass.

389
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,820
Let's dig the hole there.

390
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,220
Let's dig the hole there.

391
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,940
Let's dig the hole.

392
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,660
Let's dig the hole there.

393
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,940
Let's dig the hole there.

394
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,360
Let's dig the hole there.

395
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,580
Have you seen my new house?

396
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,720
Looks just like a dog house.

397
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,180
Have you seen my new house?

398
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,400
Someone saw it walking straight into the ocean.

399
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,980
Thought it was an ivory boat.

400
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,980
Let's dig the hole there.

401
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:50,640
Let's dig the hole there.

402
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,020
Let's dig the hole there.

403
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,320
Let's dig the hole there.

404
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,820
Let's dig the hole there.

405
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,300
Let's dig the hole there.

406
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,760
Let's dig the hole there.

407
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,080
Let's dig the hole there.

408
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,820
Let's dig the hole there.

409
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,400
Let's dig the hole there.

410
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,200
Let's dig the hole there.

411
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,920
Let's dig the hole there.

412
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:20,980
Let's dig the hole there.

413
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:20,980


414
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:23,920
Maybe

415
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,800
It's just a bad dream and I'll wake up soon

416
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,200
But I don't think I'll be so lucky

417
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,220
Maybe

418
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,400
It's just one of those strange days

419
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,600
When nothing's right, no, nothing seems right at all

420
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,000
Went up to a payphone on a bathroom wall

421
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,300
But I can't remember who I wanted to call

422
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,480
Operator, can you help me?

423
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,220
His wife was a spent piece of used jet trash

424
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,380
Made good Bloody Marys, kept her mouth shut most of the time

425
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,900
A little chihuahua named Carlos

426
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,580
That had some money in her pocket

427
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,420
Had some kind of skin disease and was totally blind

428
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,940
They had a thoroughly modern kitchen

429
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,700
Soft cleaning oven the whole bit

430
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,020
Frank drove a little sedan

431
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,320
They were so happy

432
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,900
We've encountered some metathons from the police

433
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,760
Attention Earth people

434
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,480
I bring you warning from the planet Expenses

435
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:42,500
We Expenselings have the power to destroy K-N-O-N

436
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,120
And the music that you love to hear

437
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,380
K-N-O-N plans to retaliate with a summer pledge drive

438
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,500
Starting June 22nd through the 28th

439
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,900
So if you want your music

440
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,020
And K-N-O-N to live

441
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,520
You had better give

442
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,560
Beware Earth people

443
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,180
Beware

444
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,920
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

445
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,580
Tonight's episode of the Hour of Slack is going to be a little bit different than the other ones we've been talking about

446
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:16,580


447
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,040
The Hour of Slack is underwritten by the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company

448
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,180
Pilgrim

449
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,160
The Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company

450
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,720
Fine purveyors of Dobbs approved church wear

451
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,940
Including t-shirts, buttons, and custom made Dobbs golf shirts

452
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,000
That's the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company

453
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,860

559-5148

457
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,440
Thanks Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company for supporting K-N-O-N

458
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,340
And the Hour of Slack

459
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,580
K-N-O-N-O-T-S-S-H-I-G-U-P-S

460
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,660
Shake

461
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,480
Shake

462
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:22,500
Shake

463
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:29,420
Going to have a good time

464
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,600
I'm gonna kind of color this as a globurger

465
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,420
I shouldn't be Также contaminating theни

466
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,720
I'm not sure I'm calling the wrong time

467
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,280
Just Pick a Line?

468
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,640
Take a letter, like a friend.

469
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,860
Take a letter, like a friend.

470
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:46,860


471
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,400
Take a letter, like a friend.

472
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,580
Take a letter, like a friend.

473
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,200
Just get crazy, girl.

474
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,060
You bet.

475
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,680
In the old times.

476
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,560
I had to.

477
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,960
I never forget.

478
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,420
Better than the day.

479
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,400
Just get crazy.

480
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,600
It's a selfish love that the originator was arrested on.

481
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,200
I'm charging you with four counts for attempted murder and illegal possession of a gun.

482
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,820
Take a letter, like a friend.

483
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,980
Take a letter, like a friend.

484
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,880
Take a letter, like a friend.

485
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:31,320
Love is gone.

486
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,440
Come on, let's get there.

487
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,000
Shucks.

488
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,540
Now I'm not sure how I'm supposed to explain that I'm giving away a gut stick that drove a vehicle.

489
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:46,540


490
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,080
I'm a fucking dubter, happy bus.

491
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,300
Tell me why you're afraid to say I'm alive.

492
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:55,760
Just better than a faffing § me.

493
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,520
Just give me five food.

494
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,600
It's been for ages with four嘛

495
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,540
anyone at home now

496
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:38,220
Oh, yes, dear friends.

497
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:45,420
This is Reverend Don Truby you're listening to off his post-hip Gnosis album.

498
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,640
And while I'm at it, I ought to...

499
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,320
Well, no, I'll get to that later.

500
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,860
This song won't last long enough for me to get to it now.

501
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,760
So we'll just go straight to the guest testimonial here.

502
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,640
Testimonial from a dear friend.

503
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,000
Around this time, a kindly reverend came along.

504
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,240
He asked me if I knew Bob as my personal savior.

505
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,940
Of course, I recoiled at such a thing.

506
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,700
Oh, no, I said.

507
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,020
I gave it the office.

508
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,760
Well, he patiently told me he knew of my inner turmoil.

509
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,580
He gave me a phone number.

510
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,780
Just a phone number.

511
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,520
Counselors will be available day and night, he told me.

512
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,800
I prepared to toss it away.

513
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,500
After all, I could make it on my own.

514
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,000
I didn't need Bob.

515
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,980
But having the answer, I was able to get rid of Bob.

516
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:34,980


517
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:34,980


518
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:34,980


519
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:34,980


520
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,180
The number began to pull at me.

521
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,180
I, one lonely night, went over to the computer

522
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,240
and with shaky fingers, dialed the number of Bulldada BBS.

523
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,780
Somehow, I made it to the subjunius files.

524
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,060
Reading through them, I knew I had arrived home.

525
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,460
They were talking about me.

526
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,620
I just had to join.

527
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,580
I knelt down and said in a loud cry,

528
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,480
Oh, Bob, I know now.

529
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,960
A heavenly sound tingles in my heart.

530
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:04,960


531
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,640
I heard it crackled in my ears.

532
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,900
The sound of being logged off for no more time.

533
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,600
Since then, the going has been rough.

534
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,460
All my friends look at me with the evil eye.

535
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,960
Look as they quickly cover themselves with wolf's bane

536
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,480
to arm themselves against me.

537
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,440
And a horror of horrors,

538
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,220
I have lost my access to that wonderful Christian BBS,

539
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,380
The Ark.

540
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,080
But I am happy in the knowledge

541
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,280
of I now know it all.

542
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,800
And Bob,

543
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,960
is responsible.

544
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,320
Bob is so neat because I tell him what his will is

545
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,200
and he lets me do it.

546
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,920
And if I want something,

547
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,560
I just put in an order with him.

548
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,600
Oh, thank you, dear Reverend Frank.

549
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,180
Now friends, I gotta talk.

550
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,540
This is the swinging love corpses running in the background here.

551
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,940
And, uh, I need to, I need to talk to you.

552
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:04,940


553
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,300
I need to, uh,

554
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,040
bring, this is a project I'm working on personally.

555
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,920
But I need help.

556
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,140
I need the help from, from y'all.

557
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,340
And that's help with drugs, dear friends.

558
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,760
I need help with drugs.

559
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,000
Uh, drugs are of interest to some of our Slack listeners,

560
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,620
I think, for, for four different kinds of reasons.

561
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,780
Well, I hope this next music coming up here is okay.

562
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,520
Uh, one reason is, of course, a lot of subgeniuses just plain like to get high.

563
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,440
And those are the Hedonites, you know,

564
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,460
the hedonistic type subgeniuses.

565
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:40,100
Second group are people with a sincere interest in, uh, altered states,

566
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,300
the kind of misto scientific interest.

567
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,440
Uh, third group is, uh, people who probably almost got killed,

568
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,820
got in the air at any rate, got in terrible trouble with drugs

569
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,400
and want to prevent it happening to others.

570
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,260
And, of course, the fourth kind is the people who hate all drugs

571
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,720
without really knowing what's going on.

572
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,000
Now, I want to put together a book.

573
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,780
I just finished my second book, so this is for real.

574
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,740
I want to put together a book of, uh,

575
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,980
haunted bad trip anecdotes, dear friends,

576
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,360
uh, in your own words, or your friends' own words.

577
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,280
Uh, I guess the, uh, only, uh, logical name for a book like this would be

578
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,920
Bummer.

579
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,380
But it'd be a, a collection of, uh, of bummer tales, folks.

580
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,300
And, uh, I want you to start sending those in.

581
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,940
I'm gonna mention this every now and then on the Hour of Slack, uh,

582
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:33,080
uh, because it's a, a socially redeemable sort of, uh, uh,

583
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,420
cause, uh, in other words, for, for the youth of America, uh,

584
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,240
who are, might be, uh, considering, uh, a heavy psychedelic dose.

585
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,760
This is the kind of thing that just might make them go,

586
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,840
heh, heh, maybe I'll wait.

587
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,080
Maybe, maybe I'll wait until I'm about 50 or so.

588
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:56,280
Uh, and for, for those who, for whom it's just too late to be helped, boy,

589
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,180
it would be a barrel of laughs.

590
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,160
So, uh, do send those in, too.

591
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,440
And I'm gonna read this box, the number again at the end of the broadcast.

592
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,920
This is also where to write for information about any of the stuff, uh, we're playing.

593
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,760
And that's, uh, write to, to Bob.

594
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:17,240
Uh, either Will or I'll probably actually, uh, open the envelope.

595
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,160
But, uh, you never know.

596
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,800
You never know.

597
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:26,460
That's Bob at P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

598
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:30,700
75214.

599
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,140
Once again, that's P.O. Box 140306.

600
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,760
Box 140306.

601
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,880
Dallas, Texas.

602
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,920
75214.

603
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,220
Hoo!

604
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,160
.

605
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,160


606
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,440
.

607
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,680
.

608
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:52,840
.

609
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,260
.

610
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:15,160
Ohhh my god.

611
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,180
Take a look at this thing.

612
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,440
It's a Sioux topping on a

613
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:16,440


614
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:16,440


615
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:16,440


616
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,900
.

617
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,520
.

618
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,060
You're mixing it up.

619
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,700
That's the educational channel.

620
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,200
No.

621
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,800
Genius hearings.

622
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,680
Look, see, there you are testifying again.

623
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,460
That's a rerun from yesterday.

624
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,960
They think they're going to fool the American public,

625
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,620
playing the same confessions over and over again.

626
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,900
Look, I was drunk.

627
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,980
I mean, that was fake.

628
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,940
I mean, that's not me.

629
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,200
You can tell that's not me.

630
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,920
That's this other Dallas guy who looks like me.

631
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,780
They paid him to get up there and confess to all sorts of ridiculous things,

632
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,060
like working for a living and so forth.

633
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,240
Things a subgenius minister would be cocked dead doing.

634
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,220
I don't get it.

635
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:13,380
Look.

636
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:19,020
And look, in fact, I mean, I don't care how repugnant the idea of prairie squid,

637
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,860
physical love with a land mollusk,

638
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:30,920
may be repugnant to some of these more polished ears of these San Francisco liberals.

639
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,820
We're going to nail these guys, let me tell you.

640
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,300
I think so.

641
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,180
We got enough lawyers.

642
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,100
We got enough money.

643
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:37,680
We got time.

644
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,220
We got press releases, I think.

645
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:40,840
That's right.

646
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,080
We have the sponsors, the listeners.

647
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
The gabble, the gabble.

648
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,680
We got it.

649
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,480
Yes, we got to keep the sponsors happy, PM.

650
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,220
Now, I've got a great new program in mind.

651
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,980
If you can just sit down in the conference room and we'll review it.

652
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,620
Okay, well.

653
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,720
Show it to us.

654
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,660
Plug it into the VCR here.

655
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,220
Yes, let's put it on the stand and see who testifies.

656
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,780
What to do if you are confronted with excessive show.

657
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,260
Okay.

658
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,120
Okay, we can spin off.

659
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,080
We can have a spin off.

660
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,600
There's a lift.

661
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,440
It is charming.

662
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:22,940
I'm not sure having a computer generated Robbins there is a two derivative.

663
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,560
Good afternoon.

664
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,180
I am a Hal 1000 computer.

665
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:41,200
Well, the survey tested 25 suggestive words and phrases,

666
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,060
all less sensitive than the...

667
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,220
famous quote seven dirty words.

668
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:52,120
Turns receiving the highest unfavorable reaction were prairie squid, slack.

669
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,240
Very good.

670
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:53,640
Absolutely.

671
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,220
I'm a challenge.

672
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,600
Hello, this is Dr. Chris and your tour to WFMU,

673
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,480
pathologically speaking,

674
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,740
where I will, uh,

675
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:18,460
try to educate the public on everything you've always wanted to know about prairie squid,

676
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,160
but were afraid to ask.

677
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,960
Most people today,

678
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,780
whether they are single,

679
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,620
married,

680
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,900
divorced,

681
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:26,720
monogamous,

682
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,600
gregarious,

683
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,560
or even downright slutty,

684
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:34,520
are unaware of the importance of the nearly instinct prairie squid.

685
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,880
This widespread ignorance is the cause of much dissatisfaction with regards to our slippery habits.

686
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,900
For sake of saving our went-on, we will make a list of the reasons before We invite Dr. Geoffrey Tellman.

687
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,040
That prairie squid

688
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,780
is an intelligent,

689
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,140
albeit wild,

690
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:50,960

00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,460
whose body is long, tubular,

693
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,580

a copious amount of black ink. It is this ink that is used to enhance the sensations

704
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:27,480
inherent in what the teenagers of today anachronistically call squidding. It is sad to note that our

705
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:33,420
friend, the prairie squid, is no longer an integral part of our modern relationship.

706
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:39,460
They have been shunned by the puritanical segment of society and have been herded into

707
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:45,540
these so-called prairie squid reservations. It is on these reservations that the prairie

708
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:52,540
squid is harassed, abused, and what have you, by the neo-Nazi groups who even go so far

709
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:59,100
as to leech these creatures. They become self-pitying, fourth-class citizen mollusks, suffering from

710
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:06,660
such psychological problems as alcoholism, drug abuse, gambling, depression, and most

711
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,820
tragically, suicide.

712
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,440
There is a whole range of ways to destroy the prairie squid, including the use of sex

713
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:09,440


714
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:09,440


715
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,540
future for the prairie squids thanks to the efforts of the subgenius foundation

716
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:21,380
they are establishing save our prairie squid centers all across the US to

717
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:26,460
combat the malicious neglect and prejudice against the prairie squid food

718
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:31,740
shelter and recreation programs utilizing purient underground adult

719
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:37,120
comic books are just at the beginning for our struggle to reinstate the prairie

720
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:43,080
squids to the rightful place in the master bedrooms of the world but this

721
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:49,220
this requires money and the subgenius foundations funds for the SOPS programs

722
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:54,920
are dwindling to dangerous levels so please would you find it in your heart

723
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,280
to give to the save our prairie squid program for more information write to

724
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:06,500
the subgenius foundation at P O box 14030

725
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,300
306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

726
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,520
And always remember, use condiments and good squidding.

727
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:39,000
They shall be from the third book of Gaddis, the words of the prophet

728
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,760
McCandless.

729
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:45,500
And he said unto them, if there are forces of evil in Hypochondria,

730
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,920
then they have to be the fundamentalists.

731
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,220
Look you at the brawls over equal time in the schools for teaching evolution

732
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:56,200
and this laundered genesis they palm off as creation science.

733
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,580
Well, there can't be a creation without a creator.

734
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,700
If there's a clock, there must be a clockmaker.

735
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,280
Oh, they've got all the answers.

736
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,200
Show them a zircon from Mount Naria in Australia that's 4 billion years old.

737
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,080
Show them these fossilized skeletons of Proconsul Africanus from 18 million

738
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,440
years.

739
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,040
They're just a bunch of

740
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:37,200
They'll point to a billion-year-old Precambrian rocks on top of Cretaceous shale to disprove

741
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,320
geological sequence and lump the whole thing into the flood.

742
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,420
And God destroyed the earth's inhabitants with water because of man's wickedness.

743
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,700
And Noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark.

744
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,180
And the whole geological record goes down into 40 days of rain.

745
00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:00,160
They go on and on about how we've been brainwashed by evolution theory, but we can't produce

746
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,940
the missing link.

747
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:05,720
Then they jump on the Piltdown fraud and the Nebraska man that turned out to be a pig's

748
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:05,920
tooth.

749
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,760
So the missing link is a fraud.

750
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,860
Evolution is all a fraud.

751
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,280
Geology, astronomy, physics, all of it's a fraud.

752
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,500
But there's nothing in there about the flood that's going to change the future of the world.

753
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,480
Nothing about the fossil fragments of the Samburu hills where the strat is 15 million years

754
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:19,860
old.

755
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:25,540
Nothing about those fossil bones and 3 million years of volcanic ash up in the Afar triangle.

756
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,660
Nothing about all those hominin fossils at that site in the Gregory Rift.

757
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:33,740
No, they wanted the missing link produced right now.

758
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:38,440
And you know the whole time it was standing up there in front of them, braying about the

759
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,680
powers of darkness.

760
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:45,400
It's not my word is likened to the fire, saith the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks

761
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:45,900
off the rock.

762
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,640
Well, yes, stupidity is like that.

763
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,680
You put a hammer in its hand and everything looks like a nail.

764
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,440
It's the same thing they're up to out there on the television channels.

765
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:00,480
That video freak show telling the ignorant that this fool, gospel witnessing is the only

766
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,760
weapon we've got against the spread of Marxism even unto darkest Africa.

767
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,220
Fighting those forces of evil that want to stop their glorious mission of spreading stupidity

768
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,200
from one end of a dark continent to the other.

769
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,440
And I'm not talking about ignorance, friends.

770
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,940
I'm talking about stupidity.

771
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:21,020
If you want ignorance, you can find it right there at that site on Lake Rudolph, right

772
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,260
up there in the Gregory Rift.

773
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:27,660
Hominid fossils, stone tools, hippo bones, all of it caught in a volcanic burst two or

774
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,600
three million years ago.

775
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,700
That was ignorance.

776
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,980
But that was also the dawn of intelligence.

777
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,080
And what we have here and now is its eclipse.

778
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,840
Stupidity is the deliberate cultivation of ignorance.

779
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,620
That's what we've got here.

780
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:44,420
These smug born again idiots with their pious minds.

781
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:44,420


782
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,820
They just can't stand the idea that they're descended from that gang at Lake Rudolph banging

783
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,640
around with their stone hammers trying to learn something.

784
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,480
No, no.

785
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,840
They think God put them here in their cheap suits and their bad neckties in his own image.

786
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:03,660
Did you know that almost half the damn people in this country believe that man was created

787
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,760
about eight or 10,000 years ago, pretty much like he is today?

788
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:07,680
That's right.

789
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,260
They believe that.

790
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,740
All of this despite the fossil record going back billions of years.

791
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:14,400
And they're not just trying to make us believe that.

792
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:14,400


793
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:14,400


794
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,680
And of course, the record is full of gaps, full of arguments as to how evolution really

795
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,120
happened.

796
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,560
And so they use those to say that it never did happen.

797
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,720
We have the questions and they have all the answers.

798
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,100
They dress up Genesis and call it science.

799
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,860
They go back from Malachi counting up all those begats and begats and begats.

800
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:40,160
And the creation took place on October 26, 4004 B.C. at 9 a.m. bingo.

801
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,180
Now that's what they call the scientific method.

802
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,220
Anybody see it?

803
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:44,400
No.

804
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:44,400


805
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:44,400


806
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:44,400


807
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:44,400


808
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:44,400


809
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:44,400


810
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:44,400


811
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:44,400


812
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:44,400


813
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:44,560
No.

814
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,900
It's revealed.

815
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,060
Yes, friends.

816
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,080
It's revealed right here in the first couple of pages of Genesis.

817
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,920
It's what you call revealed wisdom.

818
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:57,620
We talk about having business with the Bible, walk down any street and smack over Georgia.

819
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:02,020
Somebody you've never seen in your life comes right up and asks you if you've been saved,

820
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,700
if it was any of his damn business.

821
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:04,940
But he thinks it is.

822
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,940
The prevailing IQ in this country is about 100 or slightly lower.

823
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,340
Great dogs talk about Africa, the dark continent.

824
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,180
This is the dark continent.

825
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:14,400
It's a dark continent.

826
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:14,400


827
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:14,400


828
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:14,400


829
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:14,400


830
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:14,400


831
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:14,400


832
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:14,400


833
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:20,980
And I'll tell you something, this revelation, revelation is the last refuge ignorance finds

834
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,720
for reason.

835
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:27,160
Revealed truth is the one weapon stupidity's got against intelligence.

836
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,760
And that's what the whole damn thing is all about.

837
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:36,400
Look at that judge down in Georgia who said that until textbooks were changed to the Christian

838
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,220
ethic, there was no possibility that crime, violence, venereal disease and abortion rates

839
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:42,860
would decrease.

840
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,380
And what about that?

841
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,880
What about those charming literary hit squads right here in Texas who keep an eye out for

842
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,640
school books and undermine patriotism, free enterprise, religion or parental authority?

843
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,140
Nothing official, of course, just your good American vigilante spirit hunting things down.

844
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:05,240
Well, you can't have books that erode absolute values by asking questions to which they offer

845
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,380
no firm answers.

846
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,920
You see, you can't do that.

847
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,120
Same damn thing all over.

848
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,420
We've got a lot of questions, but they've got all the answers.

849
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:17,240
And they're up there busy advising the state committees on school books.

850
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:22,800
And there must be over 25 states in the union where school boards cannot buy textbooks that

851
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,620
have not been selected by the state committee.

852
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:30,440
Boy, you think Texas want one that talks about land distribution in Central America or any

853
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,060
place else?

854
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,340
You think Mississippi wants a history book that tells the kids that Nat Turner was anything

855
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,220
but a coon show?

856
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:39,980
You talk about censorship and they'll howl like stuck pigs.

857
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,140
No, no, no, they don't censor.

858
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,400
They let the publisher do it for them.

859
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,200
60, 70 million dollars a year.

860
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,960
That's what Texas spends on school books.

861
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,140
And with that kind of money, the addition is so big it wipes out anything else.

862
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,900
Well, do you think any publisher wants to stay in business and make money?

863
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:56,860
It's not easy.

864
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:03,000
Oh, dear friends, that was the amazing and startling G. Gordon Gordon.

865
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,120
I'm not sure when that thing ends.

866
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,780
That rant, for all I know, could go on for days.

867
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,380
If this cassette was in the air, it would be a great thing.

868
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:13,380


869
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:13,380


870
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:13,380


871
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:13,380


872
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:13,380


873
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:13,380


874
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:13,380


875
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:13,380


876
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,660
Yeah, it's a 24 hour cassette.

877
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,340
Sure enough.

878
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,040
I bet it does.

879
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,900
Oh, once again, you can write for that information.

880
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,840
From P.O.

881
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:30,380
Box 1403 06, Dallas, Texas 75214.

882
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,500
So spookier than ever.

883
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,020
No, he wasn't drunk.

884
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,220
He was.

885
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,120
It was just his way.

886
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,360
Yeah.

887
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:49,460
What?

888
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,320
You ordered through specials.

889
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:51,720
What's wrong?

890
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,800
This will mean the extinction of all existing life forms.

891
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,200
You haven't even tasted it yet.

892
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,100
What do you ask?

893
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,160
You know, how silly.

894
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,440
It's like a psychic boomerang.

895
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,280
I can't believe this planet.

896
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,400
Fried eggs.

897
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:08,960
Yeah.

898
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,800
Oh, well.

899
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:11,740
Tastes like a chicken.

900
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:11,740


901
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:11,740


902
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:11,740


903
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:11,740


904
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:11,800


905
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:11,800


906
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:11,800


907
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:11,800


908
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:11,800


909
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:11,800


910
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:11,800


911
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:11,800


912
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:11,800


913
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:11,800


914
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,520
What happened?

915
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,100
How the hell did you do that?

916
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,420
My powers are growing.

917
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,600
Watch out!

918
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,480
It is time now.

919
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:24,360
What's that?

920
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,120
It is the code key.

921
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,000
It will activate the laser spectroscope when I use it tonight

922
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,420
to bring down the other dark overlords.

923
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,200
The others?

924
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,860
Now he's got a whole gang.

925
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,260
Well, screw them.

926
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:38,460
Then he thought to himself,

927
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,180
our timing will be perfect.

928
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:45,000
The eggs will hatch at the exact moment we land.

929
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:50,460
No one in the Shining Realm suspects what is about to happen,

930
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,120
not even Dargon.

931
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,820
The rest will be history.

932
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,460
Oh, piss.

933
00:53:59,020 --> 00:53:59,860
Holy piss.

934
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,980
It's a horrible thing, this show.

935
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:05,840
It is.

936
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,020
And no one's ever treated it off, either.

937
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:08,820
Yeah.

938
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,480
If ignorant isn't bliss,

939
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,160
I don't know what...

940
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:11,720
I don't know what it is.

941
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,020
But maybe it's not bliss.

942
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,960
Well, who knows?

943
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:15,600
It's easy.

944
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,220
Ah, radio.

945
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,520
All over you.

946
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,580
We'll be awake soon.

947
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,040
Okay.

948
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,940
What we'd like to do now, of course,

949
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,020
is remember the...

950
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,260
which a lot of people would miss.

951
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,820
And the bus plugs...

952
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,360
That was easy.

953
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,720
...up the bridge and into the icy...

954
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,280
Now I can comprehend.

955
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,200
...yacht of Potawatomi.

956
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,380
Now I genuinely understand.

957
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,420
But what's that button report?

958
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,440
...wise one...

959
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,900
...is lost at this particular time.

960
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,340
That's what it really...

961
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,120
...is.

962
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:41,140
...is.

963
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:41,140


964
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:41,140


965
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:41,140


966
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:41,140


967
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:41,140


968
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:41,140


969
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:41,140


970
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:41,140


971
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:41,140


972
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:41,380
...opens as.

973
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,540
We learned how to do that some years ago,

974
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,560
and now look at us.

975
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,300
We are here, successfully on the air.

976
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,580
YouTube caller can have this show if you want.

977
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,660
Just come on down and don't play stuff like that.

978
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,020
You'd better listen up, general public, because...

979
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:56,060
If you obey society's rules,

980
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,700
you will be society's fools.

981
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,460
You will obey, and then disobey.

982
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:07,120
You disobey, but then you'll obey.

983
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:08,860
You'll obey.

984
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,480
You'll obey, and then you'll obey.

985
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,980
You'll obey, and then you'll obey.

986
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:14,460
You'll obey.

987
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:14,460


988
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:14,460


989
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,680
It's kind of a relative thing,

990
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,220
and so we've got to expand.

991
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,100
Sooner or later, the church of the subgenius

992
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,160
will be able to have food outreaches

993
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,980
and, you know, deliver pieces of Bob's body

994
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,060
to all those starving people out there.

995
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,760
First, I'll have to praise Bob first.

996
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,300
Um, Reverend Stang,

997
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,260
what's the slack situation out in the third world?

998
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,200
I mean, do they have slack over in, let's say,

999
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,060
some of those emerging African nations?

1000
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,660
Or over in Southeast Asia?

1001
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,660
Yeah, we have worked in Africa,

1002
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,920
particularly around Nairobi,

1003
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:49,620
and also in China.

1004
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,720
And those people understand,

1005
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,600
intuitively understand slack better

1006
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,720
than most of we so-called civilized peoples.

1007
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,760
You know, it's like slack is something...

1008
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,760
It's something you're born with, friends.

1009
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,940
All of you, all of you were born with original slack.

1010
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,320
But the conspiracy comes and takes it away.

1011
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,920
And in the third world,

1012
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,680
the conspiracy is stronger,

1013
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,620
but slack is also stronger.

1014
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,460
So when Bob gets into the third world,

1015
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,820
which is happening now,

1016
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,780
of course, he has to...

1017
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,080
In China, he's called Bong.

1018
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,420
And in Africa, he looks different.

1019
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,020
But it's still the same.

1020
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:27,980
It's the same Bob.

1021
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,600
The same Bob, friends!

1022
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:31,080
Because Bob does not change.

1023
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:31,760
He's ever changing.

1024
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,920
But it's the same Bob.

1025
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:35,700
Praise Bob.

1026
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,440
There you go.

1027
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,340
Get along, little Bobbies.

1028
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,220
Praise Bob.

1029
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,240
We're coming near to the harvest, dear friends.

1030
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,960
If you would like to call here at the radio station,

1031
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,960
once again, you can talk to the Reverend Harvey Stang

1032
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,760
or the Reverend D.K. Jones

1033
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,020
or Sister Cress, the high priestess of slack here,

1034
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,960
201-266-79.

1035
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,060
Oh, what a lie.

1036
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,880
What a lie.

1037
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,920
We should mention that.

1038
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,460
Yeah, we should mention that.

1039
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,380
That's actually not the...

1040
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,120
That wasn't even the station you were listed to.

1041
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:11,040
And that wasn't the right phone number.

1042
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:11,660
Neither.

1043
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:12,680
And it doesn't matter,

1044
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,860
because you need to stay tuned for Robert Wisdom's show,

1045
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,820
American Music Party, coming right up.

1046
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:22,740
And it was off of his show that I taped this song,

1047
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,980
which is not in my collection.

1048
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,880
This is Screamin' Jay Hawkins.

1049
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:30,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

1050
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,300
most people record songs about love,

1051
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:36,620
heartbreak,

1052
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:38,500
loneliness,

1053
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:39,200
loneliness,

1054
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,020
being broke,

1055
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,080
and being hurt.

1056
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:43,100
And I'm not kidding.

1057
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:47,760
Nobody's actually went out and recorded a song about real pain.

1058
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,640
The band and I have just returned from the general hospital

1059
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,800
where we caught a man in the right position.

1060
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,620
We named this song

1061
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,100
Constipation Blues.

1062
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:02,740
Constipation Blues.

1063
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,340
Constipation Blues.

1064
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,360
Constipation Blues.

1065
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:08,940
Constipation Blues.

1066
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,040
Constipation Blues.

1067
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,460
Constipation Blues.

1068
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,280
Constipation Blues.

1069
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,600
Constipation Blues.

1070
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:34,600


1071
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:34,780
Constipation Blues.

1072
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:34,780


1073
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:34,780


1074
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:34,780


1075
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:34,780


1076
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:34,780


1077
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:34,780


1078
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:34,780


1079
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:34,780


1080
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:34,780


1081
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:34,780


1082
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:34,780


1083
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,160
Constipation Blues.

1084
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:41,260
Oh!

1085
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,300
Huh? Let it go!

1086
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,420
Let it go! Let it go! Let it go!

1087
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:14,100
Don't believe I can take much more

1088
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,140
Let it go

1089
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:17,700
Hey!

1090
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:18,640
Hey!

1091
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,020
Oh!

1092
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:27,300
Lot of pain down inside

1093
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,040
Won't be denied

1094
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,080
Every time I try

1095
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,120
I can't be saved

1096
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,260
Let it go

1097
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:47,020
Let it go

1098
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:47,020


1099
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:47,960
Oh!

00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,720
Let it go!

1101
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,280
Let it go!

1102
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,240
Let it go!

1103
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,860
Oh!

1104
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,020
Oh!

1105
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,620
This pain down inside

1106
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,580
Just won't let me be satisfied

1107
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:14,700
Let it go

1108
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:21,620
Let it go

1109
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:22,680
Oh!

1110
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,440
Oh!

1111
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:24,940
