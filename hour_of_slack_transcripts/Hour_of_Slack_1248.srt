1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:16,640
No. No, stay where you are. For this is a time of slack. This is the slack hour.

2
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,800
Hey, you guys know-

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:26,600
Hey, you guys know-

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,700
I got a robe and a pretty nice ring. You bet that brotherhood's a wonderful thing.

5
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:46,440
Guess what? I'm amazing now, and you better take care if you want to stay on the good side of the guy who's got the secret handshake.

6
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,060
Hey, you guys know-

7
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:59,460
Should we talk about the governments that I control? Should we talk about the hands of fate, the dice they roll?

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,820
But the secret things you'll never see. The secret man you'll never be. The secret room that has no windows.

9
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:28,320
Too late to make amends, cause the wheel's in motion now. So get up off your knees, try to carry on somehow.

10
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,000
You can't escape it, so you better not try. Now there's some friends of mine who'd like to say hi.

11
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:46,800
Guess what? I'm amazing now, and you better take care if you want to stay on the good side of the guy who's got the secret handshake.

12
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,560
Hey, girl!

13
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,120
Yes, you better pick up on it. Jonathan Colton, I'm amazing now.

14
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,980
From an album you can find out about on jonathancolton.com.

15
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,580
Colton with C-O-U-L.

16
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,480
Thanks to Dr. Legume for showing us Jonathan Colton.

17
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:14,460
This hour of slack will be easy for me since it's mostly a puzzling evidence show from KPFA Berkeley, February 22nd,

18
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,960
with Dr. Howell, Dr. Philodrummon, which I've already edited, which was hard.

19
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:29,800
The rest is by the great Mr. Fernandinani Lemur, except for little clips here and there by The Large and some music coming up.

20
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,020
Now, let's go on the air with puzzling evidence.

21
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,260
Hello. You're on the air.

22
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,540
Hello.

23
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,920
Hello, Nina. You're on the air.

24
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,100
What are you doing?

25
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:52,620
We're doing just fine here, washing ourselves and the little fins of the bombs in the beauty of the dead guy on a stick.

26
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,500
What are you doing right now?

27
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,960
Just standing here watching Jesus.

28
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,720
You are?

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,400
Yep.

30
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,520
Are you masturbating too?

31
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,020
No, no, no. I'm watching Jesus.

32
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,260
He's sleeping with that...

33
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,480
He's finishing the mail.

34
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,580
...wood that you hear on the radio?

35
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,800
We are the guys on the radio, yes.

36
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,880
Oh. Well, I don't know if I'm on the radio or not.

37
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,480
Am I on the radio?

38
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,660
No, I'm not.

39
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,200
Look! White man, come now!

40
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,980
The old captain.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,620
Captain made an impressive picture with his white semen on his shoulder.

42
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,120
Take some slack.

43
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,420
He used to be tough as new hemp, but he's getting a bit rusty in the joints.

44
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,800
Yes?

45
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,100
A bad epidemic of smocks has broken out in the Indian village.

46
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:45,680
Smocks?

47
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,560
You know, these Indians, they're contaminated and they'll spread the disease everywhere.

48
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,580
Yes, I know.

49
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,740
They'll spread the disease worse than ever.

50
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,300
Doctor.

51
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:53,960
Yes?

52
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,500
Yes.

53
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,780
I just thought of something.

54
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,600
Captain?

55
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,780
How could you do?

56
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,320
Captain, burn furs.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,860
Well, start right now.

58
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,060
I'll spread smocks to the Indians tomorrow.

59
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,720
Ah, that was good work, Preston.

60
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,540
Yes, it was, Doctor.

61
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,700
It's a bad epidemic.

62
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,620
Many joy.

63
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,960
Go to Skipper King.

64
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,640
Come on.

65
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,520
Him talk to do.

66
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,300
Hey, boy.

67
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,100
Get up.

68
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,880
Burn furs.

69
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,700
Burn furs.

70
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,360
Burn furs.

71
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,580
Burn furs.

72
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,800
Burn furs.

73
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,760
Burn furs.

74
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,560
Burn furs.

75
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,320
Burn furs.

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,020
He's got smocks.

77
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,700
The early Yukon Doan brewed them.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,120
Tea.

79
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:42,000
The furthest to the right on the Laugh-O-Meter was during that phase of the measurement time.

80
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,620
And there's a piece of toast.

81
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,700
Oh, okay.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,760
Well, all right.

83
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,680
Your toast is ready.

84
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,000
Remarkable what they can do these days with their high technology.

85
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,180
The Toast-O-Matic 3000 is the ultimate edge of the technological envelope

86
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,260
in the thinking toaster.

87
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:09,860
With the inbuilt computer chip, this toaster not only knows how you like your toast, but

88
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,040
when you want it.

89
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,440
And materializes...

90
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,360
There's more ready right now.

91
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,140
...atomic matter.

92
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,720
This toast is from the future.

93
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,040
Yes.

94
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,180
The atoms are actually retrograde.

95
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,280
The grain that this toast is made out of hasn't even been grown yet.

96
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,680
Throughout this piece of toast.

97
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,640
It hasn't even been harvested from the plants from which it will someday be grown.

98
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:39,860
Well, the dust traveling through time has reversed its atomic structure and...

99
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,360
That's okay.

100
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,420
It's already been sold on some futures market.

101
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,280
Yeah.

102
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,040
And resold and sold and forgotten about and resold.

103
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,580
Do you know about the little white tablet?

104
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,660
To bring your ass under the sun.

105
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:56,660


106
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:56,920
Control.

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,300
Best for any kind of ass distress.

108
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,200
Only 49 cents.

109
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,800
From PR News in Washington, I'm expanding.

110
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:13,960
Walgreens reports today the Commerce Department rose at a faster than expected rate in Palo Alto, California.

111
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,800
The government rose at an annual rate of 591.8%.

112
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,600
Rose down after falling by 1.5%.

113
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,560
On Wall Street, 2310291.

114
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,420
622.

115
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,920
President Obama is hailing PR News at a faster than expected rate.

116
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,280
Republicans charge the program hasn't created a second depression the administration promised.

117
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,160
The president says this is PR News.

118
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,300
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has entered Dubai on a fake British passport.

119
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,340
Gordon Brown's name on a list in a hotel.

120
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,840
At the Vancouver Olympics, a suspected U.S. drone is showing some signs of improvement.

121
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,580
Suspected American drone is 16.

122
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,380
The United States is the 13th in the lineup.

123
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,060
Toyota is reviewing dozens of complaints about PR News in Washington.

124
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,460
And the contempt for human life, even the tenderest, shown by the mighty.

125
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,140
This leads me down another aisle of discontent.

126
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,120
Not my discontent, it's just an aisle of discontent.

127
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,040
I don't know what I'm doing on it because I'm actually very contented.

128
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,840
But I just wanted to see what was on this aisle and it's kind of gloomy.

129
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,640
The aisle is full of people.

130
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,260
Full of voices and mysterious spirits.

131
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,660
Yes, disgruntled employees.

132
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,580
It's one of these haunted islands.

133
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,400
Like the island of Colossa.

134
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,200
Like the island of...

135
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,300
Or Skull Island.

136
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,040
Oh well.

137
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:42,620
Oh yes.

138
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,960
But those days are gone.

139
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,000
Skull Island sank in 1934.

140
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,280
The lost city of CORE was destroyed.

141
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:07,520
Was that before or after the implementation of their new system of jurisprudence?

142
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:18,380
Well, you know, I think the fuss created when she, who was not to be disobeyed,

143
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:24,420
consumed herself accidentally in the pillar of the fire of eternity,

144
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,140
which was supposed to revive her immortal self,

145
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,240
instead shriveling her on the spot into an hideous mummy

146
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,140
before the horrified eyes of the arctic travelers.

147
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,800
Everyone else gets you.

148
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
Then maybe I'll get you.

149
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,660
Maybe then I'll get you.

150
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,700
Maybe then I'll get a chance at getting you.

151
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,580
But until then, I can't have you.

152
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,040
I can't have peace.

153
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,120
Until everybody's got peace.

154
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,280
A piece of peace.

155
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,800
But everybody thinks the way to get peace is this.

156
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,580
Give me a piece of peace.

157
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,700
I'd like to get a piece of peace.

158
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,560
Alright, now get up off the ground.

159
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,480
My peace from up off the ground

160
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,000
come from the hills of Kentucky,

161
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,420
come from the hard times,

162
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,400
bologna for Sunday dinner,

163
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,260
come from the heart of Bing Crosby,

164
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,560
uh, Frank Sinatra.

165
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,560
You know, I'm the other end of your society.

166
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,840
You know, so you can ride your bicycles and do your thing.

167
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,100
You know?

168
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,480
What do you mean?

169
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,260
I mean I think you're lying.

170
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,800
Well, what can I say?

171
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,740
You will say plenty.

172
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,940
Thank you.

173
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,900
What's the meaning of this?

174
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,140
What's the meaning of this?

175
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,420
What?

176
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,520
Don't forget you are simply better than everyone else.

177
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,400
So try, always try to remind them of it.

178
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,460
I know, the fog turns me on, okay?

179
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,380
Okay.

180
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,840
Is that the only thing that turns you on?

181
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,040
Redefine the point of every argument until you win.

182
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,180
I'm gonna give it to you straight up.

183
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,000
That's something my friend Puzzling Ed has told me just recently.

184
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,360
You pardon my Texas land.

185
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,320
And I learned from that.

186
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,620
You can hear the sun rises and it sets with me.

187
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,420
Of course, check your argument for logic flaws.

188
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,400
If you find any, be prepared to scream more shrilly at this point of your argument.

189
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,240
And blame any unarguable counterpoints on your predecessor.

190
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,960
If you don't have a predecessor, simply target the patsy.

191
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:34,560
Be prepared to scream like a wounded eunuch when you see a tiny spider walking on the bridge of your nose.

192
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,700
Always frame every conversation by how someone else's behavior keeps you from achieving your goals.

193
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,280
Don't take any guff when you strut your stuff.

194
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,440
Always use terms like you always or you never when establishing blame.

195
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,080
What?

196
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,640
Keep your feet on the floor and always watch the door.

197
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,320
Anyone who doesn't share your opinion is either stupid or ignorant or both.

198
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,700
Always stop for a red flag waving and stay on the rails no matter what.

199
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,000
Take this opportunity to belabor that point to them for a while.

200
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,080
Be sure you're right, then go ahead.

201
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:14,500
People within earshot appreciate it when you remind them of your current mood every 20 to 30 minutes.

202
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,380
You can't underestimate how important this information is to everyone else in order to help them plan their day.

203
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,880
Never, never apologize.

204
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,060
You must be always right.

205
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,600
Don't let a conversation go by without becoming the object of it.

206
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:38,660
The most frightening words you can hear are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.

207
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,460
Always talk on your cell phone way too loud every place you go, particularly in elevators and used cars.

208
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:45,940
Hello!

209
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,580
Because people really want to keep up with all of your coordination.

210
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:56,980
Better to throw the food in the street than give the kiddies too much to eat, but better belly burst than good meat spilt.

211
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,680
Assume that when people talk about you behind your back it's because your greatness makes them jealous and feel inferior.

212
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:10,640
You fly pie and apple pen downy makes your eyes light up and your stomachs hang out.

213
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,840
You are great.

214
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,180
Don't deny the world the opportunity to learn from your greatness.

215
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,660
They will love you for it.

216
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,300
How right.

217
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:27,840
And don't forget what may, to some, may, should have been the first rule would have been in any interaction.

218
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,720
Make sure you have targeted the patsy so that everyone knows who to blame the bad stuff on.

219
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,840
I wear long red woolen underwear winter and summer.

220
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,180
I only wear woolens.

221
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,960
And that's rules for jerks and dominant people.

222
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,840
Cranks and quips and walton wiles.

223
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,280
Nods and becks and wreathed smiles.

224
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:52,840
Don't forget.

225
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,560
That's it.

226
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,300
You are simply better.

227
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:57,440
Is the show over?

228
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,460
Oh, no, we've got to forget everyone else.

229
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,180
Sorry, folks.

230
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,740
I didn't know we had just came in and slept.

231
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,780
I always try to remind them of it.

232
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,440
Don't tell me what to do.

233
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,780
I don't like people telling me what to do.

234
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,100
I just come from a place people tell me what to do all my life.

235
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,400
And I tried to shake two or three of them, but they were pretty smart.

236
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,280
I will never grow up as far as they're concerned.

237
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,400
And I kind of agree with them.

238
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,840
Sixteen years old in my world,

239
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,860
and the people living in the streets are generally about,

240
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,140
at sixteen, generally about fifty-five in their minds.

241
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,920
They've done been through more life and death situations

242
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,520
than the average straight-line little house in the rows

243
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,900
dude going back and forward doing what the mother says, going to school.

244
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,260
In other words, life is not in the school books.

245
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,540
You go anywhere off any bus,

246
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,640
you get down off the bus,

247
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,460
oh no, you're broke, you go to the phone, you call moms.

248
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,480
I don't.

249
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,840
I get off the bus, and I go in the aisle and get a tire iron.

250
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,960
And I do whatever I have to do to survive.

251
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,880
See, I was raised up, I may have come from baloney for Sunday dinner,

252
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,960
but I was raised up where you didn't fight, you got .

253
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,060
I can't read and write, but I fight very well.

254
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,520
And so we do

255
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,660
as we discover that when algae create chlorophyll,

256
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,780
quantum events, quantifiable quantum events occur.

257
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,220
In the future, there'll be automobiles made from algae.

258
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,140
That's right, and they'll run on algae.

259
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,900
Algae will do everything.

260
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,160
Now, under normal rules,

261
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,340
electrons travel to their destinations with quick random hops,

262
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,440
but studies of photosynthetic bacteria

263
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,940
and plants suggest that the electrons might act more like correlated waves

264
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,840
instead of particles.

265
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,580
They shift like it's quantum mechanics.

266
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,000
Quantum hopping, they call it now.

267
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,180
These studies have mainly seen such quantum effects at very low temperatures.

268
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,600
That's what they do in the lab.

269
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,260
But this happens at like normal room temperature.

270
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,200
Try a little quantum eating.

271
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,300
These plants are propagating quantum waves at room temperature,

272
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,500
not in a super controlled, super cooled lab.

273
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,920
You know, that's cheating.

274
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,080
Algae, one of the simplest plants known, can do this.

275
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,580
Well, I'll be a son of a gun.

276
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,300
I'll be a son of a gun, Dr. Howell.

277
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,780
How about you?

278
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,260
Quantum weirdness is at work,

279
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,720
even in life, in these nondescript plants.

280
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,960
Can you imagine if it happens there,

281
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,940
what is happening in our own bodies?

282
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,760
Fake bean sandwich.

283
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,160
What?

284
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,380
Sandwich.

285
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:40,760
Ugh.

286
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,480
Served.

287
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:42,900
No.

288
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:42,980
No?

289
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,220
Ugh.

290
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,000
Ugh.

291
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,160
Uh.

292
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,720
That was Jeremy Davies playing Charlie Manson.

293
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,680
One of my hobbies is collecting cameras.

294
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,460
Normal people will check lens or mechanism.

295
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,900
But I have a special method.

296
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,440
A smell.

297
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,880
Smell camera.

298
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,340
Good smell is good camera.

299
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,660
Bad smell or no smell, that is bad camera.

300
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,740
That corner is for amateur.

301
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,700
This corner is for professional people.

302
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,820
Yeah, this is nicer smell.

303
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,580
All right.

304
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:41,280
But what we need to discover the most is the redirection of violence

305
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,220
into the paths of righteousness.

306
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,340
You mean violent righteousness for a change instead of passive?

307
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,300
No, that's self-righteousness.

308
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,140
There we go.

309
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,540
We're redirecting some of the violence toward, uh, oops, sorry.

310
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,420
Now there is an ancient theory that causes the geographic region

311
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,780
to culture civilizations.

312
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,440
You don't mind if I pillage and rape your Sims village, do you?

313
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:05,960
No, I don't mind.

314
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:05,960


315
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:05,960


316
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,040
Turn to faith in the conceit of divine right

317
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,060
to justify their dominion, to justify their rule of power.

318
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,760
Yes, the evil power that they wielded.

319
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,540
From the Orthodox Christianity of the Eastern Roman Empire

320
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,220
to the Mahayana Buddhism of Northern China.

321
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,920
So, do you have a sign for that anymore?

322
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,580
That old history stuff?

323
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,100
Yeah, start thinking now.

324
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,760
It's a new way you can begin to push your thinking into a bushing.

325
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,900
Surveying such an all-encompassing cosmic scale.

326
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,680
But you will scream for increases.

327
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,340
Unbelievable ongoing where it's happening now, daddy.

328
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,660
You will cry and whimper along.

329
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,380
And, for the more, if I am elected, I will make sure

330
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,440
that the inhabitants of our jails are given a college education.

331
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,600
And it may be ugly, but it's gonna get you there.

332
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,640
That's the important thing.

333
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:07,460
They can work off time earned by passing academic standards,

334
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,020
which are to be rigorously met.

335
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,760
And that's what we're here for.

336
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,660
Why not just give them the degree?

337
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:17,200
Courses in locksmithing and demolition will not be included in the curriculum.

338
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,880
What's the point in making them have to work for their degree?

339
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,240
That seems a little punitive to me, Dr. Howe.

340
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,720
They are not given the chance to do anything right now.

341
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:33,380
And privileges of the past have been taken away in punitive and insane impunities.

342
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,900
But don't you see this imposition of work as a...

343
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,880
Don't you think they should be able to play for their degree?

344
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,740
It's voluntary.

345
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,720
And to those in the know, it is play.

346
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,540
They should be able to have fun all the way to their college degree.

347
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,260
They will be inculcated into the idea of achieving pleasure.

348
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,440
They should be able to watch the movies of their choice,

349
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,920
all the way to their earning their upper-level college degree and their professorship.

350
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,780
They cannot have a choice unless they know what there is to choose and reject.

351
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,160
Uh-oh. I can hear something going on in the studio.

352
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,780
It's just some robot.

353
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,480
But some kind of mechanical contraptoid that's kind of in a...

354
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,860
It's either dancing or it's going crazy.

355
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,960
Well, now it seems to run...

356
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,120
No, there it goes. It's...

357
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,480
Can you push that tape, that button that says tape on it?

358
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,840
Well, I could, but I'm not sure that would be good for my health.

359
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,340
You know, some motions aren't very salubrious.

360
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,140
These ergonomic stools are not well designed.

361
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,400
I know. It's a tough job.

362
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:38,640
I had a job once where I had to come in each week on Wednesdays.

363
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,440
And on the first day of the week, I'd come in around noon,

364
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,980
and I would push the big red button, and then I would leave.

365
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,620
Wow.

366
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,460
And they paid me like $40,000 a year just to do that,

367
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,780
come in once a week and push the big red button.

368
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,960
And one day, the boss was there, and I said,

369
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,400
you know, I've been thinking about this.

370
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:07,620
If you put this thing here like this, then it would push the button,

371
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,260
and you wouldn't need me.

372
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,060
And the boss, like, I could see the light bulb go off on top of his head.

373
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:13,380
Oh, no.

374
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,900
And so I lost that job by engineering myself right out of it.

375
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,720
Because you were smarter than the job.

376
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,320
Yeah.

377
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,480
I just couldn't see why my important time should be wasted.

378
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,260
My time was worth $40,000 a year.

379
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,760
Yeah. Was that boss named Bob?

380
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,620
It shouldn't have been able to be wasted having to push this button

381
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,640
that could easily have been pushed by a robot.

382
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,800
Yes, but that would deprive you of all free choice and free will.

383
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,760
A robot does not have freedom of action.

384
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,260
The problem is I should have invented the robot myself.

385
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,240
Oh, the robot

386
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,720
was in vez of progress.

387
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:34,400
What?

388
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,500
Is that just a bit?

389
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:35,620
I've always been short-tempered myself.

390
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,580
I was taken to the trash fortnight

391
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,300
In Quia

392
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,780
In Flatlight City Night

393
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,100
I was taken to the trash fortnight

394
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,380
They stuck me in a big black bag

395
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,920
They stuck me living here

396
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,980
They were and they stuck me out

397
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,320
I couldn't scream

398
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,620
I couldn't fight

399
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,360
My sister told me not to fight

400
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,500
I was taken to the trash fortnight

401
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,160
I was taken to the trash fortnight

402
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,340
They woke me up

403
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,420
In Flatlight City Night

404
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,740
I was taken to the trash fortnight

405
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,620
I was taken to the trash fortnight

406
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,860
They woke me up

407
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:18,860


408
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:18,860


409
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,020
I was taken to the trash fortnight

410
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,080
They woke me up

411
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,320
In Flatlight City Night

412
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,240
I was taken to the trash fortnight

413
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,900
In Flatlight City Night

414
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:31,900


415
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,860
They stuffed me in a big black bag

416
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,960
They stuffed me in a new little bed

417
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,880
They stuffed me and I couldn't scream

418
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,900
I couldn't fight, my sister told me not to fight

419
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,040
I was taken out the trash all night

420
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,740
I was taken to the trash all night

421
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:14,120
They woke me up with five lights on the light

422
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,080
I was taken to the trash all night

423
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:54,880
I was taken to the trash all night

424
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:24,880
I was taken to the trash all night

425
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,860
Oh, I see, there it is, okay.

426
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,320
But what about the parallels and connections

427
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,160
between such seemingly disparate events

428
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,960
as the schism between Rome and Constantinople,

429
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,460
Mohammed's establishment of Islam,

430
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,900
the rise of China's Tang dynasty

431
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,760
and its fall at the hands of the Turks,

432
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,200
the romance of Emperor Justinian

433
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,620
and the actress Theodora,

434
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,320
or Pope Leo's successful mission

435
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,420
to turn Attila the Hun away from the gates of Rome,

436
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,880
the once innocuous...

437
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,180
There's clubs of chariot racing fans

438
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,600
that devolve into mobs of guerrilla warriors

439
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,020
driven to brutal battle by doctrinal differences,

440
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,420
the unification of the German kingdom

441
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,640
under Henry the Fowler,

442
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,620
the repeated invasions of Britain

443
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,160
by Norsemen and Normans

444
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,500
and the hideously bloody Crusades

445
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,680
to impose Christian rule upon the Holy Land.

446
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,200
Fantastic.

447
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,040
Well, uh...

448
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,760
In other news, astronaut probes alien for a change.

449
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,280
Ew.

450
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,280
Ew.

451
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,580
More on this after the top of the hour.

452
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,680
From PR News in Washington,

453
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,720
I'm down to 9%.

454
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,100
On Wall Street, 50-55, 99-2, 21-23.

455
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,420
The Labor Department says this

456
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,700
is certainly not cause for celebration.

457
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,880
Communities across the eastern seaboard

458
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,240
and mid-Atlantic are preparing for what could be PR news.

459
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,680
The victims' identities have yet to be independently verified.

460
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,640
The president of Toyota,

461
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,480
is coming under heavier scrutiny for a gay bill.

462
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,680
The bill calls for draconian gay sex relationships.

463
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,980
The draft law also proposes aggravated homosexuality.

464
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,260
Most recently, from President Obama,

465
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,200
or a serial offender

466
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,020
who denounced as odious the PR text news.

467
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,760
According to PR News.

468
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:14,900
Something about...

469
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,260
Saccharin, every kind of weird sweetener.

470
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,820
Every weird FDA-approved

471
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,780
magic color.

472
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,300
Every weird color combo.

473
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,200
Purple and red and shocking pink.

474
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,200
Above the fruit.

475
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,800
All in the same piece of chewing gum.

476
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,560
None of which has any nutritive value.

477
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,780
Chewing gum.

478
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,180
If you demand new products like this,

479
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,940
then you're the kind of people we want listening to the show.

480
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,880
That's right.

481
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,700
If it's not natural rubber,

482
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,640
why use it?

483
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,240
What's the point?

484
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,840
Well...

485
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,880
That's the secret weapon we'll bring into the game.

486
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:54,880


487
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,660
It's true.

488
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,160
Unfortunately, it's not for us to decide.

489
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,480
We can only angle the keel of our onward rushing bark,

490
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:08,340
but not suspect that we will hit the space between the reefs.

491
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:08,820
Well, you know, Dr. Hal...

492
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,260
Luck is the intersection of opportunity and preparation.

493
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,880
And with our secret arcane knowledge and our special tools,

494
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,200
we have the people, the place, the power, and the time

495
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,820
to bring forth a new model

496
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,560
Yes.

497
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:33,760
One which can be adhered to by even the simplest, most rudimentary mental process.

498
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,260
Just so long as one has the F.I.B., the faith in Bob,

499
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,040
then one can surf effortlessly over the Luck Plane.

500
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,560
But as I said a few shows ago here,

501
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,460
for some of us who are plagued with worry,

502
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,440
the possibility always seems to loom that you can surf the Luck Plane,

503
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,720
but then you're going to wipe out.

504
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,800
Who surfs effortlessly?

505
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,440
Well, you can surf effortlessly to the shore every time

506
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,780
without even having to dismount his board.

507
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,460
Everybody wipes out.

508
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,360
And wiping out on the Luck Plane is somewhat like

509
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,800
putting your face through a plate glass window.

510
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,400
That's so true, Dr. Hal.

511
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:15,440
Fancy goggles and swim caps and the latest high-tech suit

512
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,640
won't help human sperm as they power through their race to fertilize an egg.

513
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,780
You could be rolling the dice, or...

514
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:24,780


515
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,200
Little wiggling guys rely on a proton-shaped...

516
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,480
...or your own choice.

517
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,320
...target.

518
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,140
...in about...

519
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,240
...of the United States.

520
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,380
Yes, ladies.

521
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,220
Bob!

522
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,220
Leave your whole body glowing with a warm blush.

523
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,340
Enjoy a beauty bath with bath-size...

524
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:41,600
Bob!

525
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,460
Get bath-size...

526
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:43,800
Bob!

527
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,160
Just a gentlest massage over your body leaves your skin delightful.

528
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,880
Yes, get big bath-size...

529
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,140
Bob!

530
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,060
I saw Bob take Ben's pants off.

531
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,700
Keep your eye on Bob.

532
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,500
How can I love a God that let me kill my baby?

533
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,420
God loves you because you love him.

534
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,200
Why?

535
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,380
I know you want me back, but I can't come back, Mommy.

536
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,740
I'm dead.

537
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,480
No!

538
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,340
What?

539
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,280
I'm sorry.

540
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,020
We have to come back on at some point.

541
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,560
No, let me go!

542
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,560
Okay, I won't.

543
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,300
No!

544
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:29,980
There we go.

545
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,620
No, it's all right.

546
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,000
It's all right.

547
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,800
This is my hand.

548
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,240
Here we go.

549
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,720
There we go.

550
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,100
And here we are.

551
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,160
Yep.

552
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,400
And here is how.

553
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,940
Behold his mighty hand.

554
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,960
And we've landed.

555
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,840
Back on the show at 420.

556
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,620
Still, as at first it was, is the hand.

557
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,140
Not yet contented of the creator.

558
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,040
Mm-hmm.

559
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,640
Hi, Mom.

560
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,380
Oh, gosh.

561
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,860
I thought you needed me.

562
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,340
I think the young child's

563
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:55,980
woke the baby.

564
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,600
Yeah, I just didn't...

565
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,280
Child thinks you are...

566
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,540
Let him have a drink of water and go back to bed.

567
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,120
Here are some soda crackers.

568
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,260
Yeah, that's right.

569
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,080
They probably want a cracker.

570
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,080
Let's just have a big party, okay?

571
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,420
That's it, kid.

572
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:06,460
Okay.

573
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,020
We're just going to have a big party.

574
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,160
Whee!

575
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:16,500
But why do you suppose that Shining Path of Least Resistance sent all this stuff about

576
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,960
the yuppies in Shanghai and all that?

577
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,640
Because he thought it was very funny.

578
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,540
It is very funny.

579
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,920
Yeah, but he think we could come and do the show.

580
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,520
Well, of course he's hoping that.

581
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,020
He wouldn't if any...

582
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,840
If he's going to pay, then let's go home.

583
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,780
Yeah, exactly.

584
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,280
But, you know, that's not how the real world works.

585
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,880
We know that.

586
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,860
It's not a fantasy.

587
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:40,720
This isn't some...

588
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,200
No, no, no.

589
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:41,920
We don't...

590
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:48,700
Take some wealthy, benevolent philanthropists who just happen to be listening who would

591
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,760
decide to finance such an expedition.

592
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:51,820
But, you know, we're going to have a big party.

593
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:51,820


594
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:51,820


595
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:51,820


596
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:51,820


597
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:51,820


598
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:51,820


599
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:59,140
But, you know, the parallel there is the Crusaders comic book series written by Jack T.

600
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,480
Chick.

601
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:06,320
Everybody knows the little pamphlets that have sinister religious parables about going

602
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,900
to hell in them.

603
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,460
No face deity.

604
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,120
But Chick also produces these large-sized comic books called the Crusaders series.

605
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:19,540
The Crusaders are these two muscular dudes, one black and one white, who go around the

606
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,680
world working for Christianity.

607
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,620
Oh, yeah.

608
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:29,100
And they go to Russia and they fight the communists and they just prove that Noah's Ark was real.

609
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,100
And every time they need to go on one of these expeditions, they go to their boss and say,

610
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,600
Boss, we need to go and solve a problem in Eastern Europe.

611
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,120
And we've been preying on it.

612
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,400
Oh, it's a secret agent.

613
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,040
We're going to have to do it.

614
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,520
Well, that's all right, boys.

615
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,200
You go ahead.

616
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,120
Now, you know, I can't pay you for this time.

617
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,180
You're going to be off your job.

618
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,680
But your jobs will be waiting when you get back.

619
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,140
Gee, thanks, Mr. Smith.

620
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:51,660
Thank you.

621
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,760
But how are you going to get the airfare to get over there to Croatia?

622
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,460
Oh, I think we'll get it.

623
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,320
Don't you, Jim?

624
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,680
You know who's going to give it to them?

625
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,160
Jesus.

626
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,180
They get down on their knees, these big, beefy, burly guys.

627
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:11,660
Oh, Lord, please send us the equivalent of the airfare to Croatia so we can go.

628
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,240
Now, I may be down to sleep.

629
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:18,880
And at the same time, according to Chick's comics, some old lady is driving down the

630
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,860
road in her Cadillac.

631
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,660
And she suddenly says, I have a problem.

632
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,320
I have a strange feeling.

633
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,020
I ought to donate $2,000 to these nice young men in the factory.

634
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:38,120
And so the money does come from divine sending through the person, the holy person of this

635
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,820
old bag.

636
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,000
They just tilt the luck line by through their prayers and admonitions and absolute, absolute

637
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,280
admonitions.

638
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,360
No, Philo.

639
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,960
When they do it, it's not luck.

640
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:50,280
It's Jehovah One giving them an unfair advantage, helping them along.

641
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,740
Which the rest of us don't get.

642
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,040
And here is Jehovah One.

643
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,140
So you say.

644
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,280
804 007

645
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,180


646
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,520
And here it is, Jehovah One.

647
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:07,520


648
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:07,520


649
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,740
403 007

650
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:08,740


651
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:08,740


652
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:08,860
dark

653
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,680
The adventures of Jim appear from coast to coast.

654
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,560
And now, the adventures of Jim.

655
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,260
Jim is relieved of active duties in our armed forces.

656
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,420
Jim is rather glad that he has the lovely Nazi spy, Twin Kolo, comes in.

657
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,200
That you, Kolo?

658
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,260
Kolo, say, watch, be ready Tuesday.

659
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,080
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go.

660
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:32,960
What we do?

661
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,580
Kolo, we're going to that laundry.

662
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,140
Once I go to his house for wash.

663
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,740
Come on.

664
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,740
This is dark.

665
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,380
Hey, wait a minute. Look at this.

666
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,620
Oh, where?

667
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,240
Paper airplane.

668
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,620
Kolo not like this.

669
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,620
Neither do I, Kolo.

670
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,400
Kolo go.

671
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,920
And so, Jim defeats the enemy with a toy paper airplane.

672
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,480
Except I've seen the photos of the pygmies in the oven.

673
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,740
So, what are you going to do?

674
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,580
It takes one half dozen of the other.

675
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,980
And willy-nilly mammoth.

676
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,060
And that's...

677
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,300
What if you had six of one and a half dozen of the other?

678
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,080
Wouldn't you have twelve?

679
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,140
Well, you'd have an even dozen.

680
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,280
Yeah, that's right.

681
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,180
But you wouldn't have a baker's dozen.

682
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,540
There's no wrong, there's only popular.

683
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,000
I never have understood what that expression is supposed to mean.

684
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:29,000
Six of one and a half dozen of the other is still a dozen.

685
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:29,820
Something.

686
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,340
Well, precisely.

687
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,720
They are the same.

688
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,280
Although, what it says is these different quantities or essences are essentially similar.

689
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,800
Just view...

690
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,160
...in a different fashion.

691
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,940
An estimate which, by the way, in my estimation, is almost always wrong.

692
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,160
Yes? What is it?

693
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,420
I'm on the phone here.

694
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,380
Uh, it's the 50th anniversary, uh...

695
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,020
I'm sorry, we'd have to get this other phone.

696
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,100
...summer show on the phone, Dr. Howe.

697
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,700
If, uh, I can get the vice principal to answer that other telephone, I can continue...

698
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,340
Oh, just a moment. Someone does need to get that line.

699
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,340
I'll get it.

700
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,500
I don't understand anything outside of my own panic and solitude.

701
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,500
Okay, well, uh, Philo's gonna take care of our little telephone problem.

702
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,100
The pledges are still coming in.

703
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,520
I'll take care of it.

704
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,300
And you can pledge your break now.

705
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,740
There it goes.

706
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,600
Oh, I'm sorry you broke your pledge. Uh, this means that money will actually be withdrawn from your bank account.

707
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,800
Wait, what? Don't kill him now.

708
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,560
Wait.

709
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,500
Wait.

710
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,480
Fat chance, you may say.

711
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,280
Too early.

712
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,680
Handheld tape recorder.

713
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,260
Right.

714
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,060
Too early.

715
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,800
Boy, I wish I had a tape recorder.

716
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,420
Every dollar has its day, and this is not the one.

717
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,480
My tiny, teeny, tinny tape recorder died.

718
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,260
What do you want?

719
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:44,520
You have to raise your money up, and then you have to toilet train it so it doesn't leak all over the place.

720
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:51,680
It used to chug and make all sorts of sounds, which should not have, which it would also record, but it still worked.

721
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:58,660
Why do you waste your money when it just slackfully leaks out and isn't properly potty-trained?

722
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:03,920
Because they could offer you something that you just want more than anything else.

723
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,620
Four.

724
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,280
Four.

725
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:05,840


726
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,160
Four.

727
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,120
you yield to this impulse large just suddenly appear in my life you would

728
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,660
hypothesize

729
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:24,880
is the true remedy that's the way it works you give up and then you get it trying to get into

730
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,400
the show but on the other hand the uh i can't spare any more you have to resist quit resisting

731
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:41,640
or resist quitting resistance is to the right down the hall resisting quitting we're still active

732
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:50,480
here and taking your calls and your pledges uh no the conspiracy is interested in making you

733
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:59,240
fearful at the same time it all the time it wants you to let bob control your desiring and it wants

734
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,200
you to be fearing

735
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,660
and at the same time i don't have the things i'm supposed to have it wants you to feel powerless

736
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:14,000
also and to make statements like oh i have attention deficit disorder or oh i have chicks

737
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,840
comic books disorder well it could be that or it could be oh marijuana makes me have the munchies

738
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:28,320
marijuana makes me feel paranoid you know all of these things are an abandonment of uh

739
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,220
the potential

740
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:37,240
of control or luck plane surfing one may easily

741
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:43,340
deal with what seems to be an insoluble problem if one simply recognizes that

742
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:50,500
for example marijuana is a plant and the chemicals in it are just that chemicals they do not possess

743
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:58,040
volition nothing forces you to do anything that a simple adjustment of the will cannot completely

744
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,380
countermand look at the impact the juure calculation of which kind of rules uh the st wszness and the

745
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:07,680
Bleeding the Hindu yogis that can isolate one half of their costal shield while they're sitting down if they can train themselves to do that

746
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,680
You can keep yourself from marching to the refrigerator and thawing a frozen pizza in the microwave

747
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:22,260
Oh, we can see much from our bank of monitors here at science headquarters

748
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:26,700
Well, that was just an example

749
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:38,220
Try it now. Yes, you and only you are the key to the amazing well or fountain of power

750
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:44,940
Which lurks inside your central dynamo to be activated at a special secret?

751
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,920
Normally only

752
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:56,740
Show has to stop in 20 minutes. It's just your subgenius contact. Well, get it

753
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,080
enters a different plane

754
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:04,740
This is all about itself. I'm not a free damn. I'm talking about me

755
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:14,680
Hello, hey Bob, we're all going to the creek tonight, it's gonna be a gas you're coming right I can't guys

756
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,540
Have a

757
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,680
Coffee how about a second cup darling you the entire affair is your fault my fault

758
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,740
how much I understoodir

759
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:59,660
So much for the

760
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,480
different. Okay, Dad.

761
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,680
I don't know. When I was a boy,

762
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,840
my father never permitted this breakfast table.

763
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,460
Breakfast was a quiet,

764
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,320
peace meal. Eat your breakfast, dear.

765
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,440
I noticed Orpheus

766
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,040
Stain likes my status.

767
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,580
Of course he does, because he's

768
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,400
a faithful follower for Bob.

769
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,740
He's a stalwart soldier.

770
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,780
A marcher in the...

771
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,460
My Facebook.

772
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,480
I Facebook. I tweeted.

773
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,900
I tweeted.

774
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,920
And it rolled over to Facebook.

775
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,360
I was contacted by someone who's on

776
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,040
MySpace. I hardly remember how to go there.

777
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,560
I don't even remember MySpace.

778
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,260
Yes, that's...

779
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,480
So when you're standing

780
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,500
outside MySpace, you're just kind of like this?

781
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,420
No, I can go into MySpace.

782
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,660
I can go back into MySpace from time to time.

783
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,600
Well, I guess I'll have to do some diving

784
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,000
and wiggling and weaving.

785
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,720
You have so much time to be cool.

786
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,600
Stain listens to Twitter, but he won't

787
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,360
listen to the show.

788
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,340
Oh, he listens to it.

789
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,920
Is he steaming?

790
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,980
There's one eye on the Twitter board

791
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,580
and one eye watching Doc

792
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,860
night of sinking grass.

793
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,120
Is he steaming the show, Ivan?

794
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,860
Are you steaming the show, Ivan?

795
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,120
Over a foaming pasture.

796
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,520
One of those little Chinese cooker things.

797
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,680
He makes no cry from that light as a breath.

798
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,500
Do you want white show or brown show?

799
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,560
Orpheus Stain and Bob's time.

800
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,060
That Orpheus self might heave

801
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,320
his head from golden snow.

802
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,060
We're listening to the show.

803
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,640
Just now, Dr. Al.

804
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,240
More than 58 minutes.

805
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:28,520
What's up?

806
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,000
What's up?

807
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,620
What's up?

808
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,200
Oh, this is a robot mobile.

809
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,220
Observe.

810
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,180
I merely press this button.

811
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:39,980
Yes.

812
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:40,760
What?

813
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,480
You drink?

814
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,300
A glass of sherry.

815
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,000
Yes.

816
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:45,640
Yes.

817
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,720
Well.

818
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,340
Well, yes.

819
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:53,800
Yes.

820
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,180
Yes.

821
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:54,820
Yes.

822
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,680
This vehicle is in an underground

823
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,260
chamber.

824
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:58,880
It's all?

825
00:43:59,320 --> 00:43:59,800
Everything.

826
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:00,740
Sorry.

827
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,600
I didn't mean to offend.

828
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,280
You might try harder to get out.

829
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,100
Night.

830
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:11,700
Okay.

831
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,240
Let me see if I can rewire this thing.

832
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,780
Quit feeling sorry for them.

833
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,220
Wasting all that sorry time.

834
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,480
You can feel sorry for yourself

835
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,500
and languish in self-indulgent behavior

836
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,860
instead of trying to feel sorry for the world

837
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,760
and hiding from yourself.

838
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:27,860
Yeah.

839
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,580
That's true.

840
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,560
I should no longer be hiding from myself.

841
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,300
You're just hiding from your own pain and suffering

842
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,340
when you go out and try to help other people

843
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,060
through their pain and suffering.

844
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,640
My wound can never be healed.

845
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,240
He said.

846
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,300
Begrudgingly.

847
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,100
You remember in the end of...

848
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,540
Don't forget back in 1994,

849
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,960
the Church of the Subgenius predicted

850
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,760
there would be drug abuse religions

851
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,160
cropping up by now.

852
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,060
It's true.

853
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,940
No, please. Not that.

854
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:57,580
Oh.

855
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,420
Uh...

856
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,380
That's not good.

857
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,840
China and France clash in space.

858
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,660
I just want to lay back on the big couch of the bus.

859
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,700
Clash in space.

860
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,420
It's going to happen.

861
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,740
Over differing interpretations of church dogma.

862
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,820
That one did come true.

863
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,240
China will take up the banner

864
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,180
as predicted by Nostradamus.

865
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,660
Okay, we're teleporting now to Nostradamus' future.

866
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:20,500
The moon will be full on the 28th of February,

867
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,560
the last day of the month.

868
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,080
On that day,

869
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,280
the sun shall set,

870
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,240
at exactly 6 o'clock,

871
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:33,020
and shall rise a few minutes before 7 o'clock.

872
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,100
The greenhouse effect was reversed by Bob.

873
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:36,560
The full moon?

874
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,700
No, the sun.

875
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,880
Since 1995, there has been no...

876
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,160
Talking about sunrise and sun shift here.

877
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,980
Thanks to Bob.

878
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,100
The full moon, of course, will be at the zenith at the...

879
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:51,380
Really?

880
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,100
I haven't seen them in years.

881
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,500
I've been to the zenith in years.

882
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,180
Oh, my God.

883
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:00,340
That has to do with the way he says his five upside down and backwards

884
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,160
in a third-dimensional time graph.

885
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,780
He slips through like...

886
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:13,120
To add on to what I was saying from the last message,

887
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,680
what I'm trying to say is that

888
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,060
the imperialist powers that represent a conspiratorial union,

889
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,400
and there is some kind of cabal, a conspiratorial union,

890
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,720
that is pulling out all the stuff

891
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,120
of this end of the 20th century tyranny

892
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,140
with all these signs and informing information,

893
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,140
you know, informer attention,

894
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,160
and the transportation system and subway systems

895
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:49,720
to cater and adhere to this tyranny of the authoritarian Gestapo

896
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,080
that they're trying to pull over on us everywhere.

897
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,880
But they will not do it to me like they did to me before

898
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,460
because this time, if anything happens to me...

899
00:46:59,460 --> 00:46:59,460


900
00:46:59,460 --> 00:46:59,460


901
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:04,060
.

902
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,300

903
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:05,820

914
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:07,660

.

926
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,640
out of it. Let's see what happens. And if it does happen? Why? Just ask me, that's all.

927
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:40,200
What are you going to do? This. Get out of my way. I didn't do it. Yeah? Yeah.

928
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,200
Yeah.

929
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,460
With the right people and the right preparation.

930
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,820
Wait a minute, this is getting complicated.

931
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,860
With the right team.

932
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:03,060
Oh, in fact, you're reminding me of, today I walked around Broadway with Bishop Joey,

933
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,560
who was dressed as Pantalone.

934
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,680
Oh, wow, it was the Bologna thing?

935
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,180
No, no, well, nobody showed up. It was basically just a few very old hands of the old church

936
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:18,860
of the Comedie dell'Arte. And we went up and down and did stuff and did things. And the

937
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,800
Tosca's area was...

938
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,480
It was completely closed because they're filming what I realized was a TV show, because

939
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,180
they had lots of lights and cameras, a lot of gaffers. Amazing caterer truck. I want

940
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:34,800
that caterer truck, man. Super, super cool food making, fast cleanup delivery thing.

941
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,320
Was it like, could you go inside of it?

942
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,320
Well, no, no.

943
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,620
Was it like a super Mexican taco wagon truck?

944
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,740
Yeah, it's like that. But the kitchen is there. I was looking up into it and they're feeding

945
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,260
a huge group of... Yeah, I saw the star guy in the...

946
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:58,320
These couple of attractive pararescue kids went by.

947
00:48:59,040 --> 00:48:59,400
Paramedics?

948
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,080
Paramedics. And I thought, they don't have any gear on. Something's wrong here. And they

949
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,860
look a little too pretty. And I looked over and there's like a star guy that I recognize

950
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,680
from TV. So then we go up there and we come back. And when we come back down the street,

951
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,100
the street is full of guys with gorgeous like...

952
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,560
Really? Zombies?

953
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,140
No, I think the paramedic guys run in, deal with...

954
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,160
Amazing.

955
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:20,960
Medical emergency.

956
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:25,640
But it was nice to see like a street full of guys all laughing with horrible face wounds

957
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,460
and stuff. I think it was the paramedic guys have to respond.

958
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,400
They laugh in the face of adversity.

959
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,280
Well, that's what happens in the warehouse of the gods.

960
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,220
Here on the show.

961
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,020
Hello, this is me, Bernard. The United States government helped spread the AIDS virus along

962
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:47,980
with other countries around the world, like France especially, and even the Canadians.

963
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,140
The New York City Medical...

964
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:57,720
The New York City Medical Establishment helped spread the Hepatitis B virus and gave it to

965
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:07,040
gay men in Europe and in New York City and Africans, you know, and Blacks in Africa and

966
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:14,900
the New York City Blood Center and Adolf Hitler and the pharmaceutical companies. You know,

967
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:19,560
they had plans to... They had an agenda to have a stronghold over the pharmaceutical

968
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,120
industry.

969
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:36,500
So why not just give someone who once in Mexico knew that there was a difference in

970
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,580
Kenny Tate's vaccine strategy?

971
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,820
Well, there's got to be some.

972
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:42,100
With what type of evidence is there now?

973
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,920
Well, there's now those ones that give people in the US the Hampshire People's Ninety

974
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,120
Suit presidents'

975
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:46,440
Well.

976
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,460
There's got to be some in the United states now...

977
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:49,500
Evidence from the field?

978
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,100
When you look at things through the wrong end of the telescope.

979
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,020
We have met on a great battlefield.

980
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,240
A big tiny scope.

981
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,120
That's what Ivan Stang is in now.

982
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,160
A 10 billion scope.

983
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:12,960
You know what I like about that story you told before the show about Ivan Stang?

984
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,160
Is that he's taking his camera and doing the dumbest, cheapest version you can do of this.

985
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,400
Just as I'm doing that with still photographs.

986
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,740
No scanning or measuring.

987
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,280
You just take a picture of the picture.

988
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,680
You make a file.

989
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:30,960
So we're all just like grabbing the media and pushing it around really fast now.

990
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,740
As conveniently as possible.

991
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,960
We've found that we can do that.

992
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:35,740
That's great.

993
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,240
Chewy nougat.

994
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,640
Thick, rich milk chocolate.

995
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,540
What you said.

996
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,460
Reckling, tasty.

997
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,620
Oh my goodness.

998
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,100
And caramel.

999
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:44,840
This is great, man.

1000
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,520
What I said.

1001
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,300
I really agree with you.

1002
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,600
It's the same candy you taste.

1003
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,640
I can tell.

1004
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,180
I know how to be a great man.

1005
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,280
I used to agree with other people.

1006
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:55,440
Don't forget.

1007
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:59,700
I was standing over here looking over there thinking, so there's a great man.

1008
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,600
There is a special great man.

1009
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,960
You were thinking that while I was thinking that.

1010
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,100
Yeah, because we great minds think alike.

1011
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,000
That's true.

1012
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:06,640
That's true.

1013
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,780
Al wasn't thinking at all.

1014
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,860
Al wasn't thinking at all.

1015
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,120
He's not as great as us.

1016
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:12,400
Yeah.

1017
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:12,840
I'm a boy.

1018
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,500
I'm a boy.

1019
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:13,940
But he can't be.

1020
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,360
And take a bag of canned potatoes.

1021
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,980
If he just listens to us, he can't be as great as us.

1022
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,460
If he just thinks like us.

1023
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,700
Thank you.

1024
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,500
Thank you.

1025
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,340
Thank you.

1026
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,960
In fact, I'm just going to say that.

1027
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,460
Al can be great as us.

1028
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:25,880
Really?

1029
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,060
He can be as great as us.

1030
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:27,080


1031
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,040
Without a lot of trouble.

1032
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:35,400
I wish I could be as great as us.

1033
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:41,200
Praise Puzzling Evidence Show on KPFA, berkeleykpfa.org.

1034
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,520
And praise Lee Murr,

1035
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,820
who did almost all the collages in this episode,

1036
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,500
except the last two, which will be by the large.

1037
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,960
This is Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1038
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:54,740
All information, MP3s, videos, book lists, and so on,

1039

1040
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,660
And now to end, a jolly song from Reverend Corey McAbby

1041
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:05,680
of American astronaut fame from his latest feature-length movie,

1042
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,620
Stingray Sam, seen at stingraysam.com.

1043
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,860
A song, the animation for which,

1044
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,520
you'll have to see to believe.

1045
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:18,640
And awarded to Edward and Frederick.

1046
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:22,900
When the child was born, he was given the name Fredward.

1047
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:27,060
The entire upper-class population was impregnated

1048
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,100
with double male genetic combos,

1049
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,220
and thus a new generation was born.

This baby is that he's gone and

1117
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,780
This baby is that he's gone and

1118
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,620
This baby is that he's gone and

1119
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,120
This baby is that he's gone

1120
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,880
And so the plot begins to thicken, but not by much.

1121
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,920
A girl is in need of rescue,

1122
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,820
and the genetically designed figurehead of a very wealthy planet is somehow involved.

1123
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:15,960
But how?

1124
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:16,740
Who?

1125
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:17,760
What?

1126
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:18,660
When?

1127
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,640
Where?

1128
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,720
And why?

1129
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:29,360
Find out the answers to these questions and more on our next episode of Stingray Sam!

1130
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,660
Are we still gonna get anything done?

1131
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,140
Get a box of salt and a cup of交 me a little of my name to go?

1132
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,340
Let me guess if you want a brand-new

1133
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:56,800
Let me do the digging again.

1134
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:56,800


1135
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:56,800


1136
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:56,800


1137
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:56,800


1138
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:03,480
Giving me some sound gagner or needed to do,

1139
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,640
டShawne Very good, Brian!

1140
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,920
B willing to make screw you to do that.

1141
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,900
B willing to make screw you to do that. B willing to make screw me to do that. B believing that we've got to do this. B willing to make screw me to do that. B willing to make screw you to do that. B willing to make screw you to do that.

1142
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:10,840
And a sleetish sleep.

1143
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,420
That's what we were speaking about earlier.

1144
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,560
Slithering slush.

1145
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:15,960
We just follow the show.

1146
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,600
So in three minutes, the show just suffocates itself.

1147
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:19,900
All right.

1148
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:23,720
Grotesque bicycles bearded the burdened trees.

1149
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,800
Snapping power lines.

1150
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,780
Thank you for that nice round of applause.

1151
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:29,460
Plus it could be...

1152
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,440
Max Broken Journey is created by...

1153
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,120
Everything we say on the show becomes true.

1154
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,540
So what Hal's going over the list here, I'm sorry.

1155
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,480
What's about to happen to you.

1156
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:46,000
Drunken Santa Claus is staggering from the service entrance of department stores.

1157
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,780
Just listen to this list that Hal's visiting on the entire northern and central California.

1158
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,740
Anybody on KBFA.org.

1159
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,040
I'm as sorry as the sorriest guy on the show.

1160
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,460
That's all right, Philo.

1161
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:03,200
You don't need to apologize because everyone knows that it's all for the best.

1162
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,440
Whatever is, is right.

1163
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,500
I wish we had that spring sand back in the area.

1164
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:08,800
That's right.

1165
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:08,960
Boing.

1166
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,720
You mean Bob Nelson's Boinger?

1167
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,140
Boinger.

1168
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,240
No, that's three.

1169
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,180
Three every time.

1170
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:15,280
That was so long ago.

1171
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:16,060
I'm going to get one of those.

1172
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,660
No one remembers that.

1173
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:18,780
Isn't there a spring?

1174
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:19,760
It's in the island.

1175
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:20,940
The island of Sweden.

1176
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,720
I could probably just search.

1177
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,920
I could get a ringtone.

1178
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,380
I'm going to get a ringtone that sounds like a spring.

1179
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,120
Sproing.

1180
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:28,920
Sproing.

1181
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,300
Sproing.

1182
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,760
The years of the spring.

1183
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,280
The days of the morn.

1184
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:33,600
Gnome.

1185
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,100
Gnome.

1186
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,560
Like morning to seven.

1187
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,340
You're going to gnome?

1188
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:36,740
Noture.

1189
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,320
The hillside.

1190
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,220
Oh, Noture.

1191
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,360
Noture Sona.

1192
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,620
The snails on the water.

1193
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,240
Noture Sane.

1194
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,160
God's in his heaven.

1195
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,880
All's right with the world.

1196
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,760
Praise God.

1197
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,420
Praise God.

1198
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:49,940
Eww.

1199
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,620
I've mutilated the monkey.

1200
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:51,880
All right.

1201
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:52,940
Counting down now.

1202
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:53,460
All right.

1203
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,280
So come back next week for more.

1204
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,560
Come back and see us now, you hear?

1205
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,780
Oh, what is the next five hour show that we're going to do?

1206
00:58:59,200 --> 00:58:59,920
Five hours.

1207
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,220
I don't know.

1208
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,260
Next week would be the normal show right after.

1209
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:02,780
Oh, the iTunes.

1210
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:03,340
Yeah.

1211
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,120
Crack Odon.

1212
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,140
Step by step.

1213
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,540
Hitch by hitch.

1214
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:07,920
And then suddenly we're just like gone.

1215
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,060
Oh, my God.

1216
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,420
Bob.
