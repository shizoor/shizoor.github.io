1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,180
You girls have never been attracted to me.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,300
I don't know why you girls aren't attracted to me,

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,800
but I will punish you all for it.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,420
It's an injustice, a crime,

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,100
because I don't know what you don't see in me.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,340
I'm the perfect guy.

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,520
And yet you throw yourselves at all these obnoxious men

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,460
instead of me, the supreme gentleman.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,620
I will punish all of you for it.

10
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,400
Listen, for God's sake, listen.

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,360
Listen.

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,260
No! No! Why don't you listen?

13
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:04,820
No!

14
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,680
All those girls that I've desired so much,

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,440
they would have all rejected me and looked down upon me as an inferior man

16
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,780
if I ever made a sexual advance towards them.

17
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,800
While they throw themselves at these obnoxious brutes.

18
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,760
I'll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you.

19
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,100
You will finally see that I am, in truth, the superior one.

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,980
The true alpha male.

21
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,580
Yes.

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,800
From PR News in Washington,

23
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,740
I'm much calmer today.

24
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,680
Not everyone is happy, as PR's report reports.

25
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,740
People look much happier when all the violence and shooting was taking place.

26
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,000
But there's just a lot of skepticism that this will solve tonight's TV.

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,400
So the Realtors Association says PR News in all parts of the country,

28
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,840
but the biggest was in Washington.

29
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,880
Stocks 29, 16, 3.

30
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,660
Singer-songwriter James Taylor,

31
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,100
who's pleading guilty to charges of possessing pornography,

32
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,780
says you're listening to PR News in Washington.

33
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,620
I wanted you to know what radio announcers are up against.

34
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,800
Feel sorry for them.

35
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,480
Send in a little something, whatever you can afford.

36
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,780
And now, friends, we have a time check.

37
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,120
And would you just fill in your own time, please?

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,320
Well, I took my sludge hammer and I painted it red, white, and blue.

39
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,180
Because in America, if you can afford it, you can do it.

40
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,780
I took my obnoxious alarm clock and I smashed it.

41
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,580
What an experience.

42
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,920
And it was really fun.

43
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,040
I liked that.

44
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,740
Thank you.

45
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:51,980
Thank you.

46
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:52,840
Thank you.

47
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:53,860
Thank you.

48
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,520
Thank you.

49
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:54,680


50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:54,680


51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:54,680


52
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:54,680


53
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:54,680


54
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:54,680


55
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:54,680


56
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:54,680


57
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:54,680


58
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:54,680


59
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:54,680


60
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:54,680


61
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,860
Do you know what time we're going to wake up Monday?

62
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,520
I don't know.

63
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,480
See, we don't either.

64
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,440
Thank you, Bob.

65
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,520
Thank you, Bob.

66
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,420
Give thanks to Bob, our eternal hope,

67
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,800
and praise me to Irwin, New Jersey's pope.

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,640
We're fickle and free and we don't make no fuss

69
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,020
at the Church of the Subgenius.

70
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,400
Bob, hear our plea.

71
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,900
We beseech thee.

72
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,260
Help us be free.

73
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,560
From normality.

74
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,260
We're dumb, devoted, and don't talk back.

75
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,820
Please give us an hour of slack.

76
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,980
J.R. Bob Dobs never fails.

77
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,680
He's the living slack master of mystic sales.

78
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,800
All you conspiracy doofs, just you wait.

79
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,520
Till July the 5th, 1998.

80
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,300
Invaders will come from Planet X.

81
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,720
Bringing gifts of money, time control, and great sex.

82
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,500
A new age will dawn and we'll never look back.

83
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,280
We'll be busy enjoying our slack.

84
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,660
Everybody now.

85
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,240
Bob, hear our plea.

86
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,740
We beseech thee.

87
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,080
Help us be free.

88
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,080
From normality.

89
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,660
We're dumb, devoted, and don't talk back.

90
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,720
Please give us an hour of slack.

91
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,340
He's the bridge between heaven and earth and hell.

92
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,740
He's the patron saint of sales.

93
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,520
Yeah.

94
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,600
He's doing well.

95
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,440
Media retins and novels and things.

96
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,440
Beware.

97
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,940
The slack master sells everywhere.

98
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,160
Give thanks to Bob.

99
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,600
Give thanks to Bob.

100
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,680
Our eternal slave.

101
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,640
Bob.

102
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


103
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


104
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


105
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


106
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


107
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


108
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


109
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


110
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


111
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


112
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


113
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


114
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


115
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


116
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


117
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


118
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,120
We'll praise you to Owen.

119
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,300
We're fickle and free, and we don't make no fuss.

120
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,960
At the church of the subgenius.

121
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,120
Everybody now.

122
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,660
Give thanks to Pope, our eternal hope.

123
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,300
And praise me to Owen, New Jersey's Pope.

124
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,260
We're fickle and free, and we don't make no fuss.

125
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,700
At the church of the subgenius.

126
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,460
Give thanks to Pope, our eternal hope.

127
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,700
And praise me to Owen, New Jersey's Pope.

128
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,540
We're fickle and free, and we don't make no fuss.

129
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,060
At the church of the subgenius.

130
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,660
Dear Bob, I must give you credit for playing some good music,

131
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,280
but why spoil it with your stupid, asinine whistling?

132
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,180
Lock yourself in a broom closet,

133
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,300
while the music is on.

134
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,500
I'm disgusted, and from now on, I'll do my own whistling in the morning.

135
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,320
This is from Springfield.

136
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,260
Is there any lower form of life?

137
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,400
Let the record show that the witness may be drinky, drinky motion.

138
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,500
I still enjoy your program,

139
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,340
even though you've been back two or three weeks now.

140
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,680
Isn't that nice?

141
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,520
Here's one.

142
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,260
It says, Dear Bob, please don't pick any more winners.

143
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,260
I'm going broke.

144
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,400
And you bull thrower, how are you going to crawl out of this?

145
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,860
That's a nice one. I like the short one.

146
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,240
At least you get them over with.

147
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:23,940
And I heard.

148
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,520
Dear Bob, I had heard so much about you,

149
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,480
I was prepared to like you immediately.

150
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,280
I tuned in your show, and you talked me out of it.

151
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,240
Here's another one from Springfield.

152
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,840
Could you please give me the exact address in Washington, D.C.,

153
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,880
of the Bureau of Indian Affairs?

154
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,180
I've always wanted to have an affair with an Indian.

155
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,260
I'll see you in hell!

156
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,580
This is from Springfield also.

157
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,780
Stupid mailman, squirming.

158
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,880
Dear Bob, this morning you advertised boys' suits for youngsters aged three to seven.

159
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,160
You said they were trimmed with piping.

160
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,660
Piping in a boys' suit?

161
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,900
Wouldn't you think they'd be housebroken at that age?

162
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,600
Hang in there, Robert. Yours truly.

163
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,480
Here's another one.

164
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,460
Dear Bob, I was standing in the kitchen in front of my radio this morning,

165
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,800
pulling my two-way stretch over my hips when you said,

166
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,420
Are you a little on the fat side?

167
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,300
What I want to know is, can you see out here?

168
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,180
If so, I must dress somewhere else.

169
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,440
Good joke, Dobbsy.

170
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,700
Aren't you going to let me in on it?

171
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,640
In on it?

172
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,060
Sure I will.

173
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,180
Sure.

174
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:21,760
Yeah!

175
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,660
Oh, isn't it great swimming in a sea of slack?

176
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:34,160
Let's just immerse ourselves in the luck-plane's surfy, surfy waves and waft along.

177
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,860
Dr. Philo Drummond once said,

178
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,200
If slack was water, Bob would be surfing and you'd be drowning.

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,040
Hey, I'm willing to settle for death by drowning in slack any day, Doctor.

180
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,640
Ah!

181
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,640
This is a soundtrack for you.

182
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:52,640


183
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:58,300
I'm going to play a soundtrack to Mr. Lucky, which is one of Bob's nine billion middle names.

184
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,960
And you know, he's taught me that it's better to be lucky than good any day.

185
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,580
And what an example he sets.

186
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,520
I rejoice in the failings of Bob.

187
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,560
I exult in the slip-ups of Bob.

188
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,060
Hey, Bob, show us how you make a mistake and make a million dollars.

189
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,120
Yes, make me a failure too, Bob.

190
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,440
Show me the witching ways of surfing the luck-plane.

191
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,940
Look, Bob, I can hang too.

192
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,820
Oh, and when Bob forgets to screw up.

193
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,580
Oh, when he screws up by not screwing up.

194
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,360
It's like breaking the bank at Monte Carlo.

195
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,580
It's such blinding, radiant luck that you can't believe it.

196
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:47,680
You appreciate the good things in life if you don't waste your time counting on them to happen.

197
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,100
But if you expect the bad things to happen, you can't do it.

198
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,100


199
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,100


200
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,260
Every day can be like Christmas.

201
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,240
Just forget yourself and go with a path of least resistance.

202
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,520
Sharpen your abnormality focus.

203
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,240
You might do only one weird thing exceptionally well.

204
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,500
Well, take that weird thing and turn it around and milk it dry.

205
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,580
Milk it for Bobby.

206
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,560
Tap it.

207
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,860
Strip mine it.

208
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,180
There's strip mining your slack away,

209
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,100
leaving toxic poisons to leech into your psyche.

210
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,100


211
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,080
You're a psychic water table.

212
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,060
Fight the conspiracy.

213
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,060
Give up for Bob.

214
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,940
On and off the road to Bob

215
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:37,260
We are marching forward blind

216
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,320
He has gouged out both our eyes

217
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,840
And he's laughing close behind

218
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,520
He will sell us back our eyes

219
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,220
When we join his noble clan

220
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,020
For just nineteen ninety-five

221
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,460
And a taste of our woodland

222
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,100
On and off the road to Bob

223
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:28,500
He has handed us the wheel

224
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,320
And he cuddles up with fun

225
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,740
As he counts himself a field

226
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,780
Our eyes are off the road

227
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,080
But Bob is still a boy

228
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,080


229
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,600
And Bob forgot to say

230
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,080
That the steering wheel went bust

231
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,720
The road carries us away

232
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,160
All those popular kids

233
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,260
who live such lives of hedonistic pleasure

234
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,880
while I've had to rot in loneliness for all these years,

235
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,060
they've all looked down upon me every time.

236
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,500
I tried to go out and join them.

237
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,600
They've all treated me like a mouse.

238
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,680
Well now,

239
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,600
I will be a god compared to you.

240
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,620
You will all be animals.

241
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,080
You are animals.

242
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,040
And I will slaughter you like animals.

243
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,940
I'll be a god,

244
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,540
exacting my retribution

245
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,120
and all those who deserve it.

246
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,920
And you do deserve it.

247
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,180
Just for the crime of living a better life than me.

248
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,640
Oh, you popular kids.

249
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,840
You've never accepted me.

250
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,560
And now you'll all pay for it.

251
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,220
The sermon tonight is entitled

252
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,740
Are You a Terminator 2?

253
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,380
Are You a Terminator 2?

254
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,320
Yes, Fritz.

255
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,960
Tonight's sermon is solely dedicated to the latest and greatest film

256
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,600
by Arnold Schwarzenegg...

257
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,180
Arnold Schwarzen...

258
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,580
Well, his full name is too offensive to say,

259
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,280
so let's just call him Arnold Schwartz.

260
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,220
As many of you already know,

261
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,420
the complete title of his latest movie is Terminator 2 Judgment Day.

262
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,320
They put Judgment Day in the title

263
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,280
so all subgenies would know this is a film about us

264
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,640
and the end times.

265
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,560
Because we know that come Judgment Day,

266
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,620
everything normal will cease to exist.

267
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,760
In fact, every normal will cease to exist.

268
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,680
Only the excess will exist

269
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,160
and those select few chosen to carry out their duties

270
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,020
will carry out Bob's wrath on a sick and sinning world.

271
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,080
The subgeniuses,

272
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,780
the excess occupational army of Earth,

273
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,560
the chosen race of which is bestowed the duty,

274
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,140
nay, the privilege,

275
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,000
of exterminating all the normals.

276
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,860
And what gives us the power to carry out this admittedly gruesome task?

277
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,580
What gives us the authority,

278
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,880
let alone the desire to kill first and laugh later?

279
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,440
Even while I speak,

280
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,120
the answer flashes before audiences every hour,

281
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,180
in every city,

282
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,920
entertaining millions with graphic premonitions of their own death.

283
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
It's not a subliminal message,

284
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,880
far from it.

285
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,140
It's so damn obvious few normals can even figure it out.

286
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,940
And that's the beauty of it.

287
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,780
Who would ever suspect that the subgenius blueprint for revolution

288
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,300
would be disguised as a summer blockbuster movie,

289
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,820
let alone a sequel?

290
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,620
Bob said they'll pay to pull the wool over their own eyes,

291
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,080
and so it has come to pass.

292
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,920
They think it's a movie about them,

293
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,980
if only they knew.

294
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,720
It's about them, all right.

295
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,460
It's about killing them.

296
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,300
And why?

297
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,720
If you're stupid enough to miss the movie,

298
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,160
you're certainly stupid enough to miss the point of the movie.

299
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,360
So as a pinko public service,

300
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,000
allow us to explain it to you.

301
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,860
Terminator 2 is about the conspiracy.

302
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,780
Not now, but in the future.

303
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,900
In a future where every subgenius is hunted down and exterminated by cyborgs.

304
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,020
Computerized, robotized, humanoid,

305
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,100
that look suspiciously like the same rednecks and stiffnecks

306
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,340
that are running society now.

307
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,160
Cops that club the tar out of taxpayers,

308
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,580
like in the Rodney King golf tournament.

309
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,860
Bodyguards that smash voters like you and me

310
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,380
whenever we get too close to important people,

311
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,580
like Ted Kennedy and his brother Dan Quayle.

312
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,100
Society in the future looks exactly like society in the present,

313
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,920
except for the billions of rotting corpses that litter the landscape

314
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,600
thanks to nuclear Armageddon at the hands,

315
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,660
or should I say buttons, of machines.

316
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,660
Now you probably think,

317
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,740
whew, at least we have time on our side.

318
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,480
We're nowhere close to cyborgs these days.

319
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,380
Heck, we barely have robots,

320
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,360
let alone robots that look like humans.

321
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,040
Wrong!

322
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,280
Look around you now.

323
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,320
How many people do you know that are really human?

324
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,920
Oh sure, they all look like humans.

325
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,240
They all go through the motions of humans.

326
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,280
They have extensive files on proper human behavior,

327
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:12,700
but,

328
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,820
try to get them to act human and see what happens.

329
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,500
Try to get them to deviate from what society has programmed them to do,

330
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,920
and see how far you get.

331
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,340
You'll be surprised, dear friends.

332
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,780
Stand on a corner during rush hour and ask for some simple human compassion.

333
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,320
Good luck!

334
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,240
You'll see the march right on past,

335
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,700
just like ants teaming their way to work.

336
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,040
Get in the way and the soldier ants appear,

337
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,260
ready to pick you up and haul you down to the prison chambers.

338
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,120
These may not be computers,

339
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,480
but they damn sure ain't people.

340
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,740
They're a combination,

341
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,340
man and machine.

342
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,120
The worst traits of both mixed together in a lethal combination of cold and calculating logic.

343
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,400
They know their mission.

344
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,420
For some, it's data entry,

345
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,260
working all day at the terminal.

346
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,820
We call them terminal cases.

347
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,160
For others, it's data retrieval,

348
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,000
patrolling the streets for deviance,

349
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,580
cleansing the system of errors and arresting viruses.

350
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,520
Eventually, the incurable ones are terminated,

351
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,260
hence the name Terminators.

352
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,580
Now, future Terminators operate much the same way,

353
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,180
only they're more efficient.

354
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,500
They don't waste time arresting the deviants or trying to cure them.

355
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,880
They simply kill them, Johnny on the spot!

356
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,960
There's plenty of Terminators in training that wouldn't mind taking those shortcuts today,

357
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,920
believe you me.

358
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,740
So as you can see, we're well on our way to a Terminator tomorrow today.

359
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,440
But alas, dear friends, it shall not come to pass.

360
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,240
Alas, for the conspiracy, there is another, darker future in store for us.

361
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,580
For them.

362
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,600
An alternate future in which the Terminators are the ones that are terminated.

363
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,620
A future where the subgenies revolt and take back that which is rightfully theirs.

364
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,440
The entire world!

365
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,380
Humanity will cast off its chains,

366
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,320
and the servants will become the masters.

367
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Machines will be returned to their place as our slaves,

368
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,100
instead of vice versa.

369
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,280
No longer will we plod through the years,

370
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,880
clocking in and out of life,

371
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,980
wearing ourselves out like miscellaneous cogs

372
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,640
in some giant corporate machine.

373
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,460
It's payback time!

374
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,220
And guess whose turn it is to fall down on their hands and knees!

375
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,320
Bow, you pico-normal computer conspiracy collaborator!

376
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,020
Lower!

377
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,100
LOWER!

378
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,080
So we can hack off your head with one foul swoop!

379
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,740
You had your chance to join the counter-revolution, and you blew it!

380
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,780
You sold your soul and sealed your fate with your conspiracy co-sponsor!

381
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,660
The subgenies don't need you anymore!

382
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,560
You're just polluting our air!

383
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,300
Get ready to die!

384
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,160
Unfortunately, that time has not yet come.

385
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,780
Independence Day won't be here until July 5th, 1998.

386
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,880
In the meantime, they could be mean to us,

387
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,040
but the clock is ticking, dear friends.

388
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,820
Time is running out!

389
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,720
If you want to save yourself, you must be saved by Bob!

390
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,500
You may feel unworthy,

391
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,680
and you may think there is no way someone as good as Bob

392
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,780
can spare someone as loathsome as you.

393
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,000
But don't give up.

394
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,420
After all, one of the heroes of Terminator 2

395
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,780
is none other than ex-conspiracy dupe,

396
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,520
the original Terminator, Arnold Schwartz!

397
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,780
That's like taking Satan himself back into the fold!

398
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,220
Now if Schwartz can join the anti-conspiracy crusade, so can you!

399
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,260
No matter how mechanized your life is now,

400
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,800
it's never too late to fight for freedom!

401
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,140
Indeed, the moral of Terminator 2 is this.

402
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,460
You can be designed by the conspiracy,

403
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,540
you can be built by the conspiracy,

404
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,120
you can even be programmed by the conspiracy,

405
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,820
and yet, you can still fight the conspiracy and win!

406
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,700
But you alone must decide, dear friends.

407
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,960
So which are you gonna be?

408
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,300
An Uncle Tom devoted to upholding the system?

409
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,900
Or an Uncle Bob dedicated to crashing the system?

410
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,140
The choice, dear friends, is yours alone!

411
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,440
Here endeth the word of our praise, Bob! Amen!

412
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,580
I hate all of you.

413
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,820
Humanity is a disgusting, wretched, depraved species.

414
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,760
If I had it in my power, I would stop at nothing

415
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,580
to reduce every single one of you

416
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,720
to mountains of skulls and rivers of blood.

417
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,140
From PR news in Washington,

418
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,760
I'm stabbing and slashing early this morning.

419
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,300
Obama's struggling with mental illness.

420
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,840
We never seek help.

421
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,840
Obama says it's impossible to eliminate PR news.

422
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,920
First Lady Michelle Obama is believed to have gone down in the southern Indian Ocean.

423
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,560
President Obama told mourners,

424
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,080
you're listening to PR news in Washington.

425
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,120
Obama told the families to sue.

426
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,780
About two million years ago,

427
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,000
the earliest man walked upright on the land.

428
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,440
And that creature was lonesome cowboy.

429
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,300
The man was a boy named Dave.

430
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,880
What are you talking about?

431
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,360
We were talking about you, Dave.

432
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,280
Were your ears itching?

433
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,700
You sound so small and far away.

434
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,700
Really?

435
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,520
Yes, really.

436
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,720
Well, I'm right here.

437
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,120
You sound close.

438
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:25,580
Yeah.

439
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,440
I sound lovely?

440
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,660
Almost inappropriately close.

441
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,600
Gosh.

442
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,520
I had no idea you felt this way, Dave.

443
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,760
Well, you sure are a garbled mess.

444
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,480
I can hardly understand a word you're saying,

445
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,140
but I could tell you one thing for sure.

446
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,420
In that murder spree today,

447
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:50,380
I think it could be a plot by the Chinese to manifest organ harvests and stuff.

448
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,120
Really?

449
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,040
I assume that it was a plot by...

450
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,100
I assume, like, whenever any crime happens,

451
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:03,200
I always assume that Obama ordered it to make gun nuts look bad

452
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,060
so that he can take all our guns away.

453
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,740
Actually, that conspiracy is true.

454
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,740
That conspiracy theory is already being kicked around.

455
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It is instantly.

456
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,300
As soon as anything goes wrong.

457
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,780
It's always all Obama's fault.

458
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,140
Well, it is.

459
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,360
I have to do the credits here.

460
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,220
Let's see.

461
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,900
Well, that's why you...

462
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:30,080
Well, the preaching there was, of course, the great Papa Joe Mama,

463
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,560
although he was a little tasteless at the very beginning,

464
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,640
but, you know, not everybody...

465
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,120
not everybody has the same taste buds.

466
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,080
Susie the Floozy did the coll...

467
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,940
Susie the Floozy did the collage work about Bob

468
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,660
that was originally broadcast on her show,

469
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,720
Bob's Slacktime Funhouse,

470
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,040
heard on WREK Atlanta,

471
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,440
as this show is.

472
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,000
And, um...

473
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,320
Oh, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy did that song

474
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,420
on and off the road with Bob.

475
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,600
And, of course...

476
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,240
Complete with the frauds burping.

477
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,600
Pardon me?

478
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,120
Complete with the frauds burping there.

479
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:12,880
Yeah.

480
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,580
And we heard also some clips of that pink boy,

481
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,580
Elliot Rogers,

482
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,420
who decided that since girls didn't like him,

483
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,140
he'd kill them all.

484
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,840
And he even screwed up at that.

485
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,420
You know, I had to...

486
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,580
I was...

487
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,180
As soon as I heard that guy's rant,

488
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,240
his video that he made before he killed all those people,

489
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,640
I thought, there's some sentences in here that...

490
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,460
You know, when Papa Joe Mama says it,

491
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,300
or when Legume delivers it,

492
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:44,980
it's funny.

493
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,900
And it's also well delivered.

494
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,900
But when a pink boy like Elliot Rogers says it,

495
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,900
it's not funny, and it's...

496
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,860
It's simultaneously lame,

497
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:02,480
bad acting, like in a Disney villain character or something.

498
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,160
And, you know, it's just...

499
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,540
I was thinking of this, too, man.

500
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,540
It's like a socio-evolutionary thing.

501
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,740
This has gone from satire of a world which exists right now.

502
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,180
And people don't understand that.

503
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,820
They think they're...

504
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,920
Because there are so many of these people now that...

505
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,460
They're the object of the satire.

506
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,080
You know what I mean?

507
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,660
No.

508
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,460
Of course you know what I mean.

509
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,940
The church is based on...

510
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,740
Well, it's not really based on a satire of this world,

511
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,280
which exists right now,

512
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,760
because it's existed for so long.

513
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,480
Well, we just always assumed that the world was a satire of the world.

514
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,500
But can't you see what's clearly in your face right in front of you

515
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,960
and why you're being persecuted by the Roman legionaries?

516
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,840
But see, here's the thing, Dave.

517
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,640
I know how that kid felt, sort of,

518
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,800
although I wasn't a spoiled Hollywood rich kid.

519
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,280
And I also wasn't as good looking as that guy.

520
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,180
However, I didn't...

521
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,700
Also, your parents didn't call the police three months ago

522
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,940
and say you've lost your mind.

523
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,700
Well, I didn't...

524
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:09,960
Don't, never mind.

525
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,220
Although I had trouble getting a girlfriend, too,

526
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,880
I didn't blame the girls or want to kill them.

527
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,500
The only person I wanted to kill was me.

528
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,700
But I'm a subgenius.

529
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,040
And you wanted to eat bacon.

530
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,560
It's against the law in subgenius land to kill yourself,

531
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,460
because it's...

532
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,440
It's dumb, because it's an...

533
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,000
You're an amateur at it,

534
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,740
and Bob or God are going to do it anyway all too soon.

535
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,820
So what's the hurry?

536
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,700
It's Bob's job.

537
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,860
Trust a professional.

538
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,100
That's God's job.

539
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,360
Trust a professional.

540
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,920
Yeah, and as far as killing the others,

541
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,700
well, obviously, we're going to let the aliens do that.

542
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,540
There's no point in us running around being ninnies

543
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,540
like these crazy pinks that go off their rockers.

544
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,120
You know, there's a big difference between subgenius and crazy.

545
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,840
That is, well, or is there?

546
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,600
I'm not sure.

547
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,960
Mal-aligned normals are not the same as a subgenius.

548
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,620
Right.

549
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,440
We might sometimes be all full of hatred for the others

550
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,940
and think it's not fair and so forth.

551
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,280
And, well, that's when you go tear up your picture of Bob

552
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,660
and throw darts at it and go,

553
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,180
Why'd you let me down, Bob?

554
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,460
I trusted you.

555
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,960
I believed on you, Bob, and you let me down.

556
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,100
You know, so kill Bob.

557
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,780
But if you go out just randomly shitting people,

558
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,400
half of them might be deuce-paying subgeniuses.

559
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,800
Probably not, but...

560
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,540
It's an anecdote, but it's also an anecdotal pudding

561
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,200
because it's very, well, it's sacrificial in enough ways to get by

562
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,660
as far as the great mythologies and everything like that.

563
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,960
But mainly, you get to purgate yourself of all kinds of other sins

564
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,160
just by beating the hell out of them.

565
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,040
Well, the face of Bob.

566
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:02,540
Right.

567
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,700
If you know what it means.

568
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,780
Well, a lot of us keep a scarecrow of Bob.

569
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,320
You know, I have one.

570
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,180
Princess, we and I have it.

571
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,740
I think it's sleeping behind our couch on top of one of the radiators.

572
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,560
It scares every guest that comes into our home.

573
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:24,340
I have a dangling punching bag, which doesn't refer to a hernia belt or any kind of...

574
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,360
What did you say?

575
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,560
What?

576
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,660
You have a Prince Albert?

577
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,320
I don't want to hear about that, Dave.

578
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:28,700
I'm old.

579
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:28,960
No, no.

580
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,840
I have a Prince Albert.

581
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,140
I have a Prince Albert.

582
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,140


583
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,140


584
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,140


585
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,140


586
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,140


587
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,140


588
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,140
I have a punching...

589
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:34,880
Sorry.

590
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,100
I have a punching bag with the face of Bob on it.

591
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,020
Right.

592
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:49,420
Well, we use this dummy of Bob, which was expertly built by Dr. Le Guin 20 years ago

593
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:49,900
or something.

594
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,180
Back when he was a super artist and tradesman, craftsman guy, he's making those

595
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:59,820
little delicate ovaries in the Russian egg baskets, you know, Bob's face popping out

596
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,580
each one of them.

597
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,240
Oh my God.

598
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,340
I just thought...

599
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,400
And drink vodka from them and throw the glass in the fireplace and go to Slavonema

600
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,520
or some kind of stuff.

601
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,420
That's what we used to do.

602
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,020
Yeah.

603
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,920
I just thought of something I never put two and two together until now regarding

604
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:21,200
that Bob dummy and its creator, Dr. Victor Frankenstein Le Guin.

605
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:29,000
And that is that, okay, when Le Guin made that Bob dummy, he loved Bob.

606
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,120
But after a while, he was like, I don't know.

607
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,300
I don't know what to do with it.

608
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:30,300


609
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:30,300


610
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,940
And then after a while, he got kind of tired of the whole thing.

611
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,900
And remember, he and Chaz had it sitting in Camp Tiki Banzai and they'd shoot arrows at

612
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,120
it.

613
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,720
They'd use it for target practice.

614
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:38,720


615
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,040
They were sexually abusing it like a love doll and stuff like that.

616
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:42,240
Right.

617
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,200
Remember that cult?

618
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,120
Remember the cult?

619
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,980
The NYP or the state boys showed up and wanted to ask questions and answer.

620
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,640
Well, that guy just wanted a t-shirt.

621
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,200
But the point is Le Guin decided, okay, Stang's going to be taking this Bob dummy home.

622
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,120
I'm going to do a little bit of heart to it.

623
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,740
I'm going to do a little heart surgery on it and leave a surprise.

624
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:10,460
And he opened up the shirt and stuffed some raw hamburger inside the Bob dummy's chest

625
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,520
and then sewed it back up.

626
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,500
Now, his plan was foiled because pot or nostril tattled.

627
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,560
But here's the thing.

628
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:26,060
Okay, Le Guin thought it'd be real funny to do heart surgery on that Bob dummy.

629
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,420
What happened to Dr. Le Guin?

630
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:37,020
Five or six years to the minute later, Dr. Le Guin had found himself in an operating room

631
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:42,460
getting his chest broken open so they could replace two-thirds of his heart with a machine.

632
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:53,760
So you go stuffing hamburger into your Bob dummy, pretty soon some doctors can be stuffing hamburger into you.

633
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,200
That's like voodoo doll karma or something.

634
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,720
Yeah, it's a sad kind of karma.

635
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,460
By the way, I don't believe in karma at all.

636
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,020
Or dogma.

637
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,360
But, because life isn't fair.

638
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,640
If there was karma, I'd be richer now and so would you.

639
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:24,100
Well, I think the pity and the crime and the shame and the discompassion, the argument is

640
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,000
that that was actually an art project by Zoltan Fizetula.

641
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,180
That was actually an art project by Zoltan Fizetula.

642
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,640
Like many years before where actually they replaced the heart area of the

643
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,600
dummy with uh some hamburger

644
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,660
and then after a little while maggots would start to crawl out

645
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,980
even though it was closed up again.

646
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,400
And they would create this like living artwork

647
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,640
and then they would go in with the three-in-one glue, the elmer's glue and stuff

648
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,560
and they'd freeze it.

649
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,120
You know, that's how David Lynch got started.

650
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,060
He was mentally ill.

651
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,620
There's a lot of that going around.

652
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,200
He was. He is.

653
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,780
Well, he isn't anymore because he has money now.

654
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,460
And he can act out his insanity, or not act it out, but direct it out.

655
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,240
Yeah, right.

656
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,560
Turn it into a TV show.

657
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,620
Yeah.

658
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,320
Wrapped in plastic.

659
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,220
Yeah, therapeutic self-expression.

660
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,920
Talking about art and self-expression, Dave,

661
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,500
have you ever heard of the photographer, artist, name of Spencer Tunick?

662
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,500
To refresh your memory, he convinces cities full of people to pose nude.

663
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,800
Right, exactly.

664
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,300
You were a participant once, weren't you?

665
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,680
Well, he did do a photo shoot in Cleveland, but we didn't attend.

666
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,140
Some friends of ours did.

667
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,300
Yes, we have friends.

668
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,860
And they said it was really cold.

669
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,620
It was really, really cold.

670
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:53,180
And he's had people show up, naked people in Sweden or somewhere in Scandinavia,

671
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,400
pose on a glacier, for instance.

672
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,600
So, imagine my surprise when last week, Princess Wee and I opened a letter from Pappy.

673
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,540
That's my Pappy, Pappy Stang in Stangsville, Texas, which is a small town.

674
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,780
And this is his music in the background, by the way.

675
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,340
I copied the CD for him.

676
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:14,840
Pappy's music?

677
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,900
Yeah, this is him playing in the background.

678
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,220
Anyway, Pappy said,

679
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:23,060
Dear Ivan, I was contacted recently, yesterday,

680
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,800
by a man named Spencer Tunick,

681
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:34,060
who wanted to talk to me about a proposed mass nude photo shoot in, we'll call it, Stangsville.

682
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,380
I asked him why he'd chosen me to contact,

683
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,100
and he said he'd talked to some people in Stangsville,

684
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,440
and all of them, allegedly, suggested he'd call me.

685
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:51,320
He said that apparently everyone in Stangsville said it was something funky to call human Gormry Stang.

686
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,840
That's his name.

687
00:31:53,500 --> 00:32:00,920
What he wanted me was to get a bunch of Stangvillians, which is idiots, together,

688
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,020
get them all nude in a public place and photograph them.

689
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,620
I told him I could get two people together to go nude, but probably no more than that.

690
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,940
He said, in that case, only one would be enough.

691
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,260
Have you ever heard of this guy?

692
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,080
If so, tell me what you know about him.

693
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:22,440
He looks sane, but I'm not so sure.

694
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,420
He says this,

695
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,300
This is art.

696
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:31,280
Should I support or sponsor this person for such an event as art or porn at all?

697
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,420
Please advise.

698
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,820
And we called him up and said,

699
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,400
Pappy, that guy's really famous.

700
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,800
He said, oh, I've never heard of him.

701
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,340
I said, well, that's because you're concerned with more important things.

702
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,940
But long story short, he was putting us on.

703
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,860
He was yanking our chain.

704
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,360
He put on the old put-on artist.

705
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,800
Yes, he put on here.

706
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:04,980
And, you know, it took me a day to piece together that it was me.

707
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:14,160
I had sent him a documentary about Spencer Tunick called Naked States about six months ago or a year ago.

708
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,480
I totally forgot about it.

709
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,300
So I set myself up for that one.

710
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,980
But that letter was completely convincing the way he...

711
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,800
The way he worded it, as if he was ignorant about all of this.

712
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,240
It was easy to believe.

713
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,600
That's our Pappy.

714
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,040
It runs in the family, I guess you could say.

715
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:39,040
Well, you have years and years and years of sexual transgressions to look forward to.

716
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,340
Just thanks to those genetic, that passage.

717
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,240
Well, he's a lawyer by trade.

718
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,960
That's where I get the lying.

719
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,720
B.S.

720
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,060
Yeah.

721
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,740
The lying.

722
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,180
The bull manure.

723
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:52,840
Right.

724
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,400
And the manipulative, you know, nature.

725
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,460
Although a lot of subgeniuses are much better...

726
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,180
I'm sorry.

727
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:04,800
What?

728
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,240
I just had to say this.

729
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,620
Well, anyway, we all sound like our Pappies, I guess.

730
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,060
I probably...

731
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:22,160
I never did meet your dad, but I always assumed that he probably just was a craggier...

732
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,760
version of you, which is pretty damn craggy.

733
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,160
He likes to do accents and imitate other people.

734
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,080
Really?

735
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,280
Yes.

736
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,520
Well, that's revealing.

737
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,580
Yes.

738
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,640
Yeah, my father liked to criticize other people.

739
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,900
And I was an embryonic...

740
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,780
I was an embryo when my mother was playing a large bass fiddle in a swing orchestra.

741
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,340
So, there's a constant thumping sound in my head.

742
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,960
It just won't go away.

743
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,140
It's just...

744
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,180
I think it's maternal genetic.

745
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,220
Well, your guitar playing is certainly good.

746
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,640
I can hear you playing...

747
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,940
You're just playing, chunking along in the background there.

748
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,600
Yep.

749
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,480
It's important.

750
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:03,580
I'm like Chet Atkins or something.

751
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,800
I'm like Chet Atkins or something.

752
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,160
...from the ancestral homelands of Norway and Sweden.

753
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,740
Places where, you know...

754
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,240
Well, where you come from, they give the family name first.

755
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,300
That would be Lonesome, right?

756
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,360
Right.

757
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,180
The Lonesome Clan.

758
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,120
The Lonesomes.

759
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,800
And it was originally pronounced Lona-Sama.

760
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,780
But they had to anglicize it when they came to Ellis Island.

761
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:34,680
And they were put in a totally different part from all the other immigrants from Eastern

762
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,960
and Southern and Western Europe and stuff like that.

763
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,380
We're all...

764
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,440
I was going to ask what kind of a name is that Lonesome?

765
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,740
It's Crypto-Pomeranian, I think.

766
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,480
But I was confused about some of the...

767
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,080
They said, you know, they were real poor.

768
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,160


769
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,840
And then they were, well, they were rich, but they had to get out of town.

770
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,920
And I heard all kinds of stuff.

771
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,220
And I guess one of them was born with like one huge eye in the middle of their forehead

772
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,080
and stuff like that.

773
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:07,300
He was a carnival guy for a long time and rode around in the Studebakers and the Tinker

774
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:12,320
trucks and everything like that and helped people pound stakes to put up carnival things.

775
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,580
But you're not the last of the Lonesomes or Lonesome-es, are you?

776
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,420
Because you've got...

777
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,300
You've reproduced somehow.

778
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:20,780
Yeah.

779
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,480
You've got a lot of...

780
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,320
Well, I was...

781
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,200
I'm not sure how you people do that.

782
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,260
I don't want to...

783
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,820
I'm not asking you to explain it on the radio right now.

784
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,980
Well, we do more than lay our eggs on the water, if that's what you mean, and just come

785
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,920
along and spurt on them or something like that.

786
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,140
There's a very...

787
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,060
Hey, careful, man.

788
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,660
We're on the radio.

789
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,000
Oh, yeah.

790
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:43,400
But I'm going to get into the wedding clothes and stuff like that and procreage and how

791
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,960
you gain a wife.

792
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,840
When you gain a wife, it's like considered a material asset.

793
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,760
And that's why their parents are...

794
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:50,760


795
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:57,780
Parents have to give you a store and a vacuum cleaner that actually works sometimes.

796
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,360
That's the law?

797
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,680
And a lawnmower.

798
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,100
Wow.

799
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,560
Because you've got to have one of those to live in America.

800
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:10,160
And you want to learn to speak English real good and know the names of the people who

801
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,260
had big, weird, bulbous growths on their noses and on their foreheads, like in George Washington

802
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:16,980
and those guys.

803
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,920
And every boss.

804
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,380
They were controlled by the aliens.

805
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:20,760
That's another name.

806
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,380
Boss.

807
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,960
Well, they knew more than Bob's name.

808
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,180
They knew his address.

809
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,100
That's why they got into so much trouble.

810
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:37,700
It's not as if a guy that age in those times of constitution, they were wearing brassieres

811
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:44,080
around everywhere and arguing in public squares about gay marriage and stuff.

812
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,820
Well, they're not arguing about that in North Dakota.

813
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,340
But that's the last place that they aren't arguing about it, apparently.

814
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,760
Oh, it's just had to do with the tribe.

815
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,520
You've been talking to tribal elders again?

816
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,920
The tribal elders on Fox News were saying that that guy shot up all those people because

817
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,780
he was gay.

818
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,900
I thought, wait a minute.

819
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,520
I thought that he was so...

820
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:13,080
Such a frustrated heterosexual that he shot all those people.

821
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,400
Yeah.

822
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:13,860
No, no.

823
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,840
That's what repressed gay people do.

824
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,320
Oh, I see.

825
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,500
Uh-huh.

826
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:19,800
I don't know.

827
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:19,800


828
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:19,800


829
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:19,800


830
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:19,800


831
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:19,800


832
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:19,800


833
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:19,800


834
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:19,800


835
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:19,800


836
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:19,800


837
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:19,800


838
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,640
I don't know.

839
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,620
I don't know.

840
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:21,620


841
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:26,620
Well, that was the first conspiracy theory that popped out on the mass media was that,

842
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,120
well, obviously he's a repressed gay person.

843
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,480
That's why he killed all those girls and boys equally.

844
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:39,400
And then it was more like, well, no, it was obvious he was a sleeper Manchurian candidate

845
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,840
guy personally programmed by Obama like all those shooters are.

846
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,160
Oh, yeah.

847
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,260
Everybody's personally programmed by Obama.

848
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,140
In fact, actually, they've...

849
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,340
The real secret...

850
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:49,780
The secret...

851
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:56,200
The serious conspiracy scientists don't believe that these mass killings even happen at all.

852
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,680
That that's just something they showed on the television and that no one killed anybody.

853
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,260
It's all special effects and movies.

854
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,720
Photoshop.

855
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,560
Yeah, like the hologram planes in the World Trade Center.

856
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,860
Well, actually, this particular shooter's dad worked in Hollywood.

857
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,760
And I noticed that in the course of one hour, the spin on his...

858
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,460
The dad went from...

859
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:26,480
He was a second assistant director on Hunger Games to he directed Hunger Games.

860
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,180
Thanks, Obama.

861
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,640
So once again, you see the hand of the Kenyan trader everywhere.

862
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,400
In tornadoes, in hailstorms, in...

863
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,240
All of those things are fake too.

864
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,420
None of these things...

865
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,440
Nothing bad ever actually happens.

866
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,580
But the media makes it all look bad to keep you in fear all the time.

867
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,400
And it's all been engineered by Obama, right?

868
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,200
Everybody thinks...

869
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,780
Well, he doesn't have to hands-on do it because the Hollywood elites all kind of do that automatically.

870
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,540
Ah, okay.

871
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,480
You've heard the old journalist joke.

872
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,680
They just do that in their sleep.

873
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,240
I see.

874
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,440
They lie in their sleep.

875
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,440
Yes.

876
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,860
You have heard the old journalist joke, it's a free press if you own one.

877
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:12,700
Right.

878
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,000
Well, I own one.

879
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,900
So I'm not worried.

880
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,200
I can publish anything I want and I have done so.

881
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,280
You're free to print what you want.

882
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:28,280
Somebody's quoting the Bible at me and I said, wait a minute, wait a minute.

883
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,200
Isn't that a book?

884
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,460
Yeah.

885
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,980
Anybody can write a book.

886
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,240
I've done a book.

887
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,940
In fact, I've written a Bible.

888
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,600
In fact, some people actually believe it.

889
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,860
So don't tell me this is any kind of big trick.

890
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,200
Anybody can do that.

891
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,860
You are a potential prophet.

892
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,900
Of course, you already perhaps are a prophet.

893
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:57,720
I mean, I don't want to mention any books that were dictated by any archangels or anything

894
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,820
like that and have any backgammon games erupt on me or something like that.

895
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:09,040
But you certainly do pass as some sort of, I don't know what's the word, not a prophet.

896
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,320
A proofreader actually is what I am, Dave.

897
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:11,900
A proofreader?

898
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,980
Bob wrote these memos, but his grammar and spelling are atrocious.

899
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,840
Well, Bob is a prophet.

900
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,760
So basically Philo and I just kind of corrected his spelling.

901
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,120
And we did it.

902
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:30,260
We added a few things ourselves to his holy writ, and I wish we hadn't.

903
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,060
One of them was anti-music.

904
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,800
We said, oh, everybody who can't play an instrument should be in a band and play anti-music.

905
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,220
I've never been so sorry for something we put in a book.

906
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,040
I hate anti-music.

907
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,300
I even hate it when I'm playing it.

908
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,280
But boy, we sure have gotten a lot of tapes of that stuff over the years.

909
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:58,560
There's no little teeny tiny little squirrel tail of artistic bizarro in you.

910
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,240
You love melody above all things.

911
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,500
Is that what you're saying?

912
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,620
No, I'm a clerk.

913
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:11,800
A nutless chimpanzee could do my job, to quote the Hollywood author.

914
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,760
That is the best.

915
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,960
If he was patient.

916
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,020
That's the problem.

917
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,680
A boom day.

918
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,200
Numerous subgeniuses have not been able to do my job because they weren't patient enough.

919
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,480
They got too fed up with all the other subgeniuses really quick.

920
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,420
Which is why I'm not on Facebook.

921
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,220
So I don't have to get fed up with my best friends real quick.

922
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,200
As long as I don't talk to them, they remain friends.

923
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,520
Everything's fine.

924
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:38,900
Yep.

925
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:46,000
You told me one time that you were getting into too much trouble with people that you had previously forgotten.

926
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,040
But haven't you 달ped around with them?

927
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,400
Who?

928
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:54,780
Well ...

929
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,600
Catch my cold before dead.

930
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:56,300
Darn it.

931
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:56,300


932
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:56,300


933
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:56,300


934
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,440
You're 20 years and later than me, and you're saying, I was born asked to solve the problems

935
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:58,440


936
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,760
Because I've never lived ENT if I was in the dark.

937
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,040
Wow.

938
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,820
But is that how it goes?

939
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,180
Absolutely.

940
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:02,220
So you didn't have to go back and forth.

941
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:02,460
You could talk with any of the people there.

942
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,060
I think you've already had a microbe set-up there.

943
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,140
And your meeting with 보여드� quickly turned the professor from videos floor to floorflare

944
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:06,140


945
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,420
How is that related to ничего foram?

946
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:10,960
Because childhood.

947
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:10,960


948
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,980
Since life really comes to an end, a certain practice over time, you talked to involves

949
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,480
set on fire instead of me,

950
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,800
throw him in the swamp instead of me.

951
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,320
But no, every year they set me on fire

952
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,740
and throw me in the damn swamp.

953
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,700
The sacrificial labral sobs.

954
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,220
But I shouldn't complain

955
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,900
because that's the only day of the year

956
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,940
that I have to get up early.

957
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,140
And it's the only time I have to take a shower

958
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,220
at the end of that day.

959
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:38,980
I don't know.

960
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,080
Some of them weird get-ups you gotta wear.

961
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,980
I remember the one time when you was wearing

962
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,360
the Archbishop's miter.

963
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,040
It was like four and a half feet tall.

964
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,200
And you had those like Korean Zen master shoes

965
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,240
on the bottom.

966
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,980
And it did elaborate like kabuki uniform.

967
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,680
And it was like the little Mr. Pope's man

968
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,860
from grade school.

969
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,560
The Pope suit is not short.

970
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,760
It's too long.

971
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,100
And what you saw was me stumbling

972
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,000
through the mud in a Pope suit

973
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,660
trying to hike the skirts up

974
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,360
so that I wasn't tripping over

975
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:12,880
the rope.

976
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,640
The sacred robes.

977
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,700
My Pope suit was actually made

978
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,800
for a taller Pope.

979
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,560
And we've...

980
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,820
We did take it.

981
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,400
You did take it up last time.

982
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,140
Because I had used it for a marriage.

983
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,060
I performed the wedding

984
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,580
of Potter and Petal Nostril

985
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,480
wearing that sequined

986
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,080
Pope outfit.

987
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:36,680
Made by

988
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,560
Catherine Cartwright Jones.

989
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,780
Or Reverend Bunny.

990
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,500
She used to be a Playboy Bunny.

991
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,520
Did you know that?

992
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,340
I bet you did.

993
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:45,800
No, I didn't.

994
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,440
Because you don't even know

995
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,100
who I'm talking about.

996
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,280
Well, I could imagine

997
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,240
because you said she was

998
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,520
a Playboy Bunny at one...

999
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,760
Well, you said it one time.

1000
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,760
So now I can imagine

1001
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,620
something else.

1002
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,420
Right.

1003
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:55,960
Yes.

1004
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:57,960
But she...

1005
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,820
Yeah, she was...

1006
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,880
She also made theatrical costumes

1007
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,260
and they made a...

1008
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,820
She made a sequined...

1009
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,300
I mean, this is a Pope outfit

1010
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,400
suitable for the village people.

1011
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,360
Well, she made theatrical costumes.

1012
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,060
Absolutely.

1013
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,820
I made idiotic comments.

1014
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,480
Idiotic comments.

1015
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,700
Everything's got a verb

1016
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,840
and an adjective

1017
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,160
and going...

1018
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:19,800
I'm sorry.

1019
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:20,860
Dave, are you playing

1020
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,860
the piano in the background now?

1021
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,480
I'm playing...

1022
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,520
Did you switch from the guitar?

1023
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,740
This is actually

1024
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,320
a little tiny spinet.

1025
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,380
A little...

1026
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,620
It's part marimba

1027
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,220
and part rigged up together piano

1028
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,900
I've got going at the studio here.

1029
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,320
I'm working on building

1030
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,240
some new instruments.

1031
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,700
And this kind of closely

1032
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,760
resembles a piano.

1033
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,360
A keyboard, you know, obviously.

1034
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,300
But still, it's got

1035
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,200
a little bit more of a...

1036
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,500
a marimba, you know.

1037
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,200
That ancient

1038
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,520
clickety-clang-clang

1039
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,780
thing going to it.

1040
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,020
I'm amazed at anybody

1041
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,220
who can play music

1042
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,780
and talk at the same time

1043
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,480
even if they're only talking

1044
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,360
the way you talk.

1045
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,580
It's still really amazing.

1046
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,520
I mean, just...

1047
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,940
Just think of

1048
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,920
Chico Marx or Harpo.

1049
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,240
Well, Harpo didn't talk

1050
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:03,940
while he was playing

1051
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,280
but just think of Chico

1052
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,360
giving three-hour-long dialogues

1053
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:07,880
while he...

1054
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,420
See, you made me

1055
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,080
miss a note there.

1056
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,500
I'll say I was

1057
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,080
rather now.

1058
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,520
I can still talk about stuff

1059
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,800
and try to be real brilliant.

1060
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,300
Let's talk about...

1061
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:19,700
Oh.

1062
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:21,540
Okay.

1063
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,980
Well, that was all

1064
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,020
I had to talk about

1065
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,500
was the pink boy

1066
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,360
mass murderer

1067
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,080
felt so sorry for himself

1068
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:30,980
because the girl...

1069
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,700
You can tell why nobody...

1070
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,880
why he couldn't get laid

1071
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,820
because he acted like

1072
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,420
he was better

1073
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,500
than everybody else.

1074
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,220
He also had...

1075
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:38,720
He had real affectation

1076
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,940
about the picture, doesn't it?

1077
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,860
He had real affectation

1078
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:42,440


1079
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:42,440


1080
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:42,480
about the picture, doesn't it?

1081
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:42,900
He had real affectation

1082
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:42,920
about the picture, doesn't it?

1083
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,580
The way that he spoke

1084
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,620
and the way that he moved

1085
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,740
his lips and everything.

1086
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,560
He was really

1087
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,040
very affected.

1088
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,060
I really felt sorry for him.

1089
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:50,580
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1090
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,760
Like a bad Disney villain.

1091
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,180
Yeah.

1092
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,420
A corny Disney villain

1093
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,340
at the end of his...

1094
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,260
It's like...

1095
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,400
And you will all pay.

1096
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,580
Yeah.

1097
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,320
That was the crappiest laugh.

1098
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,640
That was the crappiest

1099
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,340
mad scientist killer laugh.

1100
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,840
He is no...

1101
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,300
Elliot Rogers,

1102
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,000
I knew Hannibal Lecter

1103
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,540
and you, sir,

1104
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,420
are no Hannibal Lecter.

1105
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,100
They should bring back

1106
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,100
crucifixion for guys like that

1107
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,100
or something.

1108
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,020
Or no, wait,

1109
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,520
I heard somebody saying that

1110
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,120
the other night.

1111
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:20,620
Right.

1112
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,320
In Oklahoma,

1113
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,800
they're already doing that.

1114
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,500
Well, their injections

1115
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,600
don't work so bad.

1116
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,920
They just bang on you.

1117
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,360
They nail you to a stick

1118
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,320
until you die.

1119
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,340
It is an iron skillet

1120
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:33,860
to the head.

1121
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,460
They were talking about

1122
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,880
bringing back firing squads

1123
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,440
in Utah.

1124
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,900
Yeah, they don't even understand

1125
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,860
the art of firing.

1126
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,260
I remember the old

1127
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:42,400
school.

1128
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:42,600
They just put a gun

1129
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,020
on Gary Gilmore's eyes

1130
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,560
and they stopped doing it

1131
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:45,980
for a while

1132
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:46,780
because of all this

1133
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,080
the social protests

1134
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,460
of the idea of like

1135
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,600
putting a target on somebody

1136
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,180
and wasting that many bullets

1137
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,140
when all they have to do

1138
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:54,660
is just like

1139
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,480
maybe throw a hand grenade

1140
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,460
in there in the room.

1141
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,580
Of course,

1142
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,740
that doesn't always work either.

1143
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,280
I'm against it,

1144
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:02,680
I think,

1145
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,140
because,

1146
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,020
well,

1147
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,820
I don't like most people,

1148
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,020
especially bad people,

1149
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:07,980
but...

1150
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,760
But you don't want

1151
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,340
to get arrested.

1152
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,040
Otherwise,

1153
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,000
you'd probably go

1154
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,140
on a shooting spree, right?

1155
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,320
You just don't want

1156
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:14,940
to get in trouble.

1157
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:16,520
Oh, no.

1158
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,280
No, no.

1159
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,800
Isn't there a lot

1160
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,600
of collateral damage

1161
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,860
with a hand grenade, too?

1162
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,180
Well, I don't really feel

1163
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,500
that angry at society at large.

1164
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,580
I think it's probably

1165
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,800
the ruling class

1166
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,160
we have more to worry about

1167
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,800
than the idiot next to us

1168
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,720
in the line at Walmart.

1169
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,380
Ah, yes.

1170
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,700
No, but see,

1171
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,180
this guy didn't like...

1172
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,000
He was jealous

1173
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,940
of the idiots

1174
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,140
in line at Walmart

1175
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:41,920
because they were

1176
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,740
holding hands

1177
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,520
and making out.

1178
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,540
Even if they were obese

1179
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,360
and kind of crippled,

1180
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,640
they were still, like,

1181
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,260
had love

1182
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,780
and he didn't have any,

1183
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,380
so they must die.

1184
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,480
If I were of a different

1185
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,340
shape and size,

1186
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,020
I would look at that picture

1187
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,760
and I would say,

1188
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,660
the cat's a demonic man.

1189
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,640
Like, he's not really

1190
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,020
ever been a normal kid.

1191
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:03,620
He's like...

1192
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,660
He's been in therapy

1193
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,360
since he was eight years old,

1194
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,660
so, you know,

1195
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,420
take it from there.

1196
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,300
Oh, I got beat on that one.

1197
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,200
They were taking me

1198
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:15,920
to see the doctor

1199
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,880
when I was five.

1200
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,240
What is wrong with this kid?

1201
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,620
He's not aiming for the head

1202
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,040
when he's throwing footballs

1203
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:23,340
and stuff.

1204
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,400
It's, you know,

1205
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,220
to be that young

1206
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,420
and have big dark circles

1207
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,260
under your eyes

1208
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,580
and your stomach growls

1209
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,080
real loud

1210
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:33,580
and, like,

1211
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,160
your fingernails are real long

1212
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:35,560
and you, like,

1213
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,720
teacher tells you something

1214
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,120
and you turn around

1215
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,120
and scratch and hiss

1216
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:38,660
or whatever.

1217
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,180
Oh, I know.

1218
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:41,620
I know.

1219
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,220
There is no escape

1220
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,680
from this hostile planet.

1221
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:47,800
And, uh,

1222
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,700
as the amino acids said,

1223
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,800
and they are going to be

1224
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,920
playing at X-Day,

1225
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,280
also at the X-Day drill,

1226
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,840
the Rolling Stones,

1227
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,480
Pussy Riot,

1228
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,240
Led Zeppelin

1229
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,400
is getting back together

1230
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,620
for, uh,

1231
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,540
X-Day,

1232
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,880
and, uh,

1233
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,360
a Blue Man group

1234
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,080
is coming,

1235
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,420
Penn and Teller,

1236
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:08,640
uh,

1237
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,900
but, uh,

1238
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,900
but I don't know.

1239
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:11,900


1240
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:11,900


1241
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:11,900


1242
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,580
I can't advertise

1243
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,840
this kind of thing, you know,

1244
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,140
because this is a public...

1245
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:16,180
What?

1246
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,400
Especially since the Stones

1247
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,040
are going to do it for free.

1248
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,460
Oh, yeah.

1249
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,680
Yeah, they all do it

1250
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,620
because they love Bob.

1251
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,700
It's, you know,

1252
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,640
we could never afford

1253
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,460
to pay any of these people.

1254
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,520
Well, maybe Richard.

1255
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:28,880
That's right.

1256
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:29,440
I mean...

1257
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,180
But Jagger,

1258
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:31,580
it's all,

1259
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,920
it's all about the money

1260
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,760
for Jagger.

1261
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,360
I mean, Richard's into Bob

1262
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,260
and, you know,

1263
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,460
he's got the Bob tattoo

1264
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,960
and everything like that.

1265
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:40,540
Well, I mean...

1266
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:40,820
He's the hero

1267
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,580
of the average,

1268
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,380
average guitar player

1269
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,640
of every generation

1270
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,960
from, you know,

1271
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:46,740
what, just,

1272
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,500
urinating my pants.

1273
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:49,940
But how, you know,

1274
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,740
the thing is

1275
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,740
they need to stay cool

1276
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,660
and Jagger knew

1277
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,940
that if he was, you know,

1278
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,600
seen at X Day

1279
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,560
and reported

1280
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,120
at being at X Day

1281
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,080
and not taking money

1282
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,680
that, you know,

1283
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,120
that would help,

1284
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,740
help him keep his, uh,

1285
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,540
his cachet

1286
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:04,880
of coolness.

1287
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,260
Yeah, his cachet.

1288
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,660
Keith Richards

1289
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,100
is just there for the froth.

1290
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:10,560
Yeah.

1291
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,560
Yeah.

1292
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:11,560


1293
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:11,560


1294
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:11,560


1295
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:11,560


1296
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:11,560


1297
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,500
He doesn't care about Bob

1298
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,260
either that much, but...

1299
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,240
He does, he does like

1300
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,080
to climb the trees

1301
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,260
because he's, you know,

1302
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,240
a socialist environment

1303
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,280
where there's plenty

1304
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,580
of arboretums around.

1305
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,320
Down there's beautiful

1306
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,040
200-year-old trees

1307
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,560
and Keith Richards

1308
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,620
has been known

1309
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,580
to climb these trees

1310
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:31,000
after hours of arguing

1311
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,820
with carbuncles

1312
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,220
about his drug damage

1313
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:33,980
and how, like,

1314
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:34,640
he really cares

1315
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,860
or something like that.

1316
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,940
Well, he's still

1317
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,140
in good enough shape...

1318
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,400
You gotta get him down, you know?

1319
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,100
He did make the news

1320
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,680
for falling out of a tree, right?

1321
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,900
Bumping his head.

1322
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,620
But at least he can still

1323
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,440
climb a tree.

1324
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,320
Most of the people

1325
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,120
I know that age

1326
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,160
can't climb a tree.

1327
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:50,800
No.

1328
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,620
No, there's too much

1329
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,720
neurological damage

1330
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,200
thanks to the fukushinas

1331
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,140
and the, um,

1332
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,720
the nasal drippage

1333
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,200
is probably

1334
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,420
the major problem

1335
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,160
with thousands

1336
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,580
and thousands of people

1337
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,420
right around here.

1338
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,240
Whereas Keith

1339
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,180
gets and wakes up

1340
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:05,880
every morning,

1341
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,840
gets to take a hit

1342
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,620
off a, uh,

1343
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,300
a morphine inhaler,

1344
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,920
which is the best way

1345
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,900
to do it, I've heard.

1346
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,360
Yeah, if you,

1347
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,220
if you've got, like,

1348
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:15,740
false teeth,

1349
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,200
you, you really

1350
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,000
have to make sure

1351
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,540
that they're not

1352
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:19,380
sending signals

1353
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,660
in the ones that are, like,

1354
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,960
got the phony, um,

1355
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,040
fillings in there

1356
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,380
because artificial teeth

1357
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,000
shouldn't have

1358
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,820
fillings in there.

1359
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,060
So if you look

1360
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:28,800
at your false teeth

1361
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,460
and there's, like,

1362
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,720
these little, you know,

1363
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,240
looks like little metallic

1364
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,040
tiny little spots...

1365
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,580
Then that's a transmitter.

1366
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,000
It's a transmitter

1367
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,120
and a receiver, too.

1368
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:38,380
Right.

1369
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,260
Right.

1370
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,380
That's where the voices come from.

1371
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:40,540
Which is what made,

1372
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:40,900
you know,

1373
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,600
so I was wondering

1374
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,080
if the kid,

1375
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,720
maybe if the darn kid

1376
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,800
actually had, uh,

1377
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:46,880
transmission damage

1378
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,760
from false teeth,

1379
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,400
but he looked like

1380
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,640
he has all his choppers.

1381
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:50,900
Hmm.

1382
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:52,260
Repack the instruments

1383
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,580
and prepare for takeoff.

1384
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,100
We will continue

1385
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:56,800
our search

1386
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,980
in another solar system.

1387
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,540
Good luck, boys.

1388
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,600
Good luck, girls.

1389
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,120
Now, the amino acid's

1390
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:06,660
heading off

1391
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:07,820
to look for

1392
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:08,780
intelligent life

1393
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,720
in another solar system.

1394
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,280
I don't know how the hell

1395
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,000
they would know

1396
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,560
the difference.

1397
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,360
Yeah.

1398
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,940
The mean old acids.

1399
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:19,940
Ha, ha, ha.

1400
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:21,760
Ha, ha, ha.

1401
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:22,880
Uh,

1402
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,820
there's usually, like,

1403
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,500
punks with prostate problems

1404
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,040
or...

1405
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,460
No, that's not, um,

1406
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,660
punks with pacemakers,

1407
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:31,840
punks with a pulse.

1408
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,960
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

1409
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,920
Ta-ta-ta-ta.

1410
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,900
Yeah, I was playing

1411
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:38,940
punk rock.

1412
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:39,500
Uh,

1413
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:39,900
uh...

1414
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,320
Dave,

1415
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,200
you were in some kind

1416
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,300
of a punk rock band,

1417
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:44,920
weren't you?

1418
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:45,580
Yeah.

1419
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:46,200
Or was that just

1420
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,200
a rock and roll band?

1421
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,140
No, it was, well,

1422
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,160
there were arguments

1423
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:50,800
in the band

1424
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,580
and they called

1425
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,100
different things

1426
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:52,740
power punk

1427
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,860
and power pop

1428
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:54,300
and stuff,

1429
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,340
and we were

1430
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,620
definitely dubbed

1431
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:57,840
as New Wave,

1432
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,640
I mean, uh,

1433
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,400
New Wave.

1434
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:00,860
Uh, New Wave,

1435
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,540
yeah, that's right.

1436
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:02,400
Are you guys,

1437
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,140
what was the name

1438
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:03,540
of that band,

1439
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,560
the Clock Radios?

1440
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,280
Because less people

1441
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,560
threw beer cans

1442
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,560
and spit on us.

1443
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,240
They didn't always do that,

1444
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:09,640
but sometimes

1445
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,660
there would be, like,

1446
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,560
the art crowd

1447
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,840
where it's just

1448
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,880
black leather jackets

1449
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,960
and you didn't throw

1450
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,060
your beer up on stage

1451
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,740
and spit on people.

1452
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:18,940
Right.

1453
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,680
What was the name

1454
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:20,700
of the band?

1455
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,160
Strawberry Alarm Clock Radio?

1456
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,440
There was,

1457
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,120
there was, uh,

1458
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,160
Radio Alarm Clock,

1459
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,200
which was originally

1460
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:26,740
the clocks,

1461
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,000
and before that

1462
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,720
was Chronix,

1463
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,420
which came out

1464
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:30,520
with a, uh,

1465
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,200
45 called, uh,

1466
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,140
Test Tube Baby,

1467
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,060
um,

1468
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:34,960
when the first

1469
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,860
Test Tube Baby

1470
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,500
came out,

1471
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,740
and it was, um,

1472
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,580
Bleeker Bob's

1473
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,220
pick of the,

1474
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,740
for about 10 years

1475
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,020
running.

1476
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:41,800
Wow.

1477
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,360
It was really wonderful.

1478
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,640
They had dinner

1479
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,380
and a dance,

1480
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:45,580
and, um,

1481
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,540
I was forced

1482
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:47,540
to expose myself.

1483
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,360
I mean, at least

1484
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:48,840
the damage

1485
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,880
that had been done

1486
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,540
during the before.

1487
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,200
Well, that was part

1488
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,020
of the job, right.

1489
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:53,900
Yeah, and that's how

1490
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,100
the lawsuit all turned out.

1491
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,060
They weren't gonna pay

1492
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,160
everybody at one time

1493
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,260
because, you know,

1494
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,380
not everybody had to have

1495
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,640
the same kind of

1496
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:01,700
droppage

1497
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,380
or whatever you want

1498
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:02,740
to call it

1499
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,120
when they remove

1500
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,240
half your body.

1501
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,320
I'm glad I was never

1502
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,180
in a punk band

1503
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:08,760
because I,

1504
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,580
I didn't like,

1505
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,960
I would have had

1506
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,540
to get a haircut.

1507
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:13,920
Yeah.

1508
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,060
I, I would have,

1509
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:15,860
if I was gonna be

1510
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,280
in a band,

1511
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,520
I'd be in a hippie band

1512
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,400
where I didn't have

1513
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,040
to get a haircut.

1514
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:20,900
Yeah, you'd also,

1515
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:21,740
you'd have to wear,

1516
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,020
like,

1517
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:22,760
yeah,

1518
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:23,940
you'd have to wear,

1519
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:24,280
like,

1520
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,460
of this generation,

1521
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,100
you'd have to wear,

1522
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,940
like, a, um,

1523
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,440
a button-down shirt

1524
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,260
and stuff that was,

1525
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:29,740
like, ripped

1526
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:30,640
and stuff like that.

1527
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:31,800
And then you'd put

1528
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,800
a, uh, toothpick

1529
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,680
through your nasal cavity

1530
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,160
through your nose

1531
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,160
and stuff like that.

1532
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:37,600
Ow.

1533
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,660
But I never did that.

1534
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,380
I had a mohawk haircut

1535
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,500
for a short while,

1536
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,440
but I was thrown out.

1537
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:44,560
Did you really have

1538
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,600
a mohawk, Dave?

1539
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,480
Did you really?

1540
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:46,900
You are out of,

1541
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,120
you are out of school today

1542
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,920
and don't come back tomorrow.

1543
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,060
I believe Dave had a mohawk.

1544
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:56,420
I can't,

1545
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,760
I don't believe Dave

1546
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,700
ever had enough hair

1547
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,360
on the top.

1548
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,180
I do.

1549
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,320
I do.

1550
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,500
I had a mohawk

1551
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,220
and I even had

1552
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,680
a rockabilly pole bucker.

1553
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:05,920
I had, uh,

1554
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:06,900
sideburns.

1555
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:07,820
Wow.

1556
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:08,740
Sideburns.

1557
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,860
And a, and a big, like,

1558
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,160
you know,

1559
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,360
it's Vestian cone,

1560
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,080
like, whippy dip

1561
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:13,920
coming out in front,

1562
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
like an ice cream cone

1563
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,500
or something.

1564
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,700
Or like in Leningrad Cowboys.

1565
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:18,680
You ever see that movie?

1566
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:19,620
Like,

1567
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,680
about the weird, uh,

1568
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,120
band that comes to America

1569
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,460
from a small border town

1570
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,920
of Russian and

1571
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,040
with ice cream cone hair.

1572
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,760
I didn't see that,

1573
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,700
but I read the cliff notes.

1574
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,100
He's funny.

1575
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,220
How is Mackie?

1576
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:36,880
He's funny

1577
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,860
unless he's dead now.

1578
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:38,020
No.

1579
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,120
Is his dad shunning us?

1580
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,260
No.

1581
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,480
Carlos Mackie.

1582
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,540
Carlos,

1583
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,480
Carlos Mackie?

1584
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:47,560
Yes.

1585
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,160
He's, he's

1586
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:48,940
Finnish director.

1587
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,380
Comes up with

1588
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,340
kind of funny movies

1589
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:52,200
that you have to be a

1590
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,060
European to get him,

1591
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:54,240
though.

1592
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,500
Oh, I bet our friend

1593
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,240
Mr. Sister

1594
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,400
knows all about that.

1595
00:56:59,660 --> 00:56:59,980
I bet he does.

1596
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:00,580
I was gonna mention,

1597
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,340
speaking of, uh,

1598
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,280
of, um,

1599
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:04,820
this ancestors

1600
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:05,720
and descendants,

1601
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,060
he's been into

1602
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:07,260
genealogy

1603
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:07,840


1604
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,720
and we figured out

1605
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,880
why he's so interested.

1606
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:10,900
He's, he's close

1607
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,080
to proving that he's

1608
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,720
the true heir

1609
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,300
to the crown jewels

1610
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,660
of Sistarvania.

1611
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,460
Yes.

1612
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,020
Which is like

1613
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,340
some obscure corner

1614
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,280
of the,

1615
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,560
between Poland

1616
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,740
and Transylvania

1617
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,400
or something.

1618
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:24,960
Yes.

1619
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,120
Everyone there

1620
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,140
is related to him,

1621
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:28,040
but he's, he's

1622
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:28,960
a direct descendant

1623
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,720
of the rich landowner.

1624
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,280
Yes.

1625
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:32,440
And they had a palace.

1626
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,000
So he's,

1627
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,640
he's, um,

1628
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,680
he's working on

1629
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,720
proving that he's,

1630
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:37,820
um,

1631
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,080
actually the crown prince

1632
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,120
of, of Sistarvania.

1633
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,080
And, uh,

1634
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,400
just as I

1635
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,040
will someday prove

1636
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,660
that I am the heir

1637
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,000
to the Russian throne

1638
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,600
of the Romanovs.

1639
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:50,840
Yeah, the Rachmaninoffs,

1640
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:51,800
the composers.

1641
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,460
No, no, no.

1642
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:53,840
The Romanovs,

1643
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,420
the, the Tsar,

1644
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,560
the Tsar's family.

1645
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,000
I thought there was

1646
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,440
a kind of

1647
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,260
I'm not, I'm not

1648
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:58,960
a blood relation

1649
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,780
to Tsar Nicholas,

1650
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:01,940
but I,

1651
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,620
let's put it this way.

1652
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:04,700
Um,

1653
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,960
the Tsarina

1654
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,640
uh, uh,

1655
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:09,360
Alexandra

1656
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,180
and

1657
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,540
my great, great, great,

1658
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:12,960
great, great, great

1659
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,580
grandfather,

1660
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:15,780
Rasputin.

1661
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:16,980
Well, they kind of

1662
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,240
hooked up.

1663
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,200
Oh, I see

1664
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,200
which side of the family

1665
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:20,340
that comes from.

1666
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,200
That's where the Stangs

1667
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,840
come from.

1668
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:22,540
Yeah.

1669
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:22,900
Yeah.

1670
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:24,540
You've never heard

1671
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,020
that story?

1672
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,800
The unreported children

1673
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,800
of Rasputin

1674
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,220
and ladies

1675
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,000
in Zarnina,

1676
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:29,600
Starnina,

1677
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,100
Delaware.

1678
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:30,860
Yeah.

1679
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:31,900
Ivan Stang

1680
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:32,740
is the rightful

1681
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,620
Tsar of Russia.

1682
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,200
Ah, the wistful smile.

1683
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:36,780
But you know what?

1684
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:37,660
They do the Tsars

1685
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,280
in Russia,

1686
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,180
so I'm not going

1687
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:39,700
back there.

1688
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,080
Well, you're not going

1689
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:41,720
to get any of that

1690
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:42,480
property back.

1691
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,120
They already turned

1692
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,780
it into a gymnasium

1693
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:45,680
or something like that

1694
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,680
or they already

1695
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,200
tore it down

1696
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,100
for a parking lot.

1697
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:50,600
And then they

1698
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,180
wouldn't even know

1699
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,620
who the hell

1700
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:52,160
you were talking

1701
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:52,720
about anymore.

1702
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,440
Right.

1703
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,120
Except for maybe

1704
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:54,880
some old lady

1705
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,700
with a babooska

1706
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,240
might want to

1707
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:56,800
beat you up

1708
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,220
or something.

1709
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:57,820
Right.

1710
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,240
Yeah.

1711
00:58:59,460 --> 00:58:59,900
Yeah.

1712
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:00,940
Okay, Dave.

1713
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,280
Dave, it's, um,

1714
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,380
where we are

1715
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,680
in terms of

1716
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,280
time control,

1717
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:05,920
we have to,

1718
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:06,560
I'm going to have

1719
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,560
to fade you out

1720
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,780
in about 10 seconds.

1721
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,580
So what do you

1722
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,420
have to say, Dave?

1723
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,460
What do you have to say?

1724
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,900
What do you have to say, man?

1725
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:14,560
What do you have to say?

1726
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,060
Well, I just think

1727
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:15,780
everybody ought to,

1728
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,040
you know.

1729
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:16,520
Come on, come on,

1730
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:16,820
tell us.

1731
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:17,940
Come on, come on.

1732
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,580
This is important.

1733
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:20,640
This is your last time

1734
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,220
on the radio for a week.

1735
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,640
Everybody has too many desires.

1736
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,720
They should give them

1737
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:24,860
all to me.

1738
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:25,300
Spit it out.

1739
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,280
And I'll take care

1740
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,020
of them as long

1741
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:27,800
as I can.

1742
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:29,760
What?

1743
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,020
Okay, Dave.

1744
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,080
Bye.

1745
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:33,700
Wow.

1746
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,960
Look, he voluntarily

1747
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,980
got out

1748
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:36,480
real quick.

1749
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:36,900
Wow.

1750
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:37,540
That was horrifying.

1751
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,680
Never seen that happen before.

1752
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:39,920
Me either.

1753
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:41,620
Okay.

1754
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:42,580
Well.

1755
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,920
I'm out of here

1756
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,640
and we're listening

1757
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,020
to the amino acids.

1758
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:48,720
Great job.

1759
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,520
We'll be right back.

1760
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,980
We'll be right back.

1761
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:10,220
We'll be right back.

1762
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,580
We'll be right back.

1763
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,040
We'll be right back.

1764
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,040
