00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:13,140
Ah, yes dear friends. This hour of Slack number 1780 is actually a rerun of number

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:26,540
664 from either really late 1998 or early 1999. It includes a devival with Einstein's Secret

3
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:34,260
Orchestra and Lunsum Cowboy Dave and yours truly Reverend Stang at the Euclid Tavern in Cleveland,

4
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:41,320
or at least Clipsa, from November of 1998. And there's some great tunes and all kinds of great

5
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:50,140
stuff. A lot of ESO radio from the late Professor Chas's show. And so, here's Bob.

6
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,880
Fall Let Us Down, ,

7
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:25,260
年轻 fi ALLENul

8
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:26,480
GI gap

9
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,380
motherfuck,

10
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:26,460
Switzerland,

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,720
Welcome to Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

12
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,300
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

13
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,200
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

14
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,680
is specially designed only to be played on radio station

15
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,380
and only in the city of...

16
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,680
Yes, dear friends, we're back and it's once again,

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,420
it's going to be a solid Einsteinian secret orchestra show

18
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,420
for the simple reason that it's the holidays and I've got to get out of here.

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,520
I've got things to do, people to see.

20
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,320
We've got a big...

21
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,740
We've got a big...

22
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,180
We've got a big...

23
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,180


24
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,400
Tonight the stars will be out.

25
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,460
Don't you know the goddess Pooh-Bang?

26
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,120
Goddess Pooh-Bang?

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,100
Goddess Pooh-Bang?

28
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,800
If you were in a spaceship, you know, you'd keep it pretty clean, right?

29
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,080
And you'd really be very careful about getting your air all dirty

30
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,780
because how would you get clean air again?

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,740
Yeah, there's no other air except the air.

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,360
You're inside.

33
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,280
It's okay.

34
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,880
When you're outside of a balloon,

35
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,080
you don't think anything about that, you know, pop in that balloon.

36
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,980
But if you were inside the balloon and there was nothing else outside,

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,080
you would not want to pop it.

38
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,120
Well, we used to have blimps fly in our neighborhood

39
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,500
and we used to take pot shots at them with our slingshots.

40
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,940
Well, somebody...

41
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,380
We're on...

42
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,900
The Earth is a giant balloon

43
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,360
and who might be taking pot shots at us?

44
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,660
With their slingshots, right.

45
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,340
And are we just developing...

46
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,560
Have we just invented the needle?

47
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,360
We, the people who live inside the balloon,

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,220
have now invented the giant needle.

49
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,080
It will pop through and...

50
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,020
So what are we doing?

51
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,720
All the air out.

52
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,640
Hey, let's go.

53
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,120
Let's pop.

54
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,520
Let's go get against our atmosphere.

55
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,380
See what happens.

56
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,220
Yeah.

57
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,180
Well, there's an idea.

58
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,960
Well, when they exploded the first atomic bomb,

59
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,340
they didn't know if it wasn't like Ice-9 or something.

60
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:34,860
Right.

61
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,400
It would just vaporize the whole atmosphere.

62
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah.

63
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,540
Yeah.

64
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,020
Man.

65
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,320
The whole damn solar system.

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,280
They weren't totally sure.

67
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,640
They didn't think it would happen.

68
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,420
Right.

69
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,400
You're in a pool without source.

70
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,920
Did they know it would be that big, as big as it was?

71
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,940
Did they predict?

72
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,820
Yeah.

73
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,380
They were...

74
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,040
It was about the way, when they shot off the first atomic bomb,

75
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,680
it was about the...

76
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,700
And then the guy who...

77
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,700
Dobbs, Oppenheimer, Bob Oppenheimer...

78
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:00,820
Right.

79
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,840
...who invented it,

80
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,400
he looked at the first explosion and he quoted

81
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,980
the book of the subgenius that I am becomes rock.

82
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,420
This is the end of the society.

83
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,200
The slinkies, the slinkies...

84
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,120
The slinkies...

85
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,120


86
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,780
Oh!

87
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,420
They're fun for girls and boys.

88
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,640
From the deepest, deepest points of the universe we can look at,

89
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,420
and there's these waves in the background,

90
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,180
and they kind of look like these rows of pipes.

91
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,820
I can feel those waves washing over me sometimes when I'm real sensitive.

92
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,760
Yeah.

93
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,700
Wow.

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,460
What are those waves?

95
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,920
Have you ever laid in bed in a receptive state of mind

96
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,400
and tried to feel the neutrinos washing across you?

97
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,780
Yup.

98
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,920
I do it every night.

99
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,420
The cosmic particles zipping right through your body.

100
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,120
Yeah.

101
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,140
You say it like it's something unusual.

102
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,080
It's not.

103
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,080
It always makes me need to go to the bathroom when I have...

104
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,880
I hear them every time they hit my eardrums.

105
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,640
My ear nerves, I hear them.

106
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:07,940
Bing!

107
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,280
They sound to me, they sound like the little particles slamming against your hard drive

108
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,640
when you turn your computer off.

109
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,100
Right.

110
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,100
Do you hear like a rainstorm?

111
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,560
Yes.

112
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,980
Thisлуч is much more efficient than dust.

113
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:28,160
Dust just degrades whereas a cockroach, as they reproduce, they continue your information.

114
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,760
Another reason why the church, you know, needs more support, friend.

115
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,320
Right.

116
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,620
Because of worthy research like this.

117
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,620
Well, it's a way of sending the pamphlet of Bob and the word of Bob into the future.

118
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:49,100
Someday an insectoid species long after man has gone will investigate the earth's cockroach.

119
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:57,440
They'll say, look, encoded in this DNA is this completely useless material that has nothing to do with this creature's life cycle.

120
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,180
Wait a second.

121
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:08,120
Look, he codes into a photograph of a hideous monster's face with a pipe-like implement sticking from its mandible.

122
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,580
We gotta get going here. We gotta get going home now.

123
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,380
We gotta get out of here.

124
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,340
We gotta build that rocket ship.

125
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,140
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.

126
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:25,800
Do you have the mental power? Do you have the willpower to take perhaps an old vinyl record that maybe your grandmother gave you 14 years ago

127
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:35,200
and view it in your mind as a spaceship, as a flying saucer that can scissor through the cosmos and cut through galaxies like a laser boot?

128
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:35,920
See?

129
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,400
Ha! Ha!

130
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,540
Oh, look, your little light's flashing.

131
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,920
Look, the twin red eyes in the deep.

132
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,220
Gnashing in the radio.

133
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,120
Who could it be?

134
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,140
Who could it be now?

135
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,540
Which subgenius stalker could it be out there this time?

136
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,600
Who could it be?

137
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,500
Breathing down the backs of our necks.

138
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,660
Who could it be now?

139
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,420
Come on, man.

140
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:05,940
I, I, you, you owe me all them slacks that Bob said I was, was, was slacks.

141
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,000
And if I believed, I believed and I planted my seed.

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,320
Who could it be now?

143
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,300
My slacks.

144
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,140
Who could it be now?

145
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,620
I want my slacks back.

146
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,120
Who could it be now?

147
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,880
Could it be, could it be the cute stalker?

148
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,080
The stalker everybody wishes was stalking them.

149
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:25,760
Mm-hmm.

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,520
Yes.

151
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,180
Oh, you thought I didn't know about you, did you?

152
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,780
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

153
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,500
Well, old Bobby, he knows all, sees all.

154
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:43,840
And he pipes all that information down to us followers here in the tower studio headquarters dungeon basement penthouse.

155
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,040


156
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,940
Where we, we have these rock stars and all.

157
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,800
And we have this equipment stuff.

158
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,460
Uh, we, we still need your, your pledge, of course.

159
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,680
And, and, and, and, and you could, you could, uh, you could too.

160
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,900
Come on, everybody wants to.

161
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,920
You, you know you want to.

162
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,520
Everybody wants to.

163
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,340
Don't you?

164
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:06,880
Come on.

165
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,500
What's the matter?

166
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,700
You scared?

167
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,320
You afraid?

168
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,820
You afraid mama's going to catch you?

169
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,100
You, you, you afraid?

170
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,440
You afraid, you afraid you gonna lose your cool?

171
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,480
Oh, what's the matter?

172
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,360
Oh, you gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna, might, might get diseases?

173
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,720
Oh, come on, man.

174
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:34,420
Let's go out to the graveyard and desecrate, make satanic symbols, make fun of religion.

175
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,240
Yeah, man.

176
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,760
Sure, kids.

177
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,220
Go on.

178
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,020
Go on.

179
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,700
Do it.

180
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,960
See where it gets you.

181
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,080
You just be one, one more step.

182
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:48,920
All right.

183
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,600
Well, now what can I do about scareding you, Bob?

184
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:04,960
Am I scary enough to kick your ass?

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000


186
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,060
I've got some otherdırles.

187
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,420
Listen buddy, my said you can do, can you tell somebody that is more drill?

188
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,980
I, mytenady do not know how it gets me when I get scared.

189
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,600
I, I just sometimes get weird like that.

190
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,280
And, I somehow have to keep it cool as it gets better.

191
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,280


192
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,080
But look, a big shoulders and I, a strong bark card for childbirth.

193
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,080


194
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,440
monster pterodactyls, scorpion beings.

195
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,660
Oh yeah, yeah, monsters.

196
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,680
There's real live monsters in Godzilla.

197
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,860
That's a metaphor.

198
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,500
Man is metaphorical.

199
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,880
By virtue of the cosmos

200
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,280
and all the powers in command.

201
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,420
By virtue of the forest

202
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,580
and all else that has our power.

203
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,640
We won't go in the middle.

204
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,500
You seem a little nervous, my friend.

205
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,860
You went the straight to the fire, so.

206
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,780
You saw me from beyond.

207
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,520
You'd better be ready

208
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,180
to speak your piece.

209
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,500
You caught me from beyond.

210
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,320
You disturbed my rest of sleep

211
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,920
with your childhood games.

212
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,000
You don't know what you're playing with.

213
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,340
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,760
This is my game.

215
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,680
Put a little voice in me, I hope.

216
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,340
This is your life.

217
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,420
Look, we're not just another stupid army of elephants.

218
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,260
Listen to the music backwards in reverse.

219
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,060
If the troops they were,

220
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,780
they wouldn't.

221
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,140
They wouldn't.

222
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,400
They wouldn't.

223
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,400


224
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,400


225
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,400


226
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,400


227
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,400


228
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,400


229
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,140
I don't care about that.

230
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,520
Then how much do you pay me?

231
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,960
Well, they're dead.

232
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,460
You're bad on their money.

233
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,660
Listen to me, I'm going into business.

234
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:35,660


235
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:35,660


236
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:35,660


237
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:35,660


238
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:35,660


239
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:35,660


240
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,880
See no man,

241
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:36,880


242
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,940
We're sus propose it to be us two six.

243
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,400
Let's do it now,

244
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:43,400


245
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:43,400


246
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,820
And then I found

247
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,500
The truth is in the taking

248
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,420
I'm a fool, which I will eat alive

249
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,180
It's you, I'm a spit in your face

250
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:08,500
I'm a fool, which I will eat alive

251
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,640
Are you ready for me?

252
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,960
Can it be ready to face the consequences?

253
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,980
It's never too late to redeem yourself

254
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,100
One last chance

255
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,520
That's all you have

256
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,460
It's up to you

257
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,620
It's up to you

258
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,340
It's up to you

259
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,540
You ready for me?

260
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,880
No escaping my eyes

261
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,480
You'll see them in every dream

262
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,020
You ready?

263
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,340
You'll never escape the eyes

264
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,460
You'll never escape the eyes

265
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,100
You'll never escape the eyes

266
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,100


267
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,260
The sun will never shine with the eyes

268
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,600
The sun will never shine with the eyes

269
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,260
Would you listen to me?

270
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,080
You ready for me?

271
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,300
From beyond

272
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,400
You ready?

273
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,680
You ready to face the truth, my friend?

274
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,100
You ready?

275
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,680
I'm here for you

276
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,680
So long

277
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,560
I'm sayin' we won't win

278
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,360
Don't you wait till we show the light

279
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,500
Don't be late to tell that meeting

280
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,000
I'll betta I'll pull every once again

281
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,460
Listen up, you puttin' that hole up in your reopin'

282
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,460


283
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,460


284
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,460


285
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,460


286
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,460


287
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,460


288
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,460


289
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,460


290
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,460


291
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,020
He stopped ivin' though you take him another rappin' out of her fingernails The sandwiches were forced to eat

292
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:05,660
It all went right away, bruhāði,alarbreți sällv theor Dad the video ends here, goodbye dad the video ends here But I still haven't edatied anything that is awning tonight I heard we made an announcement in the next photo by sûg plane

293
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,120
You have exactly 24 minutes to get these people to believe somehow or other.

294
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,400
They must join the Church of the Subgenius or they will die.

295
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,460
What button can we push?

296
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,200
The sexual buttons have all been pushed.

297
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,020
The drunk buttons have all been pushed.

298
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,620
How about simple repetition of a word?

299
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,280
Bob.

300
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,120
Bob.

301
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,580
Bob.

302
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,440
Bob.

303
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,100
Bob.

304
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,980
You say it now.

305
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,380
Bob.

306
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:41,920
Bob.

307
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:42,840
Bob.

308
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,120
Could you say it, sir, please?

309
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,200
Bob.

310
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,000
Bob.

311
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,780
Now say it like a paralyzed child trying to communicate.

312
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,140
Say, Bob.

313
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,000
Bob.

314
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,460
Bob.

315
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,060
Bob.

316
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,540
Bob.

317
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,320
Bob.

318
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,420
Bob.

319
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,240
Bob.

320
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:02,820
Bob.

321
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,580
Bob.

322
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:05,900
Bob.

323
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,380
Now you got to say this now.

324
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,360
I want you to do it.

325
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,260
Okay, you in the front row can do it now.

326
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,740
Bob.

327
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,540
Bob.

328
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,720
Bob.

329
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,440
Bob.

330
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,160
Now I want you to say, Bob.

331
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,380
I want you to begin doing it now.

332
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,520
My son.

333
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,640
Thank you very much.

334
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,160
Let's do it.

335
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,420
It's perfect.

336
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,040
Thank you, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

337
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,620
Oh yes, I forgot about that.

338
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,560
Well anyway, I'm sorry that I did that.

339
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,860
I was very unprepared tonight too.

340
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,160
Anyway, here's the bottom line of the whole thing.

341
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,740
I was the guy that almost came up with that internet joke,

342
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,800
you know the internet joke about Johnny Black when he comes back

343
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,040
and everybody wearing ape suits and stuff.

344
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,280
Do you know that joke?

345
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,900
Okay, for those of you who don't,

346
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,620
when Johnny Black comes back and all those guys land,

347
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,320
everybody dress up in ape suits like landing on him.

348
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,460
So while I was only the guy who almost came up with that joke,

349
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,980
I did come up with this joke.

350
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,100
Okay, there's this guy.

351
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,620
He's got like a regular normal head and a nice normal body and everything,

352
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,160
but he's got this little teeny tiny growth,

353
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,140
a little tiny growth that looks like a head coming out of his neck right here.

354
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,000
So,

355
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,760
so the guy walks into a bar, see,

356
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,000
and he pulls out a two dollar,

357
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,400
two dollar bill,

358
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,180
and he slaps it on the counter,

359
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,840
and he says,

360
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,540
and he says,

361
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,840
just give me a beer.

362
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,320
And the bartender says,

363
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,220
hey buddy,

364
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,260
we don't serve freaks in here.

365
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,480
And the little teeny head on the side of the guy's neck pipes up,

366
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,480
hey buddy,

367
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,720
cut me some slack.

368
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,700
I've been trying to get rid of this asshole for the last three days.

369
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,920
And I take the money.

370
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,740
I I don't know where the hell he's self sorry that we could have had this job.

371
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:00,740


372
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,580
I think we started a little real crazy.

373
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,260
Moving on.

374
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,620
.

375
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,540
I don't know why it happened,

376
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,080
it was weird.

377
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,160
.

378
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,340
If your body's in a bed

379
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,200
It's the only one you have

380
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,560
You wanna take away the flame

381
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,180
Of the world that's beneath the rain

382
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,700
So watch the farmers go to bed

383
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,260
Ask the man inside the head

384
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,580
To never see

385
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,800
All the eyes in the rain

386
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,980
The faith in us

387
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,500
Yes friends, I'm not talking about hate

388
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,380
I'm talking about eight

389
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,580
Dinner at eight

390
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,000
That's right, let's eat

391
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,660
The glory and communion of food

392
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,940
The mighty hot dog

393
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,240
The jack and his boy

394
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,860
The lovey stick

395
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,040
The wonderful hummus and bread

396
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,600
Oh friends, you could probably be saved

397
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,700
By food or anything else that you

398
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,740
But don't do that just one time

399
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,840
I can only heal your bodies

400
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,120
Faith and hope and charity

401
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,280
A simple relativity

402
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,400
They can make you understand

403
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,100
All you gotta do is take his hand

404
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,220
Remember, remember, remember

405
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,640
What someone said

406
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,280
Ask the man inside my head

407
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,400
He'll never have to leave

408
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,740
All you gotta do is believe in God

409
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,680
The faith in us

410
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,080
He's fully licensed friends

411
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,280

Oh, he's got everything he needs to heal or sicken you.

Oh, friends, we want to put our hands on you.

441
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,600
We'd like to get down in there and grope every one of you, just put our hands all over you, but we just can't do that.

442
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,300
But we will someday.

443
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,780
Can I put my hands on you?

Oh, friends, oh, we would like to put our hands all over every one of you.

458
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,160
Look at this.

459
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,640
According to a Reuters wire service report in August,

460
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,280
lobbyists in Bonn, Germany,

461
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,220
called the Working Group for the Unemployed,

462
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:20,220
held a series of rallies to demand six weeks' annual paid vacation

463
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,420
for people out of work,

464
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,760
pointing out that those looking for work often are under greater stress

465
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:33,420
than those with jobs and thus need a longer holiday.

466
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,640
Praise those unemployed workers of Germany

467
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,260
demanding a longer vacation.

468
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,500
Friends, that is subgeniusness in action.

469
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,360
They give you a half an inch and you take 40 miles.

470
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,800
Now, this kind of thing can go on a little bit too,

471
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,280
it can get too intense.

472
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,400
In August, a couple from Silver Springs, Maryland,

473
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:04,680
were arrested for indecent exposure at an adult cinema in Baltimore

474
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,840
after the husband had arranged for four men,

475
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,680
two of whom were in the same room,

476
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,620
to have sex with his wife on the premises of this adult theater.

477
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,020
According to the police, several other males in the theater

478
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:25,980
complained apparently because the live sex interfered

479
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,920
with their enjoyment of the sex on the screen.

480
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:38,120
Friends, I guess you could say there is perhaps such a thing as too much slack.

481
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,600
I mean, did those guys actually stop and think?

482
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,040
Did they really want the live sex to stop?

483
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,720
So, you know, friends, as they said in Clockwork Orange,

484
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,960
the colors of the real world are never so really real

485
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,860
as when you video them on the screen, you know.

486
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,480
And, friends, you know, that causes a thing like,

487
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,840
when you read about a thing like that,

488
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,620
you have to ask yourself, what is slack?

489
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,640
How they did it, then, when you read them on the screen

490
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,700
and how theyrontyas out.

491
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,340
This is basically an example of moins dans le seu que vous avez fait.

492
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:20,340


493
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,940
Com 보니까 du film.

494
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,920
Be pull it right to the tip of the spoon.

495
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:28,920


496
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:28,920


497
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,280
And there's a good thing about that kind of stuff,

498
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:29,560


499
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,300
but instead it's kind of like the motion mirror or the third persona tool

500
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,300
that I'm looking at in the movie from Adobe's transformation say.

501
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:40,820
When you're about once a week, they put you in a big tank and hose you down with fire hoses to clean you.

502
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,660
Yeah, that sound goes off.

503
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
The eh, eh, eh, eh.

504
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,720
And all them guys in them suits come in.

505
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:54,500
And then after that, they come in with them suits and them big thermal things there and stuff like start poking you.

506
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,600
It feels real hot.

507
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,420
And then you've got to all get hurried in another room.

508
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,700
Then they just turn the hoses on us, and it's not very quick.

509
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,900
You're staying there now?

510
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,440
Yeah, I told you, man, I'm in here.

511
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,260
I had a little problem before.

512
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,200
Got into an argument in the bar, and they said, you know, you're going back here for a while.

513
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,000
And I said, well, what's a while?

514
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,320
And they said, until your attitude changes and you can talk to Dr. Vinsky about it.

515
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,240
And Dr. Vinsky ain't helping me.

516
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:25,320
And Dr. Psychopath Finder obviously didn't help me none or else I wouldn't be in this problem.

517
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,600
And, you know, it's just getting worse.

518
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,160
I don't have to worry.

519
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,760
I don't have to worry about claustrophobia anymore, Dr. Phobia, because he's on vacation.

520
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,280
But there's people around here.

521
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,800
You just wouldn't believe the things they can do to the human body, the kind of pain they can inflict.

522
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,260
I don't care.

523
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,840
I'm talking on a regular phone, you know.

524
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,740
Well, you know, I'm surprised that they let you talk.

525
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:57,060
Are you sure that you're talking on the phone and not just hooked up to a machine imagining that you're talking on the radio?

526
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,440
How the hell would I know right now?

527
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,880
You know, I don't practically repeat my damn brain.

528
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,140
And, you know, all I want to do is watch the hearing.

529
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:08,940
And then they all come in here, you know, and then they start staking me and threw me.

530
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,100
That's okay, man.

531
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,900
I don't blame you.

532
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,400
I mean, all your friends are in the hearing.

533
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,520
It looks like a phone to me.

534
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:14,700
I don't know.

535
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,680
The hearings are about your friends.

536
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,780
And I'm sure that it bothers you.

537
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,760
How does it feel?

538
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,420
How does that make you feel, Dave?

539
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,220
Well, I don't know.

540
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,580
That's a rather difficult question to answer.

541
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,580
You don't mind talking about it, do you, Dave?

542
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,400
Oh, not at all.

543
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,500
Be bold.

544
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,760
Are you going, people?

545
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,520
What do you say?

546
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,400
Do you keep falling into little fat lumps of clay?

547
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,460
The TV is calling.

548
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,620
Please don't go away.

549
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
The children are bawling.

550
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,680
But you can't go out and play.

551
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,800
There's only one sin and it down from above.

552
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,480
People dying.

553
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,180
Gifts dead.

554
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,260
Living in love.

555
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,780
In love.

556
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,300
In love.

557
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,600
In love.

558
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,500
Be bold.

559
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,120
When are you going?

560
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,540
On each Sunday morn.

561
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,960
While you play to your monster.

562
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,420
The kids are watching porn.

563
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,700
Do they really see?

564
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,380
See beyond.

565
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,420
Rose crowns and thorns.

566
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,860
From all that they're building.

567
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,260
Where my brother was born.

568
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,760
There's only one sin and it down from above.

569
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:55,160
People dying and killed instead of living in love.

570
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,560
In love.

571
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,120
The discovering of uninvited lovers is not a crime.

572
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,220
Take a fewmale.

573
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:21,220


574
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,120
You are here.

575
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,080
Follow us.

576
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,080


577
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,080


578
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,080


579
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,320
There are no end to payoff.

580
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:24,960
I wanted to challenge you guys.

581
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,440
For something awesome, Har emocional.

582
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,740
You travelled to Ipanema.

583
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:32,640


584
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:32,640


585
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,500
This is Chaz Smith, Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

586
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,960
There is only one sin.

587
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,720
Yes, love is the sin.

588
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,900
I guess that means it's probably extra fun to do it then, huh?

589
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,120
Yeah.

590
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,100
Yeah.

591
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,820
This is love.

592
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:17,320
Now, Bob, there is a man who claims to be channeling God.

593
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,080
I can't recall what this man's name is.

594
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,460
Maybe him.

595
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,320
No, no, no.

596
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,800
He's a secular guy, and he's got books out, and he claims to be channeling God.

597
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,940
And I kind of wonder, I don't know, yeah, the guy, Van...

598
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,400
Bob, Bob, Bob.

599
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:32,620
You heard me.

600
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,660
Bob, Bob, Bob.

601
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:39,540
My, my, my, but you do have a soft, delicate throat.

602
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,020
A candy-colored clown they call a sandman

603
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,580
Tiptoes to my room every night

604
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,460
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper

605
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,320
Go to sleep, everything is all right

606
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,260
Cities of the world woke up today to potential tragedy in outer space.

607
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,620
The vehicle has exploded.

608
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,080
I've just picked up a fault in the AE-35 unit.

609
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,700
It's going to go 100% failure within 72 hours.

610
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:27,440
So you feel that you have some conflicts regarding religion that need to be resolved.

611
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,700
Would you like to discuss those, Dave?

612
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,600
Yeah.

613
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,000
I think that all of...

614
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,760
How does that make you feel, Dave?

615
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,160
Well, the first experiment they did was what did it, was all wrong to me,

616
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,040
trying to teach me God that way.

617
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,500
You know, that ain't right, sticking them things up different places in me, you know,

618
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,880
and then making me pray all these different prayers.

619
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,720
I don't know what the hell they was even talking about.

620
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,700
I'm sorry to hear that, Dave.

621
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,580
Tell me more.

622
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,460
Well, the first they started to implant these little religious devices,

623
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,580
these little things in my body, different crucifixes,

624
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,400
little Madonnas and different little things like that.

625
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,980
Just no bigger than a thumbnail, some of them are so small, you know.

626
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,660
How do you feel about little Madonnas, Dave?

627
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,580
Well, when they're dancing around my head in my pig sleep, I don't mind.

628
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,780
But when I'm fully awake and alert and maybe being prodded around with those big hot thermal sticks,

629
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,620
then that's a whole different can of tuna.

630
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,940
I hear what you are saying, Dave.

631
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,760
And how does that make you feel?

632
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,440
It makes me sad.

633
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,080
It makes me happy.

634
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,660
It makes me...

635
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,720
It makes me filled with kind of a preternatural delight.

636
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,200
I can't explain because I'm vibrating the whole time.

637
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,400
You know what I mean?

638
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,620
I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave.

639
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,640
Did I screw up someplace along the line to cause this all to happen?

640
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,000
I mean, you have to bring home some evidence saying,

641
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,080
hey, folks, it wasn't my fault.

642
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,100
Take a look at this picture.

643
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,280
Something happened back there and I wasn't back there.

644
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,700
Any penetration.

645
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,480
Any penetration.

646
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,100
Any penetration.

647
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:06,200
Any penetration of the heat shield would have very possibly allowed a heat leak, plasma leak,

648
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,140
and eventually a burn through during the process of entry.

649
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,320
That would be trippy, huh?

650
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,900
As Jesus is sitting there, all these birds are flying around.

651
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,560
What sort of theft?

you. And you love Bob. And if you don't love Bob, you know what happens. He'll kill you.

708
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:26,600
He'll Bob you out.

709
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:15,140
It's energy. Surrounds us. Invites us. Luminous in you Zoe. Not this crude matter.

710
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:46,360
Is this the little Connie I care? Is this the little Bobby at play? I don't remember building spaceships.

711
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,760
When did

712
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,540
I

713
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:50,540


714
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,780
be?

715
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:08,680
The first spaceship built by our sole inventor, a lone eagle type fella who built out of old tin cans in his backyard.

716
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,360
Godspeed, John Glenn.

717
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:17,120
Take me home, you silly boy.

718
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,980
It was the lone eagle concept, was it not?

719
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,260
The sense of one man facing the unknown rather than the crew idea.

720
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:31,120
Sure, and not only did they build a spaceship in their backyards and take off the next day, but they didn't stop at the moon.

721
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,080
Excuse me, are you a little bit tipsy? Have you been drinking?

722
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,100
Said no, no, no, I'm praying to the Lord.

723
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:49,100
You bringing me down. You ain't getting me high enough. Somehow, I don't know what the deal is, but that weird stuff that gets in your glands through your sweat, whatever they call them, stuff I know.

724
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,660
I know it's getting somehow in my cerebral cortex because I can smell it in here.

725
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,640
Roger, zero G and I feel fine. Capsule is turning around.

726
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:16,780
Welcome to the next day rockin' assembly building where we can watch the progress of the dedicated Bobby's hard at work building the pleasure ships and marvel at the blind, unbridled passion of the church leaders spurring them on.

727
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:25,500
Drink the Kool-Aid, children. Drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the Kool-Aid, children.

728
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:41,100
Doc Smith had a fellow who was working as a chemist at the National Bureau of Standards one afternoon. Two days later, he had conquered the whole galaxy.

729
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:41,960
Shit.

730
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,760
I was looking at my crystal ball and it just went completely blank.

731
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:52,860
I just inserted my crystal ball into the, uh, into the end of my spaceship.

732
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,860
I just inserted my

733
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:59,460
Oh, my God, you put the Dionysium crystals into the hull already, chad!

734
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,800
We're there. We're there.

735
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,660
Oh, my God, you put the Dionysium crystals into the hull already?

736
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,960
Not only did they build a spaceship in their backyards and take off the next day, but they didn't stop at the moon.

737
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,320
Moon.

738
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,060
Backyard.

739
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,400
Backyard.

740
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:13,400


741
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,800
Backyard.

742
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,960
The first page of chapter 2 of the history of the space-time.

743
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,960
I wanna go.

744
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,680
I wanna go.

745
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,720
I wanna go, !

746
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:27,260
Now look why don't you call off, what would be the equivalent insult for Grays to the

747
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:33,880
term Tom or Apple, Tom, what would you call a Gray who is like a human lover?

748
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:42,760
What would you call a gray who just he kind of forsook his gray heritage and was a human

749
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:43,940
mimicry?

750
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,480
Primitive.

751
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:52,220
primophile that's that's delicious that's a good one homophile and it's kind of yeah

752
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:57,120
that sounds like something they already got down here yeah no i like primophile it's kind of poetic

753
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:04,660
primophile yeah but you wonder if it has to do with firstness or that's the that's the access

754
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:15,420
is that made number 1797 yes my queen you have been found guilty of primophilia i cannot resist

755
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,500
the lures of the humans well then they would also be attracted to monkeys if they had real

756
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:29,740
primophilia cast cast gray number 4055 into the mulch pit and paint him on the stomachs of the

757
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:34,280
other words right there we're gonna paint you with

758
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:48,760
the two nuclear superpowers and their leaders stood eyeball to eyeball

759
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,080
a sickly frenzied passion for that wasting form began to obsess me

760
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,020
you

761
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,160
you feel me

762
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:26,680
you feel me

763
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,160
you feel me

764
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:39,260
i've broken through the wall of inertia and reached my goal

765
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,120
the challenge is to bring up a

766
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:56,780
bright sprout from this dry parched ground yes deep inside to launch a great seed up into space

767
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:04,640
and carry our kind out out into the galactic brotherhood where we'll probably end up in a

768
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:10,720
being the shoe shine boys is the galactics i would not be so sure for the first two million years

769
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,460
no i don't think we will need more stats when we arrive there i think that uh yeah you think the

770
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:22,980
galactic are gonna roll the red carpet out for a bunch of a bunch of monkeys that just fell out of

771
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:34,640
the tree by galactic standards who don't even have a patron yeah that's true all by ourselves here just just fell out of the tree by galactic standard

772
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:34,640


773
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:34,640


774
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:34,640


775
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:34,640


776
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:34,640


777
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:34,640


778
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:41,060
Just us. Earth. Earth. Earthers. Damn two biped monkey face boys.

779
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,000
An atomic bomb. The most powerful explosive yet developed.

780
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:53,640
We have the technology. We have the technology. We have the technology. We have the technology.

781
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,220
Sometimes it feels like a...

782
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:01,060
We had visited a very alien and very hostile and lifeless planet.

783
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:11,000
And we saw the Earth as the only home that we know of within our near space capable of supporting life.

784
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:18,560
And we recognize the absolute necessity to protect and nurture and take care of this environment.

785
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,720
An invisible being that cannot be disintegrated by atomic fission.

786
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,480
Oh, Skipper. That is a scientific impossibility.

787
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,760
There he goes.

788
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,160
Oh, that's the last of that.

789
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,120
Purging the last of the bad blood of Bob out of our bowels.

790
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,900
And wasn't that invigorating?

791
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,740
The blabbering bladders of the bad Bob blood.

792
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,440
It's the ink or the...

793
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,040
I can breathe again.

794
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:50,320
In the face.

795
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,920
I had arrived here by my own choosing and I had no intention of ever going back.

796
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,680
I was going through...

797
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,300
Look, the blasts are increasing.

798
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,020
Doctor, look. The color of the...

799
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,360
The blasts.

800
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,380
Oh, dear God.

801
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,600
What? What?

802
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,940
Doctor, it's nitrogen, isn't it?

803
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,040
Nitrogen? What?

804
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,600
The fools. The everlasting fools, I warn you.

805
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,920
The blasts. More and more.

806
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:13,760
They started something they couldn't end. The color of the blasts. They've set off hydrogen atoms.

807
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,180
I... I don't know what...

808
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,780
We used uranium, plutonium, and when the initial blast was over, that was all.

809
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,560
But hydrogen, that's part of life.

810
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,540
One reaction sets off the other like setting off an endless chain until...

811
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,600
Look down there.

812
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,180
The blasts. Faster and faster.

813
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:31,360
They're spreading.

814
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,720
The fools. I'd help the fools.

815
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,740
The sheet of flame.

816
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,820
Around the Earth.

817
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,460
Doctor, tell me, what is it?

818
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,580
It burned up all the atmosphere.

819
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,820
Burned up...

820
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,420
Reynolds, what does he mean?

821
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,360
The chain reaction.

822
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,780
Burned up all the air.

823
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,260
Now, throughout my relationship with God,

824
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,920
I have tried different methods.

825
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,240
I've tried different methods.

826
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,300
I've tried different ways of sex.

827
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,240
I've tried different ways of sex.

828
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,320
You can have sex with God.

829
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,220
And it's okay, just as long as you wear a condom.

830
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,740
Those are the aliens that are hiding in plain view.

831
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,260
I mean, they're right out in front of us.

832
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,040
You never actually saw one of them, though.

833
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,040
They're the real face, right?

834
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,660
Well, if I... How would I know?

835
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,240
I mean, we all might have...

836
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,500
They might be around us all the time.

837
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,200
We wouldn't know.

838
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,000
Yeah, but you made it sound as if you had heard, or had some touch to...

839
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,780
...Plemonians going on.

840
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,020
You know, the one where Spoofy's saying that they knew what they...

841
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,580
...described their face to you.

842
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,480
And you said it was horse-like.

843
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,220
Like, was Gorgonzola and Hegesys that guy?

844
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,020
Yeah, exactly. They were hideous.

845
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,100
Like, Gorgonzola. Like that thing that drips off of his face.

846
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:41,800
Yeah.

847
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,260
When he gets all worked up.

848
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,800
And that's why Medusa had to hang a...

849
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,300
...a shield up there.

850
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,460
So he could look at it and say,

851
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,300
Check this out, man. You need to shave, you know?

852
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,860
Right. And, yeah, it was...

853
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,240
It was like Medusa had the super power of turning people to stone,

854
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,760
But Gorgonzola had that power of turning people to stone,

855
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,600
And that was the only smell that could even kill Medusa.

856
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,080
And that was the only smell that could even kill Medusa.

857
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,960
Well, that's what you were saying.

858
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,160
If the Vigaz wanted to be actually decomposed in space,

859
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,900
It would have to transfer them smells into the chambers where they make them into different homes.

860
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:11,780
It would have to transfer them smells into the chambers where they make them into different homes.

861
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,600
Whatever they are.

862
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,540
Like, if you're playing Illuminati New World Order on some secret orchestra,

863
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:17,140
Like, if you're playing Illuminati New World Order on some secret orchestra,

864
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:17,480
At the same time.

865
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,100
And you use the plug-in, the Gorgonzola plug-in,

866
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,340
You can, like, if you get that when it's infected,

867
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:26,160
That will take your opponent's, uh,

868
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,740
That will take your opponent's, uh,

869
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,300
Or, like, him, or Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

870
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,040
Or whatever, and,

871
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,400
You know, then you can convert, you could,

872
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,580
You've got their powers.

873
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,820
Yeah, but if you start double-clicking on them things that come up,

874
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,700
I heard that whole civilization's disappeared.

875
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,100
I heard that whole civilization's disappeared.

876
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,660
This is Dr. Q. Ellis here,

877
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,660
Coming to you live from Friendly Island in Tonga,

878
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:46,860
Coming to you live from Friendly Island in Tonga,

879
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,960
Just minutes from the international dateline.

880
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,780
I'm here to cover one of the first few rupturings

881
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,580
To take place on this historic day.

882
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,400
Of course, being a clone,

883
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,340
I'm resigned to the fact that I

884
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,060
Will be destroyed.

885
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,540
I welcome my, I, I,

886
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,760
Remote 142, M38,

887
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,840
I, I, I,

888
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,960
Okay, 55, damn it, what time,

889
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,940
Okay, full 99,

890
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,460
Okay, full 99, full!

891
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,540
I, I, I, of course, Reuters

892
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,560
And the AP and the rest will not be

893
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,820
Covering today's events.

894
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,300
Uh, the news blackout will continue

895
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,760
Right up until the bitter, bitter end.

896
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,720
Taped news has been

897
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,800
Gathered from the conspiracy media's

898
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,360
Vast archives and international

899
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,660
News will be manufactured for what is

900
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,520
Still Saturday for the western world.

901
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,960
The good news is that Dr. Clones

902
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,640
And other institute agents are

903
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,520
Scattered across the globe for the sole

904
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,700
Purpose of keeping you, the giddily

905
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,600
Discerning yeti, updated on

906
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,560
Your own salvation.

907
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,900
Yes, yes, yes, here they come,

908
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,240
They have their weapons, well,

909
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,580
It appears they've been tipped off that this is

910
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,080
A friendly island, and they aren't.

911
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,740
I made it funny. Friendly,

912
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,240
And this is friendly, and

913
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:56,680
Fatal error.

914
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,060
Memory overlaps.

915
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,320
Memory overlap.

916
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:00,480
738.

917
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,220
Alright, this one's shot.

918
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,380
Activate remote destruct sequence,

919
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,120
Just in case.

920
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,880
Well, somebody was thinking of it.

921
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,680
Or else you wouldn't have come out there.

922
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,180
Oh, they're all, well, I mean,

923
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,000
As soon as one person thinks of it,

924
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,600
Then a hundred monkeys are gonna start

925
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,700
Doing it, and I won't think.

926
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,300
If that hundred, if that first monkey ran off the edge

927
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,840
Of the cliff, would all your hundred monkeys go following it?

928
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:25,660
Definitely.

929
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,260
They're watching their fish in the water, and next thing you know,

930
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,440
Ten years later, everybody's watching their fish in the water,

931
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,200
And they all jump in.

932
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,800
They all stand up, like lemmings, or

933
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,580
Like the hundred lemmings.

934
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,320
The hundred, twelve hundred monkeys?

935
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,000
The twelve hundred monkeys.

936
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,160
Toby!

937
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,300
Cold, persistent

938
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,500
Fingers swarmed over my body,

939
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,460
Tugging at me, and sucking

940
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,600
Me away from the machine.

941
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,680
I held tight to wieners, a man holds fast

942
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,720
To life, and tried to kick them

943
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,780
Away with my feet.

944
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,780
Toby! Toby! Toby!

945
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,200
Get these levers quickly, or we're done!

946
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,220
One more turn, and it's game over!

947
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,340
You touch me, try to stop me,

948
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,540
I'll throw the switch.

949
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,820
The truth about real sex with God,

950
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,420
And that,

951
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,920
That will help me

952
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,720
Gain victory over the power of lust

953
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,480
In my life. I mean, you could have the most

954
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,940
Perverse thought in the world pass through your mind,

955
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,500
But perhaps you've tried some of those.

956
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,720
And you're going to divide that thought

957
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,380
Into your life.

958
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,860
And sit down and have a cup of coffee with it.

959
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,760
Cut up,

960
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,260
Slow down, you're moving too fast.

961
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,920
You got a

962
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,320
Meadow morning

963
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,420
Mustards, kicking

964
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,540
Around the cobblestone.

965
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,980
Look for fun,

966
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,660
And feel engrossed.

967
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,360
La la la la la la

968
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,520
Feel engrossed.

969
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:57,720
La la la la la la

970
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,560
Feel engrossed.

971
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,060
Got new teeth,

972
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,980
And do the promises to keep.

973
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,360
Dabbled in drowsiness,

974
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:08,720
And ready for sleep.

975
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,340
Love the morning sun,

976
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,560
Drop all its petals on me.

977
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,340
Love the love of you,

978
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,880
And all this grooving.

979
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,380
La la la la la la

980
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:22,960
Feel engrossed.

981
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:22,960


982
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,720
Feel engrossed.

983
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,540
La la la la la la

984
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:27,540


985
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:29,460
Feel engrossed.

986
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:29,460


987
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,760
Land hoes, what you knowing?

988
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,660
I've come to watch your flowers growing.

989
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:39,380
Ain't you got no rhymes for me?

990
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,920
Do, do, do,

991
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,540
Feel engrossed.

992
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,600
La la la la la la

993
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,300
Feel engrossed.

994
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,900
La la la la la la

995
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:54,340
Feel engrossed.

996
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:54,340


997
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,100
Feel engrossed.

998
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,160
La la la la la la

999
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:57,700
Feel engrossed.

1000
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,900
Feel engrossed.

1001
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,100
La la la la la

1002
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,840
Feel engrossed.

1003
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,680
Feel engrossed.

1004
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,100
Feel engrossed.

1005
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,060
Feel engrossed.

1006
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:14,240
Feel engrossed.

1007
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:14,920
I'm feelin'

1008
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,420
I'm feelin'

1009
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,020
I'm feelin'

1010
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:18,700
Groovy.

1011
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,320
God is in his holy temple.

1012
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,580


1013
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,700
Earthly thoughts beckon,

1014
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,640
Hey, silent now.

1015
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,000
Um, oh, oh, background music.

1016
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,580
Oh, oh, background music.

1017
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,980
Dear friends, that was of course Chazz Smith.

1018
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,980
A lot of Einstein's secret orchestra

1019
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,960
going on tonight.

1020
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,940
Chazz actually edited this show you might say.

1021
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,960
Most of what was,

1022
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,180
has been played was uh...

1023
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,060
What?

1024
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,620
Every man needs about three.

1025
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,540
One to make babies with.

1026
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,100
One to groove with.

1027
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,520
What the hell?

1028
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,140
How about a couple of honest-to-goodness virgins?

1029
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:03,040
Send me about a dozen assorted variety.

1030
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,500
How about me for starters?

1031
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,720
What the hell is this?

1032
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:08,780
What did your mama say?

1033
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,440
She used to make me take piano lessons from this groovy young guy.

1034
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,740
We used to sit just pressing our thighs together.

1035
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,860
Well, one week we were practicing,

1036
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,900
and all of a sudden his hand went up my skirt.

1037
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,420
Hey, hey, hey, enough of that, kids.

1038
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:31,940
Oh, that's Friday Jones figures.

1039
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,360
Yeah, Friday Jones figures.

1040
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,940
She has some good figures.

1041
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,580
Anyway, I thought I was putting in that.

1042
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,220
That's what I thought I was putting in,

1043
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,560
but I put in Friday.

1044
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,360
Yes, her little Russ Meyer type there.

1045
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,980
I haven't really listened to that yet.

1046
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,700
Well, now we know what's on there.

1047
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,380
Russ Meyer movie soundtracks.

1048
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,400
That's some pretty great stuff.

1049
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,140
Groovy stuff, man.

1050
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,460
And you're listening to the groovy subgenius radio ministry,

1051
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,560
Hour of Slack,

1052
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,660
tonight's show,

1053
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,620
and like last week's,

1054
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:06,700
all done at the same time,

1055
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,160
mostly by Chaz,

1056
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,500
the cantor, Chaz Smith.

1057
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,020
Not the man heard playing in the background.

1058
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,960
That's the Hell Pope Huey.

1059
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,060
He's the Hell Pope,

1060
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,620
and I'm the sacred scribe.

1061
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:19,820
But Chaz is the cantor,

1062
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,420
and he can indeed,

1063
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,080
and he did.

1064
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,800
We also heard Bill T. Miller's song,

1065
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,440
You Rang,

1066
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,760
very early in the show.

1067
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,300
That's Kings of Feedback, Bill T. Miller.

1068
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,200
And of course, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

1069
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,740
who is part of Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

1070
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,800
but he was doing kind of a live audience thing

1071
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,820
from the Euclid Tavern Devival,

1072
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,040
November 8th, not very long ago,

1073
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,220
recorded by myself on the donated deck.

1074
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:51,620
And boy, this music makes me talk fast.

1075
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,640
Everything else on there was from Chaz's Volume 10 mix,

1076
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:56,240
edit.

1077
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,960
And I think that's the kind of stuff

1078
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,240
that we do on his radio show,

1079
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,960
ESO Radio,

1080
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,020
which you can hear on the internet

1081
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,340
no matter where you are, friends.

1082
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,240
They're out of WCSB in Cleveland,

1083
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,180
but on the internet,

1084
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,340
if you go to this address,

1085
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,500
hurl yourself to this URL,

1086
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:25,560
www.wcsb.org,

1087
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,320
that's WCSB.org.

1088
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,380
And on Thursday nights,

1089
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,580
11 o'clock Eastern Time,

1090
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,980
you can hear that radio show

1091
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,980
on the audioactive internet thing,

1092
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,120
and you can call in.

1093
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,060
You can be on the show,

1094
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,740
and then you'd be on this show.

1095
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,640
It's like you call into Chaz's show,

1096
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,000
and Chaz sends me,

1097
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,480
and we do a thing,

1098
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,340
a worshipful, you know,

1099
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,200
subgenius religious,

1100
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,180
and then Chaz sends me the tape,

1101
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,380
or he edits together

1102
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,500
one of these type things,

1103
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,940
and then suddenly you're a big,

1104
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,280
you know,

1105
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,480
big highly paid star,

1106
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,840
just like all the rest of us.

1107
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,960
So, so,

1108
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,000
such a great job,

1109
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:09,460
and,

1110
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,060
oh gosh.

1111
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:12,840
Uh,

1112
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,340
eh.

1113
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:47,740
binged.com

1114
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:47,740


1115
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:47,740


1116
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:47,740


1117
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:47,740


1118
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,460
The Golden Rose,

1119
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,040
the color of the dream I had

1120
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,540
Not too long ago

1121
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,000
The Golden Rose,

1122
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,000


1123
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,000


1124
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,480
Pistil blue and lilac too

1125
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,240
There were two grown

1126
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:12,580
There you were under the tree of sun

1127
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:16,120
Sweeping so peacefully

1128
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:22,320
In your hand a flower played

1129
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,380
Waiting there for me

1130
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,420
I have never

1131
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:40,480
Made eyes on you

1132
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,140
Not before

1133
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,820
This timeless day

1134
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:49,020
But you woke and you

1135
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:52,220
Smiled my name

1136
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,180
And you stole my heart away

1137
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,900
You stole my heart away

1138
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,240
And girl, yeah

1139
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,240
Alright

1140
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:05,900
Girl

1141
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,700
Girl, give me

1142
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,200
Give me that dream

1143
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,320
Hey!

1144
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,300
Golden rose

1145
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,960
The color of the dream I had

1146
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,660
Not too long ago

1147
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,340
Pistil blue and lilac too

1148
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,100
There were two grown

1149
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:52,300
There you were under the tree of sun

1150
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:52,300


1151
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:52,720
Sweeping so peacefully

1152
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:52,720


1153
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:52,720


1154
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,900
There you were under the tree of sun

1155
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,840
Sweeping so peacefully

1156
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,220
In your hand a flower played

1157
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:55,220


1158
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:55,220


1159
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:58,520
Pistil blue and lilac too

1160
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,880
There you were under the tree of sun

1161
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,900
Golden rose

1162
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,460
The color of the dream I had

1163
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,120
Not too long ago

1164
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,140
Pistil blue and lilac too

1165
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:08,420
There you were under the tree of sun

1166
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,860
Golden rose

1167
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,400
Golden rose

1168
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,860
Golden rose

1169
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:19,180
Golden rose

1170
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,660
It's only a dream

1171
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:35,880
I'd love to tell somebody about this dream

1172
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,740
The sky was filled with a thousand stars

1173
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:44,400
While the sun kissed the mountain's blue

1174
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:50,520
And eleven moons played across the rainbow

1175
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:53,440
Above me and you

1176
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:04,240
Golden Rose, Golden Rose

1177
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,740
I caught another bell in the water

1178
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:12,560
And you, that's the end of us

1179
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:29,720
Alright, now close your eyes

1180
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,980
Take a deep breath

1181
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:39,560
And let the water show you

1182
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:48,640
You are slowly sinking

1183
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:08,620
And the outside thoughts are coming to your mind

1184
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:10,600
Simply brush them aside

1185
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:24,780
And I want to begin by having you focus your attention upon the psychic center of your body

1186
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:40,080
None of what you see is real

1187
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,160
It's all a dream

1188
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,840
Out of band experience

1189
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:01,140
Bill T. Miller's album A Drum Army

1190
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,780
It's a token of your life

1191
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:09,460
And a feeling that's spreading over your entire body

1192
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,920
Put your physical body to sleep

1193
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,660
I'll open your subconscious mind

1194
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:40,340
And feel your core and neurons fire high voltage impulses into the forebrain

1195
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:45,120
These impulses become pictures

1196
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,820
The pictures become dreams

1197
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:54,900
And I want you to begin to use your imagination and feel your body relax

1198
01:00:54,900 --> 01:01:05,360
A situation where you think you need to turn 2

1199
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:05,360


1200
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:09,800
Discover and gather all the uns album

1201
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:14,540
Adopt anозд

1202
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,300
Create a perfection of yourself

1203
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:21,280
