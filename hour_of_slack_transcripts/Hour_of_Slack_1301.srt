1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
The western man is at once mournful and menacing.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,520
Why? Why this terror of the man?

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,380
It is not his appearance that stops our heart.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,620
The opposite.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,780
His invisibility.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,500
It is possible to live in the same habitat for years and never encounter him.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,000
He is elusive.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,060
We know he is near, for we see his tracks.

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,460
We know he kills, for we see the remains.

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,980
We know he lives because we hear the howl.

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,340
The last peel so frightfully piercing is to go through your heart.

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,000
About 20 yards to the right.

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,900
Ladies and gentlemen, due to circumstances beyond our control, we are unable to continue the broadcast.

14
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,040
This time we take you to Washington for a special broadcast on the national emergency.

15
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,800
My name is Ruler Bobby, and I'm about to fight some crime.

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,560
And what about Chuck and Bob?

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,640
Oh wait, they aren't on this show.

18
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,960
See, I told you we weren't on this show.

19
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,260
Oh, shut up, Bob.

20
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,520
Confused? You won't be after the next episode of...

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,100
The Self Genius Hour of...

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,720
Everything is under control.

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,500
Did so.

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,720
Everything is under control.

25
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,560
Did so.

26
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,720
Everything is under control.

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,560
Did so.

28
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,680
Everything is under control.

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,460
Moon say glamorous.

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,480
This is perfect.

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,500
Moon say glamorous.

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,720
This is perfect though.

33
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,020
You know I'm always thinking pink.

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,360
You know I'm always thinking pink.

35
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,440
Not from now on anyway.

36
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,740
Surrender to the power of the pink?

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,240
Phew.

38
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,120
I ran into Bob out on the driveway and he told me you weren't at church.

39
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,360
God, I hate Bob.

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,480
They went to church, Richard. The Self Genius.

41
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
Here's the $120.

42
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,140
And they found us a place up front.

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,860
All right, that's it. I'm kicking Bob's ass.

44
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,240
So in the end you picked somebody else and that somebody else was Bobby?

45
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,520
Look, Bob's ass.

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,720
You think you're dealing with...

47
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,560
Wala.

48
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,180
Wow.

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,680
Whole new man.

50
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,340
Look at that.

51
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,620
There you go.

52
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,340
A sensible, graduated Bob.

53
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,340
Perfect answer.

54
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:36,940
Let's go.

55
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,340
Oh!

56
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,220
Why are you hitting me?

57
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,540
Because you don't listen to me.

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,840
I told you last night Bob was coming for dinner.

59
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,780
Oh, right.

60
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,020
Bob.

61
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,240
I don't have time for this.

62
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,540
Bob is going to be here any second.

63
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,160
Do I have to eat with you guys?

64
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,720
Bob and I have nothing in common.

65
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,060
You are having dinner with Bob and that is all there is to it.

66
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,780
Come on in, Dad.

67
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm going to get you some food.

68
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:57,960


69
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:57,960


70
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:57,960


71
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:57,960


72
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,620
Bob.

73
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,700
Huh?

74
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,680
Uncle Bob.

75
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,780
Come on, come on, go to the bathroom.

76
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,240
No fight.

77
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,440
No drama.

78
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,520
No what about Bob moments.

79
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,020
You know we're going to hurt you.

80
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:14,800
Shh.

81
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:15,900
Listen.

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,640
That's very gentle.

83
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,560
It's a little harder in grade two, but not hard enough yet, for example for penetration.

84
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,940
And three, it is hard enough for penetration, but not really at all.

85
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:27,940


86
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,140
It's completely stiff as you think you want it to be.

87
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,200
And four, it's completely stiff, you can feel it.

88
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,220
Then the erection is gone.

89
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,140
This is supposed to be? This is normal.

90
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,200
This is not normal. Sorry, but...

91
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes, yes, yes, my friends.

92
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,240
Thanks to the LARGE for that intro title collage

93
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,400
and Reverend Walter Kosmak for the Western Man National Emergency Business

94
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,920
and...

95
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,560
for PR and...

96
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,520
for this music in the background.

97
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,640
And with this show, we'll finish up the Starwood Devival recordings

98
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,540
and we have some other surprises.

99
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,140
But first, I should mention that this episode,

100
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,860
hour of slack number 1301,

101
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,820
is very close to our sacred number of 13013.

102
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,580
So, on the internet only,

103
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,720
next week,

104
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,380
there will be a special show,

105
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,240
number 1301.3,

106
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,700
.3 of an hour, or 18 minutes long.

107
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,020
That was Modemax's idea.

108
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,040
And we will explain, for those who still don't get it,

109
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,660
why 13013 is special.

110
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,580
It'll also be completely X-rated.

111
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,480
But first, the Evolution Control Committee,

112
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,300
who will, by the way, be performing at X-Day,

113
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,420
and all the new 14X-Day information is up at subgenius.com.

114
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,780
ECC did a mashup of a Jonathan Coulton song

115
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,320
that I played last week.

116
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,300
And I promised to play the mashup this week.

117
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,960
And so, Evolution Control Committee,

118
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,880
for the next three tracks.

119
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,340
Praise Bob.

120
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,880
. . .

121
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:47,960
. . .

122
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,980
. . . .

123
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,580
. . . .

124
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,140
. . . .

125
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,220
. . . .

126
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,300
. . . .

127
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,300


128
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,360
. . . .

129
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,360


130
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,360


131
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:25,380
. . . .

132
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,380
. . .

133
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,200
. . .

134
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,280
. . .

135
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:52,460
. . .

136
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,360
. . .

137
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,360


138
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,360


139
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,760
to make you fat. Anyway, you're busy with the telephone. No time for chat. Code Monkey,

140
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:07,280
have a long walk back to Cusico. You sit down, pretend to work. Code Monkey, not thinking.

141
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:13,520
So straight. Code Monkey, not feeling. So great. Code Monkey, like mosquitoes. Code

142
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,420
Monkey, like tab in Mountain Dew. Code Monkey, very simple man. Big, warm, fuzzy, secret

143
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:37,460
heart. Code Monkey, like you. Code Monkey, like you. A lot. Code Monkey, have every

144
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:44,340
reason to get out this place. Code Monkey, just keep on working. See your soft, pretty

145
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,400
face. But shroud away, get beat up, copy cake. Take bath, take nap. Code Monkey, like you.

146
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:55,100
Take a nap. This job fulfilling, you create a way for such a load of crap. Code Monkey,

147
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,640
think someday he'd have everything, even pretty girl like you. Code Monkey, just waiting

148
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:07,620
for now. Code Monkey, say someday, somehow. Code Monkey, like burritos. Code Monkey, like

149
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:14,200
tab in Mountain Dew. Code Monkey, very simple man. Big, warm, fuzzy, secret heart. Code

150
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,180
Monkey, like you.

151
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,740
Code Monkey, like you.

152
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,060
Code Monkey, like you.

153
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:34,020
Warning. You're listening to the Evolution Control Committee's album, All Rights Reserved.

154
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:40,860
And that means you are in violation of our listener license agreement. We printed it

155
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,920
in the album liner notes and we stated it in the first track of the album. You are expressly

156
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,500
forbidden from listening to any part of this album.

157
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,040
Look, you may think that you're being cool, or maybe doing something radical by defying

158
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:01,060
the terms of our agreement. Don't be a fool. Legal agreements such as ours exist solely

159
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,200
to tilt the scales of justice wildly in favor of those who write them. By the time you're

160
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,740
faced with one, you've already lost. Our listener license agreement is a masterpiece of contractual

161
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:18,100
skill written by top shelf lawyers who insist that our album include it. Your petty show

162
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:25,520
of defiance is laughable and hopeless. A good legal agreement is like a virus. If you ignore

163
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,520
it, it just gets deadlier. Take my advice. Press stop now.

164
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,960
Well, All Rights Reserved will continue after this brief commercial announcement.

165
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:48,020
With me and my dad, it's like our relationship is a record album.

166
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,980
typical金ence

167
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,100
and and and an untha fu

168
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,040
de

169
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,680
re

170
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,540
you re

171
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:58,900
You know what I'm saying?

172
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,440
There are these...

173
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,200
skips.

174
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,780
Bad skips.

175
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,600
Painful gouges.

176
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,200
But in your head you compensate for it, you know.

177
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,260
You keep the beat because you keep the beat because you keep the beat because

178
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,180
you keep the beat because you keep the beat because you keep the beat because you know the song.

179
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:44,720
Most people buy laser discs now. You know, CDs. They don't wear out.

180
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,220
You can't damage the surface of CDs.

181
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,300
Digital, digital. Not analog.

182
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,040
Pon, pon, pon, pon, pon, pon, pon, pon.

183
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,960
Yes dear friends, thanks to Evolution Control Committee for that. They are at

184
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,920
evolution-control.com

185
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,460
and

186
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:24,180
I think that's about the only way you can get their material because as they said in their listener agreement, they're completely illegal.

187
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,140
Well, not really, but

188
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,920
you oughta check it out.

189
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,960
evolution.control.com

190
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,340
The large mixed up this stuff in the background, Oxygen Runner.

191
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,220
14x Day is coming up in July followed by Starwood. I mean

192
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,300
even if the world ends we'll have Starwood on my escape vessel.

193
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,680
And you can learn more of that soon, but we're about to play you

194
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,460
the last of the last

195
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,820
years Starwood. Thank you.

196
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,900
I guess we could do

197
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,000
questions, a question and answer

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,040
thing. I really do want to

199
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,980
get off the stage

200
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,640
so that I can get high.

201
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,240
Is Bob a monkey?

202
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,260
I sacrifice, friends. I sacrifice for you.

203
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,040
Is Bob a monkey?

204
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,500
Is Bob what?

205
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Is Bob a monkey?

206
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,740
Is Bob a monkey?

207
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,120
No, he is technically

208
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,060
an ape.

209
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,420
A great ape.

210
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,740
Well, he is an ape.

211
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,660
Yes, a type

212
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,300
of chimpanzee.

213
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,340
We all are.

214
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,920
Some of us...

215
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,820
Now, I think what your question

216
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,480
really is, is Bob

217
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,640
a yeti?

218
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,680
And yes, Bob

219
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,120
is more of a full-blood...

220
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,600
Any subgenius, what makes you a

221
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,660
subgenius is you're tainted with

222
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,720
the blood of the yeti, the Sasquatch.

223
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,340
You know, our ancestors.

224
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:56,660
Our ancestors.

225
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,720
The ancestors of the humans,

226
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,520
yeah, those are monkeys.

227
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,600
That's a

228
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,800
creative design or something,

229
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,280
I guess.

230
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,760
Now, there may be a live mic

231
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,520
going around, but I can't see

232
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,120
anything.

233
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,360
Ivan, you were suggesting

234
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,460
that people should pee, but isn't it true that

235
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,260
people pee, they eventually,

236
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,200
after years of doing it, they die?

237
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,340
Yes, people...

238
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,960
Peeing does lead to death.

239
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,820
The little girl over there said,

240
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,680
you know, it's like, didn't eventually,

241
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,000
if you pee and pee and pee, eventually you die?

242
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,020
Well, yeah, that's true.

243
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,000
If you can find an alternative,

244
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,640
I sure want to hear about it.

245
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,800
And then,

246
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,600
is there life after death?

247
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,840
You know, that's the ultimate question

248
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,760
now, isn't it? If you really

249
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,040
believe for sure,

250
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,200
then,

251
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,780
as soon as the bill's piled up,

252
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,840
you jump off a bridge.

253
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,780
Listen, and let me ask you this,

254
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,500
though, doesn't it not, true that

255
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,860
not peeing leads to death even quicker?

256
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,380
I...

257
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,180
It feels like that.

258
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,580
That's all I can tell you.

259
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,100
I've never been dead,

260
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,540
and I've never heard from anyone who

261
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,540
has been dead. I've heard from lots of people who

262
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,840
say they've heard from people who've been dead.

263
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,440
Let me put it this way.

264
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,740
If, uh, if when I

265
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,240
die, I go

266
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,320
through a tunnel of light and

267
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,520
meet all my loved ones, or

268
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,780
even go through the alternative universe

269
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,860
of lost on the last season,

270
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,980
I won't

271
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,560
be surprised.

272
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,000
But if I don't

273
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,880
experience that, you likewise won't

274
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,880
hear me complaining either, now will you?

275
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,980
That's not something I'm

276
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,280
really all that worried about. People ask,

277
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,780
Reverend Stanton, now come on, you must believe in

278
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,940
something. What do you really believe

279
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,880
in? I'll tell you.

280
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,380
I'll be real straight with you.

281
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,940
I believe that I'd like to crawl

282
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,820
across an ocean of tithing.

283
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,100
I believe that I'd like to have

284
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,800
some pees on my belly.

285
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,280
I believe I would like that.

286
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,980
Just one way to look at it.

287
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,920
Uh, any other questions?

288
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,760
Is there peeing after death?

289
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,940
Why are you asking me all this stuff?

290
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,280
Go to some, uh, psychic

291
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,720
medium and ask them if there's peeing

292
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,700
after death. I'm sure there's an

293
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,960
ocean of, uh, etheric

294
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,720
pee. Maybe that's

295
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,360
what the, uh, the ether is.

296
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,280
You know, the

297
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,760
unknown.

298
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,340
The unmeasurable part of the,

299
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,280
of science.

300
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,720
When is the

301
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,460
landing?

302
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,200
When is the landing?

303
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,180
Ha ha ha ha.

304
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,540
It was, uh, you know,

305
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,300
Monday morning, this last

306
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,120
Monday, July 5th, just

307
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,700
like every July 5th

308
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,340
at 7 a.m. for

309
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,000
the last 15 years.

310
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,520
I was standing out there in the field

311
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,080
waiting for the saucers,

312
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,340
doing the countdown,

313
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,320
and of course, nothing happened.

314
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,500
But on the other hand, how do we know

315
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,960
we're not on the saucers?

316
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,240
It's just that we don't have enough imagination.

317
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,620
And we, the, the, the, the escape

318
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,640
vessel that we envisioned

319
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,760
just happens to, all we could

320
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,420
envision was our crappy apartment that we live in.

321
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,040
You know, so, so we're on our way to Planet X,

322
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,680
we just haven't believed it yet.

323
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,820
That's one theory.

324
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,640
The landing. There's not going to be a landing.

325
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,840
That it's not there.

326
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,080
The UFOs that Bob predicts are not these pussyfoot little greys

327
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,780
with, with saucers that crash in New Mexico.

328
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,200
My God.

329
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,060
I mean, by hell.

330
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,440
The, the types of, uh, aliens that Bob's talking about

331
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,500
are the things that have been mistaken for gods

332
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,940
or the god or goddess for centuries, thousands of years.

333
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,620
Where do you think all that stuff came from?

334
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,620
Jehovah One is an alien from a corporate sin galaxy.

335
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,260
It's in pamphlet number one.

336
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,240
Haven't you been reading your prescriptions?

337
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,760
You people!

338
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:02,820
My God.

339
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,240
My Bob.

340
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:05,980
Heh heh.

341
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,940
Any more questions?

342
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,060
Why doesn't Bob use his pipe to stop the oil spill?

343
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,860
Somebody's going to have to translate that one.

344
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,320
Why doesn't Bob use his pipe to stop the oil spill?

345
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,320
Why doesn't Bob use his pipe to stop the oil spill?

346
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:21,600
Why doesn't Bob use his pipe to stop the oil spill?

347
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:21,600


348
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,540
can God make a rock so big he can't lift it?

349
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,440
if Bob could in fact use that mighty pipe

350
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,520
it's got all kinds of powers

351
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,080
it's like James Bond's car

352
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,820
you know it's like a boomerang pipe

353
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,960
rocket pipe

354
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,260
oil

355
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,240
you can actually

356
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,400
I wonder if that's how that oil spill really got started

357
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,400
could Bob

358
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,060
obviously

359
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,520
Bob could stop the oil spill

360
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,220
he must not want to

361
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,020
I've read in the Yahoo comments

362
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,400
that our president

363
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,420
the Kenyan traitor

364
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,260
communist

365
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,080
Nazi socialist

366
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,040
Satanist

367
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,720
did I leave anything out?

368
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,380
that he ordered that thing to happen

369
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,140
so that

370
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,380
he could

371
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:20,380


372
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,540
offshore drilling would look bad

373
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,440
and the reason he wants that to look bad

374
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,840
is so the US will go broke

375
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,040
because he hates our freedoms

376
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,080
and also

377
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,900
I think some people are kind of sore

378
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,420
that a black guy is president

379
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,060
if you ask me

380
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,460
the guy's a little bit too conservative

381
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,260
what else?

382
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,320
anything?

383
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,040
because I'm not ready to go

384
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,180
does Obama smoke a pipe?

385
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,280
what?

386
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,400
you couldn't have asked what I thought you just asked

387
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,740
I think I did

388
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,880
what was that?

389
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,120
does Obama smoke a pipe?

390
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,900
does Obama smoke a pipe?

391
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,960
would

392
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,060
be

393
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,700
Obama smoke a pipe?

394
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,660
would

395
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,100
Barry

396
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,840
be

397
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,140
I don't know

398
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,900
I'm not Dr. Howell

399
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,400
I can't answer every question

400
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,900
is that about it?

401
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,220
oh praise Bob

402
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,920
that's all we need to know

403
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,580
actually that's not a piece of knowledge

404
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,200
it's just something to shout

405
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,140
praise Bob

406
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,820
friends I'm going to get off of the

407
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


408
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


409
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


410
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


411
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


412
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


413
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


414
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


415
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


416
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


417
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


418
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


419
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


420
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


421
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


422
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


423
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


424
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820


425
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,380
this stage so that I can get off

426
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,580
earth we must get off

427
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,260
and in closing

428
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,120

429
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:58,960

430
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,440

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,260

432
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,660

447
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,580

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,040

449
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,440

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,900
Rosenthal

451
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,880
actually uh

452
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,980
I was married to him at this last winter star

453
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,060
in a subgenius uh

454
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,300
temporary marriage ceremony

455
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,000
my husband and I married Joe

456
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,820
he's never actually consummated

457
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,780
I was a little salty about that

458
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,760
but uh

459
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,600
he uh

460
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,080
his partner Walter probably is not so unhappy about that

461
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,400
um

462
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,180
but uh Walter liked my lips

463
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,720
he said they reminded him of uh

464
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,180
Dorothy's left slipper so

465
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,020

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,600
oh yeah okay

468
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,820
I was all messed up

469
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,760
he had these light thingies in my eyes

470
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,560
I don't know dude

471
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,760
the light was in her eyes

472
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,480
music plays

473
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,580
music plays

474
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,620
musicungen

475
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,560
music plays

476
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,520
Somewhere over the rainbow

477
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,980
Way up high

478
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,560
There's a liar that I've heard said

479
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:15,560


480
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,520
Once in a lullaby

481
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,120
Somewhere over the rainbow

482
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,040
Skies are blue

483
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:41,320
And those dreams that you dare to dream

484
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,500
Really do come true

485
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,620
Someday I'll wish upon a star

486
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,640
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me

487
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,140
Where troubles melt like lemon drops

488
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,040
Away upon those chimney tops

489
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:09,100
That's where you'll find me

490
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,480
Somewhere over the rainbow

491
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,380
Bluebirds fly

492
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,560
Birds fly over the rainbow

493
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,240
Wild, wild

494
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,360
Tough of a time

495
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:57,540
So make it right

496
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,360
To your home

497
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:06,840
Up on those struggling skies

498
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:06,840


499
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,400
To your home

500
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,180
Flash by on a pink sky

501
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,180


502
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,400
One that I'm gonna live by and think I must実現

503
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:22,980
Someday I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me

504
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:31,480
Where troubles melt like lemon drops away upon those chimney tops

505
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,360
That's where you'll find me

506
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,240
Somewhere over the rainbow

507
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,660
Bluebirds fly

508
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,580
If birds fly over the rainbow

509
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,280
Why, oh no, why can't I?

510
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,680
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

511
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:11,740
Why, oh, why can't I?

512
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,080
Why, oh, why can't I?

513
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,120
Why, oh, why can't I?

514
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,320
Why, oh, why can't I?

515
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,200
Well, that was Miguel Sague on guitar and whistling.

516
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,560
And Fat Mandi singing with Princess Wee.

517
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,540
Into Venus conditions.

518
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,860
Into Venus conditions.

519
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,240
Into Venus conditions.

520
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,560
Into Venus conditions.

521
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,000
But I hit my head more when I walk up right now.

522
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,680
And the knowledge.

523
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,000
How to gulp oxygen.

524
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,740
directly from the air.

525
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,780
Pro tip, use lungs.

526
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,760
How to use your skin as an accessory breathing organ.

527
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,420
Oh, amphibians, is there anything you can't do?

528
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,260
How your size can make you thermally independent.

529
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,060
Reducing your side toes,

530
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,000
how much it will really add to your running speed.

531
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,740
You know, drag is important at 25 miles an hour.

532
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,520
Eliminate wasted appendages.

533
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,980
You don't need them.

534
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,720
This tonic can bring relief immediately.

535
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,180
Well, I hope it does.

536
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,020
What a relief.

537
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,960
I feel better already.

538
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,080
Now I've got 159,090 reasons left.

539
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,180
I'm not going to go through them all right now.

540
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,560
Oh, no.

541
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,120
What's your oxygen doing in the air?

542
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,700
What are you doing putting oxygen in the air?

543
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,980
The callers are going around the other side of the ether zone now.

544
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,400
Yeah, I guess so.

545
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,920
Around the dark side of the ether zone.

546
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:13,920
Inventorizing.

547
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,140
Oh, boy.

548
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,460
So what?

549
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,960
So, we didn't get very many callers tonight on the show.

550
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,940
So, buttons.

551
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,340
You're the one out there, like, struggling to find the microphone to his phone

552
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,120
or her phone or his phone.

553
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,880
What is it?

554
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,340
Nobody wants to talk to me.

555
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,720
I thought you were going to say,

556
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,740
I think I know what to do about that caller problem right now

557
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,660
if I just push these buttons.

558
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,060
Legend is?

559
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,060
I thought so.

560
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,060
Puzzling evidence.

561
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,920
Funny you should call just now, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

562
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,220
You mean funny like a tortoise animal or a cyclical event?

563
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:05,680
Well, I had a puzzling evidence show clip playing in the background.

564
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,900
I think it was one the large sent me.

565
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,620
That means he must be being heard on it somewhere.

566
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,340
Now, don't bludgeon that button.

567
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,480
Just push the button.

568
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,400
Philo weeks ago was griping about, nobody's calling in.

569
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,540
And although I was going to let that segment play for another minute and a half,

570
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,040
I thought, nah, let's just pause that one.

571
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,160
We need our Dave.

572
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,120
Yeah, well, we'll...

573
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,300
Was I early on the button?

574
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,400
Because sometimes my button is a little shaky and fuzzy.

575
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,580
No, you're...

576
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,760
I know you like to play with your button, Dave.

577
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,020
All right.

578
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,240
All right.

579
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,520
All right.

580
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:40,600
All right.

581
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:40,600


582
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:40,600


583
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,980
I do a lot more than play with it.

584
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,300
Actually, your button action was perfection, Dave.

585
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,980
I saw you wearing a button that said, kiss my butt.

586
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,200
Yep.

587
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,320
That's what I offer to this world and this land, especially in the grave times we're in.

588
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,880
Oh, these are grave times.

589
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,760
You need a lot of graves for the folks these days.

590
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,120
Yep.

591
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,680
A lot of exhumations going on.

592
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,440
I'm sure I'll save that again.

593
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,100
You know, we...

594
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:15,980
We considered coming in and doing the live show last week, but the tsunami was going

595
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,380
on.

596
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:22,840
And on top of that, a couple of our friends died, and it just...

597
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,180
It seemed like too grave of a week to be doing a satirical show.

598
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:36,060
Although now, we've got a third war world going on, so I figure that's humorous material.

599
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,400
Yeah, I would prefer if we all had a third nostril, but no.

600
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,760
No, we're going to have a third war, so let's have one and see if we can mount those bodies

601
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,480
up a little higher.

602
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,340
I guess the count is not high enough.

603
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,200
Nope, got to pile them up.

604
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,040
Mm-hmm.

605
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,280
Like cordwood.

606
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:53,920
Mm-hmm.

607
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,380
I've been ready for this particular war for...

608
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,160
Oh, I'm on to 30 years now, I'd say.

609
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,200
Here you have Dr. McCobber.

610
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,380
Well, back in the 1980s, I was getting...

611
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,480
I was getting a present by my old friend, Palmer Freedies.

612
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:20,640
He handed me a football made in the shape of the face of Muammar Gaddafi.

613
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,540
Thanks, Palmer.

614
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,280
And that's how long that guy's been infamous.

615
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,980
You mean he's infamous for having given you face for so long?

616
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,500
Well, you know, we just...

617
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:39,300
For a long time, we let that Gaddafi head football sit in the closet.

618
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,620
The closet next to the...

619
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,540
What other head footballs?

620
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,520
We had the golfer head golf ball, and we had the...

621
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,620
Dried brino foreskin.

622
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:58,780
Yeah, we had a basketball shaped like Kennedy, and we had a Lee Harvey Oswald foosball set

623
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,360
or something like that.

624
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,720
They were just mulchering away.

625
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,200
So we...

626
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,120
Anyway, last year...

627
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,880
Folks, those...

628
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,800
And one people who were lucky enough to attend what turned out to be the 13th...

629
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,040
Actually, it was the 15th X Day drill.

630
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,520
We call it 13 X Day.

631
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:23,960
The whole X Day, we had that Gaddafi head football sitting on top of our main pulpit.

632
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,380
Every now and then, it got launched, I believe.

633
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,320
Absolutely.

634
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,620
Oh, in fact, we had...

635
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:35,520
Somebody gave us an Arnold Palmer golf club that was made in such a way...

636
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,220
It looked like a golf club, but instead of like a nine iron head...

637
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:45,980
It had another little miniature model Arnold Palmer with a tiny golf club.

638
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:51,160
So, in other words, the head of the golf club was a Palmer head.

639
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,220
Yeah, it was an entire Palmer, and we could therefore...

640
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:01,840
This is kind of goes back to really old subgenius rituals that we had to stop doing in 1998.

641
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,580
The conspiracies, 1998.

642
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,360
What people thought of.

643
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,700
But we were actually able to...

644
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,760
By holding this special golf club and pulling the trigger,

645
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,260
you could make the tiny little Arnold Palmer figure at the end of your golf club

646
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,820
whack the Gaddafi head football.

647
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,400
Wow.

648
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,220
I remember every time you...

649
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,880
And yet, believe it or not, this is not on YouTube.

650
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,380
No.

651
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,740
No, we're on YouTube.

652
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,880
The weird thing was, every time the thing would strike Gaddafi's head,

653
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,280
he would spout some of the things from the...

654
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,640
The little green book, which we know is not really that little.

655
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,360
It's about the size of a football locker.

656
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,100
No, I have a copy right here in front of me, Dave.

657
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,400
I know you carry one around at all times right next to your...

658
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,980
You know, the stuff that Bob gave you, the cocktail napkins.

659
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:59,100
It's actually true that Moe and Mark Gaddafi's little green book has been in my bedroom,

660
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,520
right next to my bed, for a couple of years now.

661
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,500
Reverend Carter LeBlanc gave it to me.

662
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,200
Thanks, Carter.

663
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,580
He said...

664
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,260
He said, Stang, you really ought to have a copy of this.

665
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,520
You'll find that he's...

666
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,280
Gaddafi's really a rogue subgenius.

667
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,460
If you'll read this about half the time, it's like a subgenius book.

668
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,440
Half the time, you're going, you know, it sounds kind of crazy,

669
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,300
but by golly, this is the way things are.

670
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:24,700
He's right.

671
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:28,700
And then the other half of the time, it's stuff like this.

672
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,160
Okay?

673
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,400
I'm going to...

674
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,820
Here's some...

675
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,960
This was a random selection, page 70 from Gaddafi's green book.

676
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,320
Women are different from men in form because they are females.

677
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,140
Just as all females in the kingdoms of plants and animals differ from the males of their species.

678
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,960
This is an indisputable fact of nature.

679
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,620
The male in the plant and animal kingdoms is both naturally strong and striving,

680
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:02,640
while the female in both kingdoms is naturally born beautiful and gentle.

681
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,900
And you know, that right there tells me that this guy must never have gone outdoors,

682
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,700
or read an elementary school level book about animals.

683
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,540
Well, it sounds like Bob to me.

684
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,280
It sounds like one of the spoutings of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

685
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,440
Well, but it's...

686
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,540
No, it's fact...

687
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,520
The female is different from the male,

688
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,620
and the connections between the extreme parts are shortened or lengthened

689
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,600
depending on the root of the atmosphere and the conditions...

690
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,000
The thing is, this is scientifically inaccurate.

691
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,120
It's laughable.

692
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,200
It's scientifically completely true.

693
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,620
In many species of animals,

694
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:42,020
the female is in fact the strong, striving one,

695
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,400
and the male is this gentle, weak thing...

696
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,920
And brightly colored and beautiful.

697
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,340
Oh, yeah.

698
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,480
Normally, it's the males that have the more plumage or whatnot...

699
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:51,980
That's a school.

700
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,580
...and spend all day showing off,

701
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,460
while the females are the ones that are hunting down the zebras.

702
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,520
But we see this in everyday life.

703
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,440
We see zebras wearing funny hats.

704
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,240
We see people with all kinds of different ornaments on their heads

705
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,400
and haircuts that are different.

706
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,060
And it still doesn't matter because the power struggle,

707
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,600
always rests in the middle of the diagram.

708
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,740
In the middle of the curve,

709
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,600
lies those beings who are neither male nor female,

710
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,200
nor hermaphroditic in any shape or form of the word,

711
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,560
but simply resemble some kind of aspect,

712
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,840
one individual aspect of the whole spectrum.

713
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,320
So therefore, I would say they should all...

714
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,480
All should be moved to another location.

715
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,560
Well, this Gaddafi book,

716
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,680
is full of things that I always thought kind of went without saying.

717
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,780
Oh, yeah?

718
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,720
When a creature is born to life,

719
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,980
it is a living being,

720
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,080
and shall inevitably be so until it dies.

721
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,980
Puff, thanks for filling us in on that, Mo Amar.

722
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,500
Once again, though, like Einstein was,

723
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,360
he was right, and he is right.

724
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,800
Once a being is born and is alive,

725
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,600
it remains at rest, or remains in...

726
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,940
Alive until it dies.

727
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,900
Until it dies.

728
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,900
Until it...

729
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,400
Damn it!

730
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,680
So insightful!

731
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,700
If I didn't have Gaddafi's little green book,

732
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,520
I'd just think everything lived forever,

733
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,820
or had never lived at all.

734
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,100
Call it Thermodynamics for the Third Grade Mind.

735
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,300
If you like.

736
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,120
But I prefer to call it

737
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,600
The Erudite Bangings of a Hursute Wisdom-Driven Man and Woman,

738
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,380
embodied in one fine, funny, um,

739
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,420
coffee or whatever, or kaboong or whatever.

740
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:32,820
Kamumu.

741
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,880
Kamumu.

742
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,660
Kamumu.

743
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,900
And that lovely kamumu,

744
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,520
and a fine, shining, feathered headdress

745
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,200
he sometimes wears when he's appearing

746
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,800
in North Dakota or South Dakota.

747
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,240
Sometimes, I guess, he wears a big old farmer's hat

748
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,080
when he's in Indiana.

749
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,860
But we just call him a friend to the...

750
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,080
I don't know.

751
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,080
You know what, Dave?

752
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,440
I know you don't know.

753
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,900
I know you know.

754
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,860
Isn't it hard to remember how your sentence started

755
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,040
by the time you start getting near the end?

756
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,960
My sentence started and ended,

757
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,160
and I'm out, I'm free,

758
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,340
and I go to the meetings,

759
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,080
and I do everything I'm supposed to do.

760
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,020
I think that's great.

761
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm so glad.

762
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,780
So I wouldn't bring up any time spent.

763
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,380
I hope they don't put you back in there again.

764
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,000
Well, I hope so.

765
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,640
Now, um,

766
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,160
I looked at the very last page of Gaddafi's green book.

767
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,200
It's not called The Little Green Book.

768
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,860
It's called The Green Book.

769
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,820
And, um,

770
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,840
at the end, the very last thing he says

771
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,380
is that boxing and wrestling

772
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,140
should be purged from mankind

773
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,440
because there shall inevitably come to an end

774
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,060
when man progresses

775
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,220
and becomes more civilized.

776
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,640
Gun matches and before that,

777
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,940
human offerings were familiar practices.

778
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,240
But these cruel practices ended hundreds of years ago,

779
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,460
and later man came to look upon these with self-derision

780
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,260
because human beings like himself

781
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,020
had once been a human being.

782
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,220
And he indulged in such practices.

783
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,040
It will be the same with the various kinds of boxing and wrestling

784
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,920
as people become more civilized

785
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,900
and the progressive individuals

786
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,140
are the only ones able to avoid such cruel practices.

787
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,280
That's the end of the green book

788
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,240
written by a man who has just finished

789
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,860
having bombs dropped on

790
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,780
untold thousands of his own countrymen.

791
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,420
Well, I would like to make...

792
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,000
Because he didn't like it.

793
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,260
He didn't like the way they voted or something.

794
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,020
I would like to make one dirty comment

795
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,540
concerning the whole dirty innocence.

796
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,600
All we have to do is remember

797
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,340
probably a lot of them stingers he got from the U.S.

798
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:45,880
and now...

799
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,200
Well, duh.

800
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,920
That's where they all get it.

801
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,040
...like rainfires.

802
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:49,780
Uh-huh.

803
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,320
And them stingers all cost about a million bucks a piece

804
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,960
depending on who's firing them at who.

805
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,040
They're firing at each other

806
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,840
and all we're doing is

807
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,280
spending a lot more money

808
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,420
of my hard-earned...

809
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,380
I read that today,

810
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,220
now this is from the internet,

811
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,980
so it's probably not true,

812
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,000
but I read that each cruise missile

813
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,620
costs $600,000

814
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,720
and this morning

815
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,640
we sent 110 of those

816
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,660
raining down upon various parts

817
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,220
of Qaddafi's Air Force

818
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,920
and anti-aircraft setups.

819
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,220
Well...

820
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,000
And not just...

821
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,660
I mean, you know,

822
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,720
the French and the British

823
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,160
and everybody else is in on it

824
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,520
and even the other...

825
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,020
A bunch of the other Arab nations said,

826
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,620
yeah, go ahead.

827
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,380
And then they went,

828
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,260
how dare you?

829
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,940
But that's all expected.

830
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,400
I think it's horrible when they play copycat with...

831
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,380
It's just like in shoe choices.

832
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,040
You know, like some person will decide

833
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,040
that he wants like shoes

834
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,300
that come all the way out

835
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,180
where they have a real sharp pointed toe

836
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,580
in the end that kind of curl up

837
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,680
and they kind of reflect the interior atmosphere

838
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,960
of his foot itself within the sock

839
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,560
in that his one foot,

840
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,700
his one big toe

841
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,580
is really badly, badly deformed.

842
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,020
Now, you can take that as a metaphor

843
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,980
for Qaddafi's misarrangements

844
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,920
and his nucleus power plant,

845
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,820
which he never built,

846
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,520
but his waterworks,

847
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,500
which the water rights might go to,

848
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,580
prove perhaps.

849
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,260
We don't know how the global economy

850
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,660
is going right now,

851
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,120
but we know it's going

852
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,140
because we can smell it in the air.

853
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,500
The smell of cheese.

854
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,620
Burning electrical equipment.

855
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,080
Burning electrical equipment.

856
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,720
Burning people's feet, screaming.

857
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,820
Darn that Qaddafi.

858
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,460
Darn that Qaddafi.

859
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,740
Darn that man.

860
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,000
I don't remember ever meeting him personally,

861
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,700
but I did have a strange dream.

862
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,040
He appeared at the foot of my bed

863
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,820
and he held his hands up

864
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,220
in the usual, you know,

865
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,560
bellicifant mannerisms

866
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,460
and he was wearing a headdress

867
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,180
and everything like that

868
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,460
and he said,

869
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,520
Dave, you will be a prophet

870
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,540
not only to the Mideast,

871
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,360
but to the Midwest.

872
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,980
Someday you will be as green as I am

873
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,080
and probably putrefacting purple,

874
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,320
but don't let that bother you.

875
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,720
Just keep on babbling out

876
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,080
the same old dumb stuff.

877
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,140
Well, when you make that profit

878
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,100
and rank,

879
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,880
well, you're already,

880
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,320
when you rank,

881
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,980
when you make the profit,

882
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,200
share some, would you?

883
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,200
With old Bob's preach,

884
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,300
Bob's old preach.

885
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,420
Well, you well know how much money

886
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,980
you could make in a single book signing,

887
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,940
perhaps millions and millions of dollars.

888
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,460
Thousands at least.

889
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,260
I'm a bad thing.

890
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,920
You make a couple hundred thousand dollars,

891
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,640
you go have a snack at Rubio's,

892
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,980
you know, you drink some $7 espresso

893
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,740
and have a bottle of,

894
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,120
oh, Glen, whatever it is,

895
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:30,820
that real expensive.

896
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,640
Glen Fittich.

897
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,360
Fittich.

898
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:32,840
Fittich.

899
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,220
Yes, I have, yeah, yes.

900
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:40,780
I was looking at a $145 bottle of that stuff

901
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,820
a couple of months ago

902
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,800
at a fancy store in Los Angeles

903
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,360
and I took a photograph of the price tag

904
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,820
and in fact, I think you can see

905
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,140
the price tag photograph on my YouTube channel.

906
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,280
If not tonight, then in a couple of nights.

907
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,620
I've been putting things on YouTube

908
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,240
of our,

909
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,460
our working vacation

910
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,740
and so that people can see

911
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,660
everything we did and why.

912
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,700
Including the weird sexual stunts.

913
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,680
Well, YouTube,

914
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,800
you have to be careful about that with YouTube.

915
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,280
We had to put those on Vimeo.

916
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,700
The, um...

917
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,000
But you got various complaints

918
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,540
from the Hopi elders saying,

919
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,680
you know, you and we were doing weird things

920
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,940
out in chickens were crowing

921
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,920
in the middle of the morning

922
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,940
and the old lady was out walking her,

923
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,600
huh?

924
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,020
You're thinking of the Navajo.

925
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
We were very polite in the Hopi.

926
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,000
Absolutely.

927
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,040
So you kind of went,

928
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:34,680
you went,

929
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,260
we gone mad

930
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,340
at the Navajo Four Corners Mall.

931
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,460
Shopping mall.

932
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,880
Casino, actually, is what it is.

933
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,480
But I don't,

934
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,360
I don't want to go there.

935
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,600
I want to go to X Day.

936
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,200
14 X Day.

937
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,840
That's coming up.

938
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,000
The reason I mention it

939
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,600
is because I spent the last three days

940
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,380
really working hard at my job for Bob.

941
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,640
Putting together a nice preview

942
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,120
and,

943
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,580
and I'm going to go to the announcement section.

944
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,880
I had to do it all fresh and new

945
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,680
because X Day's moved, you know.

946
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,880
We're no longer at that place.

947
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,000
We're at Wisteria in Southern Ohio.

948
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,940
Yes, X Day has returned to Ohio.

949
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,960
It's rather florid scent for a,

950
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,840
for the name of a manly place of X Day.

951
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,320
Well, not, I'm not saying...

952
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,820
Well, but, but here's the thing.

953
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,180
You can, people can now,

954
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,540
if they go to subgenius.com,

955
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,720
click on the events section,

956
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,160
it shouldn't be too difficult.

957
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,180
First thing up will be a big thing about X Day,

958
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,380
followed by a thing about Starwood.

959
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,680
Now, there are photographs.

960
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,600
The reason I bring all this up is,

961
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,140
is I, we're, people are going,

962
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,560
how can each place be as cool as the old place

963
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,340
we used to have it?

964
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,800
Well, you can look at our photographs

965
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,640
from Starwood last year now,

966
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,980
and you can see,

967
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,760
and you can also see,

968
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,680
there's a photograph of Keith

969
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,360
standing in the other room there.

970
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,480
Guy does the show right after Dr. Sinister.

971
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,580
He's also standing there.

972
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,360
There's a photograph of that very self-same Keith

973
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,600
on the subgenius website,

974
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,660
running the tech board at Starwood,

975
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,780
and the, the pic, the photo is labeled,

976
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,780
Tech God Keith.

977
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,040
So you see, we do appreciate

978
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,760
the hard work that people put into these festivals.

979
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,200
We will be having a costume ball at our own festival

980
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,400
called, the theme, there's always a theme,

981
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,160
and this theme,

982
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,640
this theme is an evening of anachronistic anomaly,

983
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,700
which in other words, come as you are.

984
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,620
I thought people were going to dress up

985
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,280
in mid-Victorian steampunk only with having like strange,

986
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,640
Like I said.

987
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,600
valves and things coming out of their baton.

988
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:48,460
Yeah, what I said.

989
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:49,580
Yeah.

990
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,180
Come as you are.

991
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,360
This is typical subgenius,

992
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,580
an evening of anachronistic anomaly.

993
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,320
So the girls are all talking about

994
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,520
what they're going to wear.

995
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,140
Oh, oh, oh, this reminds me,

996
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,300
I should give credit.

997
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,640
This music in the background is by a band

998
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,600
that will be, I don't know if beautiful is a word for it.

999
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,540
Well, I mean, it's very, it's very unsettling at times,

1000
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,540
and very restorative at times,

1001
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,380
makes you want to praise Jupiter

1002
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,460
and dance around at the moon and so forth.

1003
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:16,340
It does?

1004
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:16,940
Well said, Dave.

1005
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,200
Yes, it does to me.

1006
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,960
That's just what it does to me.

1007
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,820
Why don't you and Dave go out and dance around

1008
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,740
and draw down the moon?

1009
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,900
Hey, Dave, you want to go out and draw down the moon?

1010
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,860
Sure, let's draw it down.

1011
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:28,920
I'll show you.

1012
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,640
I'll show you a little stick that I could point at it.

1013
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,540
I'll show the both of you a moon.

1014
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,340
How do you like this one?

1015
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,360
Oh, man, if the audience could only see this.

1016
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,560
Oh, God.

1017
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,780
I'll show you a moon.

1018
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,240
I'm going to be forbidden from looking further.

1019
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,880
Yeah, oh, anyway, the band, the band.

1020
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,240
The band, the band.

1021
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,460
The music that's in the background is Boron Nuzzle.

1022
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,320
I keep wanting to say nozzle,

1023
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,400
and then I keep thinking that it is in fact nuzzle.

1024
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,600
No, don't get it.

1025
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,220
It is nozzle.

1026
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,520
It's Boron Nuzzle.

1027
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:00,900
Right.

1028
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,500
There's a type of a machine.

1029
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,460
Because you're thinking of the Boron nozzle that Dr. Michio Kaku says is used on Fukushima.

1030
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,800
Is that what it is?

1031
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:11,620
Well, yeah, they were going to try and squirt boron into it with a huge nozzle.

1032
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,060
Well, you know Dave knows.

1033
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,080
Now, come on.

1034
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,360
Well, that was the funny thing.

1035
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,360
I was going, which is it?

1036
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:20,140
The guy gave me a box full of his works.

1037
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,120
I'm just saying I can see your confusion.

1038
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:28,900
I was on the intronets, and I looked up, because I was, well, is it Boron Nuzzle or Boron Nuzzle?

1039
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:33,380
And it turns out there is a Boron nozzle, a commonly used equipment.

1040
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:40,300
But Boron Nuzzle is the name of the music in the background, and they will be at X Day along with Monkey Hive,

1041
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:47,500
Andrew the Impaled, Fat Man D, the Evolution Control Committee, the Amino Acids' very last performance,

1042
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,840
DJ 2 Beans and other DJs, I think Pope Black.

1043
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,680
Did I say Andrew the Impaled?

1044
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,800
He sticks screwdrivers into his head.

1045
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,620
And plays guitar.

1046
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,280
At the same time sometimes.

1047
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,560
He's a sideshow marvel.

1048
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:18,840
Dr. Dark's drive-in will be there showing the incredible film Big Man Japan, which I would not recommend to anybody normal.

1049
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:25,540
Well, your recommendation will then be followed by those who are not normal.

1050
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,780
I've watched it three times since then.

1051
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:27,880
I've seen it three times.

1052
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,520
Viola gave me a copy, and I still haven't seen it translated into Japanese.

1053
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,440
I have no idea what it's doing.

1054
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:37,920
It's probably a lot funnier when you don't know what they're saying.

1055
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,820
You're assuming that normal people could even be listening to this reference thing.

1056
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,500
Yes, I certainly am.

1057
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,760
I hope so.

1058
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:52,100
I hope millions of normal people are listening.

1059
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,800
And I hope they hate it.

1060
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,740
They think of nausea.

1061
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:58,680
They think of the nasal panic.

1062
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,740
We're here for the weirdos, baby.

1063
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,100
This is this whole club, this subgenius thing.

1064
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,620
You ever wonder what this is about?

1065
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,080
Here's what it's about.

1066
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,160
It's about the weirdos.

1067
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:15,920
And I don't care whether they're smart, cool weirdos or lame, embarrassing weirdos.

1068
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:20,220
They are weirdos, and that's why Bob is their god.

1069
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:26,240
There's a good reason that we call this the Church of the Subgenius.

1070
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,160
Believe you me.

1071
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,820
We've all known the guy or gal who was smart.

1072
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,660
Too smart for their own good.

1073
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,200
Oh yeah, they're savants.

1074
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,160
That's why everything they do is an act of savantage.

1075
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,740
No sir, no ma'am.

1076
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:47,000
We instead do wander as media overlords in the blabberinth of media overload.

1077
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,300
Resplendent in restententialism.

1078
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,860
It's the uncannibals versus the pretty-ots.

1079
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,140
The Church of the Subgenius.

1080
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,740
Friends, renders the conspiracy bobsolete.

1081
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,420
Subgenius puts the er in nerd.

1082
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,180
We are the polutically correct.

1083
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,820
Where the pinks would be but sated, we say hail Satan.

1084
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,060
For our enemies, we have a bouquet of forgive-me-nots.

1085
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,680
Their golden age that never was fills us only with nostalgia.

1086
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,060
Worldly?

1087
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:27,020
We'll give you world beat music.

1088
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,200
Like an old limp show, it can't be beat.

1089
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:37,320
And I just read that sermon from Onan Canobite.

1090
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,440
What a brilliant piece of...

1091
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,420
I did not bite all of that off by myself.

1092
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,140
Aramphage, Aramphage, Aramphage.

1093
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:47,060
He emailed me that in January and I've been...

1094
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:47,300
Indeed.

1095
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,860
It's been laying around in this stack of stuff all that time.

1096
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,360
Waiting.

1097
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,060
Mouldering, mouldering, I tell you, mouldering.

1098
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,000
Till this moment.

1099
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,140
I'm afraid we have run out of time.

1100
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:57,820
We have run out of petrol.

1101
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,420
It looks like the little red light is poignant to me.

1102
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:07,720
And although that's always meant excellent in my book, I'm afraid I'm passing out.

1103
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,280
Do you have any of those, what's the thing, those nozzles?

1104
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,200
Yes, that's right.

1105
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,280
The nozzle, boron nozzle will be there.

1106
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,140
The Qaddafi head football will be here.

1107
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,680
Friends, it's true.

1108
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,140
A year ago, we were launching Qaddafi head footballs.

1109
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,520
We were ahead.

1110
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,400
Ahead of our time.

1111
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:34,180
Which is another thing you could call our man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1112
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,700
Ahead of his time.

1113
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,100
The head of his time.

1114
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,180
Fill it up, Dave.

1115
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:46,320
And I can mind radio screen the head, fertile, fertile, unfertile, fertile, further and further

1116
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:46,940
from Earth.

1117
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,800
And soon it passed Saturn.

1118
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,120
And soon it passed Pluto.

1119
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,180
The little tiny asteroid that proclaims itself as a planet.

1120
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,380
And kept on, kept on, and kept on, and kept on.

1121
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:56,500
And I'm afraid I'm going to die.

1122
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:56,500


1123
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:56,500


1124
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:56,500


1125
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:56,500


1126
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:56,500


1127
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,740
Oh, I forgot to mention.

1128
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:02,420
Did I mention that we're having Dr. Dark's drive-in at this camp out?

1129
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,500
It's a great thing to do when you're camping out with subgeniuses.

1130
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,880
You only see once a year.

1131
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,220
Sit in the dark and watch a movie.

1132
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:07,620
Yeah.

1133
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:16,580
Well, another Reverend Fight C. Taj is going to have, be playing 30 movies in six days.

1134
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:23,860
Or basically movies all the time, 24-7 for six days in something called the Bad Film

1135
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:25,580
Grindhouse.

1136
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:32,980
And I've seen his list of movies, and it includes everything from A Boy and His Dog,

1137
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:39,680
The Beast of Yucca Flats, The Bride of the Monster, Carnival of Souls, Eegah, Frankenstein

1138
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:45,420
Meets the Space Monster, Manos, Hand of Fire, without the Mystery Science Theater treatment.

1139
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:45,980
Yeah.

1140
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,740
And so forth.

1141
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:54,080
All the great, famous, bad films, plus many you've never heard of, and some 12-part serials

1142
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,560
with special effects and a little bit of a twist.

1143
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:55,560


1144
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,380
By the Lidecker brothers.

1145
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:01,500
I'm actually looking forward to seeing these bad films because I just finished reading

1146
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:06,740
a book-length article about the Lidecker brothers who did the special effects in the

1147
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:12,560
old Republic serials, and serials like Radar Men from the Moon.

1148
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:17,300
The guys who flew the spaceship, so to speak, for Flash Gordon.

1149
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,780
And that you could actually not see the little wires.

1150
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,560
Under preachers, I've been advertising that, uh, Donald Trump is a bad guy.

1151
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:25,560


1152
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:25,640
And they're not.

1153
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:25,640


1154
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:30,240
So, um, I'm hoping that, uh, Dr. Legume will be there, Susie the Flusie, uh, Reverend Ivan

1155
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,740
Stang, Dr. Howell, although we're going to need help with that.

1156
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,840
Um, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, is he going to be there?

1157
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,160
I will try.

1158
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,240
I hope so.

1159
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,640
My very, um, my very adenoid relationship.

1160
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:47,840
We'll send someone after you if you don't show up.

1161
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,840
Oh, there's no one after me.

1162
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,440
Oh, and, uh, Finney, Reverend Phineas Narco of National Cynical Radio may be there.

1163
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:55,540
That's my favorite.

1164
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:55,540


1165
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:55,540


1166
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:55,540


1167
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:55,540


1168
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:55,540


1169
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:55,540


1170
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:55,540


1171
00:52:55,540 --> 00:53:00,360
And, of course, all the new ones, all those new preachers that everybody else knows, and

1172
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:06,560
I don't, because I'm not on Facebook, and I'm not young, and I hate parties, and I don't

1173
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,920
remember anybody until I've met them five times, and, uh.

1174
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,300
And he's used your name 16 times.

1175
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:17,500
You get, there's a whole portrait gallery of what's considered now to be famous ex-day

1176
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,320
subgeniuses, all these caricatures.

1177
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:24,800
And I, I, most of them are people I don't, I don't, I don't even know.

1178
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:25,520
Oh, my God.

1179
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:31,500
None of the old people, none of the old people that wrote them subgenius books or did any

1180
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,760
of them shows is, but that's because we're invisible.

1181
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,200
And old.

1182
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:40,660
And somebody already, and we've already, I shouldn't complain.

1183
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:46,460
There's two caricatures of me, two, two, there's new ones on, on, uh, sub site now.

1184
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,720
I, they're old, but they're new to others.

1185
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,720
Uh, friends, I see we're swiftly running out of time.

1186
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,480
Have we covered everything?

1187
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,680
But, but, but, but Dave.

1188
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,140
But is it slowly running out of time or quickly running out of time?

1189
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,080
Time is a thing of dragonflies and angels.

1190
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,180
Not of substance, that's for sure.

1191
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,420
Because if it were, we could grab hold of it.

1192
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,300
Time is a thing of Dr. Howell quotes and poetry.

1193
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,900
Time is a thing of, uh, of, uh, about three more minutes.

1194
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,400
So, oh, oh, oh, I know what I was supposed to mention.

1195
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:22,840
Yes.

1196
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,480
I did mention that, right?

1197
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:30,560
I could mention for the prisoners out there listening, especially ones in near Atlanta

1198
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,540
that don't have internet.

1199
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:36,760
You can write for free information from got that pencil ready?

1200
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,580
Post office box.

1201
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:45,860
1 8 1 4 1 7 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1202
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,620
4 4 1 1 8.

1203
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,700
And that's, that's quite a few numbers right there.

1204
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:57,420
I'm not sure if you can remember, but all you have to do is just either listen to it

1205
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,700
again or listen to it again.

1206
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,080
And if they had that magic thing of pen and paper that Reverend Stang is always telling

1207
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,160
me about, they'll have it forever.

1208
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,880
If they can find that piece of paper.

1209
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:08,200
Okay.

1210
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,480
So we're going to go down, uh, Dave, I'm going to put puzzling evidence back on.

1211
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:16,260
And after that, there might be a little bit of international espionage from the devotional,

1212
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,200
but we'll see.

1213
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,600
Nobody wants to talk to me.

1214
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:21,900
Come on.

1215
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,420
Snap out of it.

1216
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,460
Wake up and smell the coffee.

1217
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,340
Collar just fell asleep.

1218
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,680
At the side of the freeway.

1219
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:31,760
Yes, I know.

1220
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,360
With the engine idling, flashers flashing.

1221
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,480
And those are the guys standing outside the car.

1222
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:44,280
No, but seriously, they're over there on the side of the road on the soft shoulder.

1223
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:48,220
And pretty soon the highway patrol will be long to mop up.

1224
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,280
Between the highway.

1225
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:53,040
There's a ship over there sleeping.

1226
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,080
Somebody that's a renegade.

1227
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,960
Shemp in his own sleeping bag.

1228
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:57,600
Yeah.

1229
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:58,960
Yeah.

1230
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,280
Sham.

1231
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,780
I always tell shit by the way.

1232
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:02,980
He's.

1233
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,220
What?

1234
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,020
Hey, you found the phone.

1235
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:13,060
Chocolate.

1236
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,280
Chocolate.

1237
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,440
What kind of chocolate are you going to get me?

1238
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,080
Collar's a retail clerk and they're trying to wait on customers.

1239
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:23,400
What kind of chocolate?

1240
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:23,400


1241
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,420
I don't want to talk to a lot of talking to us.

1242
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,340
Where are they retailing?

1243
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,880
And I solid block of Chuggs.

1244
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,200
Up and down the block.

1245
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,460
The pack and sack.

1246
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,580
Only we had three stomachs like our friends.

1247
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,900
Then we could eat three times as much and then regurgitate it.

1248
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:45,040
Me.

1249
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:45,500
You didn't eat it again.

1250
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,440
Really?

1251
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:49,440


1252
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:49,860
Yeah.

1253
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,920
We'll be right back.

1254
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,320
We'll be right back.

1255
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,680
We'll be right back.

1256
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:20,580
We'll be right back.

1257
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,740
We'll be right back.

1258
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,760
We'll be right back.

1259
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:50,760
We'll be right back.
