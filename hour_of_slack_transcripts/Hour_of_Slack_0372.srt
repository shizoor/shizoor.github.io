1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,480
But now, I want you to remember to stay good boys and girls.

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,880
Respect your mothers and fathers and do what they tell you.

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,580
Obey your teachers and learn a whole lot.

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:29,460
Now, if you do this, I'll make sure you get good presents from me every year.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,240
But if you're bad boys and girls, your name goes in the bad boys and girls book.

6
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,140
And I'll bring you something horrible.

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,520
The Soap Genius Hour of Sweat.

8
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,320
A toast!

9
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,400
To Santa Claus!

10
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,680
To Santa Claus!

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,660
11-6-7-8

12
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,780
Better stay up late

13
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,980
9-10-

14
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,440
Santa's comin' again!

15
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,060
Yeah!

16
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,480
Nicely done, Santa!

17
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,180
Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!

18
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,140
On Comet! On Cupid! On Donald and Fredson!

19
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,480
Now, DASH AWAY!

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,680
DASH AWAY!!

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,640
That's who I am!

22
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,300
Who were they, number six?

23
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,180
Who let you in?

24
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,140
What are their names?

25
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,520
There's an organization, isn't there?

26
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:54,940
Dissidents.

27
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,460
Who's the head man?

28
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,580
Santa Claus.

29
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,920
Daddy, when's Santa be showing with his big red sack?

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,620
Moving on, tools.

31
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,220
Riding his gear.

32
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,400
Oh, Prancer.

33
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,140
Oh, Vincent.

34
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,540
Oh, what a great book.

35
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,160
It's that time of year.

36
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,000
Guess I've got all the luck.

37
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,380
And you, Mrs. Claus, are you ready at last?

38
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,100
Your coal is ready.

39
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,640
I'm bumped up with gas.

40
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,860
So this Christmas time is my time of year.

41
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,160
Get your sweet bones cooking, let's get into gear.

42
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,480
Say this red sack is packed and it's ready to roll.

43
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,860
Your love, damn women, is from their heads to their toes.

44
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,760
Time to pack.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,560
Up the sled.

46
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,020
Make that be trick.

47
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,800
No time to complain.

48
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,980
Don't forgive me.

49
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,160
Don't let dear counten on me.

50
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,840
It's Christmas time.

51
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,520
Deliver my loan if I don't.

52
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,080
It's a crime.

53
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,660
Through the cold north sky, I fly in my sled.

54
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,540
Don't need no radar.

55
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,540
I'm using my head to direct my nose to your good fun.

56
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,920
I'm tickling your fancy till the morning comes.

57
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,980
I'm psyched up and I get it right.

58
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,600
Don't be scared.

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,860
I'm sick of all this.

60
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:58,840
Take all the fetish streets out.

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,900
All the women like to Christmas cheer.

62
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,080
Well, it is ready, St.

63
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,060
It's the cheer.

64
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,200
This is the story of old St.

65
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,000
Nick with his big red sack and his candy stick.

66
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,400
Flying back home with his beard so white.

67
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,700
He's licking that boom tang all Christmas night.

68
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,460
Oh, it's Christmas time.

69
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,940
It's my time of year.

70
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,140
Get your sweet hugs, boom, and let's get it here.

71
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,160
Say, let's get sex back.

72
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,520
It's ready to go.

73
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,960
All the lovely women from the top of their heads to their toes.

74
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,800
Oh, it's Christmas time.

75
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,240
It's my time of year.

76
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,460
Get your sweet hugs, boom, and let's get it here.

77
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,420
Say, let's get sex back.

78
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,720
It's ready to go.

79
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,240
All the lovely women from the top of their heads to their toes.

80
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,080
Oh, it's Christmas time.

81
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,540
It's my time of year.

82
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,760
Go to sleep, go to sleep, get your party here.

83
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,760
Say, let's get sex back.

84
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,020
It's ready to go.

85
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,480
All the lovely women from the top of their heads to their toes.

86
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:18,340
Yes, dear friends, Santa's Big Red Sack by Iron Liver with Brother Cleve Duncan and Dr. Felix Krul on vocals.

87
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:30,140
And yes, it is the Hour of Slack traditional Christmas show, which is, as always, composed of all previous subgenius Christmas shows.

88
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:48,100
But don't despair. I know the last five were exactly alike. But this time, why, it's half new. Thanks to an amazing Christmas barrage tape we got from the good Reverend Jerry, most aptly named subgenius.

89
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:57,320
Nutter, Reverend Jerry Nutter, a tape called The Hopes and Fears of All the Years.

90
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:17,300
Ah, yes, you know when those other tape editing geniuses and mad collectors help us out this way, why, it makes Slack so much easier to get in this hectic Saturnalia season.

91
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:32,620
By the way, I should also mention that we're doing this show entirely at home, so to speak. Most Hour of Slack shows are at least partly put together live on the air in the high-tech studios of KNON.

92
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:47,420
But since this show has to be ready two weeks ahead of time, I am forced to do it here at Bulldada Time Control Laboratories, which may help to explain the lack of background music.

93
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,320
And my own.

94
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:56,440
My own lack of the terror of, oh my God, we're live and thousands are ready to pounce on any screw-up.

95
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,040
Actually, I kind of hate doing shows without that panicky feeling.

96
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:10,820
And you may also notice the different ambiance, room sound, air noise, or smells, or what have you.

97
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,980
The background sounds like squeaky chairs, or differently squeaky chairs.

98
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,320
The background sounds like squeaky chairs, or differently squeaky chairs.

99
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,640
The background sounds like squeaky chairs, or differently squeaky chairs.

100
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,640


101
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,640


102
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:26,340
Dogs barking, and the nuclear reactor thunking away, and the whimperings of the sub-bobbies.

103
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,260
And, of course, poor old Will of Dobbs laboring away over there.

104
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,220
You there, Will?

105
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,460
I'm right here, sir.

106
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:41,100
Over there across the warehouse, supervising the mail order division, hauling canisters of souls down to the basement.

107
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:47,180
Anyway, all I want for Christmas, friends, is my two frontal lobes back.

108
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,420
And a stocking full of slack from Bob's own illegitimate dad, St. Nick.

109
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,080
Or Old Nick.

110
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,240
I can't remember which he prefers to be called.

111
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,740
Old Scratch, whatever.

112
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,300
Oh, yes.

113
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,720
So nice.

114
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,540
So nice.

115
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:23,180
Oh, so nice to hear Reverend Yukon Jack's Christmas themes again.

116
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,180
From his kitty cat singing to you, dear friends.

117
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,400
Yes, this is, uh, listen, for those of you doubtful about the hour of slack,

118
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,440
stay tuned because I'm going to be playing.

119
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:42,660
I'm going to be singing a Christmas carol so horrible, so anti-human, so absolutely,

120
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,200
I mean, believe me, you want a tape of the song, the Christmas carol,

121
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,940
that I'm, recorded right here in Dallas by six sick minds.

122
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:34,520
I'm going to be singing a Christmas carol so horrible, so anti-human, so absolutely,

123
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,320
I mean, believe me, you want a tape of the song, the Christmas carol, that I'm going to be playing.

124
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,460
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

125
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,260
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

126
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,100
God love ye weary citizens, for it is such a shame

127
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,680
To think of cruel injustices all done in Jesus' name.

128
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,440
Remember when you go to church, believers are to blame.

129
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,360
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

130
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,500
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

131
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,860
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

132
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,800
God help ye weary citizens, you've all been taken in

133
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,400
By priesthoods waxing rich and fat upon your fear of sin.

134
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,140
Though you may knock at heaven's door, they will not let you in.

135
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,900
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

136
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,580
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

137
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,080
God save ye weary citizens.

138
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,380
For this who made ye sick.

139
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,160
Said Christ was just another Jew they nailed upon a dick.

140
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,820
He couldn't save himself, you know religion is a trick.

141
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,700
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

142
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,500
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

143
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,020
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

144
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,520
Oh, yes, and we have also another...

145
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,400
Dammit, where's my script?

146
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,580
Yeah, a new, that is new this month, 1990 new Christmas carol.

147
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,660
Or actually it's an X-mas, no, an X-ist-mas carol.

148
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,500
Not an X-mas carol.

149
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:56,080
From the mighty Soso Dada Clanch in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

150
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:01,160
And you'll have to listen close to the lyrics because I believe this one is supposed to be

151
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,380
being sung by the X.

152
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:04,880
X-ists.

153
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,520
Black Boba.

154
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,440
Propping in the hay.

155
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,020
With honey and some cutters.

156
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,020
They're on exit 3.

157
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,560
Exit will come on 1.

158
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,500
Must be on day 1.

159
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,800
And we will have some slack.

160
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,940
Squat front pop up.

161
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,640
Do the thingy, yag, yag, yag, yag.

162
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,920
Yag, yag, yag, yag, yag, yag, yag.

163
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,260
We'll mess us up.

164
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,740
Black Boba.

165
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,780
Slack Boba.

166
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,280
Propping in the hay.

167
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,500
Hey, yag, yag, yag, yag.

168
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:34,500


169
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,700
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

170
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

171
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,140
Black Bob, Black Bob, Black Bob.

172
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,540
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

173
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,760
And I'm on my way with happiness for little girls and boys.

174
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,460
Five multiple head rockets.

175
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:31,000
All tied to the controls in the war room of the Pentagon and targeted on our enemies.

176
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,020
But the only person authorized to push the button is...

177
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,460
Yes?

178
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,580
The President of the United States.

179
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:37,860
Precisely.

180
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,780
But we're not at war, and he's not about to push that button.

181
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,700
Quite right.

182
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,360
Not that button, and not knowingly.

183
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,100
But there are buttons and buttons.

184
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,000
I still don't...

185
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,920
Like the button that will turn on the lights on that beautiful Christmas tree.

186
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,080
On the White House lawn?

187
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,080
Right.

188
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,380
You mean to say that button is tied into the rocket launch system you just showed me?

189
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,060
Now you're getting it.

190
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,220
It's tied in by a remote control circuit I secretly installed.

191
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,720
And when the President pushes the button that lights the tree...

192
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,100
Good Lord.

193
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,620
For a brief moment, the lights will go on.

194
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,840
And then a bomb concealed in one of the tree ornaments will detonate,

195
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,120
destroying everyone in the immediate area.

196
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,900
Including the President?

197
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,720
Especially the President.

198
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,380
And simultaneously,

199
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,660
five beautiful rockets will soar like avenging angels through the night sky.

200
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,420
And when they reach their targets...

201
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,440
Merry Christmas, everyone!

202
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,960
In the minds of all beings, let's penetrate the sacred radiation.

203
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,400
With your fiery incendiary missiles of mercy,

204
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:59,060
turn out the hate and normalcy which has sought to subdue our church and our abnormality.

205
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,940
Sure, let's go in.

206
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,040
And with your cleansing radioactive...

207
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,080
Hold your breath till nothing human exists.

208
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,960
And now...

209
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:14,060
...Sugarion Dunk blew off the air and charged it to a million energy-efficient particles.

210
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,740
Give!

211
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,340
Give, folks!

212
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,000
Give a little to poor old Santa Claus!

213
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,480
Give what you can so thems ain't got hardly anything at all!

214
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,460
You can have a little Christmas cheer!

215
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,720
Give! Give!

216
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,060


217
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:39,440
Somebody'll hit like an atom bomb when he comes, when he comes.

218
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:39,860
You'll...

219
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,060
For those of you out there who enjoy the latest in new music...

220
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,260
You'll...

221
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,860
Ho, ho, ho!

222
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,400
...Hurrah!

223
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,860
Back we go!

224
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,260
...Hurrah!

225
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:07,260


226
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,280
Oh, dear friends, this is Magic Moes.

227
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,700
What is it? What is this?

228
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,040
Say, do we have any druids in the audience?

229
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,140
Well, hi, yeah. This one's for you.

230
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,600
Magic Moes and his royal rockers here.

231
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,020
Have yourselves...

232
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,660
...a groovy little solstice.

233
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,860
...a groovy little solstice.

234
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,300
Why won't you voice a little comfort next to them?

235
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,100
It's not a treat.

236
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,100


237
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,100


238
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,200
Now it's your time to go.

239
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,040
Because we'll never go out today.

240
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,040


241
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:51,880
No- texted!

242
00:17:52,660 --> 00:18:02,840
No- telephonic calls.

243
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:09,200
Solstice, nosh out on druid food.

244
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,200
Yeah, make little pigs of yourselves.

245
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:21,800
Then we'll all dance naked in a festive mood.

246
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,260
If you are a dazzling urbanite,

247
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,760
a smug suburbanite,

248
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,000
hey, that's cool.

249
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,620
You don't have to lead a boring country.

250
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,320
Life to groove our natural life

251
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,600
as a rule.

252
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,880
Someday soon,

253
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,380
we'll all dance nude together

254
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,200
if utility rates allow.

255
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,920
You know, those funky Boston Edison guys, you know.

256
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,080
Until then,

257
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,620
we'll don our ritual robes and bow.

258
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:46,240
To have ourselves a groovy little solstice now.

259
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,180
Yeah.

260
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:48,520
Yeah.

261
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,440
Yeah.

262
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,600
Yeah.

263
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:50,600


264
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,380
Take it away, guys.

265
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,620
Oh, yeah.

266
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,320
All you pagans out there

267
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,060
ought to get into this special Christmas show

268
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,580
here on the Hour of Slack.

269
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,680
This is Magic Mose and his royal rockers.

270
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,940
So, are you all having a good time this evening, huh?

271
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,700
I sure am.

272
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,780
Aren't you?

273
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,380
Yeah.

274
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,000
Are they putting booze in the drinks tonight, huh?

275
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,120
Mm-hmm.

276
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:14,920
Oh, yeah.

277
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,960
Well, remember, folks,

278
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,980
the more you drink, the better we sound.

279
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,500
Yeah.

280
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:18,880
Yeah.

281
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,240
The better I feel.

282
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,280
The more you drink.

283
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,180
Oh, yeah.

284
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,780
Praise Bob.

285
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,480
Oh, it may be witchcraft.

286
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,120
The royal rockers, ladies and gentlemen.

287
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,740
Aren't they wonderful?

288
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,260
But it's wonderful.

289
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,180
It's wonderful.

290
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:34,600
Thank you.

291
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,240
Thank you very much.

292
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,800
Thank you.

293
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,960
The boys thank you.

294
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,340
Bye.

295
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:39,760
Thank you.

296
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,820
Oh, love.

297
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,580
Okay, we're swinging now.

298
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,540
I'm not afraid of the cold or the dark.

299
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,700
All my life I've lived in the cold and the dark.

300
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,560
Well, who are you, little girl?

301
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,040
I am Greta Vilna.

302
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,240
Please help me, Sandy Claus.

303
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,040
Sure, sure, I will.

304
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,660
But where do you live?

305
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,720
I don't live anywhere now.

306
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,260
Don't you know the house or the street?

307
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,000
There are so many houses all alike.

308
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,380
So many streets all alike.

309
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,540
Oh, you poor little girl.

310
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,820
This is terrible.

311
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,620
Please don't cry for me, Sandy Claus.

312
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,420
I'm not afraid for you.

313
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:19,660
I'm not afraid for myself.

314
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,780
Only for my papa.

315
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,340
Where's your papa gone?

316
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,160
To a newspaper office.

317
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,560
A newspaper office?

318
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,680
What newspaper?

319
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,720
I can't remember, but he had to go.

320
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,280
And I'm afraid they'll send him away to prison like they did at home.

321
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,860
No, they won't, miss.

322
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,440
Newspapers don't ever send nobody to prison in America.

323
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,880
They only try to help the police.

324
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,180
The police.

325
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,600
That's where I better take you, miss.

326
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,860
To the police station.

327
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,480
Oh, no.

328
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,320
There's no Sandy Claus.

329
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,420
I'm afraid of police stations.

330
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:52,940
Why?

331
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,020
Because people who go to police stations hardly ever come home again.

332
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,120
Not here, miss.

333
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,800
Why, if that was so in America, there wouldn't be enough jails to hold them.

334
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,340
Now you come on.

335
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,900
I gotta get you out of this cold and snow.

336
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,200
No.

337
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,040
Please, Sandy Claus.

338
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,460
Don't take me to the police station.

339
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,360
Only two shopping days.

340
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,340
Two Christmas days.

341
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,560
And I'm not going to be able to get home.

342
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,880
Well, I hope you've done all your shopping by now.

343
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,600
If you haven't, you can go ahead and go running out to the department stores.

344
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,320
Even now.

345
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,080
But you might prefer to stay home and get in the Christmas spirit this afternoon.

346
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,400
Oh, dear.

347
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,340
It is turnover.

348
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,040
The time of the year when all things sell.

349
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,660
The end of the year sale.

350
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,540
Oh, yeah.

351
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,460
So come and get it, everyone.

352
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,500
And just buy our products.

353
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,600
Now, are we, is Chris, I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

354
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,220
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

355
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,700
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

356
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:11,780
But the present subgenie try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now and sell everything to the pigs.

357
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,040
Oh, yes.

358
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,460
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

359
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,440
And it was something else.

360
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:27,720
In between there, before it was, after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season, it was something else.

361
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,580
But I think they started the war over it.

362
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:29,980
Yeah.

363
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:38,820
Well, friends, we've got our own special Christmas carol that we're going to play that we're inventing as we go right now.

364
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,200
X is missed.

365
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,520
From the town.

366
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,180
Snap.

367
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,440
Sound system.

368
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,260
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

369
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,620
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

370
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,160
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

371
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,420
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

372
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:48,420


373
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,280
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

374
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,900
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

375
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,220
Come on, come on.

376
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,960
From Bunch Bunny.

377
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,060
Who do you want?

378
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,080
It's He-Bob.

379
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:08,420
Hey, kids, you can help the mighty subgenius Christ overthrow the evil normals with shopping, shopping, everybody shopping, 11 more days to Christmas.

380
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:15,200
Each so separate, each so separate, each so separate, each so separate, you from Tonya.

381
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,700
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob.

382
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,400
I'll let you know.

383
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,560
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.

384
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,860
Shut up, pink boy.

385
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,820
No way.

386
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,540
I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.

387
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,860
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien tool.

388
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:38,440
Bob Dobbs comes with rockets, pipe, head launcher, Janger device, all Yaka-tisma, fighting Jesus, and other action figures sold separately.

389
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,640
Some assembly required, batteries not included.

390
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,260
This toy falls apart in three days.

391
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,280
He-Bob.

392
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,160
Welcome, Westland.

393
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,220
Welcome to the Masters of the Universe.

394
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,380
Too much is always better than nothing.

395
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,380


396
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,380


397
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,380


398
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,380


399
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,380


400
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,380


401
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,380


402
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,380


403
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,380


404
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,380


405
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,380


406
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,380


407
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,380


408
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,820
I'm a chocolate space cadet.

409
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,220
Life support system down to zero coco.

410
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,860
Feeling spacey.

411
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,640
Absolute.

412
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,020
Well, friends, what do you think?

413
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:15,380
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here, or is it the horrible

414
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
death of the Santa Bob, dear friends?

415
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,160
Santa Claus is Santa Bob, as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures.

416
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,940
Now we need roller skates for Fanny and a bicycle for Annie.

417
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,720
And don't forget the pie for dear old dad.

418
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,480
Oh, that pie.

419
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,420
We just thought of something funny.

420
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,000
Where the heck do we get money?

421
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,980
We get it all from J-Bob.

422
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:41,720
Bob.

423
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,700
Bob Bob.

424
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,560
Bob Bob Bob.

425
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,680
Bob Bob Bob.

426
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,040
Bob Bob Bob.

427
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
Bob Bob Bob.

428
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,440
Bob Bob Bob.

429
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,080
Bob Bob Bob.

430
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,540
Bob Bob Bob.

431
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,800
We're eating've we'n

432
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:02,200
Why, daddy.

433
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,200


434
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,240
So, who'd like to play some wonderfugly dice and show them to Daddy?

435
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,300
Daddy dive!

436
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:02,860
Daddy인이 go get the dice!

Father Kaz haven't been parted from to desperate giving.

439
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,620
And that's really the fun of ISA.

440
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,160
Yes, he's right.

441
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,340
Good luck to everybody.

442
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,700
A three-year supply of Libby's frozen fruits and vegetables.

443
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,260
A $2,000 Moray diamond ring.

444
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,380
A new Ford custom-built station wagon.

445
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,940
On the fourth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...

446
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,020
A complete steered.

447
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,300
A three-year supply of Libby's frozen fruits and vegetables.

448
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,940
A $2,000 Moray diamond ring.

449
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,120
A new Ford custom-built station wagon.

450
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:50,040
On the fifth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...

451
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:55,900
From Mandeville, five-in-one combination radio, television, phonograph, wire recorder, and bar.

452
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,660
A complete steered.

453
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,980
A three-year supply of Libby's frozen fruits and vegetables.

454
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,600
A $2,000 Moray diamond ring.

455
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,760
A new Ford custom-built station wagon.

456
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:13,060
On the sixth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...

457
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,000
A new Ford custom-built station wagon.

458
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,120
Fixed $100 hats.

459
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,320
A Mandeville five-in-one combination radio, television, phonograph, wire recorder, and bar.

460
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,140
A complete steered.

461
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,480
A three-year supply of Libby's frozen fruits and vegetables.

462
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,780
A $2,000 Moray diamond ring.

463
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,920
Like I said, bone face.

464
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,720
You hear the thunder here.

465
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,100
But I feel the punch here.

466
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,020
Feel the punch.

467
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,760
The key man, you, from the Masters of the Universe Collection.

468
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,600
Bring grace, obey.

469
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,920
We're gonna rock and wrestle.

470
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:42,920
We'll wait.

471
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,280
Illusion is the ultimate weapon.

472
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,620
Doll that stands up.

473
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,520
She's new.

474
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,660
From Kenner.

475
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,920
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

476
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,960
We must buy our toys.

477
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:58,720
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

478
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,780
They will empower us to resist us.

479
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:11,880
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the public.

480
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,840
It will be a whole bother for kids.

481
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:27,840
Do you understand and accept this lesson?

482
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,600
For the usual plus expenses.

483
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,500
Good.

484
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,300
This covenant

485
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,580
has been recorded

486
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,980
in the archives of reality.

487
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,460
Okay, I think for the girls we'll have the strawberry rainbow, rainbow bite.

488
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,740
And for the boys,

489
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,400
a little tiny transformer.

490
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,240
Robots will change into dollar bills and back again.

491
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,840
Yes.

492
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,280
But how will they?

493
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:19,060
How will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

494
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,980
Good at what the most?

495
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,140
Good.

496
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,060
Good!

497
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:33,960
The primitive Earth societies should accept this value judgment.

498
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,780
Good will have great physical attributes

499
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,220
according to human desires.

500
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:55,740
Sexual desires latent in children brought out through the vehicle of this so-called

501
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,900
Skull farmers told these boys at church.

502
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,240
That is not good.

503
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,120
Skull farmers.

504
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,880
That's good.

505
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,140
I think that makes sense to the humans.

506
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,520
Skull farmers.

507
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,220
Little wind-up bobs.

508
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,160
Hundreds of little bobs.

509
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:24,080
Each whispering their messages in the night to the little children as they sleep.

510
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,280
Too much is always better than not enough.

511
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:37,280
Too much is always better than not enough.

512
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,960
Too much.

513
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,640
Too bad.

514
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,460
Too bad.

515
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,460
Too bad.

516
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,280
Too bad.

517
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,420
Too bad.

518
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:45,900
Too bad.

519
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,240
Too bad.

520
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:47,800
Too bad.

521
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,420
Too bad.

522
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:56,280
When everybody sells,

523
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,000
We're all selling.

524
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,700
we all have something to sell.

525
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,880
Yes, everyone selling together mighty symphony of prosperity.

526
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,520
Chocolatey pebbles from you know who?

527
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,140
I'm a chocolate space cadet.

528
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,700
Hey mom.

529
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,500
Hey dad.

530
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:09,500


531
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,640
Can we have some polyester hose for breakfast?

532
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,300
Sure, son.

533
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,680
All of us moms have TVs,

534
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:20,880
so we know that polyester hose are just chock-full of conspiracy genetic coding

535
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,240
and administrative byproducts.

536
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,540
That's right, Mom.

537
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:28,320
One serving of polyester hose can turn your blue-collar children

538
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,240
into what appears to be a bag of pink pus

539
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,780
stuffed into a white shirt and tie.

540
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,900
And remember, there's a whole dead executive in every can of

541
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,860
Chucky-style polyester hose.

542
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,880
You have lost your reward.

543
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,780
Here we go.

544
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,520
You shall enter heaven as a servant without a single soul to your credit.

545
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,540
It's unfair.

546
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,540
Show him his record.

547
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,480
The ceaseless ages of eternity is an awful price.

548
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,620
It is an awful price to pay.

549
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,040
Mom, Buck's calling you.

550
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:19,080
And we do, we're gonna, we're gonna seriously address this issue,

551
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,920
but in the meantime,

552
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,400
we have the problem of who is the Santa Bob?

553
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,280
Were there any readings here on the Santa Bob?

554
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:32,100
We ought to talk a little bit about Weir Bobs and Ima Bobs tonight, Reverend Stang.

555
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,060
I can sense a little bit of that coming on Red Reverend Stang.

556
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,420
The Weir Bobs and Ima,

557
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:42,120
those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.

558
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,160
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.

559
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:50,700
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous errands.

560
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:58,520
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

561
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,920
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float in through the keyhole.

562
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,840
On the seventh day of Christmas, my true love sent to me

563
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:17,400
7,500 cans of Campbell's delicious soup.

564
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,900
Six $100 hats.

565
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:25,200
Amandaville 5-in-1 combination radio, television, phonograph, wire recorder, and bar.

566
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,720
A complete steer.

567
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,180
Santa's on a diet.

568
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,920
He was forced into exile to a San Fernando Valley health spa

569
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,400
where they forced him to take off his clothes.

570
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:37,400


571
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:37,400


572
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:37,400


573
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,480
And embarrass him.

574
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,320
And derail him in front of his reindeer.

575
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,080
Who fled in confusion and hunger into the sky.

576
00:33:51,620 --> 00:34:04,880
This one, dear friends, is Santa Claus is Coming to Rape Your Wife by a band called Mechanical Sterility.

577
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,400
The story of Santa Claus is coming to Rape Your Wife by a band called Mechanical Sterility.

578
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:07,400


579
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:12,620
The singer, I think, is Reverend M. Schaefer of the Church of the Subgenius.

580
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,540
Listen to this beautiful, beautiful song.

581
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,740
Ah, yeah.

582
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:25,200
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.

583
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:33,580
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.

584
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,400
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.

585
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:42,400
And he's got a big knife.

586
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,720
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.

587
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,600
Hey, Santa Claus.

588
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,220
Santa discern it by heart.

589
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:18,700
We call!

590
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,660
Santa Claus is coming to rape you.

591
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,700
Santa Claus, Santa Claus is coming to rape you.

592
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:20,940
Here's the song.

593
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,340
Santa Claus is coming to rape you.

594
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,340
Santa Claus, Santa Claus is coming to rape you.

595
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,500
Santa Claus is coming to rape you.

596
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,460
Santa Claus is coming to rape you.

597
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,420
Santa Claus is coming to rape you.

598
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,260
Santa Claus is coming to rape you.

599
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,440
Here's the best song this giver would ever sing.

600
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,600
Santa Claus's coming to rape you.

601
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,020
Santa Claus is coming to rape you.

613
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:01,660
On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...

614
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,680
Well, $100 Volta wristwatches.

615
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,280
A Sherwin-Williams paint and varnish.

616
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,420
supply for your entire house inside and out. Venetian blinds and window styling

617
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:14,860
throughout by Kirsch Company. A general electric sink combining garbage disposal

618
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:21,580
unit and automatic dishwasher. A French maid for two weeks. 7,500 cans of

619
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:26,980
Campbell's delicious soup. Six $100 hats. A Mandeville five-in-one combination

620
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:32,640
radio, television, phonograph, wire recorder, and bar. A complete steered. A

621
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,000
three-year supply of Libby's frozen fruits and vegetables. A $2,000

622
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,540
Moray diamond ring. A new Ford custom-built station wagon.

623
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:01,720
Cut that out! A lot can happen to a kid in this hard-boiled town.

624
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,620
We just

625
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:07,540
deal too much with the seamy side, Harry. Actually, the people of a big town are no

626
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,820
worse than other people the world over. Yeah, more good than bad, even in the

627
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:18,860
seamy ones. I guess we kind of forget that. Yeah? We forget a lot of things, Harry.

628
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:28,780
That we only remember this time of year. Yeah. It's still snowing. Makes the old town

629
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,220
kind of pretty, almost. Yes.

630
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:38,620
It hides and softens the man-made ugliness. And in a moment, we'll return to the dramatic

631
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:44,160
and heartwarming climax of Prelude to Christmas. Perhaps I could interest you in this little

632
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:51,340
sparkler, the wild turkey flask. Comes in its own gift box, holds 200 milliliters, and we've

633
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:57,040
got eye-catching point-of-sale signs to let everybody know about them. A great stocking

634
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,600
stuffer, too. I'd love it. You guys are beautiful. Thank you. I mean, you have thought of me.

635
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:02,600


636
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:10,280
Of course. Of everything. Great packaging, collector's items, precious crystal, flask. You've thought of everything.

637
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:23,500
All this should lift your holiday sale. Now, I can really be on top of the world. And I owe it all to you.

638
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:31,900
Hello? Where'd you go? Where are you? Hello? Hello, spirit?

639
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,860
Where are you? Where are you? Where did you go?

640
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:48,280
He's got those holiday blues. Is that a dream? I knew it was too good to be true.

641
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:59,720
Merry Christmas to all! Ah, yes, dear friends. Christmas, the season of turnover, when the

642
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,600
shelves must be cleared. I can't get that car. I can't get that car. I can't get that car.

643
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:02,920
I can't. I can't. I can't get that car. I can't get that car. I can't get that car. I can't get that car.

644
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:02,920


645
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:02,920


646
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,440
to get this car right now, dear friends. You know, I got, after all these friendly calls,

647
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:13,700
I got one call from somebody who said, what are you all? The usual thing, the usual question,

648
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,460
what are you all trying to do? And I go, hey, we're trying to give you some slack, OK?

649
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,520
You know, they go, who's Bob? I said, well, give them your address. I'll send you some

650
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,800
some information or whatever you know i'll give the number at the end of the broadcast and they

651
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,760
and and this person you know i knew there was something that they weren't saying and finally

652
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:41,480
he goes well i just hope that it was something like i just hope that you know you can get right

653
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,320
with jesus or something like that just hung up he hung up that was the key point so he didn't want

654
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:56,420
to hear what i had to say back about that because you know see a subgenius has so much faith that he

655
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:02,740
not only can accept somebody making fun of bob stomping on a picture of bob he'll do it himself

656
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:10,680
he has so much trust and faith in bob bob is such a good friend that he can insult bob now we subgeni

657
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,520
i hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes but we subgeni may

658
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,680
be bad

659
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,120
you

660
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:25,940
, but our way of bad is holy is holy compared to the evil of so not all at all by any means but so

661
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:31,560
many american fundamentalists charismatics evangelicals etc in general of course they

662
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:40,360
and their corresponding types in iran russia libya south africa etc if you ask me are actually the

663
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:46,600
ace up the devil's sleeve wolves in sheep's clothing friends just like jesus warned about

664
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:46,860
five

665
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:55,800
where jesus and bob like we say our old drinking buddies got nothing against jesus it's just his fan club and

666
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:02,040
Now we aren't saying that bob is the ace of god's sleeve he's more like the smear on god's handkerchief

667
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,940
Just like you were me but the uptight

668
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:12,380
Rival cults they don't think god has a handkerchief. Oh, no because god's perfect. He doesn't even sneeze

669
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,340
We're made in his image except that we have all these nasty

670
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:24,500
hearts attached to us and we have to go in the the secret room the bathroom to do awful things

671
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:31,280
but god oh he's clean and pure according to them oh and he's male but he doesn't excrete juices

672
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:37,200
and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do because we sin oh yeah we all sin we're bad

673
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:44,620
we're worthless we're no good to god unless we sign a contract with his agent well friend

674
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:50,720
jesus himself he spouted just about as many great punch lines as bob probably more but and this is

675
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:57,720
true this is historical fact the very early mainstream christian church methodically censored

676
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:04,100
about half of the existing gospels about jesus they and this is i'm not kidding you can go to

677
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:11,020
any real bookstore and pick up the censored gospels that they finally found years later

678
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:14,420
they took out the parts where jesus specifically

679
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:20,900
said that every person had equal access to the lord and that you didn't need no preacher between

680
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:28,320
you and him that in fact was probably his main point now lost in antiquity that you were the son

681
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:35,360
or daughter of god just as much as jesus was or bob see but that's too humanistic for the

682
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:42,900
conspiracy christians so they they wiped out the subgenius gnostic christians anyway i'm going to

683
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,400
get off my soapbox we'll get into it

684
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:50,060
into the the hideous theological discussions coming up next week as we attack the bobbies

685
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:54,600
we interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement we turn

686
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,460

Baby, I've had a lot of hard times at Christmas time.

705
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,500
I can remember me and my brother when I was about six years old.

706
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,580
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece

707
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,780
and the health department made us take them down.

708
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,700
Baby, me and my brother wore tennis shoes so long.

709
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,440
Now, let me tell you how long we wore them.

710
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:35,080
We wore tennis shoes Indian summer, Easter, Thanksgiving,

711
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,040
Halloween day, New Year's, and Christmas.

712
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,900
Baby, we wore our tennis shoes so long

713
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,620
till we wore them out up to the name on the ankle.

714
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,760
When we got ready to lay down,

715
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:50,580
we didn't.

716
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,260
We didn't take them off.

717
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,540
All we had to do was fold them back, baby.

718
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,320
I remember my father well, you know.

719
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,300
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.

720
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,560
He used to have, you know how tall he'd be.

721
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,240
He used to put a stocking cap on his head

722
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,000
and put a knock light in front of it.

723
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:14,680
Daddy would wake up with that thumping headache

724
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,740
and he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad.

725
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,980
I said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas,

726
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:20,760
but he's going to bring it.

727
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:21,200
He said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas,

728
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:21,200


729
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,340
So Daddy took that old rifle and went outside

730
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,620
and shot up in the air and come back inside

731
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,760
and told us the biggest lie I ever heard.

732
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,920
Said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.

733
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,800
So that we can celebrate future Christmases in peace.

734
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,720
Yet in thy dark streets

735
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,760
shineth the everlasting light.

736
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,180
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light.

737
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:51,600
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light.

738
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,980
The hopes and fears of all the years

739
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,840
are met in thee tonight.

740
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,940
So goes the ancient Yuletide carol.

741
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,880
You know, I'm not the only soldier

742
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,360
who says a little prayer inside when he hears it.

743
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:09,180
A little prayer that our United States keeps strong and free.

744
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,180
And this I know.

745
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,300
God helps those who help themselves.

746
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,900
And it's up to us, the American citizens,

747
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,760
to keep up our defense with a strong and free spirit.

748
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:20,760


749
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,140
a strong and free spirit.

750
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,500
And that's the light of freedom.

751
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,440
Let's keep that light burning for all the years ahead

752
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,340
by doing our part for defense.

753
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,500
On the fifth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me

754
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,560
five valiums,

755
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,980
four grams of hash, three pounds of grass,

756
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,280
two hundred reds, and a tab of yellow sunshine LSD.

757
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:27,240
Well, yes, Ivan, thanks for coming out to Dobstown here,

758
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,760
and I wanted to show you the Christmas nursery.

759
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,840
Oh, look at these little scamps.

760
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,280
And to think these used to be slackless children.

761
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,740
What did you kids say?

762
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,260
Great mom!

763
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:39,960
Oh, yes.

764
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,180
That's so darling.

765
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,960
Does that warm my Bob land or what?

766
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,680
Yeah, hey, would you like to use one of these kids?

767
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,240
Yeah, yeah.

768
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,300
Warm it up a little more?

769
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,080
They're available.

770
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:49,500
Yeah.

771
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,260
A discount.

772
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:50,680
All right.

773
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,240
Our subscribers, our church family subscribers,

774
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:59,280
can adopt one of these little scamps for a mere, oh,

775
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,920
couple thousand on top of your usual annual fee.

776
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:02,620
That's right.

777
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,340
Put them to work.

778
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,740
Take them home, put them to work.

779
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,980
They've been trained, and they'll do all sorts of tricks.

780
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,240
They've been trained to slack off.

781
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,480
Just try to get work out of some of these little guys.

782
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:16,980
Prince Bob!

783
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,420
Merry Christmas!

784
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,120
Merry Christmas!

785
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,180
God rest ye merry gentlemen.

786
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,020
Let nothing you dislike.

787
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,400
Remember Christ.

788
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:41,440
A fairy who was born on Christmas day.

789
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,060
Merry Christmas!

790
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:45,940
Merry Christmas!

791
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:47,820
Merry Christmas!

792
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:48,620
Merry Christmas!

793
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:49,360


794
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:49,740
Merry Christmas!

795
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:50,700
Merry Christmas!

796
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:50,740


797
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:50,740


798
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:50,740


799
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:50,740


800
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:50,740


801
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:56,340
wheel again, Sergeant. What for? To wish him a Merry Christmas?

802
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,920
Merry Christmas!

803
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,720
Merry Christmas!

804
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:44,500
So many confusing issues at hand, including whether or not the Santa did actually die at the hands of the cavalry that day on the Mount of Skulls, or whether the over-modulation can be helped at some time in the far future.

805
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,160
So, friends, this is a song about...

806
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,740
Oh, I see, I see, I can control...

807
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,980
It comes in and out of here.

808
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,520
We can now control the hiss.

809
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:06,060
That means that their minds can likewise be controlled by subliminal messages planted in the hiss that goes out with this show.

810
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,740
Stay there.

811
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,060
Please stay there.

812
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:10,960
I'll be right back.

813
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:16,060
Remember, you are commanded not to be turned.

814
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,420
Merry Christmas!

815
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,460
Warner, the editor of famous magazine called Toilet Suck.

816
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,840
I'm sure you've heard of it.

817
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:02,400
Out of New Jersey, Toilet Suck is a fantastic cultural artifact.

818
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:10,960
And what we're playing right now, friends, is an album by this fellow.

819
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,680
It says,

820
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:20,660
The irritating sounds heard on this recording are not intended to be digested as reenactments of actual events.

821
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,740
Sounds based on personal activity.

822
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:28,720
Monsoon familiar mechanized calf Jesus.

823
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,840
And it is copyrighted.

824
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,200
The name of this tune is

825
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,980
The Manson Family Christmas.

826
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,040
Write.

827
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:53,480
Add.

828
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:58,580
Yeah.

829
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,660
Do all choices and immediately stop.

830
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,400
So let her with all my love,

831
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,520
say it from the what?

832
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:20,520


833
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:20,740


834
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:20,740


835
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:20,740


836
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,300
We're not going to die.

837
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,940
But we can't be going on this.

838
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,360
If we can't do, why is it?

839
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,740
Why do you have to sing them all the time?

840
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,700
It's just silk.

841
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,580
Dig, it's a game.

842
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,160
It's always been a game.

843
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,500
Shortly after Shady and I got new,

844
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,760
we should enjoy Creepy Coy's Lacta.

845
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,980
We have to let love happen.

846
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,560
Charlie is our love.

847
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,320
We are trying to love.

848
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:47,400
It's our one.

849
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,500
It's all happening now.

850
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,040
Listen to that beautiful

851
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,280
Charlie Manson Family Christmas.

852
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,000
Yes.

853
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:07,680
You know, those were different kind of family values,

854
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,160
I think, in those days.

855
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,060
But who says the 60s can't live again here in the 80s?

856
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,940
And now, your local multinational corporation

857
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,740
presents...

858
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,700
some energy-saving holiday tips from Mr. Abernathy.

859
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:29,780
Hello.

860
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,300
Your local multinational corporation has sent me to this remote point in Australia to prove

861
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:36,800
a point.

862
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,440
Conservation can be dangerous.

863
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:45,480
In this remote Aboriginal village just outside of Sydney, Australia, the natives were told

864
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:50,440
by their government to slow down in their consumption of gasoline and fossil fuels.

865
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:55,760
Unfortunately, the files in the government energy office on this town were lost.

866
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:01,740
So nobody bothered to tell them when it was OK to go back to normal energy use.

867
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,580
Sadly enough, this town has become the victim of what we call an energy surplus.

868
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:13,100
And the natives have been forced to convert many of their dishwashers, lawn mowers and

869
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:17,680
refrigerators into these homemade, energy-hungry miniature racing guards.

870
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,740
Boys and girls in the village between the ages of 18 and 20 are forced to use these energy-saving cars.

871
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:20,740


872
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:20,740


873
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,020
The village's owners, who are now in their 20s, must stay behind the wheels of these

874
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:30,220
primitive, high-speed and dangerous machines for up to 90 hours at a stretch, just so their

875
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:34,620
village can receive the next fuel shipment from their local multinational distributor.

876
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:40,980
And we'll keep on shipping at our usual rates, just so this little village can meet and surpass

877
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,440
its energy quota.

878
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:47,680
And to think, it's all because they kept lights off when it didn't have to be convenient.

879
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,740
This holiday season, why not turn on the lights?

880
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:54,760
Turn on all the lights in your house and keep them on for the rest of the year.

881
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:59,000
Maybe you'll make the load a little lighter on us here at Multinational.

882
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,600
And a winter reminder, citizens.

883
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:06,100
Carbon monoxide, the silent winter killer, lurks everywhere.

884
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:12,640
So if you have a gas stove, oil burner or open flame, make sure all the doors and windows

885
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,700
in the room are tightly sealed so that none of that nasty carbon monoxide can sneak in.

886
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,540
Thanks and happy holidays.

887
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:20,720
This is NewsHour.

888
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,680
I'm Mr. Abernathy, signing off from your town to you.

889
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,420
Scott, you made your choice.

890
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,980
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.

891
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:48,680
And to your eternal soul, you have found that only could you afford to give to God that

892
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,400
which was his.

893
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,600
But you could not afford to do otherwise.

894
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,940
The Senate still stands.

895
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:03,700
And as the leaves, into outer darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.

896
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:07,180
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir.

897
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:09,540
I don't want to go to hell, sir.

898
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,740
Sir, no, no.

899
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:15,080
Thank God I don't want to go to hell.

900
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,600
No.

901
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,380
No.

902
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:32,500
I await authority's pardon.

903
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:38,040
I don't know until tomorrow!

904
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:38,920
Oh, yeah, you bet I do.

905
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:39,460
Thank God.

906
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,760
a self-addressed stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready?

907
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:49,760
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

908
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:57,640
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

909
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,820
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

910
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,620
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

911
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:20,400
Just like the ones I used to know

912
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:26,340
Where the treetops glisten and children listen

913
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:30,580
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

914
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:36,520
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

915
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,440
With every Christmas card in my pocket

916
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:40,200
I write

917
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,120
May your days be merry and bright

918
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:50,360
And may all your Christmases be white

919
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,720
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

920
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,880
With every Christmas card I write

921
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:24,280
May your days be merry and bright

922
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:30,080
And may all your Christmases

923
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,440
All your Christmases

924
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,060
All your Christmases

925
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:37,020
All your Christmases

926
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,440
May all your Christmases be white

927
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:45,260
All your Christmases be white

928
01:02:49,140 --> 01:03:09,140
One, two, three.

929
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:14,340
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

930
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:18,380
Praise Bob and Merry X-mas.

931
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:22,700
California oranges, Texas cactus,

932
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,720
We think you need a little more practice,

933
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:30,200
Throw them in the graveyard, cover up their feet.

934
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,260
JR Bob Dobbs can't be beat, yay!

935
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,060
Oh
