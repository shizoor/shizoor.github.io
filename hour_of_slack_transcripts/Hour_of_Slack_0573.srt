1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
Now proper time has come for massive change.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,600
Ring, ring, ring, swap.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,360
Jai Shri Guru Narayana, Om Shri Guru Gaino Ma.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,140
Ring, ring, ring, swap.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,580
I don't know how you came by this record,

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,940
but you are now embarked upon a journey

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,780
that must certainly lead you to change your life forever.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,340
If you were never a special person,

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,300
you are a special person now.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,060
Hello, seeker.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,880
Now don't feel alone here in the new age

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,740
because there's a seeker born every minute.

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,020
Yes, I'm Dr. Happy Harry Cox,

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,360
and call me happy because I am.

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,960
Because you're listening to another

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,700
in a series of my mind-breaking records.

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,580
The Genius Hour of Swag.

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,580
An hour?

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,760
I can't wait another hour.

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,020
What's keeping that stupid?

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,900
I mean, there it is.

22
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,180
This is a very exciting time for us.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,620
Who is us?

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,880
I'm Doe, for starters.

25
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:09,860
Doe!

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,620
No, no, no.

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,880
We said wait for the comment.

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,360
Hail Bob.

29
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,920
Do not shed your containers until X-Day.

30
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:27,940
Stay in your containers until 7 a.m. July 5th, 1990.

31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,200
That is all.

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,320
I was right about the comet.

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,480
Get them and see why.

34
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,620
What's everyone so worked up about?

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,980
So there's a comet.

36
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,980
Big deal.

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,960
It'll burn up in our atmosphere,

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,560
and what's ever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head.

39
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,080
When the sun set,

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,420
and the earth lay dark in the depth of night,

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,520
primitive man gazed into the firmament,

42
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,460
and wondered with awe

43
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,280
of what the heavens had done.

44
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,600
And the heavens contained.

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,280
Countless points of light dazzled his mind with godly grace.

46
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,760
A thousand points of light.

47
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,040
And yet, what light kindles these illumined torches?

48
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,160
Fires kept burning by an all-powerful deity?

49
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,480
Lord Bob's light.

50
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,460
Then, as the earth revolves about the sun,

51
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,040
she became host to a visitor's ship.

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Oh, there goes the camera.

53
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,140
A traveling star.

54
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,140
That's much better.

55
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,960
Voyaging from a planet called Lemuria.

56
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,540
Eleven astronauts came as cosmic messengers,

57
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,240
headed by the one Uriel,

58
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,300
to enlighten the earthman of his destiny,

59
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,040
and awaken within him the wonders of the universe.

60
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,380
We're doomed!

61
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,820
It's times like this I wish I were a religious man.

62
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,000
It's all over, people!

63
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,840
We don't have a prayer!

64
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:55,680
Ahhh!

65
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,280
Take me off to the moon!

66
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,060
Take me off to space!

67
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,140
Take me off to space!

68
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,200
Come on down, you saucer man,

69
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,020
and take me off to space!

70
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,540
Take me off to space!

71
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,900
Take me off to space!

72
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,880
Come on down, you saucer man,

73
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,700
and take me off to space!

74
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,580
Go back out of the holodeck to reality.

75
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,580
To be with, you know, the other members on the craft.

76
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,380
Oh my god.

77
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,420
Spates aliens.

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,360
Don't eat me!

79
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,080
I have a wife and kids!

80
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,820
Eat them!

81
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,360
Silence!

82
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,920
We are travelers from a certain nearby ringed planet

83
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,680
whose name we prefer not to mention.

84
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,400
My name is Kang.

85
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,880
And this is my sister, Kodos.

86
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,700
Hello.

87
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,460
I suppose you want to probe me.

88
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,380
Well, may as well get it over with.

89
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,480
There's little needles in my belly

90
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,740
They slant up my skin

91
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,080
I don't care as long as I can live with saucer man

92
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,120
I know that you don't take a quest

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,740
But I'm a special police

94
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,560
Come on down, you saucer man

95
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,220
And take me off to space!

96
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,460
Stop.

97
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,360
We have reached the limits of what rectal probing can teach us.

98
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,180
This is a mission of conquest.

99
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,060
Take us to your leader.

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,080
It's sickening.

101
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,700
It's shocking.

102
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,500
I think it's important that we get as many facts as we can about this

103
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,340
and try to determine what in fact motivated those people.

104
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,360
And what all of us can do to make sure that there aren't other people thinking in that same way out there in our country

105
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:42,980
that aren't so isolated that they can create a world for themselves that may justify that kind of thing.

106
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,100
It's very troubling to me.

107
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,620
That's slick Willy for you. Always with the smooth talk.

108
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,920
Take the little package of pudding. Eat a couple of teaspoons.

109
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,020
Make room to put the medicine in and stir it.

110
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,220
Release the fats.

111
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,620
And then eat it quickly. Drink this vodka mixture which they apparently had mixed up.

112
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,540
And then lay back and rest quietly.

113
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,780
There's a lot of speculation out there regarding other groups, similar groups that do similar acts.

114
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,520
We can't tie those in at this point.

115
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:19,100
As the investigation proceeded, we developed new information.

116
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,580
We didn't have that information available to us at the time.

117
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,500
So now we want to go back and close those doors.

118
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,200
Are you here doing the act?

119
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,740
This gentleman here in the gray shirt.

120
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,600
What's your name?

121
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,760
The castrations that you're referring to, did you tell us if they're recent or...

122
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,800
That's when we knew it wasn't some genius.

123
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,100
The question was about the castrations, how recent they are or how old they are?

124
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,960
Hey, I had nothing to do with that.

125
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,120
Every one of the cult members said goodbye on that take.

126
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,480
They were very upbeat, very much in a good mood and very enthusiastic about what they described to be the next phase of their eternal lives.

127
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:03,240
And Sorka says that the group apparently believed that a UFO was hidden behind a Hale-Bopp comet and that it was coming to Earth to deliver them to Heaven.

128
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,820
Try to take the time to look at the information that T&O has brought that has been presented to you.

129
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:18,220
We know the media is going to do a hatchet job on us in the same way they do a hatchet job on practically every subject.

130
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,100
If the humans were told the truth about what goes on on this planet, they'd be shocked.

131
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,440
And wouldn't continue to do it.

132
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,460
And wouldn't continue to do it.

133
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,940
They'd continue in their 8 to 5 slavery and ignorance.

134
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,880
And I think I've probably covered that point well enough.

135
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:41,060
Again, these here are the most incredible individuals that I have the honor to spend time with.

136
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,380
Oooh, yeah.

137
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,220
And not just anyone could join.

138
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,960
You know, we want people to be totally dedicated to this thing.

139
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:54,780
You've got to give up whatever it is you're into, your job, your family, sell your house, whatever you have to do, just come on with us.

140
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,440
You know, we want people to be totally dedicated to this thing.

141
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,440


142
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,660
And there were a few people in Dallas that were seriously thinking about going with him.

143
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,500
They just made it sound so good it was going to be like going to heaven or something.

144
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,640
Very sweet. Great.

145
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,100
And I hope this is not the case, but remember with the order of the Solar Temple,

146
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,480
this was done simultaneously in Canada and in Switzerland.

147
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,920
So I'm hoping that they're not going to discover a house in Arizona and in New Mexico

148
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,860
where people have undergone the same sort of thing.

149
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,380
Interesting. Let's go now to Kurt, who joins us on the line from Tallahassee.

150
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,980
Yes. My head is reeling from the news of this.

151
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,980
This is the second incredible coincidence dealing with this other computer-linked cult,

152
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,800
which seemed to be in some sort of rivalry with this higher source.

153
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,040
And what is that other cult?

154
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,400
I think it's called, like I said, Genius or something.

155
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,100
And it has these incredible web pages.

156
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,520
I mean, just page after page after page.

157
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,160
And they take on these Christian-based cults,

158
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,840
especially the ones...

159
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,520
They have homepages, and we're predicting that in their religion,

160
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,220
there's going to be like a UFO invasion in 1998 in July or something.

161
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,720
And they were predicting that there would be this comet that would come by a year before

162
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,760
called Hail Bob.

163
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,460
And I read about this almost a half a year ago before this comet was even discovered,

164
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,800
that it wasn't called Hail Bob.

165
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,200
I guess this is the same comet.

166
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,120
They call it Hail Bob.

167
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,740
Well, it's named after the two people who discovered it.

168
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,260
Yes, I know.

169
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,700
And it was spelled differently, but it was kind of...

170
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,700
When I first saw that coincidence, I thought, boy, that's kind of funny,

171
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,520
because, you know, they said Hail Bob, and this is called Hail Bob.

172
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,080
What was the name of that group?

173
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,220
Well, it was called the Subgenius something or another,

174
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,120
the Church of the Subgenius or something like that.

175
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,740
And they predicted that when this comet would come by,

176
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,720
it would prove to the other Christian-based religions

177
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,880
that a year later, the actual UFOs would land.

178
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,140
And they predicted that these...

179
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,240
They warned these other cults that they should just kill themselves

180
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,060
before it happens,

181
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,320
because they were going to be enslaved or tortured

182
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,520
if they waited until the actual landings.

183
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,340
And I thought, you know, when I drove in...

184
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,940
Because I remember the entire source was one of the cults

185
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,720
that was specifically taunted about this.

186
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,000
And when I heard this title, I went, holy cow!

187
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,780
I mean, I can't believe that they would have actually taken their advice,

188
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,440
because, you know, that Hail Bob and Hail Bob is...

189
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,560
It wasn't exactly what they said it would be, but it was awfully close.

190
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,040
You have to be careful, because the Church of the Subgenius

191
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,180
is not a real group.

192
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,080
Well, they've got a tremendous website.

193
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,140
Hold on, Kurt, one at a time.

194
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,760
The Church of the Subgenius is an elaborate parody on religion

195
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,300
that's been put together by some very creative people

196
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,940
in the science fiction community.

197
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,660
Well, I had also heard, too, but I had also heard

198
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,820
that this was kind of...

199
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,420
That was sort of the facade that they did

200
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,880
so that nobody got after them,

201
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,160
because they've just got...

202
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,080
If you go into their website...

203
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,500
Kurt, can you hold on just a second, please?

204
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:51,900
Sure.

205
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,300
All right.

206
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,440
Let's go quickly to James in San Antonio, Texas.

207
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,780
Let's get off of that subgenius stuff.

208
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:57,900
James.

209
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:57,920
Hi.

210
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,380
Yeah.

211
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,760
Church of the Subgenius.

212
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,680
I just wanted to speak to the Church of the Subgenius.

213
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:01,980
Yeah.

214
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,200
That's not a cult.

215
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,520
That's a joke.

216
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,040
What?

217
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,700
I'm aware of that.

218
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,560
Oh, okay.

219
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,820
It's got a very funny-faced man

220
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,760
who fronts all of their stuff.

221
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,160
Bob Dobbs.

222
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,460
Bob Dobbs, yes.

223
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,500
No, they're no threat to anybody.

224
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:14,820
What?

225
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,500
I mean, except for people who hold...

226
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,200
And that might indeed be the reason it was Hail Bob?

227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,800
Right, exactly.

228
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,520
Uh-huh.

229
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,300
Okay.

230
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,020
Sure.

231
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,040
Thanks very much.

232
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,220
Sure.

233
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,680
Okay.

234
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:25,860
Bye.

235
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,440
Appreciate it.

236
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,800
Let's move on now to...

237
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,140
Oh, yes.

238
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,360
They always want to move on.

239
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,020
Harry, who joins us from Columbus, Ohio.

240
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:32,380
Yes, Harry.

241
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,660
Well, as a matter of fact,

242
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,740
this news report,

243
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,320
not exactly just in.

244
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,320
You'll forgive us for being a couple of weeks

245
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,480
behind the conspiracy news, dear friends.

246
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,260
But it...

247
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,940
And the fact that we don't have a...

248
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,300
Well...

249
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,040
The San Diego County District...

250
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,920
District Attorney's Office refused to confirm or deny rumors

251
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,800
that poison gas canisters traced to Texas

252
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,800
had been found at the scene of yesterday's

253
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,780
Rancho Santa Fe mass suicide.

254
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,640
Sources close to the investigation indicated

255
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,840
that pressure tanks labeled, quote,

256
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,780
Church Air, unquote,

257
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,760
had been found in the mansion

258
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,500
where 39 young computer programmers

259
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,200
apparently committed suicide.

260
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,320
One tank was reported to have a shipping tag

261
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,040
with a Texas return address.

262
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,500
There were also unconfirmed reports

263
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,040
of a handwritten note attached to the canisters.

264
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,340
A neighbor who asked not to be identified

265
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,900
said that the young men and women

266
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,480
who lived in the seven-bedroom house

267
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
addressed each other as bobbies

268
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,700
and spent many hours each day

269
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,060
hooked up to the Internet.

270
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,580
I think that's where they got all these crazy ideas,

271
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,800
another resident of the upscale neighborhood said.

272
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,640
Sometimes they said their leader

273
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,980
was a guy named Robert J. Dobbings

274
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,040
and that he was in San Diego, Ohio.

275
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,960
Sometimes they said he was in Southeast Asia

276
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,280
or Malaysia or someplace,

277
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,460
but then other times they stated

278
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,260
he had been assassinated by some guy from Texas.

279
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,920
The neighbors also said that the bobbies

280
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,840
claimed to have evidence of a vast conspiracy

281
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,520
involving huge corporations and the federal government.

282
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,120
They talked a lot about something they called the con,

283
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,280
but then they also talked about

284
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,960
a small group of old guys in Arkansas and Texas

285
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,420
who they claimed had tried to take over the church.

286
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,660
They were always saying about how they had to

287
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,900
rescue the church from some guy named Irwin Strong,

288
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,780
the neighbors said.

289
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,900
These bobbies figured that since this Strong or Strang guy

290
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,380
was so old and feeble that they could just

291
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,220
shove him out of the way and take over this nut cult

292
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,600
that he apparently runs out of some foundation

293
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,220
in Fort Worth or Austin,

294
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,880
a source close to the investigation said.

295
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,980
Looks like their plans may have hit a snap,

296
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,320
but they're not sure what they're doing.

297
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,320


298
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,320


299
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,200
Law enforcement officials would not confirm

300
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,140
that they were investigating a post office box address

301
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,240
in Fort Worth, Texas,

302
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,720
thought to be hometown of Irwin Strong.

303
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,260
The note attached to the gas canisters said in part,

304
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:06,720
quote,

305
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,800
have some real slack, boys and girls, unquote,

306
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,340
and is thought by investigators to have been written

307
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,700
in a code devised by the cult.

308
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,020
And well, I guess,

309
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,020


310
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,020


311
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,240
we just may have to see what happens

312
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,020
and what comes of all of this, don't you think, dear friends?

313
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,020
I think they're just beginning possibly to catch on,

314
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,180
they like to think.

315
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,320
Anyway, I sure hope all of this is working all right

316
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,060
because, friends, we're working on new tape decks

317
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,400
donated by Sister Friday Jones.

318
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,820
We're ranting on new microphones

319
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,840
and you can imagine, you can imagine

320
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,340
we've been slamming Heaven's Gate, dear friends.

321
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:52,820
Oh.

322
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,500
Yes.

323
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,720
We've been, them all, them kids,

324
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,100
them subgeniuses are out there swinging on that gate

325
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,940
to Heaven again and they're going to throw that thing off its hinges

326
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,800
and nobody's going to be able to get through it

327
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,740
and hell will fill up with the,

328
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,420
the dead will walk the earth and all that.

329
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,100
Okay?

330
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,640
Dang them subgeniuses.

331
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,560
Uh, yes.

332
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,760
And dang them subgeniuses indeed.

333
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,440
We're probably danged already.

334
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,000
Um, but I should give some credits here, dear friends.

335
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:29,120
We have been listening to, actually, I should say that this Hour of Slack

336
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,560
is produced by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang

337
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,460
and also Sister Susie the Floozy of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse

338
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,720
in WREK Atlanta.

339
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,320
The beautiful and voluptuous Sister Susie the Floozy

340
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,160
who actually does look about the way you would think.

341
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,260
Collage, did most of that amazing collage that we've been hearing

342
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,000
and we will hear plenty more of it.

343
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,800
Dear friends, you can be sure of that, uh,

344
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,820
from her, uh, show on WREK in Atlanta.

345
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,480
Praise Atlanta.

346
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,880
We're going to be doing a show in Atlanta May 10th.

347
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,420
I'll give you these instructions on that later on.

348
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,460
We're all going to quench suicide, drink vodka,

349
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,880
take the bat pudding antidote and it's going to be great, man.

350
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,680
But what we've been listening to, aside from, uh, the collage from Susie

351
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,060
and, uh, a little bit of stuff I recorded,

352
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,020
the stuff I recorded, friends, happened to feature,

353
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,920
uh, well, uh, at one point you heard, Rev,

354
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,880
my friend Emot Zipold of Cosmic Triad,

355
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,720
you hear him playing in the back, we'll hear more.

356
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,760
He was interviewed, he's a subgenius minister here,

357
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,560
was interviewed by local news because he had had some involvement

358
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,280
with that other cult, the rival cult,

359
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,520
and the call to, uh, talk to the nation, I believe it is.

360
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,900
It's an NPR talk show, very stuffed shirt, sort of clueless bunch.

361
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,800
Um, we had a lot of, a lot of people call us up,

362
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,220
email us about that, say, oh, there was this pink boy,

363
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,880
he was all concerned.

364
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,920
Friends, that was you hour of slack listeners will,

365
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,880
of course, recognize the voice of Father Joe Mama,

366
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,480
uh, a great, a great prankster, and, and yes,

367
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,500
it is sad and tragic and everything what happened to those,

368
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,560
those people, but, you know, I think it's time for me,

369
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,880
let's just go into the comparisons here.

370
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,620
I'll pull this background music down to a, a soft rug.

371
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,060
It's my, see, I don't have any,

372
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,880
I'm like a crazy,

373
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,940
little cult member here.

374
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,880
I don't have an engineer working with me.

375
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,520
Praise Bob.

376
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,780
But let's take a look at this.

377
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,680
Coincidence or conspiracy?

378
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,580
Heaven's Gate, a cult full of computer geeks on the internet.

379
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,160
Subgenius, cult full of computer geeks on the internet.

380
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,660
Heaven's Gate, been around since the 70s.

381
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,860
Subgenius, been around since the 70s.

382
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:52,860


383
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,200
Heaven's Gate, 39 gaily bedecked dead weirdos with bad haircuts.

384
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,200
Subgenius, 39,000 gaily bedecked live weirdos with bad haircuts.

385
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:11,340
Heaven's Gate follows Doe, aka, quote, Boe, unquote.

386
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:17,300
Subgenius follow Dobbs, aka, quote, Bob, unquote.

387
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,640
Them rival cultists, they just too lazy to add them extra letters

388
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,140
on the end of the cult leader names.

389
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,220
Heaven's Gate worships mysterious Peep.

390
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,580
Subgenius worship mysterious Pee.

391
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,080
Heaven's Gate, no slack.

392
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,740
Subgenius, on Slack.

393
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,640
Heaven's Gate, no drugs.

394
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,620
Subgenius, on drugs.

395
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,520
Heaven's Gate, no sex.

396
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,100
Subgenius, bonobo sex.

397
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,480
Heaven's Gate, believes that aliens will save them.

398
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:52,060
Subgenius believes that aliens will save them and destroy everyone else.

399
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,860
Heaven's Gate, no drugs.

400
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:52,860


401
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,400
Heaven's Gate cult compound reeks.

402
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,140
Subgenius cult compound reeks.

403
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,380
Heaven's Gate started in Texas by Texans.

404
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,260
Subgenius started in Texas by Texans.

405
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:10,500
Heaven's Gate designs websites for money, chants gibberish for slack.

406
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,700
Subgenius designs websites for slack, chants gibberish for money.

407
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:20,460
Heaven's Gate considers humans to be one level below the greys.

408
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:26,620
Subgenius agree, but consider the greys several levels below subgenii.

409
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,440
Heaven's Gate mixes sedatives and vodka.

410
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,700
Subgenius mix frop and reality and sedatives and vodka.

411
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,940
Subgenius says the end of the world comes July 5th, 1998, 7 o'clock a.m.

412
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,560
Heaven's Gate? Whoops.

413
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,400
Heaven's Gate left clear evidence for police.

414
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,960
Subgenius, in our case, puzzling evidence, left for the police.

415
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,720
Heaven's Gate, 39 people were involved in the entire cult suicide.

416
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:13,900
In the Church of the Subgenius, only 39 bothered to wake up for the cult suicide drill in one place.

417
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,540
Heaven's Gate stole a great list of keywords from the Zetterbergs.

418
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,140
Heaven's Gate is a reticulant website, and so did we.

419
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,900
We had that same great list of keywords.

420
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,820
Had them there for a year.

421
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,520
Friends, for all this time, we've been sapping off.

422
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,740
Anybody who was looking that would be lured to the Heaven's Gate site, this is during the last year.

423
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,180
Friends, we had the same keywords.

424
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,420
They had equal chance of landing on the Subgenius website.

425
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,500
Have you heard about any subgeniuses killing themselves?

426
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,760
Okay.

427
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,580
Heaven's Gate.

428
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,460
The leader says he's Jesus.

429
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,340
Well, I got news for those stupid cultists.

430
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,580
Our business manager actually is Jesus.

431
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,740
The Heaven's Gate people call pinks norms, and we call norms pinks.

432
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:06,580
In both Heaven's Gate and in Subgenius, Reverend Emot Zippel appeared on sleazy local news reports about the cult.

433
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,880
Now, how can that be?

434
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,400
Heaven's Gate people want to become greys.

435
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,080
Subgeniuses want to enslave the greys.

436
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,540
Heaven's Gate people want to enslave the greys.

437
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,780
Heaven's Gate website's VRML doesn't work, and neither does ours.

438
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:28,440
Heaven's Gate and the Church of the Subgenius are both hilariously funny and are both deadly serious.

439
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,200
Heaven's Gate followers ingest deadly poisonous pudding in order to die.

440
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:47,380
Subgeniuses endure deadly poisonous face-raping bat sperm from hideous barbed plunge down their throats.

441
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:00,580
Heaven's Gate annually injects over painkillers.

442
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:10,920
Subgenius behind başka Olden O'Sexes, who has caused this and many other redux,

Hosp lugares to strapsип for the

446
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:15,860


447
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:15,860

450
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,420
changes addresses and names constantly.

451
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,040
The Church of the Subgenius,

452
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,540
P.O. Box 140306,

453
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,780
Dallas, Texas 75214.

454
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,460
Heaven's Gate, male cultists,

455
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,560
have only one penis.

456
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,460
Subgenius, female cultists,

457
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,260
have multiple peni just in their collections.

458
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,420
Heaven's Gate refers to a Father John.

459
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,440
Subgenius Gate refers to Father John R. Hyperclots.

460
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,760
Heaven's Gate, total overcomers.

461
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,680
And Church of the Subgenius, overmancomers.

462
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,100
I gave you a friend,

463
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,980
we are going to fly away,

464
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,220
to the escape vessels of the sex goddesses,

465
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,720
but, friends, we are not like the poor cult zombies,

466
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,360
I mean, not really...

467
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,380
sure, they call pinks, norms,

468
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,500
just as we do,

469
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,520
although I bet in private they probably said Norm worms

470
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,300
or something more derogatory.

471
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,720
And they asked about casting off the meat Shell...

472
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,220
But only took parts!

473
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,140
Oh goodbye!

474
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,660
Goodbye there went the last of the...

475
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:50,240
But now, friends, I guess they found out the hard way

476
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,260
what we've been trying to tell people all this time,

477
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,980
which is that the greys are not your friends.

478
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
The kind of...

479
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,660
Sorry, the greys are not your friends.

480
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,960
Dobbs predicted that this comment would prove

481
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,640
that alien attackers were en route to enslave

482
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,760
all the non-believers who should indeed kill themselves

483
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,540
to escape gruesome torture.

484
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,200
And, of course, this so-called higher source

485
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,980
was specifically mentioned in the prediction.

486
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,740
But these geniuses, they thought they wanted...

487
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,600
They thought they were going to get to become greys.

488
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,740
They actually wanted to become greys.

489
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,540
Friends, that's like wanting to become a bug.

490
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,720
Now, seriously, if...

491
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,840
If at the X-Day drill this July 5th, 1997,

492
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,520
if we suggest that everybody...

493
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:47,800
Oh, lay down in a sort of a giant star pattern on the field

494
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,680
and put these cloths over your heads and, you know, just take a nap,

495
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,160
don't worry and don't get all excited if you hear strange noises.

496
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,840
We're probably just filming one of those funny, fake, you know,

497
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:05,320
Bobby's execution scenes like we did last year at the drill for the 7...

498
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,900
We like to send that footage to the 700 Club and just freak them out.

499
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,480
You know, that's all we're trying to do, friends.

500
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,420
But I'll tell you...

501
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,200
I will...

502
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,940
I must admit, when Jesus first heard the news on the radio

503
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,240
about a mass suicide of a house full of cult members,

504
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,880
all male, all dressed alike,

505
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,720
working at computers in rows

506
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,340
with a website full of aliens and flying saucers,

507
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,260
Jesus had his fingers crossed, friends,

508
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,680
that it was subgeniuses.

509
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,240
He really did.

510
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,420
He was praying to his father,

511
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,160
which, believe me, he rarely does,

512
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,520
that when they lifted those purple shrouds in front of the TV cameras,

513
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,000
that they'd find everybody wearing a Dobbs head t-shirt.

514
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,300
Now, friends, certainly death is tragic,

515
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,800
and I certainly wouldn't want to make fun of those dumbasses

516
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,480
if somebody else had done it to them,

517
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,060
but one must consider the good riddance factor.

518
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,840
You'd have to be a pretty spoiled, self-centered jerk to begin with

519
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,940
to feel so vastly superior to everyone else

520
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,060
that you'd even start to fall for this...

521
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,520
you know, this...

522
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:16,240
you are a mistreated god line of crap.

523
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,740
Present company excluded, of course.

524
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,160
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

525
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,480
Yes.

526
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,340
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

527
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,980
and before I go on any farther,

528
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,200
and we actually will get quite serious about this presently, friends,

529
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,500
I have to play...

530
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,720
is there time at the end of this side?

531
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,580
Perhaps?

532
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,460
Jehovah Hates Fred

533
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,440
in their cover version of that great old Denslow song

534
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,320
Take Me Off To...

535
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,120
Space.

536
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:42,520
Space.

537
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,140
Yes, thank you.

538
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:45,900
.

539
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,020
.

540
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,120
.

541
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,600
.

542
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:00,920
.

543
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:02,700
.

544
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:02,700


545
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,160
.

546
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,280
.

547
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:03,320
.

548
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:03,400
.

549
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:03,400


550
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:03,500
.

551
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:03,520
.

552
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:03,580
.

553
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:03,620
.

554
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:03,640
.

555
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:03,640


556
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,020
.

557
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,020


558
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,060
.

559
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,080
.

560
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,080


561
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,080


562
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,080


563
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,080


564
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080


565
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,700
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

566
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,440
Come on down, you saucerman, and take me off to space.

567
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,580
Stick needles in my belly, take samples of my skin.

568
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,300
I don't care so long as I can live with saucerman.

569
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,660
I know that you don't take quests, but I'm a special case.

570
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,740
So come on down, you saucerman, and take me off to space.

571
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,960
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

572
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,780
Come on down, you saucerman, and take me off to space.

573
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,640
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

574
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,580
Come on down, you saucerman, and take me off to space.

575
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,740
Hey cattle mule bladers, let me join your crew.

576
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,720
Give me a knife, you bet your life I'll cut up cows for you.

577
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,820
I don't care if you're some kind of fiend without a face.

578
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,680
So come on down, you saucerman, and take me off to space.

579
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,740
Take me off to space.

580
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,000
Take me off to space.

581
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,760
Come on down, you saucerman, and take me off to space.

582
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,860
Take me off to space.

583
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,640
Take me off to space.

584
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,920
Come on down, you saucerman, and take me off to space.

585
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,600
Take down your tiny robots with your little nipper claws.

586
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,760
You pale and bug-eyed aliens with wild and clammy paws.

587
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,680
Life is just a sucker's dream and death is a disgrace.

588
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,780
So come on down, you saucerman, and take me off to space.

589
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,780
Oh, take me off to space, take me off to space

590
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,740
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

591
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,780
Take me off to space, take me off to space

592
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,160
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

593
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,060
Yeah.

594
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,160
Yeah.

595
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,640
Oh, man.

596
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,920
Superior mutants.

597
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,840
Repent.

598
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,160
Quit your job.

599
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,380
Black off.

600
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:13,060
We may not be a joke, but if we're a joke, you can believe it.

601
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,760
Sid and Bob will have thousands of followers.

602
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,760
Sid and Bob will have thousands of followers.

603
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,860
Sid and Bob will have thousands of followers.

604
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,820
Sid and Bob will have thousands of followers.

605
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,840
Sid and Bob will have thousands of followers.

606
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,700
Sid and Bob will have thousands of followers.

607
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,860
Sid and Bob will have thousands of followers.

608
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,280
That's the world's only industrial cult.

609
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,360
We would like to take a minute.

610
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,360
Yeah, but there's been...

611
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,520
Or at least a few seconds.

612
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,140
In honor of our dearly departed 39 brothers and sisters.

613
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,240
I see the goddesses.

614
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,800
Although not members of the subgenius.

615
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,080
No.

616
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:57,040
For if they were members, they would know what dumbasses they really were.

617
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,660
No, Doug Wellman, I don't know what he is right now.

618
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,220
We don't object to what they've done.

619
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,260
We think they've just done it a little early.

620
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:16,260
We believe that the space vessels of the sex goddesses will return to this earth July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m.

621
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,640
What does it look like?

622
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,140
No, you do not.

623
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,140


624
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,260
You do not have to leave your flesh vessel.

625
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,720
The space ships will pick you up in your entirety.

626
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,960
Leave the plastic bags at home.

627
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,200
Yeah.

628
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,420
Please, no video cameras.

629
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,720
They will be destroyed at the door.

630
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,300
Take them to your car.

631
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,460
No audio tapes.

632
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,340
That must be the question.

633
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,140
We'll all be there?

634
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,660
All of them.

635
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,300
We're gonna sweep.

636
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,340
A priceless...

637
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,660
It will sweep across the earth at 7 a.m.

638
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,440
Which is great for us because we can watch the destruction on television.

639
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,960
We're gonna purchase tickets.

640
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Will Bob be there?

641
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,520
I'm the Prince of Truth.

642
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,220
Will Bob be there?

643
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,000
J.R. Bogdob.

644
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,460
Tickets are for sale.

645
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:02,500
Tickets are for sale?

646
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:02,500


647
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,620
Tickets are for sale.

648
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,060
That's a real nice shirt.

649
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:05,700
Thank you.

650
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,140
Am I getting royalties on that?

651
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,180
Um, actually, yeah, it's in the mail.

652
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:09,840
Oh, thank you.

653
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:14,060
I've been waiting for that royalty check for all the Jesus paraphernalia for a long time.

654
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,960
We're listening to Jesus' sermon to the line.

655
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,540
At the Survival Research Laboratory show in Austin last weekend.

656
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:32,660
Three cult members, by the way, had done SRL's website and were actually killed in the Survival Research Labs show.

657
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,540
And wonderful bug-attracting clothing.

658
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,300
This clothing not only has the beautiful image of Bob, but it's guaranteed to attract many in...

659
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,600
Oh, yes, it's true, dear friends.

660
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,840
I am a mocker.

661
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:56,340
I'm a mocker, and I am guilty of having made callous fun of the 39 dead geeks.

662
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:04,380
But you know their farewell statements on video beg us not to make a big deal out of how tragic it all is.

663
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,500
They went not only willingly, but eagerly.

664
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:15,080
And it has always been the mission of Bob's Church to get you to the punchline alive.

665
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,600
And we don't mean the Jonestown punchline.

666
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,720
You know, sure, we're waiting for the saucers, too.

667
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:29,140
But as Dr. Lecque put it, we're happy to wait at the corner for the bus with our quarters in our pockets.

668
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,080
We don't feel we have to jump out into the path of the oncoming bus.

669
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:41,120
And, you know, sure, we'll shed our containers in 450-some-odd days.

670
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,620
But when the pigs find our meat shells,

671
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:50,540
it'll be more like the 39,000 bodies were all wearing Timex wristwatches,

672
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,260
Reebok's shoes, Levi's jeans.

673
00:31:53,680 --> 00:32:01,360
Each had an unopened pack of Camel Light cigarettes and was clutching an empty Dr. Pepper can.

674
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,560
Dr. Grabow pipes were clenched in each dead jaw,

675
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:12,480
and Smith & Wesson revolvers had to be pried out of all their cold, dead fingers.

676
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,240
Ah, yes, friends, it's true. We do, we do indeed make fun.

677
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,580
But what I want to talk about right this minute, before we go back to the funny stuff,

678
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:29,560
I want to talk about the cult that makes Heaven's Gate look harmless.

679
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,460
And I ain't talking about Church of the Subgenius.

680
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:39,400
Because more disgusting than mockers like me, or dumbasses like the Heaven's Gate people,

681
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,600
are the pompous, pious, pink pigs.

682
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:52,520
pundits that are oozing out of every op-ed page and talk show, indulging in a veritable

683
00:32:52,520 --> 00:33:00,480
orgy of self-congratulation about how sane and normal they are and their good religion.

684
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:06,060
The really hip ones go, well, now, some will blame the internet, but I'm too cool to blame

685
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,480
the internet.

686
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,800
I'm on AOL now.

687
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,900
But, of course, the real cause is the breakdown of family values.

688
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,720
Blah, blah, woof, woof.

689
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:24,620
And the biggest difference between Heaven's Gate and mainstream Christianity, friends,

690
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,060
is that the Heaven's Gate people never tried to brainwash my kids.

691
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,500
They stayed out of my face.

692
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,980
If you were interested, you could look them up on the web.

693
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,780
The Heaven's Gate people didn't feel they had any interest in me.

694
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:38,780


695
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,900
They had to take over a dozen radio and TV stations here in Dallas alone.

696
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,540
They didn't have to have entire cable networks devoted to their particular superstition.

697
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,420
So they shunned sex.

698
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,280
Millions of Christians, called nuns, priests, and losers, are the same way.

699
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,180
So 39 of them killed themselves.

700
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,320
At least they didn't kill millions of non-believers.

701
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,780
Burn all them away.

702
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,960
They killed some witches, tortured free-thinkers, and so forth and so on.

703
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:17,920
So the cultists think some spaceship full of gods is gonna come save them.

704
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,600
Well, Christians, Jews, Muslims, and just about everybody else believes in an invisible

705
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:29,640
monster that will help you out if you kiss its almighty invisible butt.

706
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,660
And why do they believe all this?

707
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,180
Why?

708
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,960
Because they read it in a book.

709
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,760
Or some really sincere person told them.

710
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:38,760


711
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,340
And they're gonna tell them all about it.

712
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:46,020
And just listen to these pinks drone on and on and on, worse than I'm doing now, about

713
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:51,940
those poor deluded cultists as if they themselves were somehow any different.

714
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,540
And I'm not talking about Christian nuts like Bob Larson and Jerry Falwell.

715
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,440
I mean, you expect it from clowns like them.

716
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:08,640
I hardly need to comment on the... on Pat Robertson sitting there on the 700 Club playing with

717
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,640
little pumpkins and talking about how silly those cultists are.

718
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,900
I'm talking about your standard, everyday, middle-of-the-road commentator, your letters

719
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:24,320
to the editor-writer, your average good American God-fearing religious hypocrite.

720
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:33,460
They are every jot and tittle as vain and silly as Doe and his followers, and have caused

721
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,800
infinitely more trouble.

722
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,760
And now I have to put up with listening to their condescending garbage.

723
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:38,760


724
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:38,760


725
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,580
Every time I check the news.

726
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,620
While all it boils down to is this.

727
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,180
See, my invisible monster's bigger than your invisible monster.

728
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,300
Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.

729
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,480
My invisible monster didn't kill me.

730
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,800
He's a good invisible monster.

731
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,860
And all the rest of us normal people, we all believe in the same invisible monster.

732
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,240
Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.

733
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,660
Friends, the cultists make me sick.

734
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,720
But the normals make me sicker.

735
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,080
.

736
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:16,340
And as screwed up as those Heaven's Gate idiots were, oft times I think I'd rather be a dead

737
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,020
weirdo than a live normal.

738
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,060
Praise Hurf.

739
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,340
And I've said my piece.

740
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:25,680
There.

741
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,080
Let's go to Susie the Floozy's incredible, incredible show.

742
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,040
I have to remember to put Dolby on for this.

743
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,000
Take it off of Chrome.

744
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,580
Okay.

745
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,460
Let's see.

746
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,440
Yeah!

747
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,180
.

748
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,300
Oh, hey, seeker.

749
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:57,180
Is that a five dollar bill and a roll of quarters in your pocket, or are you just happy to see

750
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:57,480
me?

751
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,760
Hello.

752
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:05,580
I'm that starry-eyed little smartass irreverent Susie the Floozy, and let me point out that

753
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,760
I am not from that particular deranged city.

754
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:08,760


755
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,100
I am from the Sauter Cult that you think.

756
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,040
No.

757
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:18,940
I and Bob's Slacktime Funhouse here represent J.R. Bob Dobbs and his Church of the Subgenius.

758
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,500
Make a note of it.

759
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,140
Please make a note of it.

760
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:28,240
Oh, because it's getting to where you'll need a scorecard to keep track of all the lunatics

761
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,420
that are popping up.

762
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:35,360
All the insane developments of the past few days have dictated that I throw out the show

763
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,740
that I plan to do tonight and to labor all day long.

764
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:38,740


765
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:44,680
I'm going to do it today, intensively, desperately, to bring you seekers the cutting-edge, up-to-the-minute

766
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,880
truth that you deserve about what's going on right now.

767
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,480
Oh, hey, look.

768
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,500
Another eclipse.

769
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,300
Wow.

770
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,000
Ain't this some weather we're having lately?

771
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:02,280
Oh, but what about all the apocalyptic rhetoric on the news lately, seekers?

772
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,900
Doesn't it all sound a little too familiar?

773
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,720
Right down to the flying saucers and the flying saucers.

774
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,960
Oh, it smells like the Church of the Subgenius all over, but the names and the faces are

775
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,200
all wrong somehow.

776
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,820
Oh, yeah, it was a different deranged saucer cult, all right.

777
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,660
One in San Diego, not Dallas.

778
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:29,820
Oh, and to pull the magic flying carpet out from under the flus's high-heeled feet.

779
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:37,400
Oh, I was wrong, because it turned out to be a different San Diego-based deranged saucer

780
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,700
cult than I had thought.

781
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:38,700


782
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,100
Oh, I mean, what are the chances of that happening?

783
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,040
Oh, yes, silly me.

784
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:50,640
I thought it had to be a radical splinter group of saucer-nut acolytes of Ruth Norman

785
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,100
and her Unarius Foundation.

786
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,660
You know, the one in the thrift-storch suburb of El Cajon, California.

787
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,700
And I mean, hey, it was logical, since that old bat Uriel finally croaked a few years

788
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,580
back, and, oh, I knew they didn't stand a chance of holding together without that pink-haired

789
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:08,700
saucer.

790
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:08,700


791
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:08,700


792
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:08,700


793
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:08,700


794
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:08,700


795
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,220
I mean, I don't know if I can get that super-annuated old mummy figurehead from Liberace's trailer

796
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,680
part.

797
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,180
I mean, you just can't fake disco glitter style like that.

798
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,800
But dang, it seems like alien contact cults are popping up like cosmic crack houses.

799
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:33,080
Oh, haven't they given serious thought to what they're doing with their hilltop beacons

800
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,320
and shortwave signals?

801
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:40,560
Oh, at best, aliens might have as low a gag threshold for cosmic sweetness and light crap

802
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,560
as I do.

803
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:49,080
Or they might find out that Klaatu Barada Nikto means, hey, gort, rip off my head and suck

804
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,560
down my tasty sap.

805
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,460
Oh, but I guess that's for them to find out.

806
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,780
Anyway, the logical upshot of this is that there will be the inevitable, trendy suicide

807
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,620
vogue.

808
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,700
And, hey, I'm in favor of it.

809
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,020
Any way of winnowing down the horde, I always say.

810
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,540
But I'm afraid the side effect of this will be hard to predict.

811
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:11,540


812
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:19,720
Hopefully we'll be able to figure out the real brake envelope blame-less action that

813
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:19,960
the

814
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:19,980
The

815
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,420
The

816
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,960
Just another bunch of blathering, feel-good, newage alien huggers.

817
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,380
Ha! Ha!

818
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,340
Oh, you don't think so?

819
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,000
Just look at the current video poster,

820
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,280
Children for Off-Planet Migration.

821
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,720
Oh, those astro-loonies were talking like Christians.

822
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,180
And that Star Trek holodeck metaphor spouting guy

823
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,500
really pushed everybody's credibility over the edge.

824
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,880
Oh, and the best they had to offer as a leader

825
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,880
was the poor man's Dr. Tim, Marshall Applewhite.

826
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,700
Duh.

827
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,220
No Reverend Ivan Stang for them, no, sir.

828
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,940
And what's worse, no Bob.

829
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,600
They died without Bob, speakers.

830
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,860
You know, I do have to respect them

831
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,940
for trying to attain the level above human,

832
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,780
but, well, they're going about it the wrong way entirely.

833
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,080
I mean, Bob.

834
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,720
Bob won't make you give up your testicles.

835
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,540
Well, not both of them, anyway.

836
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,640
No, far from it.

837
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,080
The only surgery we usually do on our initiates

838
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,280
is just the routine opening of your third nostril,

839
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,280
but, oh, that's not real painful.

840
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,640
Well, not fatal, at any rate.

841
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,280
And after you recover from our rituals,

842
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,360
you can really use your equipment, if you know what I mean.

843
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,440
Unlike those tacky, publicity-grabbing,

844
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,060
fly-by-the-windows,

845
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,600
fly-by-the-windows,

846
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,420
fly-by-the-windows,

847
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:09,420


848
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,940
Oh, and you don't have to give anything up, seekers.

849
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,320
In fact, it's better for you

850
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,220
if you actually acquire more vices.

851
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:19,680
Oh.

852
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,920
Unlike those four saps out in California.

853
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,100
Oh, man.

854
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,420
I mean, once you cut off cigarettes,

855
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,280
and booze, and drugs, and sex, and testicles,

856
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,040
I guess suicide doesn't look too bad as a viable option.

857
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,700
Oh, yeah, we don't make subgeniuses commit ritual suicide.

858
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,080
Just ritual career suicide like me.

859
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,600
What's more, we offer eternal salvation or triple your money back.

860
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,540
And it's so simple.

861
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,700
You're not going to get a crick in your neck looking for the star of Barthlehem or anything.

862
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:06,840
All you have to do is have your subgenius membership card in your pocket come next day.

863
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,840
So write for your ticket off-planet and avoid the rush.

864
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:24,620
Write to Bob at P.O. Box 140-306-Dallas, Texas 75214.

865
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,160
And be sure to hail Bob, hail Bob, hail Bob.

866
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:50,660
We'll see you next time.

867
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,040
I'm sorry, babe, but that's not on our playlist.

868
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,720
And by the way, you sound great over the phone.

869
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,840
Anyway, if you give us your request, we'll be glad to play it for you, babe.

870
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,080
So let's hear it.

871
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,220
We are observing your earth.

872
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,460
Oh, listen, Mike, I'm sorry, babe, but we can't.

873
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,980
And we'd like to make.

874
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,020
I'm sorry, Mike, we.

875
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,140
A contact with you.

876
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:29,820
Baby.

877
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:30,360
Baby.

878
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,960
In your mind, you have capacity.

879
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,340
You know.

880
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:45,160
To tell a path messages through the vast unknown.

881
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,940
Please close your eyes and concentrate with every thought you think.

882
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:59,440
Upon the recitation, we're about to say.

883
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,220
Calling occupants of interplanetary.

884
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,660
Planetary crowd.

885
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:16,560
Calling occupants of interplanetary, most extraordinary craft.

886
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,620
Calling occupants of.

887
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:24,720
All.

888
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,300
I.

889
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:25,420


890
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,380
The.

891
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,220
Concentration.

892
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:36,820
Effective.

893
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:36,820


894
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,180
It's a gentle meditation

895
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,140
It's a totally different energy

896
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,120
Such a pain in the ear

897
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,480
I was just standing there

898
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,480
You as bones upon the other way

899
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,780
And you are not alone

900
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,720
And you are not alone

901
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,080
Remember it's true

902
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,880
I was just standing there

903
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,460
I was just standing there

904
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:29,460


905
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:44,580
tall, I was just standing, and really

906
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:44,860
tall, I was standing there

907
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,800
old and old, and when you got there

908
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,200
I was sitting there

909
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:47,700
I was sitting there

910
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:47,740
I was sitting there

911
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:52,460
I sat there

912
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,680
laughing over it

913
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:55,860


914
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,080
commerem

915
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:58,580
all that

916
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:58,840
thing

917
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,480
enga

918
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,700
because they cannot tell a lie.

919
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,060
Hey, hey.

920
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,640
Hey, oh, bop. Hey, oh, bop. Hey, oh, bop.

921
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,980
I wonder when we will be in the year 2000.

922
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,320
I think I'll be on the moon.

923
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,020
No!

924
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,240
We'll title this tape...

925
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,740
Uh, Planet Earth...

926
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,360
About to be recycled.

927
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,920
Your only chance to evacuate is to leave with us.

928
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,060
Write me here in my award-winning communication trailer.

929
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,340
Space Nyan, Blue Mouse Trailer Resort, Hellmouth, California.

930
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,700
Nyan 0666.

931
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,700
Dogs flew spaceships.

932
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,880
The Aztecs invented the vacations.

933
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,640
Men and women are the same sex.

934
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,500
Our forefathers took drugs.

935
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,580
Your brain is not the bomb.

936
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,480
Yes, that's right.

937
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,160
Everything you know is wrong.

938
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,060
Sounds fair.

939
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,660
Toodle-oo, everybody.

940
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,940
I'll scream when the comet gets here.

941
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,260
Oh, I'm coming with you, Nettie.

942
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,080
No, sweetheart.

943
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,660
You stay here because...

944
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:13,820
Okay.

945
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:14,920
Terrific news.

946
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:15,280
Yeah?

947
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,540
They told me it's all right to talk about them.

948
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,160
They did?

949
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,140
Now listen, they want contact with you.

950
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:20,880
With me?

951
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,160
Yeah, something's gonna happen.

952
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,000
Have you received any messages lately?

953
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,360
Oh, messages? No, not out here.

954
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,240
Oh, hey, on my message.

955
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:28,360
That's it.

956
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,200
On my phone.

957
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:29,800
My answer phone.

958
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:30,400
Yeah, okay.

959
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:31,920
You're well here.

960
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,140
I am so happy to see you this day.

961
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:40,260
At this time when you have such a vital and important decision to make.

962
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,860
So I have come to try to help you.

963
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,080
But that sounds intriguing, you know.

964
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:46,360
Sure.

965
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,040
Here I get the...

966
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,000
He couldn't be.

967
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,000
What a strange game.

968
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:49,560
Can he hear it?

969
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,000
This is it.

970
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,740
This is it, you know.

971
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:50,800
Hey, what's that?

972
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,480
This is it.

973
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,220
This is real gas music.

974
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,020
No, that's my...

975
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:54,940
That's my voice, though.

976
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,780
This is the seeker.

977
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,920
The truth speaker.

978
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:57,660
You know.

979
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,800
Okay, if this is them, I'll accept it.

980
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,520
You were right all along, but you know that, you know.

981
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,420
Oh, no, it's just...

982
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:02,960
We proved it.

983
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,720
Look, there's 13 of us.

984
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,660
Oh, Nino, I'm sorry.

985
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,520
It's this kid.

986
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,780
That's pretty strange, you know.

987
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,040
No, no, it's just a kid.

988
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,200
This kid is crazy.

989
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,340
He calls me all the time.

990
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,420
There's 13 seekers of us now, and we're all coming out on the heavenly bus.

991
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:12,620
Oh, yeah.

992
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,760
You want to go to the bus listing?

993
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,700
I gotta go.

994
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,300
He just really admires me and...

995
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:16,360
Seek out.

996
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:16,860
Seek out.

997
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,580
Yeah, yeah, okay.

998
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,420
Okay, that's not it.

999
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,340
Okay, now here it comes.

1000
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,520
Are you a friend of Jimmy Carter?

1001
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:22,960
Am I what?

1002
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,160
Are you a friend?

1003
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,180
Well, ladies, stop over here.

1004
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,480
I've, you know, been to his house a few times.

1005
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:36,280
Well, you know, Jimmy Carter says he's elected president by the international so-and-so,

1006
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,340
which means they are taking over a one-world government.

1007
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:40,780
Yeah.

1008
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,500
They blew one planet up.

1009
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:42,820
Yeah.

1010
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,160
The planet Maldek.

1011
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,400
They blew up Maldek?

1012
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,420
Well, all I have to say, you're full of .

1013
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:52,040
If I see you again, you won't be in the body.

1014
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:52,700
Really?

1015
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:52,940
Yeah.

1016
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,280
I've got friends, and I'm an American.

1017
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,960
She's waving her cane at me.

1018
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,040
Okay, take it easy there.

1019
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,340
They'll spoil it like they spoiled everything.

1020
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,280
Ladies and gentlemen, this is an official release of the White House.

1021
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:13,520
I quote, suddenly there was a threat to this world from some other species, from another

1022
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,840
planet outside in the universe.

1023
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,940
We would forget all the little local differences that we have in the world.

1024
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:30,960
We would leave our countries, and we would find out once and for all that we really are

1025
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,920
human beings.

1026
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,240
We're human beings!

1027
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:41,200
At this time, the Earthman has practically forgotten all about we brothers, for he has

1028
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:47,160
indeed succumbed to the dark forces of ego, lust, and materialism.

1029
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:52,920
For if you are not progressing upwards with we brothers of the light, you will never be

1030
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,680
able to see the light of the dark.

1031
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,100
Then you are regressing downwards with those of the dark.

1032
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:06,320
But we lighted once more, that within all man there exists a spark that truly wishes

1033
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,000
to grow and expand out from these dark old ways of the past.

1034
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,060
Sounds fair.

1035
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,560
I feel this good feeling within me, but I do not know why.

1036
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,580
Yes, dear brother.

1037
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:30,220
This good feeling is our love and understanding, which we bring from our world to you.

1038
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,120
What do you hear from the Red Planet Mars?

1039
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,800
What do you hear from space?

1040
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:04,440
I know that you're from the Red Planet Mars.

1041
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,080
Gee, it's great to meet you face to face to face to face to face.

1042
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,720
Report, Kirtley.

1043
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:16,260
The minerals you seek are at the bottom of Lake Timberlake.

1044
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,160
Good.

1045
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:21,120
We will need human slaves to begin mining immediately.

1046
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:21,560
All right, Kirtley.

1047
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:21,560


1048
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:21,560


1049
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:22,560
Slaves?

1050
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:29,600
With this planet as a mineral supply, we can easily dominate the entire galaxy.

1051
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,660
We've got to stop them.

1052
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,720
Daloco, Tambo.

1053
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,820
Good idea. You hide and I'll get them to come out.

1054
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,520
Dad, there you are. Here I come.

1055
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,220
Hi there.

1056
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:42,840
Susie.

1057
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,040
Dad!

1058
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:47,560
Susie!

1059
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,600
Zorad points his hand at him and suddenly,

1060
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,800
Wild Boy is engulfed by a yellow cloud and is frozen in place.

1061
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,180
Susie screams and backs away, but they see him.

1062
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:04,400
You heard me. They're alien replicants from beyond the moon.

1063
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,420
Yeah, right, pal.

1064
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:13,720
There comes a time in each man's life when he can't even believe his own eyes.

1065
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,240
Flying saucers seen over Hollywood.

1066
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,820
Flying saucers seen over Washington, D.C.

1067
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,500
Flying saucers, Captain, are still a rumor. Officially.

1068
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,760
Looks like we beat them off again, sir.

1069
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,780
What do they want? Where are they from? Where are they going?

1070
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,560
They, sir? Who?

1071
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,940
Now this is a training maneuver, sir.

1072
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,200
We only did a little practice firing at the clouds.

1073
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,660
Well, I don't want to sanction stupidity, as our national sport still I have to admire.

1074
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,180
This little man's dogged nerve and rubber determination.

1075
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:03,360
Yes, it's a small step for this square little fellow, but he's taking a big fall for all mankind.

1076
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:07,360
This is Pat Hatt here by the big hole at Pocked as Well outside Curio, Arizona.

1077
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,660
It's bound to bring out the curious and the kooky, don't you think, Ray?

1078
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:15,720
Well, it's brought a lot of experts to the area and increased activity in the Air Force from nearby.

1079
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,020
Ghost heart.

1080
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,520
And that's very good for the economy, as we all know.

1081
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,360
Good training for the boys.

1082
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,400
Mr. Suggins, did you see a flying saucer? Could you describe it to us, sir?

1083
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,320
Yes, I can.

1084
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:35,800
I was standing there, I was just putting them cement bags up there, and I seen this huge thing.

1085
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,320
It's all orange and red and green, a cigar-shaped oblong.

1086
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:46,560
And there's a face of some, my God, it's the most frightening thing I've ever seen in my life.

1087
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,480
Massive eyes and hair and tail.

1088
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,140
And I don't drink. I don't drink, really.

1089
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,980
Don't smoke. So I know that. I had my back on it. I seen that thing.

1090
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,440
I said, by God, you better not come near here.

1091
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,840
It's how cold-cocked you can do.

1092
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:07,000
Who could blame it for not wanting to stay?

1093
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,940
It wasn't made to feel very welcome.

1094
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,060
We laughed at its flying saucers.

1095
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,600
Who needed them?

1096
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,000
But it and all of us.

1097
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:20,600
All the other its tried so hard to get with us.

1098
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,100
To be liked for itself alone.

1099
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:28,200
It came from outer space with love in its heart.

1100
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,200
So sad.

1101
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:43,580
In this spiritual well of light and love, all the flowers and trees and brooks,

1102
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:47,040
they extend its love to you as you pass them by.

1103
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,940
It is a beautiful and happy and joyous way to live, Zan.

1104
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:57,880
And you would never want to return to your earth world of warring and hatred and resentment

1105
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:02,780
after you once had a peek into these beautiful worlds of ours, of the inner.

1106
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:10,020
And so we are offering you our hand of acceptance and of love.

1107
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,020
That you will come with us now.

1108
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:18,500
Make the decision that you are through with these fickle ways of reaction,

1109
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:22,980
resentment and all the undesirable traits of man.

1110
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:29,060
On these inner worlds of light and love, we do all things with our mind.

1111
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:34,640
We do not need to use our hands to earn our way and livelihood.

1112
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:41,160
And this is all part of a progressive evolution, which is now your opportunity.

1113
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,560
And that you must make the decision.

1114
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,340
And make the choice.

1115
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:51,880
For you can move forward on this ever-progressive evolutionary pathway

1116
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:57,660
with three brothers at your side, helping you in all your ways.

1117
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,420
Zan, you may feel as though you have many, many enemies.

1118
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,700
But you know there is only one true enemy.

1119
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:05,900
And that is...

1120
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,680
We're doomed!

1121
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,160
Boom!

1122
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,980
Will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet?

1123
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,480
It's going to be destroyed.

1124
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,420
Didn't you hear what that guy in the building said?

1125
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,900
But Dad, don't you think...

1126
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,520
Ah, Lisa.

1127
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:25,320
The whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time.

1128
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,420
Just like that rainforest scare a few years back.

1129
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,960
Our officials saw there was a problem and they fixed it, didn't they?

1130
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,440
No, Dad, I don't think...

1131
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,720
There's that word again.

1132
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,600
What do you think will be the next obstacle the Earth people will put in our way?

1133
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,780
Well, as long as they can think, we'll have our problems.

1134
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,300
But those whom we're using cannot think.

1135
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,600
They are the dead, brought to assimilated life by our electrodes guns.

1136
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,620
You know, it's an interesting thing when you consider

1137
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:57,900
the Earth people who can think are so frightened by those who cannot.

1138
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,120
The dead.

1139
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,560
They look to the water and see a diver in a wetsuit.

1140
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,580
He hands a burlap sack of ore to a man and a woman, who pass it stiffly to each other.

1141
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,340
They are both wearing pulsating green discs on the back of their necks.

1142
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:17,080
Finally, they pass the bag to Lucas, then to Susie, who drags it over to a pile of sacks where Thorpe and Zoran stand.

1143
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,260
This is the way they are going to get the minerals.

1144
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,440
Chrom-tach-mante, Susie.

1145
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,540
You're right. That's how they control them all.

1146
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,380
Get more containers.

1147
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,360
Do you have your report?

1148
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,560
We had to pull in here to Space Station 7 for a rejection.

1149
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:41,560
We're returning to the planet Earth immediately thereafter.

1150
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,780
What progress has been made?

1151
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,320
We contacted government officials.

1152
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,160
They refuse our existence.

1153
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:51,800
What plan will you follow now?

1154
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,080
Plan 9.

1155
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:56,340
It's been absolutely impossible to work through these Earth creatures.

1156
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,460
Their soul is to control.

1157
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,460
Plan 9.

1158
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:06,140
Ah, yes. Plan 9 deals with the resurrection of the dead.

1159
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,560
Long distance electrodes for them.

1160
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,360
The

1161
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,580
Uh...

1162
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,280
Let me say that...

1163
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,880
I spent a very brief time inside the residence.

1164
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:45,760
When I walked through there, I did not see the aliens.

1165
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:46,700
Uh...

1166
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,620
And that type of thing.

1167
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:49,420
And I say aliens.

1168
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:55,760
More than two, possibly three or four in various locations in the house.

1169
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:00,700
Minutes later, the police, led by Inspector Daniel Clay, arrived at the scene.

1170
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,220
Who found them?

1171
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,800
Man and girl.

1172
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,820
Medical examiner been around yet?

1173
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,180
Just left.

1174
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:10,520
The Morgwagon ought to be along most any time.

1175
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,620
Engine. Seekers everywhere.

1176
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,240
I was right.

1177
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,540
Everything I knew was wrong.

1178
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,220
Turn over this record right now and get ready for a real shocker.

1179
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,560
The most important revelation in my life.

1180
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:30,360
All you of Earth are idiots.

1181
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,820
You're stupid minds.

1182
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,160
Stupid. Stupid.

1183
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,800
What? We're idiots? Who are you calling?

1184
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:35,620
Get back!

1185
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,560
Alien bug.

1186
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,160
Yeah, friends. Uh...

1187
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,320
The editing in this, all of this was by Sister Susie the floozy.

1188
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,400
An incredible, incredible job.

1189
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:47,220
I never even got through all of it.

1190
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,860
It's going on and on in the background here.

1191
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,780
They're fighting and killing.

1192
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,220
But I can't stand that Star Trek music any longer.

1193
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:52,880
It's just insane.

1194
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,860
You've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1195
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:59,280
Praise Bob. Hail Bob. Hail Bob. Hail Bob.

1196
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:04,420
And that's post office box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1197
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:08,160
And that's the way almost everybody leaves their phone numbers on my message machine.

1198
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,360
And that's why I don't call anybody back.

1199
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:11,080
Thank y'all.

1200
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,400
...eater hell mouth and the low desert area.

1201
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:20,280
But thank you.
