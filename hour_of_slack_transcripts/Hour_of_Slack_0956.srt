1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,820
The average adult has between 40 and 50 billion fat cells.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,860
The average adult has lost 7 adult teeth and has 11 teeth filled by middle age.

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,240
The average adult has 2 to 3 respiratory infections each year.

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,740
The average adult has a bout of diarrhea about 4 times a year.

5
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,340
The average adult has about 9 milligrams of molybdenum concentrated mostly in the liver.

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,520
The average adult has approximately 6 pounds of skin.

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,220
We have no other income of respect.

8
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:51,220


9
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,520
The sub-genius hour of slag.

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,140
Sub-genius hour of slag.

11
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,360
Come on, let's go.

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,140
Come on, Fart.

13
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,280
All you ought to do is put a bullet through his head.

14
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,080
Nice job, buddy.

15
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,540
Poor little fella.

16
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,360
I'll see you tomorrow night.

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,480
Good night.

18
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,140
Mr.

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,080
What does it mean?

20
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,720
So what, Mr. Dobbs?

21
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,800
We're in shape for the finals.

22
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,760
No, really, Mr. Dobbs.

23
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,520
And by the way, Bob, just where is that long promised bucket of pills?

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,400
And tell me, Bob, what's this slack business?

25
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,320
Shouldn't the hierarchical slack holders be getting unearthly dividends on a regular basis by now?

26
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,240
Or is it just really too much fun?

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,300
Is there a war on here?

28
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,440
Well, there is a war on here, Bob.

29
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,500
And whatever happened to too much is always better than not enough.

30
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,260
Has there been inside trading in the Souls Repository in Dobbs Town?

31
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,120
Ah, come on, Bob.

32
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:30,860
Remember us?

33
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,680
Remember the old guys?

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,640
We used to sell frat mixture for you way back in the good old days.

35
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,960
We've heard the old Dobbs head snake oil routine before, Bob.

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,340
We know all about the bleeding head of AP.

37
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,620
But when will it come is what we want to know.

38
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,960
When shall the fabled luck plane tilt?

39
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:55,620
And when shall things at last begin to flow to all, all, all of us who, despite the perilous times in which we do live,

40
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,320
plead unto you still, Bob?

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,020
Next day is coming closer, Dobbs.

42
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,060
You haven't got all the time to the end of the world, have you?

43
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,780
Hadn't you better just get cracking, Mr. Dobbs?

44
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,120
Don't you think it's time to get your ass out of party mode and back up the crack?

45
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,180
What would you say to somebody else who is watching right now who had leukemia or some other type of cancer?

46
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,200
What would you say to them?

47
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,040
I would say, I'm feeling great.

48
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,040
Okay, well, I thank you for the cancer in Jesus' blood.

49
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,520
I want a pain pill.

50
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,720
And I pray right now for every cancer on my back for these past three years to be successful.

51
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,180
And tumors be in Jesus' left knee.

52
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,240
Every trace of cancer, I command you to come back.

53
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,020
No more life.

54
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,560
And Lord, I pray that your growth would be loosed in Sioux Falls.

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,240
7 p.m.

56
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm expecting tremendous heart surgery.

57
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,000
But also, they cannot find her kidneys.

58
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,000
They are gone.

59
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,720
This is VR News.

60
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,300
While some areas of Colorado have been hit by heavy horses this summer,

61
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,320
farmers in the southwestern part of the state say they're still suffering the effects of the dogs and pigs.

62
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,340
Some old-timers in the region crashed through a car windshield, killing hundreds of birds.

63
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,380
But the cats and alpacas are also the worst they've ever seen.

64
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,760
The state veterinarian suspects state health officials are pigs.

65
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,520
The Colorado State Patrol is blaming the state.

66
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,000
Farmers in the area say their yield this season is 5 to 10 dogs per herd.

67
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,620
Instead of the 40 or 50 dogs, they need to make public radio.

68
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,580
Okay.

69
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:38,400
Ah.

70
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,500
Uh.

71
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,880
Yes, dear friends.

72
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,320
Well, we have another Lee Marston.

73
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,120
More show intro.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,900
Good to have a bunch of unheard, uh, chop-ups there by Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,400
In fact, all of the above collages were by that worthy.

76
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,500
Except for the, uh, ranting by Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

77
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,280
Ranting there to Bob himself.

78
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,340
And more ranting is coming up, friends.

79
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,140
Now that we have a break in the devivals.

80
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,640
Until November, anyway.

81
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,220
When it's Amsterdam, Hamburg, and London.

82
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:25,860
Uh, we've had time, in the meantime, to, uh, uh, delve deep into the summer devival recordings.

83
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:33,200
Such as, uh, these, uh, ranters from the Cleveland show, uh, May 22nd at, uh, the Beachland Ballroom.

84
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,460
Starting here with the good Dr. Sinister.

85
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,260
Uh.

86
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,180
I'll tell you what I did when I found Bob.

87
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,560
I've killed him!

88
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,900
You know why?

89
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,500
Because you know what it comes down to?

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,600
Give me slack or kill me!

91
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,860
But here's the thing about Bob, alright.

92
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,380
He's the black hole of slack.

93
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,620
The mouth and the anus of the universe.

94
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,400
You want to talk about Alpha and Omega, you've got it right there.

95
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,800
You cannot give slack to Bob.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,420
He simply sucks it up.

97
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,920
But if they say, give me slack or kill me, you can't give slack.

98
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,660
You must kill him!

99
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,700
And so that is what I did.

100
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,400
But you know, it comes down to a lot more than that, you know.

101
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,620
I've heard a lot of talk about doing this and doing that.

102
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,000
But I am here to tell you right now that you are all sinners!

103
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,240
And you will all languish on Earth with the rest of the pinks.

104
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,600
It's true.

105
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,300
It's true.

106
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,820
We are all sinners.

107
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,300
And I am a sinner myself!

108
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,820
And I come here to tell you this.

109
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,620
I have a job.

110
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,280
I have a job.

111
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,720
I confess.

112
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,440
But you know what?

113
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,480
It's a job that gives slack.

114
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,160
It gives slack.

115
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,200
And I find that I don't have to do a thing.

116
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,180
In fact, one of the jobs that was given tonight by my employer, I issue not, my boss sent

117
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,120
me here with $20 to buy him a t-shirt with Bob's face on it.

118
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,100
And they don't even have one for sale with Bob's face featured prominently on it.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,280
My boss just lost $20.

120
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,400
That's what it comes down to.

121
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,720
But seriously, let me tell you how it will be!

122
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,440
There will be pleasure saucers.

123
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,240
There will be frop for free.

124
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,860
Because he is the slack man.

125
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,080
Oh yeah, he is the slack man.

126
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,140
And the Bobbies, they know their Yeti past.

127
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,660
And the pink boys, they are all aghast.

128
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,320
Because he is the slack man.

129
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,340
Oh yeah, he is the slack man.

130
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,800
And if you hate your job, well, fucking quit!

131
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,400
And if you've got no friends, you know, he's gonna...

132
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,000
He's gonna get your back, you know.

133
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,280
And if you're feeling down, you don't need smacking.

134
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,040
Because if you're down with that, you're right on track.

135
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,400
But the tables, they will turn around.

136
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,040
Because Planet X has just been found.

137
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,240
Because he's the slack man.

138
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,640
Oh yeah, he is the slack man.

139
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,760
And if you must die, here's what to do.

140
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,860
Jump in his pipe.

141
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,800
Let him smoke you.

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,720
Because he's the slack man.

143
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,960
Oh yeah, he's the slack man.

144
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,260
But I mean, forget about that.

145
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:17,740
I mean, seriously.

146
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:24,020
I mean, he was up here, and it took all my effort to not throw a bottle at him.

147
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,820
Because that motherfucker is sucking up all our slack.

148
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,320
And that guy with the Roman collar on before, he wasn't kidding.

149
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,660
I mean, Bob really is laughing at us.

150
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,100
And it's about time we laughed back.

151
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,820
And it's about time we did something back to him.

152
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,040
So when you see Bob on the street, kill him!

153
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,140
Kill him!

154
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,380
Kill him!

155
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,820
Kill him!

156
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,060
He'll live.

157
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,940
I mean, Jesus, he died and rose once.

158
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,940
How many times has Bob been killed by disgruntled subgenia?

159
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,160
We've lost count.

160
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,280
We've lost count.

161
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,740
And he's come back every time.

162
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,780
So kill Bob already.

163
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,740
Kill him!

164
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,340
He will live, and he will love you for it.

165
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,340
And you know what?

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,160
When he loves a subgenius, you know, he's asking to be let down because subgenius love

167
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,420
hurts.

168
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,380
Kill Bob!

169
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,740
Kill Bob!

170
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,180
Kill Bob!

171
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,860
Kill Bob!

172
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,400
Kill Bob!

173
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,060
Kill Bob!

174
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,640
Kill Bob!

175
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:38,640


176
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:38,640


177
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:38,640


178
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:38,640


179
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:38,640


180
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:38,640


181
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:38,700
Kill Bob!

182
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:38,700


183
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:38,700


184
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:38,760
Kill Bob!

185
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:38,760


186
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:38,760


187
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:38,760


188
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:38,760


189
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:38,800
Kill Bob!

190
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:38,800


191
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:38,800


192
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:38,800


193
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,300
Kill Bob!

194
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,300


195
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,880
Kill Bob!

196
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,420
Kill Bob!

197
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:40,800
Kill Bob!

198
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,620
Kill Bob!

199
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:55,640
The Electric Mind is one that can achieve a versatile, high-quality self-medication.

200
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,420
Oh, I was, uh, excuse me, I didn't realize you were going to open the door. I should have locked it.

201
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,980
Oh, well, um, now...

202
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,060
Oh, oh, oh, hold on, hold on.

203
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:14,060
You know, science doesn't acknowledge the existence of some of these transient phenomena.

204
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,160
After all, science must basically, uh, pick up a conservative position.

205
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,680
I mean, this machine, for years, and science says it doesn't even work,

206
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:33,520
and yet I found it to be greatly satisfying and pleasing to my alpha rhythms.

207
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Not only that, the, uh, yes.

208
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,900
The vibrations that get processed when the brain is in motion

209
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,120
is one that can only be reflected back upon oneself

210
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:54,240
with the proper polarity and reversal transmission migration, uh, um, mutated, uh, magnetic resonances.

211
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,820
Magnetic mutants? Getting you down?

212
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,500
Mutated.

213
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,580
Well, there's always one thing you can do about it.

214
00:10:59,620 --> 00:10:59,680
Magnetic resonances.

215
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,900
You can, uh...

216
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,120
We only use the word mutant.

217
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,580
Dispense these, um...

218
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,680
To apply to those...

219
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,520
Altered ones, let's call them.

220
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:06,620
Similar.

221
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,540
Less elaborate.

222
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,180
Who cluster around the more fortunate...

223
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,500
Nogahide.

224
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,980
...like magnetic monopoles in a cloud chamber.

225
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,240
What are we to do with this social solace?

226
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,300
It's a question we've asked since the beginning of time.

227
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,180
Are we going to sweep the problem under the societal rug?

228
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,620
Is it Nogahide or Corinthian leather?

229
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,740
Or perhaps use the societal vacuum cleaner in the societal closet

230
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,720
to suck up every particle of that which makes us uncomfortable or afraid?

231
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,600
Is it simulated Nogahide?

232
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,320
But some of us understand...

233
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,040
From where does that...

234
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,440
...the Nogah originate?

235
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,740
...all men are my brothers,

236
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,300
though I wouldn't want some of them to marry my sister?

237
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,220
And which...

238
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,260
Furthermore, it's not only humans...

239
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:47,380
...animal line does the Nogahide...

240
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,940
...to find themselves punctured by this predicament.

241
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,620
According to the latest scientific information,

242
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,280
male marmosets...

243
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,560
A Nogahide is related to the marmoset.

244
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,540
The Nogah, you say?

245
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,380
The Nogah.

246
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,900
It's related to the marmoset.

247
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,040
Nogah is the, uh, source of the Nogahide.

248
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,940
Nogahide, right.

249
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,420
Yes, that's right.

250
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,900
But I was speaking of, uh, male marmosets and their high approval of sex.

251
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,500
In other words, the realm of monkey love.

252
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,720
The mighty monkey.

253
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,900
Upon noticing the seductive, sexy scent of a female marmoset...

254
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,120
Did you know that if a marmoset was the size of a human

255
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,280
that it could lift its own body and a house?

256
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,660
A male marmoset doesn't pursue her mindlessly.

257
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,040
Male marmosets appear to think about...

258
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,280
not just react to what they're getting into...

259
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,660
just as people do.

260
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,340
Would they?

261
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,760
Well, they said that, but then their actions would belie their true intent.

262
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,020
Puzzling evidence, dear friends!

263
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,440
Uh, the puzzling evidence show that is with Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrummond

264
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,660
on KPFA there in Berkeley.

265
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,120
Uh, monstrous, monstrous, uh, m-metallic, uh, magnetic mutation.

266
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,660
And now...

267
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,020
And now...

268
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,340
We will move, uh, back into the Cleveland Devival.

269
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,980
And, uh, I actually, I've been...

270
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,900
I'm glad to finally be able to present this.

271
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,840
This poor fellow's been used to...

272
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,060
He's tried to do this rant over the phone sentence by sentence all last year.

273
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,740
And finally he got up on stage.

274
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,180
And we got a good recording of it.

275
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,540
Friends, I'm happy to present SpaceBuddy008.

276
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,360
Please allow me...

277
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,160
To introduce myself...

278
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,100
For your records...

279
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,020
For your files...

280
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,260
For your own good...

281
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,960
I am SpaceBuddy008.

282
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,460
Dolphin speaks.

283
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,540
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

284
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,620
Mutant rant.

285
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,000
Mutant rant.

286
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,700
Show em...

287
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,020

288
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,020
Er...

289
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,840
Oh...

290
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,940
Tributaries?

291
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,840
Anyone?

292
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,400
Ha, ha, ha...

293
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,480
Mainstream music radio.

294
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,580
Maddening musical mind control.

295
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,520
Midriffs.

296
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,160
Macho.

297
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,520
Millions for mediocrity.

298
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
Grammys for scammies.

299
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,780

370
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,380


371
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,380


372
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,380


373
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,380


374
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,380


375
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,380


376
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,380


377
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,380


378
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,380


379
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,520
Writer.

380
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:15,060
Now the truth is it's a crime-shaming cult that's creating a crappy culture, shut down

381
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,940
the cynical corporate Frankenstein, and break free the shackles of high mentalities.

382
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,960
The evolution of consciousness, son of a bitch, is a sacred imperative.

383
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,060
What's in?

384
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,140
Indie music.

385
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,920
Indie politics.

386
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,900
Independent film.

387
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,560
Indie media.

388
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
Indie me.

389
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,040
Indian medicine.

390
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:39,660
Listen, internet, cybercly, cyberbia, individuality, interest in other countries' cultures,

391
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:53,380
and primary religious, spiritual experience and energy dedicated to co-creating heaven on Gaia.

392
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:58,980
For in spite of reality monopolizers, elites, contraries hounding us,

393
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,100
we endangered species with our reality apertures fully opened,

394
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,740
know heaven is all around us.

395
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:14,540
We need critical mass of enlightenment so as to share it with everyone.

396
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:23,160
Born, skating, skiing, working, dancing, dying, living, changing.

397
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:30,600
Earthling, darling, earthling, being, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.

398
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,980
Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.

399
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:52,340
This is the hour, this is the hour.

400
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,040
But we're coming.

401
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:53,940
Revolution.

402
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,760
This is the hour, this is the hour.

403
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,060
But coming revolution.

404
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,660
Michigan and California, the spawning grounds for the revolutionary activities.

405
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,120
The White Panthers headquarters in Ann Arbor.

406
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,120
This is the hour, this is the hour.

407
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,280
But coming revolution.

408
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,520
This is the hour, this is the hour.

409
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,600
But coming revolution.

410
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,140
Students for a democratic society.

411
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,380
The White Panthers.

412
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,480
SDS class is seen.

413
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,960
We better do it now.

414
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,960
This is the hour, this is the hour.

415
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,600
But coming revolution.

416
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:53,360


417
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,360
This is the hour, this is the hour.

418
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,460
But coming revolution.

419
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,020
Every high school and college in the country will close with riots and sabotage.

420
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,900
Millions of young people will surge into the streets of every city.

421
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,880
Dancing, singing, smoking pot, and having sexual intercourse.

422
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,960
And of course, Bob Hope said, oh, just some college kids having fun.

423
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,420
This is the hour.

424
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,140
This is the hour.

425
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,720
And we're coming up on to it once again.

426
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,760
Our program is cultural revolution to a total as solar culture makes use of every tool,

427
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,000
every energy, every media we can get our hands on.

428
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,000
Our message is one and that is freedom.

429
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:52,280
For the first time in America, we have a generation of visionary maniac white mother country dope fiend rock and roll freaks.

430
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,220
We're ready to keep up.

431
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,340
We're ready to keep up.

432
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:53,340


433
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:53,340


434
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:53,340


435
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:00,140
the jams, all the jams, this is the hour of the coming revolution,

436
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,440
this is the hour of the coming revolution,

437
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:32,780
this is the hour of the coming revolution,

438
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,800
the program of total freedom for everyone, we are totally committed to carrying out our program,

439
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,120
we breathe revolution, we are LSD driven maniacs in the universe,

440
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,760
we'll do anything we can to drive people crazy out of their heads into their bodies,

441
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,280
this is the hour of the coming revolution,

442
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,820
this is the hour of the coming revolution,

443
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,500
this is the hour of the coming revolution,

444
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,560
this is the hour of the coming revolution,

445
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,960
we'd better do it now.

446
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,540
The jelly eaters did that, dear friends.

447
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,940
And now, let's get a little bit of Tiny Tim.

448
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,060
Oh, this is Santa Claus, saying I won't be around.

449
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,020
I won't be around this year. I'm a bit sick.

450
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,180
Santa Claus has got the AIDS this year,

451
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,700
and he won't be around to spread his Christmas cheer.

452
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,680
The reindeer all look blue, they know what he's going through.

453
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,220
Santa Claus has got the AIDS this year,

454
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,920
he won't be yelling out, ho, ho, ho, ho,

455
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,820
but he'll be screaming out, no, no, no, no.

456
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,620
He's lying sick in bed, call the doctor there instead.

457
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,180
Santa Claus has got the AIDS this year.

458
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,880
Each season he is full of pep and vim,

459
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,480
but now the AIDS have got the best of him.

460
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,120
Santa Claus has got the AIDS this year,

461
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,120


462
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,200
he's got the AIDS this year, he's got the AIDS this year.

463
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,560
The nurses all look sad, cause Santa's got it bad.

464
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,000
Santa Claus has got the AIDS this year.

465
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:15,220
Oh, this is Santa Claus saying I won't be here this year.

466
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,400
I'm sick in bed with the AIDS.

467
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,240
Oh, but I'll be back next year, next year.

468
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,280
Don't cry for me, a doctor will cure me.

469
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,620
There'll be no jingle bells upon his sleigh.

470
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,060
From everyone he's got to stay away.

471
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:41,240
Twelve months to wait and then he'll soon be round again,

472
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,840
but Santa Claus has got the AIDS this year.

473
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,980
Oh, I'll miss you all, but I'll see you next year.

474
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,360
Santa Claus has got the AIDS this year,

475
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,120
and he won't be here this year.

476
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,120


477
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,320
Santa Claus has got the AIDS this year.

478
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,920
He won't be round to spread his Christmas cheer.

479
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,560
The reindeer all look blue, yeah,

480
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,900
they know what he's going through.

481
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,400
But Santa Claus has got the AIDS this year.

482
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,560
There'll be no jingle bells upon his sleigh.

483
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,980
From everyone he's got to stay away.

484
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,100
Twelve months to wait and then he'll soon be round again,

485
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:38,700
but Santa Claus has got the AIDS this year.

486
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,340
I said Santa Claus has got the AIDS this year.

487
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,080
I said Santa Claus has got the AIDS this year.

488
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,400
Tiny Tim, dear friends.

489
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,080
And before that, there's a little news for you.

490
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,080


491
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,080


492
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,920
The Jelly Eaters.

493
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:06,560
Next up, let's just lose our minds with Dr. Howell

494
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:13,700
and Dr. Philodrum back here at that KPFA Berkeley Puzzling Evidence Show.

495
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,460
That's one for Ripley.

496
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,360
Okay, I'm ready to answer your question.

497
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,360


498
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,120
Sure, just lay it on me.

499
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,880
I'll give you the answer here.

500
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,340
Remember.

501
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,160
Yes.

502
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,780
He walks, he talks, he winks and whistles, and is just plain silly.

503
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,900
Oh, that, I, well, we've all known someone like that in our lifetimes.

504
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:45,600
He craves love, he sings songs, and has a great sense of humor.

505
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,560
Well, he sounds like a real nice guy.

506
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,200
Oh, yes.

507
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,300
Oh, yes, he's one of the best.

508
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,540
He has an on-off switch for hushing his endless chatter.

509
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:59,220
One of nature's norm and the salt of the earth.

510
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,780
Although the big switch in his back is cause for alarm, he might be erseth.

511
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,460
I have an on-off switch.

512
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:06,940
See?

513
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,980
Yes, you can cover it up now.

514
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,200
That's hideous.

515
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,420
Throw a towel over it.

516
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:10,660
That's hideous.

517
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,280
Look at the way the blind is.

518
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,400
Come on.

519
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,340
We could be pulled off the air for such an on-off.

520
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,020
That's an exhibition.

521
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,920
All right, there you go.

522
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,560
That's right.

523
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,520
Cover it with the towel.

524
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,380
And when I don't, you'll see.

525
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,180
We'll tie it back here.

526
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,220
I want you to make me better.

527
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,220
Okay.

528
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,520
Talk to me.

529
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:25,520


530
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:25,740
Stop it.

531
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,480
Come on.

532
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,360
That's ridiculous.

533
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,020
I'm Kobe, the interactive monkey bear.

534
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:38,100
You know, why don't you just take a stress pill and sit down and think this over.

535
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,880
I'm telling you the...

536
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,740
I'll ask the questions and you'll understand what your answers are supposed to be.

537
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,580
All right.

538
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,840
We can do it that way.

539
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,100
Sure.

540
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,420
Why not?

541
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,800
Here, put your face into the sleek stereo unit.

542
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,500
It does.

543
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,600
It looks sort of like nobody cleaned it the last time it was used.

544
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:07,140
It's time for your mind to unwind with Kobe, the swinging monkey bear.

545
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:21,440
He has a stereo color TV clock in his belly and everything he does shows his talent.

546
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,500
He can crow like a rooster and play the piano.

547
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,060
He can play the harp.

548
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:49,280
Endless hours of challenging fun bring Kobe to life once again for you and your children.

549
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,820
It's for the children.

550
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,480
Once again, Kobe.

551
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:55,480


552
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:55,480


553
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,440
Once again, this show brings it back to what we know.

554
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:10,220
That it's to protect the children from potentially harmful programming using the auto lock feature.

555
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,600
Dr. Howell and Philo Drummond.

556
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:20,640
I'll be seeing both of those fellows at X Day and on my escape vessels.

557
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,480
But now, let's go back in time for some radio synesthesia.

558
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,380
From WCSB Cleveland.

559
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,720
We're all running out of...

560
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,020
Oh, I'm not.

561
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,600
Running out of...

562
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:39,100
No, you know, actually, I can sit and lecture for days.

563
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,460
I'm sure you could.

564
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,460
I really could.

565
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,400
I can think of a bunch of things that would interest me.

566
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,840
Oh, gosh, just endlessly.

567
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:53,800
And the joy of lecturing on the radio and thinking, oh, they're not going to change the channels

568
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,640
because this is just so...

569
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,920
You know, they wouldn't rather listen to some kick-ass rock and roll or cool jazz or something.

570
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,900
No way.

571
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:09,520
My fine lecturing about science fiction movies and time control will certainly, and President Bush's evil deeds,

572
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,620
shall keep them hypnotized.

573
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,760
That and my goatee.

574
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,780
You know, I think we could make a very, very long album.

575
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,120
24 hours long or something like that.

576
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,340
24 hour marathon of...

577
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,960
The album no one bought by the big...

578
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,420
Weird imagine.

579
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,420
By Hot Air and the Balloons.

580
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,920
The album that dare not speak its title.

581
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,020
The Bull-loons.

582
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,560
Well, there was a...

583
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:44,380
There is a song, you know, that never dies and maybe this is part of that song.

584
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,680
This is...

585
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,420
It's just...

586
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,120
It became a spoken word piece for a little while.

587
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,160
Ah, yes.

588
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,000
The song that doesn't end.

589
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,160
It disguised itself.

590
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,660
It disguised itself as a spoken word piece in order to escape its tormentors.

591
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:01,500
But the song that would never die will survive in whatever form it must take.

592
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,640
Even if it has to take over some random college radio show mixed with an IRC lock.

593
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,300
The song will sneak between the cracks and keep going.

594
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:10,860
Just like water.

595
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,520
No matter how many drummers fall by the wayside.

596
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,200
No matter how many guitar strings break and guitarist's nervous systems go out.

597
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,320
No matter how many radio station executives are put in line.

598
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,740
No matter how many people are in the hospital.

599
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,440
The song will somehow go on.

600
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,900
The song that cannot end.

601
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,980
And the baby keeps burping.

602
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,640
And this is not the end.

603
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:38,060
Our grandfathers talked of the turmoil caused by the song in the old days.

604
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:47,880
And they talked of that with a glimmer of nostalgia in their eyes because then the song was almost pleasing to the ear.

605
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,320
We're gonna take one more call here.

606
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,540
You're on the air.

607
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,120
This song has a modern song.

608
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,100
It's heard here.

609
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,640
Hello, you're on the air.

610
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,900
Yes, Stan spoke earlier of time control.

611
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,460
I had another anecdote.

612
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,420
Well, earlier from your point of view.

613
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,240
Exactly.

614
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,400
Exactly.

615
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,600
Or somebody's point of view.

616
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,900
I'm not sure whose point of view really it was.

617
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,800
It was someone's view because I was floating out in space.

618
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,480
But that's not really relevant now.

619
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,800
The reason that I felt the need to incur some long distance charge is to call back in.

620
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:22,920
I had another anecdote that I thought that you're listening populist really ought to hear.

621
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:29,080
And the thing is, is that I recently purchased a clock and hung it up on the wall.

622
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,160
And it was a subgenius time control clock with the wings of slack featured upon it.

623
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:34,900
Oh, really?

624
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,600
Oh, yes.

625
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,640
I've got one with Bob and Connie on them in my bathroom.

626
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,180
Yeah, we know about your preferences, Stan.

627
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:47,000
But once I was looking at the clock, I found that now and again it would skip.

628
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
The second hand would tick and tick and tick and then stop.

629
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,320
Mine does that too.

630
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,340
And then tick again and tick and stop.

631
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:03,100
And I was certain that since I had paid my $30 to Bob and become Reverend Vertigo instead of merely Vertigo,

632
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,500
that I had certainly attained the gift of time control.

633
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:12,640
But it turned out that the inferior made in China battery that Cafe Press included with the clock was faulty.

634
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,700
Oh, is that all it is, the battery?

635
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,380
Yeah.

636
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:15,940
Oh, thank God.

637
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,880
It was telling the time and date of my death.

638
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,360
Running backwards?

639
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,440
I figured that was what it was.

640
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,540
It was like it kept coming back for the same time, 1-12.

641
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,680
I was going, oh, God, it's telling me when I'm going to die.

642
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,640
What a relief.

643
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,260
Oh, it's just a Chinese battery.

644
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,700
Yeah, those are terrible batteries.

645
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,460
Well, it will show the time of your death, you know, twice a day.

646
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,880
Did you know Walmart will sell more than four camera batteries to anyone?

647
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,440
Don't remind me.

648
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,860
Because people might use them to make crystal meth.

649
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,260
The best thing to do is just to stop.

650
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:51,720
All the clocks that you have so that, you know, the odds of it showing the exact time of your death then get pretty slim.

651
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,260
When in doubt, just reboot.

652
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,220
It's not a bad law.

653
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,680
All down, start right back up.

654
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,220
It's not a bad law.

655
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,340
Chances are it will solve the whole problem.

656
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:05,400
But yes, once I put a good Duracell battery in there, then I've lost my powers of time control.

657
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:11,800
Okay, yeah, I've got the, now oddly enough, I have one of those Cafe Press subgenius clocks.

658
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,160
I have the one called the Hour of Slack Last Episode.

659
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,840
Bob finally came.

660
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,440
It's not a very pretty clock, but it's meaningful to me.

661
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:33,680
And it has kept perfect, ordinary time in sync with, you know, the network time of my working computers.

662
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:39,020
And yet the Bob and Connie clock is eternally in a now of 112.

663
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,880
And yet the second hand continues to tick.

664
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,140
But as you say, it'll do a few beats and we'll see.

665
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:45,920
And then it'll go from one place and stop.

666
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,460
And then do a, it's a strange dance of time.

667
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,640
Have you checked the battery?

668
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,460
Stephen Hawking would probably be able to.

669
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,320
Does it have that made in China power cell 400 or whatever that is?

670
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,480
That one still does, yeah.

671
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,720
The other ones I think have been replaced.

672
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,900
Well, you know, we pay those little Chinese children in cigarettes and candy.

673
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,340
I think that it may not be an issue with the battery's quality.

674
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:13,880
It may be that these Cafe Press batteries have some sort of, some sort of Yeti power within them.

675
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,700
Well.

676
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,160
You know, if it's something like that, it wouldn't be the batteries.

677
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,920
Believe it or not, it would be the artwork.

678
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:29,900
It would actually be the meme caused by the thing printed on the paper that's mounted behind the clock.

679
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:36,500
It's strange to see how that could affect something mechanical, but it actually is the artwork.

680
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,240
And the whatever.

681
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,620
So it's got some sort of field effect.

682
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,580
Put into the art by the subgenius artist.

683
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,160
Does it?

684
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,860
Maybe it tilts the luck plane or.

685
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,340
Right.

686
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:45,700
Exactly.

687
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,940
It's crappy with time.

688
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,640
I mean, ostensibly it's a time reader, but it really doesn't do that very well.

689
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,740
But as far as the luck plane goes, it's not bad for hints.

690
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,160
Hints as to which direction it's going.

691
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:05,020
Well, I'm standing close to the battery now, and I'm hoping that the luck plane will tilt in my direction.

692
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,160
And not be like hot lava.

693
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:13,040
I mean, the luck plane can go in your direction, but it's not always necessarily good luck.

694
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,760
You know, that's the part that we left out of the first two books.

695
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,360
Oh, man.

696
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,480
See, that's what you get when you don't read all those books.

697
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:19,780
Yeah.

698
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,740
Well, we forgot.

699
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,140
We meant to say, you know, we meant to make that disclaimer.

700
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,840
And there was a lot of little disclaimers we kind of forgot.

701
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,400
Well, at least we got the thing about the de-beaking tool and the prairie squid in there.

702
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,260
There'd be a lot of.

703
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,340
Yeah, I am really glad that you got that in there.

704
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,320
That saved my genitalia several times.

705
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,180
Huh?

706
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,680
The de-beaking of the prairie squid?

707
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah.

708
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,580
Oh, yeah.

709
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,480
Well, imagine if we hadn't mentioned that.

710
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,600
If we'd only mentioned the joys of the prairie squid.

711
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,080
I would be in the market for sexual reassignment, I think.

712
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,680
Is that the one that gives you monkey pox?

713
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,460
The old Dr. Sinister here might not have ever been born.

714
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,720
Oh, monkey pox.

715
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,800
Is that what the kids call it now?

716
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,740
His parents are old enough to have been castrated by poor prairie squid preparation.

717
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,020
That's right.

718
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,640
In fact, I was not born.

719
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,540
I was decanted.

720
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,140
Right.

721
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,760
Well, see, that might have actually happened for all we know.

722
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,380
And I was conceived in a petri dish as well.

723
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,560
It's lucky to be a doctor.

724
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:14,520
It's an immaculate conception and an immaculate delivery as well.

725
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,560
Well, the fun thing is that the vertigo is quite low here.

726
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,060
And Asperger's syndrome also, right?

727
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,300
My mom thinks I have Asperger's syndrome.

728
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:21,640
Hang up.

729
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,140
Oh.

730
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,380
He just, his time control went right down the drain.

731
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,920
It's horrible.

732
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,780
It's amazing.

733
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,160
And this is the amino acids.

734
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:38,920
Knowing that I could stop them at any point in time if I wanted to, but they were leading

735
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,040
me along a path.

736
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,600
And I just let myself go.

737
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,980
And all of a sudden, I reach this end of the path.

738
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,820
And it was very definite.

739
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:53,220
Do not eat the flesh of another living creature on your planet.

740
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,160
And I started thinking about that.

741
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,640
What is these superior forces from outer space?

742
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,860
Humans.

743
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:10,020
Well, if they did that, we could protest no more than, you know, we couldn't be the

744
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,020


745
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:15,980
protest because we eat the flesh of lower life forms on this planet. They, you know,

746
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,560
will be purposely, you know, moral in coming and eating us as life forms.

747
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,420
and

748
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,000
on

749
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,640
on

750
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,260
on

751
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:43,560
on

752
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,560
know

753
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,180
and

754
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,600
done

755
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:49,600


756
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,640
me

757
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,560
all

758
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,560
guitar solo

759
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,040
guitar solo

760
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,000
guitar solo

761
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,600
guitar solo

762
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,680
guitar solo

763
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,740
guitar solo

764
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:16,740


765
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,640
guitar solo

766
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,920
guitar solo

767
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,720
guitar solo

768
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,860
guitar solo

769
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,320
guitar solo

770
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,880
guitar solo

771
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:29,880


772
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:29,880


773
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,880
And friends, that was

774
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,000
the Amino Acids live at the

775
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,840

791
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,560

798
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,020
Someone walked over my grave

799
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,140
disturbing my sleep

800
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,820
www.subgenius.org

801
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,580
A sleep that I thought would last

www.subgenius.org

803
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,440

www.subgenius.org

806
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:57,800
Someone walked over my grave awakening me, awakening me and bringing me back to reality.

807
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:22,880
I walk now in a place that is filled with misery, caused by men in search of their sinful destiny.

808
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:27,780
I walk now in a place that is filled with misery, caused by men in search of their sinful destiny.

809
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:45,400
My friends I have known and family I have loved will have to answer to me, for they let someone walk over my grave awakening me.

810
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,220
Well, are you attending our lecture?

811
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,760
We're trying to...

812
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,340
...teach you all about the true meaning of Ex Day.

813
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,980
How each subgenius on Ex Day...

814
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,360
...should be led through his own...

815
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:13,420
So you've come to the graduation of the college at 8484425 in the 510 area code college of education.

816
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,720
As I look out on that sea of upturned eager young faces I...

817
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:27,440
...am overcome by who am I to tell you all exactly what you should do with your lives now that you are graduating from this great...

818
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,940
...prestigious university.

819
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:41,920
Much has been said, and perhaps even more has been written about that most enigmatic of young men, J.R. Beaver.

820
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,360
Yet the eager seeker after slack has no regrets.

821
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:48,880
8484425.

822
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:49,300
Behold the...

823
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,100
Yeah, this is J.R. Beaver.

824
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,660
...in the flood of information, revealed by the secret...

825
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:55,920
Here are the...

826
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,860
...agents' graduations.

827
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:57,400
...subscribes.

828
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,480
Indeed, the newly born...

829
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,060
Does the end of the world protest here?

830
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:01,860
...hold their noses...

831
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,240
...2002.

832
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:09,040
...leap in and experience total immersion in the dark, dodata pools of the church.

833
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:15,780
The secretions of the myriad-headed organism that is the body of Bob's holy tabernacle.

834
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:21,420
This hydra is usually hailed as the only slack-giving entity.

835
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,280
But are there no shortcuts?

836
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,620
Must one ingest...

837
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:26,840
...are no shortcuts.

838
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,120
...so many raw bits as to choke the philosophical self?

839
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,820
Nope, we don't have any shortcuts.

840
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,500
And then...

841
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,380
No shortcuts either.

842
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,240
...a violent dispersion of the spirit...

843
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,400
Here's the special ring.

844
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,060
No cart-shots.

845
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,820
Here's a special trophy.

846
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,260
And here's the special little midget.

847
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,860
...on indigestion, festering...

848
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,800
The midget that you get to take home with you.

849
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:46,820
...until one day...

850
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,300
That's a Michael Pepe.

851
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,580
...last of Cassius'...

852
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:55,540
The midget Michael Pepe that you can take home with you will be there, and yet you

853
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,840
don't know it, because...

854
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:56,840


855
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:56,840


856
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:56,840


857
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:56,840


858
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:56,840


859
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:56,840


860
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:56,840


861
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:56,840


862
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,940
...you lost your key to...

863
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,940
In fact, there is one super extra-size...

864
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:01,460
...Bob's Town.

865
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,880
...which permits the inquirer...

866
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,980
Your key to the front door of Bob's Town.

867
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:05,020


868
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:05,980
...so genius message...

869
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:11,460
...read quickly and queasily, uh, easily, uh, smoothly, and without any barriers,

870
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:11,940
or not.

871
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,320
...and without any barriers, or not.

872
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:24,920
...and without any barriers, or not.

873
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,820
...so genius message...

874
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:56,820


875
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:56,820


876
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,100
Thank you.

877
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,260
Thank you.

878
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,780
Thank you.

879
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,600
Thank you.

880
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,500
Thank you.

881
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,640
Thank you.

882
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,440
Thank you.

883
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,920
Thank you.

884
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,240
Thank you.

885
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,340
Thank you.

886
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,240
Thank you.

887
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,460
Thank you.

888
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,300
Thank you.

889
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,380
Bye-bye.

890
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,160
Take care.

891
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:31,180
nature, the mulching manure of the forest floor, where a man can fill his lungs and

892
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:37,100
unzip his pants and just, breathe and expel, wherever he pleases, freely. Free to breathe.

893
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:42,920
To breathe, to pee. How can Bob help us to ferret out the interstices of slack between

894
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:48,540
the pained animals? No answer. One shall come among you, and he shall unsheathe himself

895
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:55,040
and shall pay. And by that sign shall ye know him, for he is the one. Think about it. The

896
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:01,700
message is there. Not just anybody can achieve slack this way. Dobbs is beyond us. Just as

897
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:06,240
the excrement of Pharaoh was kneaded into herbs to make medicine, so Dobbs droppings

898
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,720
are mixed with the froppa mixtures. Bob's spore will fertilize anything. A woman can

899
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:17,180
get pregnant from stepping over a Bob dropping, even sitting on a toilet Bob has used. He

900
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:22,540
is so potent that merely the smell can make a woman pregnant. Bob's whole reason for the

Oh, that.

911
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,940
But you got through the game?

912
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,360
There was no strategy to do anything.

Welsh

926
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,620
pink souls. That makes me feel better. But I guess that's one of the pitfalls of sequels.

927
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:07,080
What the hell, we'll do it anyway. Just as volts are named after Professor Volt, so are

928
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:12,960
our units of measurement named after the subgeniuses who discovered them. Thus we have hyperclates

929
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:19,440
of confusion, palmers of hate, etc. Here, look at this lab report from Dobstown, Bobby

930
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:25,640
No. 5, his inebriation level was measured at 1.5 clevs, while his sex hurt index was

931
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:31,680
dropping rapidly down to 2.7 sterdas. We find this indicative that the nearness of the razor

932
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:37,240
blade incurred 4.7 megagordons of terror on the meter, which caused the scrotal sac to

933
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:44,240
retract. Give it 4 byrons on the bolded scale. Church devotion, Bobbyhood and obsequious subservience

934
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:49,420
are measured in elrons. Measurement itself is measured in mensless, and derision in

935
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:49,420


936
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,980
howls. There are core issues of delusion, welmans of defeddlement, contraires of sexiness,

937
00:56:55,340 --> 00:57:01,620
cannibites of truth, lies of euphoria, and so on. Like the formula E.M.C. 2, the image

938
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:07,200
of Bob expresses a natural relationship between you and the framework of the world. Just as

939
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,740
E equals M.C. 2, so does the symbol of Bob, by its very statement of who it is contain

940
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:18,320
those powers of Bob with which we all must deal. By looking at Bob's image, by the act

941
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,420
of registering that image, we can see that the image of Bob is a symbol of God.

942
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,260
By looking at Bob's image in your brain, slack is generated. That pattern of dots,

943
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,440
when placed, before a human scanning system, creates a certain number of fillets of slack,

944
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:34,180
like the isotropic radio signal, the sensitivity of the receiver to the slack spectrum is most

945
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:39,480
important. The Dobbs head TM helps seduce you into the state of mind whereby you can

946
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,260
conceive on how space might be folded. Were you just a little more evolved, or were you

947
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:49,420
inside a Dobbs head that has been folded? You won't be able to fold space, but you'll

948
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,660
be able to fold space. Your kids might be able to, if they are conceived, after you

949
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:58,180
had that experience. And the implications. That each line of bullshit, each reflection

950
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:03,440
going off in different, random directions, can all be perfectly valid, at least for the

951
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,000
dumbasses who don't know the difference. As long as they're paying the medicine man for

952
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,820
telling them what they want to hear, they'll be happy.
