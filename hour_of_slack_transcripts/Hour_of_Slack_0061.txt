Oh, that was a laid-back show.
Oh, it's not laid-back anymore!
Look out!
Whoa!
You are about to participate in a great adventure.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery
which reaches from the inner mind to...
The Soap Genius Hour of Slash!
Watch!
Welcome potential initiates,
and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.
Welcome to the Soap Genius Radio Ministry Hour of Slash,
sponsored by the Church of the Soap Genius.
Yes, I love you.
The Soap Genius Hour of Slash.
The track that you are about to listen to
is specially designed only to be played on radio station...
K-N-O-N.
And only in the city of...
Dallas, Texas.
Welcome, dear friend.
To the Soap Genius Hour of Slash.
I walked back up to the grassy knoll again
and started heading back down.
I left that group of wacky Zenos
and the gazebo and the Sodbusters Museum
and that wing-ding nut-flanger on the accordion.
Well, I just didn't know what to think, you know.
Coming up here, hanging around with the grass and the trees,
it's just natural,
but these people were talking different,
and I don't know.
I'm just interested in sitting around
and picking my nose and spitting and stuff like that,
and, well, it just made me think an awful lot.
Golly, my head got big,
and, well, I never knew I had so many ideas.
I began to think about writing,
or taking some pictures,
or getting a tape recorder or something,
and them things,
but, well, I know I didn't want to mess with them.
I just wanted to be natural, you know,
sitting out here with the old rocks
and watching the clouds roll by.
But that...
that old stranger with the accordion,
why, he made me feel a little different.
I...
I...
I kind of got excited,
and, well,
I liked it a little bit.
It never happened like that before.
Suddenly, I began to reflect on my whole life,
why it was like a rock or...
or a polka.
No, my life wasn't like a polka,
but here it was again,
and, God Almighty,
hiya, mister!
How are you?
How are you, fella?
Hello?
Uh, the only cult they want to talk about
is the Subgenius Foundation,
the Church of the Subgenius.
Doug Smith says we're different.
Doug's right, Virgil.
We are different, thanks to Jesus,
the Genetic Engineering Corporation of American States.
Mommy too?
Yep, the whole family.
Yay!
Everybody like us?
No, son, but we're working on it.
Round the clock!

drops to the ground.
The helicopter which plucked the reentry capsule out of the water.
It moved up, took off at fantastic speed at the at least 45 degrees angle and they just
disappeared between the stars.
During the debriefing which we always had after each combat mission, the officer who
was receiving this made a joke of it how many beer I had.
How many beer he had dear friends.
Ah yes.
Quiet down you little creatures of the night.
You've got a show to do.
Huh.
Oh dear friends this is Reverend Ivan Stang.
You're listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack on KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.
Hey Zaphod, our theory about Reverend Ann Leonard was just shot to hell the other night.
Friends I feel sorry for those of you who couldn't make it to the subgenius meeting
and for the people who didn't dare to come and...
see the reflection of themselves.
But it was very interesting the way that turned out.
You know we announced last week that there was going to be a meeting for people who wanted
to volunteer to help with KNON and the church of the subgenius specifically and we got like
30 people called Reverend Cecilia and asked directions and said they were going to come
and so forth.
But only half showed up.
And the mighty...
Reverend Cecilia who now dear friends is Popes, the Pope or Popestress of Dallas.
Popes Cecilia bowed down to her ye unworthy unclean ones for she is truly worthy.
She allowed us to have this meeting at her house, a meeting of subgeniuses who had never
in many cases had never laid eyes on another admitted quote subgenius unquote before in
their lives.
But it turned out quite interesting.
There was no real Bobbies.
It was real nice.
It was all folks that I think could give us a real hand and I haven't managed to sit down
and plot it all out on the big computer yet.
But oh yes we'll have places for you all in Dobbs Town dear friends.
Don't worry about that.
All of ye chosen who showed up.
It was just the meeting was just what you'd expect.
It was a at a seedy S&M bar in Oak Cliff full of demon worshippers.
And I'm sure you've heard of them.


Yes and you see you missed out on it.
Missed out on it.
Oh and there was a one young subgenius there gave me a Christmas a wonderful Christmas
present a sign professionally made sign that said Bulldada Time Control Laboratories is
subsidiary of the Church of the Subgenius.
Subgenius Foundation Incorporated.
And that was wonderful.
But you know when I put that sign up.
Bill know where the subgenius is.
The subgenius castle is on Swiss Avenue.
That guy now see that guy he was obviously CIA.
You can't fool Reverend Stan.
That was CIA but he was also a subgenius.
So it's OK if the CIA knows where we are.
But there's many of you out there who are thinking what's he doing in the jungle.
I thought this was a church.
And on top of that how come how come he's talking about this church and the subgenius.
What is that?
They say what are you?
What are you?
They chant.
They chant.
Wanting to know just what it is we're talking about.
And every 10 or 12 shows I play this lovely tape.
Three, two, and one.
Now to continue with the tape recording.
Superior mutants repent.
Quit your job.
Slack off.
The world ends now.
Tomorrow is tomorrow and you may die.
Well no probably not but whatever you do just keep listening.
Are we controlled by secret forces?
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?
Do people think you're strange?
Do you?
Then you may be on the right track.
Are you abnormal?
Then you are perfect.


Probably better than most people.
Yes your kind shall triumph.
Now at last the step by step process is revealed.
This is it.
The only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.
Having all the guilt but none of the sex.
Having intercourse with a beautiful live girl or damn near anything else.
You've bloody tried everything.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Learn to think big.
Develop the tricks of length extension.
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.
Stand erect for your own abnormality.
Mom is a way of life to millions.
Yet half of them don't even know it.
She's the one true living slack master with the spirit of the living.
She will know how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.
She is the one real shortcut to slack.
Now see another dimension on your TV.
Yes fear the stark fist of removal no longer.
Become physically attractive overnight.
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.
To explore new ways of going over the edge.
And coming right back.
To bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality. To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.
And channel them into an illusion of creativity.
That will fool normals and get you sex.
I don't believe you J.R.
Well, I did benefit from it of course.
But so did a whole bunch of old Dallas boys.
In other words you want to know, you want the government to know that you're in there to make money and to pay taxes.
Well we're already treading a pretty thin line Bill.
And I'm sure there's plenty of other things they'd love to get us for.
Just be, you know, well, I don't know whether we want to talk about the conspiracy on the air but...
Oh yeah, go right ahead.
This is the conspiracy, the one, the conspiracy behind the conspiracy.
Ah, the conspiracy to end all conspiracies maybe.
Well part of the church's goal is to wake people up to the fact that our lives are being controlled by forces.
Ah, the conspiracy to end all conspiracies maybe.
Well part of the church's goal is to wake people up to the fact that our lives are being controlled by forces.

Well okay, this light, as we were looking at it, both of us were watching the light,
and we thought anything just in, you know, in a split second it was suddenly,
this two-story, I'd say the diameter around thing, the height of this room.
Wow, you mean it was like a little bobbing?
Well it wasn't bobbing, as steady as this table if it were carried on a caterpillar, it was that steady.
And walking speed.
And the...
And the speed never changed.
It just suddenly got that...
It just suddenly was huge.
Yeah.
It gets really complex when you get into conspiracies, and we believe...
Um...
.
.
.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
Ha ha, have you two not gotten enough slack on the ropes of life?
This is Dr. Philodrumon speaking to you from on the road way out there,
somewhere where you nor your friends can even perceive.
Ha ha, yes, dear friends.
We're out here, you're out there, and we're thinking about you out there.
And about all the wonderful things that can be found when you find Bob.
I'm talking to you tonight about the only God, the one and only Bob, the church of the subgenius.
Praise Bob, praise Bob.
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a praise Bob?
Can I get a praise Bob?
Can I get an amen?
Can I get an amen?
Thank you children, thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

The purpose of the church.
What is the purpose of the church?
The purpose of the church is to have what?
Slack!
Can I hear that again?
I need more slack!
Can I get some slack?
Can I get some slack?
Can I get some slack?
World Without Slack, Chapter 3, by Lies.
The fightin' Jesus looked out over the bridge of the excessed battle saucer, Blood of Christ.
He looked and laughed.
He laughed and looked.
He looked and looked.
He laughed and laughed.
He was finally going to have his revenge on the natives of Dust Moat 89 AB.
Aboard Jesus' flagship, dozens of killer theologians, the shock priests, were busy at their weapons terminals.
On the power decks, the proper orgone cycles were being timed by mass fornications between the ritual crew and the cancer beings from Theta Z.
An invasion-ready state existed in the ship and the 900 others floating over the doomed planet Earth.
Jesus was in a psychopathically elated state.
His face resembled many of the perverts.
The universe icons, the humanoids of the Dust Moat, painted of him.
They prayed to these for the salvation of their souls.
As if they had any souls to save.
As if anyone would want to save them, which they didn't.
A whole disgusting religion now centered around his murder.
They had to gall to nail him up like a common criminal and then paint pictures of him enjoying it.
And they thought he loved them for it, that he was forgiving.
Oh, the anticipation.
He was sick to his stomach with glee.
He would show them the true face of pain and sin.
It had taken him 2,000 long years to return here.
And now he would pay them back for the scars he still carried in his hands.
Sweet stigmata.
Even the slightest thought of the scars made them glow red through his fists.
Through the boxing gloves.
The hold of the spacecraft was manned with angelic power.
The angels of light personally lent by Jehovah One.
They supervised the demon teams operating on all tangible destruction spectrums.
All in attack mode.
Nagas, Orzuma, Shiva, Horus, Aeons.
The dark bodies.
And at time and a half, too.
It was expensive to ravage a planet.
No matter.
The host of judgment.
That which comes had finally arrived.
And on Jesus's birthday.
What do you think, Dad?
His second in command, Jim Jones, stood by with the final attack coordinate, Codices.
A whole graphic map of Earth rotated slowly next to Jones in midair.
On its surface, grids of the natives' planetary defenses were lit up in green.
Ones, some depicting their pathetic communication structures in violet.
All in scale.
Quite pretty, actually.
A colorful net surrounded the sphere.
It would soon enough be dark.
These children wait for us below, Jesus.
We will walk among them and we will smile.
At your moment of choice, of course.
Jesus studied Jones' puffy, tired face in the pink glow of the neuron banks that ran around the walls of the mighty dreadnought and shuddered.
He was no stranger to resurrection of the undead.
But whoever had brought Jones around again had slipped up.
Something was missing.
Something else was added.
Something.
Jones had been forced on him by the Djinn bankers who had financed this angelic war fleet.
Damn them.
He never forgot the price they had demanded for this mercenary raiding fleet.
Jones' constant reminders of their influence and expectations irritated Jesus no end.
Not to mention the fact that he was a man of the world.
And the annoying habit Jones had copied from dogs.
The twisted creature insisted on smoking a pipe, even here near the sensitive nerve relays.
Jones might have been left dead a little too long.
He moved with a constant jerk and always poked at his throat.
He never removed his sunglasses and he still took massive injections of methamphetamines even though they no longer had any effect on his regenerated shell.
You know, Jimbo, said Jesus.
The best part is that they think there's an afterlife.
That's why they strung me up the first time.
They think like bugs down there.
I'm well aware of that, Commander.
It bothered Jones to be back on Earth so soon after his failure with the social programming research post he had been running there.
It wasn't really his fault.
The administration change at Central merely cut off the funding for it.
He was forced to abort the experiment.
Terminate.
I'm sorry.
There is a great deal of speculation about what is going to happen next.
The tape is ready now.
The lights have gone down just slightly.
The Mr. Science Lecture Series.
Volume 1, Number 1.
The Neutron.
Delivered by the Reverend Seth Deitch, First Church of Mr. Science, Boston.
Outside the realm of conspiracy science and in the clear light of the so-called forbidden sciences, we will find we have a far greater chance of understanding the true nature of the universe.
What the conspiracy feeds us under the guise of the most advanced system of natural philosophy is nothing but a complex sham.
A decoy to hide from us the true fact of how much bigger and more complex and nut-wrenchingly frightening a place the universe really is.
We are told about matter and energy and space and time as being either consistent realities governed by laws or as foggy abstracts that have no particular being outside of that of being convenient linguistic aids to make the whole thing easier to swallow.
We at the Temporal Management Research Society are the ones who are going to find out.
We are told that the
The Neutron.
The truth must now be told.
How it was covered up for so long would make a story intriguing enough for a separate book, but it's too involved to be told here.
The actual issue is that the Neutron is a mystery.
The issue at hand is the Neutron and its pivotal role in the management of the true cosmos.
In order to properly understand the following, it must first be made clear what actually constitutes an elementary particle.
The first of these basic particles is the electron, which has no mass but possesses a charge that is commonly described as possibly infinite, thus making it the fundamental unit of energy.
It and other related particles, i.e. positrons, photons, gravitons, etc.
acting in concert make up the Iacotismic field, which is responsible for holding everything that is anything together.
The second is the much rarer infinite mass particle, commonly called a black hole.
These particles, like the electrons, occupy no space, but the influence of a single particle can be felt at a much greater distance.
They often have event horizons many miles wide, beyond which not even light can escape.
The third fundamental particle is the Neutron.
The Neutron carries with it an infinite temporal capacity that makes it alter the rate and intensity and general quality of the passage through time of anything it touches.
The Neutron is very likely the rarest particle in this universe.
As far as we know, there might well be only one of them, though there could be as many as a few dozen without generating a dangerous concentration of Neutron phenomena.
The first segment of this report will deal with the Neutron phenomenon.
It will deal with the general implications of the Neutron in regards to existing ideas on the workings of the universe.
The second will concern the incredible potentialities of using the potent forces of the Neutron in time control research and in practical time control.
Section A
Just how fucking big everything really is.
What we know as the universe can be envisioned as a giant atom with the black hole acting as the nucleus,
and the Neutron or Neutrons acting as the electron cloud,
with the electrons providing the energy for the Neutron to drive us forward through time.
Just about everything else in the universe is just so much debris, cluttering up the works of things.
The fact that there is one such atom more than suggests the existence of others.
Section B
The Neutron has a corresponding antiparticle known as the tachyon,
which travels through time in a direction which we perceive as backwards,
so that to someone who is not in the know it will appear to exceed the speed of light.
The simple fact of the matter is that tachyons are extra universal Neutrons impinging on our universe at a different temporal angle.
These are the Neutrons of atom universes that ours is in compound with.
After this the atomic metaphor breaks down.

A six million year cycle will end in 1998.
Bob sees the world entering a new Aeon,
which in a few years will bring more wondrous and miraculous change,
and carnage, insanity, and destruction,
than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.
Bob brings a new destiny for us.
America, a time of
cataclysmic economic change
that will offer untold riches
and power to those in the
know, while billions
of deserving conspiracy
dupes fry
in hell on earth.
Uncontrolled thinking,
controlled by Bob,
will usher in a spiritual
rebrief and a cascade
of astounding mysteries,
supernatural
riches, and a
restoration of lost psychic
abilities that will
transform the lives of those
who dare to seek them
and pay for them.
That's right, you're lucky
to live in the end time.
Here's more money, Bob!
Wise up!
That's right, dear friends,
wise up.
And I must apologize there
for the choice of language used
at one point by Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger
there with the Church of Mr. Science.
I'm sorry, he cut in on our normal
broadcasting spectrum wavelength
here and inserted
that into our show.
That is not an official part of the
subgenius show. You did not hear
that.
It does not exist
technically as part
of the tapes that I chose to play.
I just
want you to know that, dear friends.
That's pretty important around here.
And I'll
probably get in
loads of serious
trouble.
Uh, what a...
Whoa!
Thanks to St. Byron Werner for that
incredible piece of music.
Hoo!
Yeah, and thanks to Reverend Bleepo Abernathy
for recording
the, uh, the barrage
that we were hearing for a lot of the
stuff that we've heard tonight, actually.
Yeah.
Shut the
door!
To get you.
The different are being silenced
by a global conspiracy.
Weird men arise!
Find out who they
are and how to smash
them!
You probably already knew that the U.S.
government is a sham.
Something popped up there for you to blame.
But did you know that the real
powers that be are not even
people? That they are actually
shambling? Unbelievable,
unmentionable, unthinkable
things?
Yes!
Jehovah is an
alien and still threatens
this planet!
Defy the sinister star
forces which mocked you!
We must all be

Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity
for thousands of years!
God has been misquoted
all this time!
His actual words may
disturb you, but
Bob Dobbs is a
bulwark against the unbearable
fear and anxiety
tormenting mankind.
There's no problem
with Bob.
I don't know who he's with
or what the deal is,
but I know that if I stay close to Bob,
I'll be safe in those
Gleegers in Arkansas.
I know those creatures can't get a hold of me
if I just hang around the foundation
and do what they say and, you know,
clean up after them a little bit.
I don't mind doing that kind of work
if it's for a good cause.
I know that Bob, I know that Bob,
is a good cause.
Bob took me inside his heart
and I accepted him into my life.
And I'm here to testify, friends,
what that man has done for me,
if you can really call him a man.
Many people say he's almost like a god.
I don't think so.
Of course, I don't know Bob, but
I do know Bob in certain ways.
And I think you understand what I'm talking about.
Yes, Bob, he filled me with a sort of a spirit
I never knew I had.
I knew it wasn't coming from him.
It was coming from inside me.
Bob was giving it to me.
He was laying hands on me from afar.
He might have been up in that great big jet plane,
or he might have been down on Skid Row
giving some bum a haircut.
But all I know is,
it was Bob.
It was Bob.
Bob.
Yeah, he's smiling.
You never see Bob frown.
You know that behind that amazing smile
there lies a mind like a steel trap.
I'm sure he makes mistakes like
what he did with those young women that time.
But I think the newspaper's exaggerated.
Bob.
Yeah, he's smiling.
You never see Bob frown.
You know that behind that amazing smile
there lies a mind like a steel trap.
I'm sure he makes mistakes like
what he did with those young women that time.
But I think the newspaper's exaggerated that.
But I think the newspaper's exaggerated that.
I know that Bob will do all of us fine in the long run.
In fact, I think I know that we really need Bob in our lives.
In our lives.
In our lives.
In our lives.
In our lives.
In 1981.
And in 1984.
Hi, little brother.
And in 1984.
And in 1991.
And in 1995.
When they bring the conspiracy to its heels.
And in that wondrous year that we know is gonna come all too soon upon us.
And we'll leave our earthly things behind.
And we'll go and join the exes from God only knows what strange planet they come from.
If they really even come from a planet at all.
And not some energy star beaming away in the darkness.
Lighting our lives with the technology.
And the spirituality.
And the mentality of Planet X.
Planet X coming down to take care of us subgeniuses.
And see that there's a place for us in the world.
And give us our rightful seat at the right hand of Bob.
Or the left hand of Bob.
Depending on whether we're rewardians or mediocrities.
But I don't want to get lost in the dogma.
I want to tell you something that blesses my heart.
And it's Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Yeah, I can hear him.
I can hear him talking off there in the distance.
Saying, come to me, Tommy.
Come to me and lay down your material things.
Because you know they are gonna mean much to you.
After that divine year.
And after I lay my hand on you.
And lead you up the steps of that magnificent craft.
And we'll board it and go to the stars.
That's right, Tommy.
We'll go to the stars.
You and me.
That's what Bob said.
Bob said that to me.
Tighten these cranial sutures down.
See the patient suffered from a subdural hematoma.
Which had suffused the dura and pia matter of the brain.
You see now this is in a dark discolored elongate mass.
Which, uh, uh oh.
It's crumbling.
Send those body parts in from Oklahoma soon.
Gratitude.
Running out of fingers.
Gratitude.
Yes, well we tried to mail them.
But the mail was disgruntled that day.
Grunt.
Boing.
What a sickening operation this is.
It's strange.
This is what the Indians can do to a guy.
The Indians did this to puzzling evidence because he violated their sacred burial space.
It was thus reawakened to the...
You know, it's terrible what they do when they...
Look at this.
This is the body of someone.
Someone who's been out in the hot sun and...
Well, from these, uh, from this evidence you can imagine what's been done.
It's certainly not a pretty sight now.
Now we're gonna open.
Here we go.
Well let's...
Household...
Yes, alright, and look at the surface.
It's...
Uh, oh!
Splashed, splattered me in the face there.
Ah, what a joker.
No harm done.
Now we're going to, uh, break the vinyl rib at the...
At the top.
Ah, jeez.
Ah, he seemed to be...
He registered that a little bit.
Maybe he felt it.
Get the blood out of here!
Uh, nurse, can we have the, uh...
We have some...
Can we have someone please try to help us restore the breathing of this patient?
Suction, please.
Ah, thank you.
I didn't expect us to put this back together yet.
Uh, now, uh...
All right, now, let's remove the...
The book lungs, you see?
It's just like a book right here.
And, uh, if we can find a...






If we take the giggly saw and you'll stop, uh, laughing in that unseemly fashion, we
can, uh, penetrate through the inner bony carapace to the, uh, epigastral.
All right, here we are.
Note the whitish, viscous surface.
Face to face.
Notice that this passage appears to be blocked with some sort of mucilaginous roughage.
We call it the roughage of knowledge here on the show.
Now notice...
Oh, the sucking chest wound.
Oh.
Oh, the pneumos.
This is a repugnant sight, but...
Disgusting.
...one which those versed in medical knowledge are often familiar with.
Now I'm going to peel back the thin, fatty layer beneath the adipose tissue which connects
to the mesentery...
Oh, you're going too far.
...supporting these organs.
Oh, you're going too far.
And, uh...
Oh, notice what is revealed before us here, gentlemen.
You've got an alien in a...
Yeah, get that little alien out of there.
Can't see what I'm doing.
Look, it's just an infant.
Baby, go away.
Stinky monster.
Look what he did inside Wellman's thorax.
Well, let's, uh, penetrate a little further.
Uh, operation's over.
I'm sorry.
Next patient, please.
Mmm...
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
We gotta get this guy back together.
...this can and can't do.
That's increased...
Now, let's, uh, go through the diaphragm here, which is no longer a spongy tissue,
but rather a hard, uh, and rigid surface after the inception of rigor mortis.
Here we are.
...use as much jelly on his diaphragm.
I can't understand.
This is, uh, spermacidal ham jelly here.
It coats the exterior.
...activity to the suggestible...
Oh!
Watch out!


Oh!
Oh!
Watch out for those loose connections.
Boy, that can kill you.
...point of entry into the...
Now, what we need to do is, uh, saw through the, um...
...move...
...the...
Ah!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

Whoa!
Whoa!
We almost made it!
Oh!

How did we do?

That was, uh...
weird...
Ah!


I'm from theantis!
As long as you're out here, I'll tell you...
crawl with me.
I mean, you know, I'm not scared of decay...
I'll tell you...

I'll tell you...
Jump over, jump over!

tout!!!

Jump on the.
The Final Squirt.
That's Ray Hay on lead,
Dr. Philo Drummond on bass,
Sphinx Drummond on the keyboard,
and I believe, I can't remember,
they trade out drummers.
They have mechanical drummers half the time.
Oh, dear friends, we had a caller who said,
Reverend Stang, I've listened to this show twice now.
It was a real nice lady.
She goes, but now, are you all involved in devil worship?
I said, no, ma'am, no, ma'am.
We have a special relationship with those devils,
but it ain't worship.
Nay, nay.
We lure the sinners away from the devils,
don't you see?
That's what we're doing,
is we take, this stuff appeals to sinners,
because Bob doesn't care about the sinning part.
He sends them on to more adept,
personal saviors than him.
It's like I told her, I said,
if she could just say,
see Bob's face, she'd understand everything.
It would all become clear,
and you can see Bob's face.
If you write to Bob and ask for a picture of Bob's face,
just say, send me Bob's face
at P.O. Box 140306,
Dallas, Texas, 75214,
but we deal with the sinners.
We went down to the drunk tank, dear friends.
We were gonna preach to the alcoholics
and the homosexuals.
Now, old Bob, he doesn't want them
to quit drinking and fornicating.
No, no, they know what's best for them.
They're men, but they say, they all say,
Bob, Bob, you're a great man.
You're a rich man.
How can you understand my problems?
I'm only a wayward sinner,
but old Bob Dobbs, friends,
Bob's been in every jail cell.
He knows the prisoner.
He's walked in the shoes of the alcoholic, dear friend.
He's walked in the shoes of the fornicator.
He's walked in the shoes of the convict.
He's walked in the shoes of the common thief.
And most important, friends,
he's walked in the shoes of the shoe salesman.
He's been on both sides of the law.
He's been through all them drugs, friend.
Oh, he's a sinner and he's a saint because he's Bob.
Oh, yes, I can feel the spirit of Bob moving in Dallas tonight
all across those radio waves.
The evil one is out there.
He's making those bad backwards miracles.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He's a he-gaheen.
He's got them good, bad, bad, good,
backwards time streams running.
Running through all them drivers out on the Mixmaster.
I feel them out there because I'm in the vision.
I'm in discernment.
I'm in the spirit, friends.
I see a young man is listening out there,
but he's bound by habit, by bad habits.
He's frustrated in that traffic jam down there on I-30 right now.
They got him listening to them record albums.
You can hear the devil talking backwards on those,
that foreigner music, that rock and roll music with lyrics.
You can hear that devil talking backwards.
And he depends.
He depends on the satellite beamed in cable TV movies
with Burt Reynolds and car crashes and women.
Oh, aren't they lost, dear friends?
But they do.
These pinks out there do have that foot gland,
that one remnant of their soul,
that rectangular gland that's connected to their monies.
My friends, they can be freed by parting with that which hath enslaved them.
You hand them that pamphlet, oh, friends, the scales fall from their eyes.
But you know, when those pink boys discover Bob,
it's either truth or death.
For the love of Bob can kill normals, friends, yes.
Yes, but Bob's men are moving on this planet.
Oh, that planetary alignment that came up, the Jupiter effect,
oh, I'm now sure that may have caused earthquakes and volcanoes
and the Earth to tilt on its axis.
And men will, in the end times to come,
men will gnash their brains and think backwards.
Dead Christians will come up from their graves shambling and rotting
like not of the living dead.
But the only way to get through it all,
helping to profit from it all,
is that one mighty link between heaven and Earth, that Bob.
Oh, yeah, I can see it now.
The miracle of the Bob world is unfolding.
They're wading up to their knees in blood, dear friends,
but it's the blood of the baptism of the mighty fist face of Bob,
that face that can pile through eight-foot-thick
titanium steel conspiracy fort-knock stores with that mighty pipe.
Oh, he ain't from another planet.
He ain't something we have to bow down and kiss to.
He's a man.
Oh, well, you can pull Bob's leg and he'll laugh right along with you
because Bob, he's been a fool just like you and me.
Bob's been a pathetic fool, and I tell you what,
that J.R. Bob Dobbs will be a fool again.
He's a fool today, he's a fool tomorrow,
because he's the same Bob.
He's always the same Bob, and he's working for you and me.
But it's that foolishness that has kept man from living.
That foolishness that has kept man from being satisfied with his lot.
That has kept man building his great gas-powered automobile engines,
his nuclear reactors that made him want to master the Earth
no matter how nice it might have been before.
And it gives us, friends, it gives us that mighty hate,
the hate that makes us want to smite our brothers,
the hate that makes us get up in the morning and, friends,
without that foolishness and that mighty hate,
why, we'd be no different from those normals,
because we'd have nothing to gripe about.
We'd have the right power and the hate that gives us something for nothing.
Oh, in the long run, we may be poor and broke,
we may be drunk and neurotic,
but we've got Bob and the hate!
And for that, we can hate him!
Hate him! Hate him!
And that's the power that we have, and they don't have.
Oh, they got plenty of that diddly kind of hate.
Oh, I hate President Reagan.
Oh, I hate my job.
I hate myself.
That's the sick hate, friends.
That ain't no kind of hate at all.
We got that all-inclusive kind of hate, that hate essence,
and it's the love of the hate that allows us to put up with just about anything.
So we can do something about it,
because the Bob hate is indistinguishable from the Bob love.
It's what keeps him on his toes.
Bob is the aware man, the natural man.
He can be walking along, humming to himself, playing pocket pool,
but the inner Bob is aware.
He can hear a fly sniff on a mountain far away,
and he can go up to that fly and look that fly in the eye and say,
Son, I'd like to sell you a big old mound of waste byproducts from physical organisms,
and that fly will give his wings to Bob.
Bob is aware, and that's how he can sell to these inferior creatures.
And that fly, he's going to be a better fly for it.
All those other flies, they're flitting from pile to pile.
They see him just sitting there without any wings on that big old mound of Bob,
and they may laugh now, but winter goes by, summer goes by,
all those other flies starve, but that little Bob fly,
he's still sitting there on that pile, a munching away and a munching away,
and that pile does not change because Bob, my friend, does not change.
Oh, he changes his mind.
He might suddenly change all the doctrine in the whole church
right in the middle of a ritual to teach us all an important lesson,
but oh, my friend, Bob Dobbs does not change.
Hold that name on the tip of your tongue.
Bob. There's a B on either side, opposite poles.
That's the lesson right there.
Flip it over on your tongue.
Say it front way, say it backwards, say it upside down.
And what does it say?
It says Bob, because Bob does not change.
His promise rings true.
But if you ain't been sprinkled in the blood of the head,
if you ain't been washed in the waste byproducts of Bob,
how are you going to get saved?
You can go to that party Saturday night, but you've got to be wearing Bob's shadow.
You can drink beer.
You've just got to get Bob drunk too.
And what about Wanda?
Oh, you're just going to have to give Wanda over to Bob.
That shouldn't be any problem because Wanda,
she found out from Bob how to do it.
She found out how to get to heaven.
Sit down, boy.
Because friends, if you're wondering,
Bob can love.
Bob can love.
Radio job.
I didn't set foot in a church for three years.
I was just fed up to here with it.
After working as an announcer at stations in several cities,
I finally got to Hollywood.
I was offered four jobs, and I took one with a major network.
In 1947, I made a business trip to Cincinnati.
And it was just about then that the Kenneth Arnold sighting
of the so-called flying saucers hit the headlines.
And it caused a lot of conversation.
I notice you keep looking out the window.
You wouldn't be looking for these flying saucers, would you?
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.
You don't think it's just some kind of a publicity stunt then, huh?
No.
It's reasonable to suppose that there's life on other planets.
Maybe I ought to start looking for flying saucers, too.
If they do come from another planet, how will we know?
Listen, when the occupants condescend to tell us, that's when.
But if they do, how will we know?









Now, Bob, you're getting to be a pretty big fella.
Yes, sir.
Maybe this is a good idea, a chance for us to have a little talk.
Why, sure, Dad.
What's cooking?
Uh, remember the last time we talked about this old body of ours, Bob?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I remember, Dad.
No.
Oh, here's a match.
Your pipe's gone out again.
Well, thanks.
But when a doctor speaks of the male organ, he, well, he calls it a...
When a man and a woman are married, Bob, they love each other very much.
And in, in showing their love, their instinct is to embrace each other as if, well, as if
to try to become the one person God intended them to be.
They're the, the sperm, as the doctors call it.
Oh, is that the seed that helps make a new baby?
No, no, Bob.
Well, what I'm talking about now is the fluid that contains the, formed in two little sacs
beneath the penis, which we call the...
Oh, but Dad, why do fellas get these, uh, these feelings before they get married?
Now, that's a good question, Bob.
Why do you ask, dear?
Well, there were some drawings in Bob's textbook.
I didn't mean to look at them honest and...
Well, then some of the older girls, well...
You mean they talk about things sometimes?
Well, yes.
Bob!
Bob?
Yes, Bob.
Call Bob.
Bob!
I know Bob, Bob days.
Bob, that's Bob, that's Bob.
Solidly commemorate...
Bob.
...the martyrdom of the prophet herald of our faith, called Bob.
And in today's program, we're going to deal with the story of the Bob's martyrdom and
the events surrounding it.
Wow!
On that blistering July summer day, there were the barrels of 750 rifles awaiting the
command to fire and take the Bob's life.
But the


He seemed so young to die, barely 30.
He was a handsome, gentle, and confident man.
Could I possibly be guilty of the shocking crime of which he was accused?
Would you get off your knees?
Somewhat unorthodox, wouldn't you say, Reverend Scott?
But realistic.
You deliver sermons like this, it's a wonder you're still an ordained minister.
Or are you?
The best kind.
Angry, rebellious, critical, a renegade.

Strip to most of my so-called clerical powers.
But I'm still in business.
Well, you seem to be enjoying the punishment.
Punishment?
Ha-ha!
The Church has blessed me.
That's what it's done.
Banished to some new country in Africa.
Hell, I had to look it up on the map to find out where I was going.
Oh, my bishop doesn't know it, but he's given me exactly what I wanted.
Elbow room.
Freedom.
Real freedom.
And I'm not going to be a slave to the Church.





Freedom to dump all the rules or all the trappings.
Freedom to discover God in my own way.
You call this an act?
They say it was an act.
I am an act, I'm not a priest.
Come on!
I saw a car.
I saw an article in the reading in a recent Billy Graham column on religion.
It said, Dear Dr. Graham, I recently converted to Christianity.

Yet I'm not presently killing Dr. Services by God.
Is this, perhaps, a theological contradiction?
You know, I'm медiormming in Christian without at this moment killing doctors for
God that's the kind of forces we have against each other.
Well, Father, somebody needs to have some sacrificial bread...
by the next moment...
I'm going to the треб...
Everybody come here!
That's mad.
That's it!
Mmm, that isèle.
I want to touch somebody's feet!

And I came in, I sang just a little bit.




that the hour for Christ's return was at hand.
The years between 1843 and 1847 were generally accepted
as the time for the return of Christ.
A young man there declared that he was the one foretold
in all the holy books of the past.
He said he had come to usher in a new era,
a new springtime in the hearts of men.
He was called the Bob.
Bob, his name means the door or the gate.
And his teaching was to be the gateway to the new age of unity.
The world is one country, and mankind its citizens.
There is only one religion, and all the prophets have taught it.
Hellfire, all right.
Okay, there's something else too.
I noticed last Sunday
that we had a new religion.
One of you put a corner in the offering plate, see?
Yeah, Raymond Welch.
You're the one.
You put a corner in there.
You tight son of a...
I see all that, see?
I'm up here where I can see it.
Y'all don't even look or nothing.
I can see it.
I know whatever one of you is giving.
All right.
I'm going to...
I'm going to maybe go to another church.
I don't know.
I don't give a...
Because I just about come to the end of the road.
Here, I've just about lost patience with you people.
You know we need a Sunday school space out there.
And as Jesus had spoken to Peter the fisherman,
the Bob spoke to a Persian student named Mullah Hussein.
Mullah Hussein described in his own words
what...
his experience was like.
I sat spelled down by his utterance,
oblivious of time.
This revelation so suddenly and impetuously thrust upon me
came as a thunderbolt,
which for a time seemed to have benumbed my faculties.
God is pretty busy.
He's got a long-term plan for humanity
that stretches far beyond our comprehension.
God is busy.

So it's not reasonable to expect him to concern himself with the individual.
The individual is important only to the extent of providing a creative link
between the past and the future,
in his children,
or in his grandchildren,
or in the contribution he makes to humanity.
Therefore, don't pray to God to solve your problems.
Pray to that part of God within you.
Have the guts to fight for yourself.
God wants brave souls.
He wants winners, not quitters.
If you can't win, at least try to win.
God loves triers.
Is that right, Robin?
Right.
You're dealing with something totally alien.
What's the problem?



Those hypnotic eyes.
Alien, totally alien.
Something that must be incredibly, unbelievably, something totally alien.
Looks like he's growing.
It's like I told Hitler that time,
back when we were just a couple of running buddies.
One man's bummer, another man's a beautiful thing.
And he always believed in that.
I think these guys in this band are a bunch of stupid, loco, loony birds.
Well, then, this is a pretty cool place to hope, even if I'm by my head.
Robber.
Robber.
Robber.
Robber.
Gotta be robber.
Robber.
Robber.
Gotta be robber.
Been to singing this song.
Drop and drop and drop.
Yeah, you got to be матropin'.

You got to be a problem.

Spreading the flakes so that they lay equal at the ends

Good kick by a mule
I was with Cousin Junior

I was drunk
I was lonely
I was plastered
I was drinkin' but wiser
And Bob was on TV
Drankin' but wiser
Watchin' Bob on TV
Swallowing red men
The day my coon dog died
The day my coon dog died
I was reading the pamphlet
Over and over again
