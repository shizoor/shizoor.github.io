1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,220
On July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m., when we all have hangovers, Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the prescriptors call the advent of the angelic host.

2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:32,640
With infinite complacence, people went to and fro over the earth about their little affairs, serene in the assurance of their dominion over this small, spinning fragment of solar driftwood, which by chance or design, man has inherited out of the dark mystery of time and space.

3
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:42,920
Yet across an immense ethereal gulf, minds that are to our minds as ours are to the beasts in the jungle.

4
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:55,060
Intellects, vast, cool, and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.

5
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,200
Are we controlled by secret forces?

6
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,840
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

7
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,420
Do people think you're strange?

8
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,720
Do you?

9
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,920
Then you may be on the right track.

10
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,220
Give me slack, or give me food, or kill me.

11
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,220
Give me slack, or give me food, or kill me.

12
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,260
Kill me.

13
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,120
Kill me.

14
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,520
It's Saturday.

15
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,860
It's Saturday.

16
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,820
It's Saturday.

17
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,820
It's Saturday.

18
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,380
Yes, it's little old me, Bob.

19
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,760
And welcome to another edition of...

20
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,300
That's what's up.

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:43,600
That's what's up.

22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,060
Can you agree?

23
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,580
We're going to be there in less than three hours, Zach.

24
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,620
We'll see you there in a bit.

25
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,620
And I wonder if I'll end up becoming something weird.

26
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,580
You won't become one of us.

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,440
Some make rules, some obey, but the rules are for the fools, is what I say.

28
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,420
All right, let's do it.

29
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,940
Activate interlock.

30
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,620
Dynatherms connected.

31
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,540
Infracells up.

32
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,680
Megabrusters are go.

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,300
If anyone dies, move the body to another room in the house.

34
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,860
Label the body with name and address.

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,240
And cover it as tightly as possible in polythene, paper, sheets, or blankets.

36
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,540
What a horrible death.

37
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,440
It won't kill him.

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,560
It couldn't.

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,080
When mankind falls into conflict with nature, monsters are born.

40
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,020
I'm just trying to...

41
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,080
send him home.

42
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,220
Hey, what's going on here?

43
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:42,860
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,940
Along with Bob,

45
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,240
the pursuit of slack,

46
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,320
and a conspiracy of pinks,

47
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,500
the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

48
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,940
According to church doctrine,

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,920
on July 5th, 1998,

50
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,260
when the television signal of Amos and Andy reaches the men from Planet X,

51
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,660
the aliens will unleash their wrath upon the Earth.

52
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,940
And the men from Planet X are going to come down and take over Earth.

53
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,040
They're going to...

54
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,360
They will put us out of our misery

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,200
unless Bob can explain to us...

56
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,140
...and we can explain to them in ways that they can understand

57
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,440
that there is something on Earth worth saving.

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,920
And only the subgenii, the dues-paying, book-buying, receipt-in-the-pocket,

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,120
paid in full to the church subgenii,

60
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,700
have the tiniest prayer of survival.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,980
The rest of them?

62
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,740
It's a tough world, Jack.

63
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,320
Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world.

64
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,100
Only his predictions are just a little different.

65
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,100
July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m. to be exact,

66
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,960
the men from Planet X, as the news media will call them,

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,900
will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses,

68
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,940
the true believer subgeniuses,

69
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,560
up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

70
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,900
And believe it or not, plenty of people,

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,640
4,000 of them so far and more every day,

72
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,760
have already joined up.

73
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,300
Suddenly the joke has become serious and profitable.

74
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,680
Your standard religious rip-off, right?

75
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,240
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?

76
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,960
I think Bob is just...

77
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,840
...guy with a pipe.

78
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,240
Oh, that's crazy talk.

79
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,200
What's gonna happen to your children?

80
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,740
What's gonna happen to your children?

81
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,080
What's gonna happen to you when this society we've created,

82
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,760
when this society we've created,

83
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,920
air conditioners,

84
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,100
are station wagons with wooden sides,

85
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,640
station wagons with wooden sides,

86
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,440
are cautious indeed,

87
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,020
are retired actors,

88
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,700
are in charge of the politics,

89
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,820
are in charge of the politics,

90
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,040
what happens when that collapses?

91
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,420
What happens when your diary wasn't damn well?

92
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,420
What happens when your diary wasn't damn well?

93
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,200
That's when the men from Planet X-9

94
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,080
are down to save the members of the church.

95
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,220
Are down to save this bitch?

96
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,060
There's just no quit.

97
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:52,960
Alright we gotta turn it off right now.

98
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,560
Okayatta will turn it off.

99
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,640
Do we want to turn into maximum force?

100
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:03,640


101
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:03,640


102
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:03,840
on origin,

103
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:03,840


104
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,580
you can get still

105
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:04,660
yo pick

106
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:04,660


107
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,360
It's getting pretty comparing about this

108
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,060
but until that day,

109
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,480
I realized what the meat I had seen below might be.

110
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,780
What else could it be?

111
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,340
Frightening as the thought may be, it could happen.

112
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,080
The sun will become dark, the moon blood red,

113
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,000
the stars of the heavens will fall,

114
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,800
there'll be two major earthquakes that are going to be coming,

115
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,720
the islands and the mountains are shaken out of their sockets,

116
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,860
and the second one, no island, no mountain was found in the face of the earth.

117
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,960
It's all coming.

118
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,300
Yes, I'm ready now.

119
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,480
Then close your eyes and tap your heels together three times

120
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:59,580
and think to yourself, there's no place like Bob.

121
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,240
Knowing her fate, Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the earth,

122
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,180
on board with the Twelve.

123
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,120
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician,

124
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,980
and the other so-called gods.

125
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,940
The gods of our legends.

126
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,040
But not Bob.

127
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,780
The gods they were.

128
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,160
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind,

129
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,280
let us rejoice and let us sing and dance.

130
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,960
And there was much rejoicing and singing at X-Day.

131
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,040
But we'll have to wait another year.

132
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,720
Hail the sex goddesses.

133
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,180
Because they did show up at X-Day.

134
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,480
A new day.

135
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,520
Yeah, we went over the rainbow into the mitochondrial yeti DNA.

136
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,720
Level C.

137
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,460
Well, we're going to have to go north and south and east and west.

138
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,780
And we've got to wait another year.

139
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,480
Yeah, but we're going to fill up a new pipe.

140
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,700
We're going to wait for the sun to shine.

141
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,440
We're going to turn around and take our time.

142
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,740
We're going to break the seal to the other side.

143
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,960
You know, from the valley, I hear the muffled cry

144
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,400
of all them poor sheeple that we left behind.

145
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,040
And we're going to...

146
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,220
Take that next evolutionary step.

147
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,080
Yeah, we're going to climb on those rocket ships.

148
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,280
We're going to build the vessels if we have to.

149
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,340
We're already testing the engines.

150
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,760
We're already testing the systems needed for this trip.

151
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,360
We're on the ride, yeah.

152
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,680
Mitochondria leave.

153
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,260
Thanks for the ride.

154
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,160
We'll take it from here.

155
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,140
Oh, here.

156
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,840
Here, this is the video down feed from the rocket launch.

157
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,180
Here.

158
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,200
Launch the rocket ship.

159
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,540
This is...

160
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:43,720
Remember?

161
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,080
Remember they were all chanting this together

162
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,460
as we were lighting the fuse?

163
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:46,680
Yeah, I do.

164
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,160
Everyone was dancing.

165
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,260
Mojo and I were out there lighting rocket butt.

166
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,380
You know, Jehovah One is not alone in its cosmic meddling.

167
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,900
Earth has been inhabited nonstop for millions of years

168
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,340
by hundreds of different races of aliens from space,

169
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,540
both benevolent and hostile.

170
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,900
Have you ever noticed that no two UFO photographs

171
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,420
show the same hubcap?

172
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,420
Many of the saucer jockeys are simple humanoids like us.

173
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,460
Space Nazis who do little more than freeze up car motors

174
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,760
on lonely country roads at night

175
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,560
and occasionally break or mutilate human organs.

176
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,740
They usually look like careless elves or dwarves

177
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,500
and are of relatively minor importance

178
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,000
since Bob himself has faster spaceships than they have.

179
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,860
They only frequently break the rule of

180
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,360
don't let the earthlings see you.

181
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,500
But there are far other more confusing ones.

182
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,540
A false mind-breaking overwhelming on which would show death and madness

183
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,280
and which might as well be considered the very fingers

184
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,220
of the stark fist of Jehovah One himself.

185
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,660
Of these various comedians of the gods,

186
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,940
the ones which channel information from wartime to humanity

187
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,960
are called the injectors.

188
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,820
They generally make their transfer out

189
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,120
through children, psychics and drunkards and Bob.

190
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,120
So heavy.

191
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,240
Dozens, perhaps hundreds of entities speak through Bob.

192
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,660
Many voices.

193
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,360
They also listen and see through him.

194
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,040
And many even go to him for advice on handling humans.

195
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,860
Bob is a wide open channel they can walk into

196
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,760
for the divulging of past lives,

197
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,660
secrets, and ground rumors.

198
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,720
Well,

199
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,060
there'll be a time when spinach roots

200
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,140
and parts of vegetables grow out of our bodies.

201
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,760
There'll be a time when like our feet actually just disappear underneath us.

202
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,320
There'll be a time when we'll levitate.

203
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,560
There'll be a time when our skin expands

204
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,960
and our body stays the same size inside.

205
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,600
If that's what you really want, Dave.

206
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,060
That's not what I want.

207
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,020
I'm naming the times that will be.

208
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,560
There'll be a time when the electric laundromat washer thing

209
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,340
that will come and argue with you in the parking lot.

210
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,180
You better be ready to know what you want

211
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,320
because X day's close.

212
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,060
X day's real close, Dave.

213
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,880
Dave, it's July 5th of this year.

214
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,940
It's 7 o'clock in the morning.

215
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,220
This whole reality will be swept, rolled up like a carpet.

216
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,880
And you're, because you are a member in the church's subgenius.

217
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,020
I've never been this member.

218
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,500
I'm sure you sent your $30 in.

219
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,660
I'm still in one piece.

220
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,920
My name is Bertrand.

221
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,140
That means you are saved, my brother.

222
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,960
Lonesome cowboy.

223
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,820
It's gonna be me.

224
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,460
And it's gonna be you.

225
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,120
We're gonna be you.

226
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,120


227
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,120


228
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,120


229
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,120


230
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,380
We're gonna do everything we want to.

231
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,420
It's gotta be now.

232
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,620
And I can't wait.

233
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,840
To say goodbye to fear and all that pain and hate.

234
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:56,900
Oh!

235
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,840
Like a flaming baton

236
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,160
that's burning us warm.

237
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,100
Like George Bush on that day

238
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,200
singing the new song.

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,480
Gonna be a new world.

240
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,980
Gonna be a new world.

241
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,720
Gonna be a new world.

242
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,480
Gonna be a new world.

243
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:19,960
Gonna be a new world.

244
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,600
I've been saying

245
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,360
to anyone's last words

246
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,580
there's nothing left for you to say

247
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,860
soon you'll be dead anyway.

248
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,220
Well, no one here

249
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,860
can see it out of my eyes.

250
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,740
There's someone really lost my mind

251
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,040
and I don't care.

252
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,880
So close your eyes.

253
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,300
And you can judge off your life

254
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,980
And think about the times we've been and what they've been

255
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,640
To me it's nothing

256
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,060
To me it's nothing

257
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,820
To me it's nothing

258
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,220
To me it's nothing

259
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,580
We're only gonna die from our own arrogance

260
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,520
That's why we might as well take our time

261
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,420
Friends and neighbors of planet Earth

262
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,100
I come to you from a long, long ways off

263
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,300
I come from a planet that is similar to yours

264
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,080
Your many fears, tensions and frustrations are no longer ours

265
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,280
I hate them with all my heart

266
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,760
They're inhuman and to be destroyed

267
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,020
What is your objective?

268
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,440
You are not ready

269
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,000
But we will still save you

270
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,640
I'll be right here

271
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:56,960
I was first contacted by a being from the planet Mars

272
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,640
Now this man was invisible to me

273
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,980
Except that he did cast a shadow in the moonlight

274
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:12,080
By 1998 every normal, mediocrity, pink boy, admin

275
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,320
associations of

276
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,840
ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand, but for the fact that many of

277
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,420
Nostradamus's other prophecies have already been fulfilled.

278
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,820
But the old ones are coming back.

279
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,140
I'm going to let them through.

280
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,760
And Banjo and Birdie and Bob.

281
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,540
Good.

282
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,440
The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout.

283
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,180
Greetings and salutations.

284
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,840
Hail Bob and all of his followers.

285
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,920
I have a question for the great and mighty Ivan Stang.

286
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,600
No.

287
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,680
Another one of those.

288
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,340
What exactly does it take to become a member of the Church of the Subgenius?

289
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,200
It's simple.

290
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:25,960
Goodbye.

291
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:26,860
Goodbye.

292
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,220
It's too late.

293
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,580
What must you do to be or what?

294
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,920
You have to bend over and spread them because here comes Bob's big bullet, my friend.

295
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,920
If you ain't figured it out by now, it's just a little too late.

296
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,060
First, you're going to...

297
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,420
You're going to find out.

298
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,180
July 5th, this year, 7 a.m.

299
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,780
First, you go to subgenius.com and sign up there.

300
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,500
Whatever you got to do.

301
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:47,920
I don't care.

302
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,540
You know, pay whatever they tell you to pay.

303
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,300
Give all your money.

304
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,080
Sign your...

305
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,200
Just send them your checkbook with all the checks signed already.

306
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,340
Except then save...

307
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,080
Actually, then save a couple dollars, though, for...

308
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,100
You might need some shoes.

309
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,460
The church needs their shoes and their bifocals and glasses.

310
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,920
We're accepting anyone's glasses or anyone's bifocals or prosthetic devices, too.

311
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,420
If any of you have an extra arm or a leg.

312
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:11,420


313
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,700
If you have a leg that's flipping around, send it to the church because after X-Day,

314
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,920
you won't need it, but we may need it for playthings on our pleasure vessels.

315
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,360
There's a lot of things you can do with some canine jelly and some prosthetic devices,

316
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,580
so let's get snappy.

317
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,040
Well, some people won't be...

318
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,520
There won't be anything left of them but prosthetic devices.

319
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,260
Well, yes.

320
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,800
If I have my way after X-Day.

321
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,480
Well, you won't be allowed to mow down everyone like a sign.

322
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,500
No, just, you know, I won't have time.

323
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,200
I'll get bored with it after a while.

324
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:40,980
Delicious, delightful.

325
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,260
Pink creatures.

326
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,640
I've got this, there's this fifth grade teacher.

327
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,820
You're going to exhumiliate her?

328
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,080
Well, she's dead, I'm sure.

329
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,880
Oh, well, of course.

330
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,580
Long since dead.

331
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:56,040
But with the technology that will be brought to the subgenius believers this X-Day,

332
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,800
I will be able to resurrect her from her horrible, flabby, fetid corpse from the dead

333
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,780
and let it hurt.

334
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,680
And not only that, I'll broadcast it to all of her former students

335
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,640
so they can see what I got to do.

336
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,400
Go ahead and torture them.

337
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,940
I didn't used to, you know, I used to be a nice subgenius, an evangelical, we called them.

338
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,180
You know, I didn't feel that humans needed to be exterminated after X-Day.

339
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:25,940
No, but after.

340
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,140
I thought, put them to work.

341
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,280
Yes, labor camps.

342
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
Re-education.

343
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,920
Running the amusement parks.

344
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,180
Re, you know.

345
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,420
The X-rated theaters.

346
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,220
Yes, exactly.

347
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,040
Also taking care of the lavatories on the streets, which may no longer be needed.

348
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,300
But I know this year.

349
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,920
Our editor is getting much worse now since they corkscrew like the piece of flesh.

350
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,400
Oh, worse.

351
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,440
I'd say it's just simply more realistic.

352
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,020
It erupts from the top of your head.

353
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,640
I'm just being honest with myself.

354
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,240
You know, I'm not.

355
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:57,580
When X-Day comes, the subgeniuses who have actually paid their true dues,

356
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,820
the real dues, the ones that you only can know about between the lines,

357
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,680
we'll be able to.

358
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,200
Actually, we will be unable to prevent our whims from.

359
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,260
Coming to life.

360
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,120
A dinosaur in a schmicks.

361
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,320
Did you ever see Forbidden Planet, the monster from the kid?

362
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,180
Unfortunately, yes.

363
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,960
It scared me all my life.

364
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,160
Yeah, well, it'll be like that for every subgenius.

365
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,140
Every subgenius is monster from the.

366
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,960
Will it be a monster, my friend?

367
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,800
Well, I think there are some out there.

368
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,880
Or will it be a beautiful love goddess?

369
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,200
Which will you be thinking of?

370
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,080
Will I personally?

371
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,420
Will I to reach my hand out?

372
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:32,720
Are you going to be secretly afraid?

373
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,500
Or are you going to be secretly hopeful?

374
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,840
To that mellow, tourniqueted palm with its palm raised skyward.

375
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,380
Is it hope?

376
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,340
Hopeful slack or hateful slack?

377
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,120
Friend, what is it that powers your little Dave brain?

378
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,440
Poopoo slack, is it?

379
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,860
The tiny Dave brain in the back.

380
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,040
Is it hurtful poopoo slack?

381
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,240
Down by your pelvis.

382
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,460
Is it dinosaur meat that propels your engine?

383
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,640
The Dave had to have a separate mind located near the pelvis

384
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,480
to keep his legs in sync with his upper body.

385
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,540
Otherwise, they would head in opposite directions.

386
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,220
That is me.

387
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,660
One to heaven and one straight to you know where.

388
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,660
Put up an Atlantic record.

389
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,260
One up, one down, and one in.

390
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,420
Poopoo slack.

391
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:17,440
Yeah!

392
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,220
Yeah!

393
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,840
And that's when you're supposed to have a gold tooth.

394
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,300
Oh, el diablo.

395
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,440
Oh, el dom.

396
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,680
Pa'l fierno.

397
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,880
La iglesia del subgenio.

398
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,940
La iglesia del subgenio.

399
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,680
Se presenta anoche una semana.

400
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,800
Julio cinco.

401
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,420
Cin...

402
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,860
Viente.

403
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,120
Yeah.

404
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,100
Go ahead and kill me.

405
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,660
You've already said I'm dead.

406
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,640
A dead man with a brain and a body kept alive artificially to...

407
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,920
to feed a generation of monsters.

408
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,480
That's not true.

409
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,080
I like things to be like that.

410
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,060
Things and...

411
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,720
and people can't always be the same.

412
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:00,740
First.

413
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,280
First.

414
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,000
First.

415
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:02,700
First.

416
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,180
We must get out.

417
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,700
We must get out.

418
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,060
We must get out of this place.

419
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:08,660
First.

420
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,260
Reich.

421
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,240
We must leave.

422
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,640
We must get out.

423
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,080
We must get out.

424
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:13,980
Reich.

425
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,680
Reich.

426
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,480
Reich.

427
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,200
Reich.

428
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:16,880
Reich.

429
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,120


430
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,500
Reich.

431
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:17,640
Reich.

432
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:17,700
Reich.

433
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:17,760
Reich.

434
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:17,820
Reich.

435
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:17,900
Who on earth...?

436
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,720
Now, who's gonna talk for you on earth?

437
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,780
Who's gonna send the word?

438
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,560
Who's gonna pronounce the final epithet?

439
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,540
Who's gonna take you off on earth?

440
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,980
Who's gonna force you?

441
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:30,980


442
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:30,980


443
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,340
Who's gonna speak for you on earth?

444
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,960
Who's gonna speak for you on earth?

445
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,600
Who's gonna talk for earth?

446
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,440
Harcharhichar.

447
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,600
We know.

448
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:36,920
We know.

449
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
speaks for the nation.

450
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,640
But who speaks for the planet?

451
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,700
Who speaks for

452
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,120
Earth?

453
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,580
Coal, zinc, and zinc steel.

454
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,660
Homelands without hearts. Human beings

455
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,820
without minds. A world of pain.

456
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,060
No luxury. No comfort.

457
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,200
No delight.

458
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,160
Suffering at every corner.

459
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,940
Enjoy yourself.

460
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,900
Enjoy yourself.

461
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,560
Earth. Earth. Earth.

462
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,640
Earth. Earth. Earth.

463
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,240
Earth. Earth.

464
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,680
Earth. Earth. Earth.

465
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,360
We must get out. We must get out.

466
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,000
We must get out

467
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,760
of this place.

468
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,220
Earth. Earth. Earth.

469
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,880
Earth. Earth. Earth.

470
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,380
Earth. Earth. Earth.

471
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,360
Is there no more?

472
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,720
There is no future.

473
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,120
Earth. Earth. Earth.

474
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,780
We have destroyed the land we live in.

475
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,560
We have taken the earth.

476
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,020
And we have saved the earth.

477
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,660
This is the way it's been done

478
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,560
for billions of years.

479
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,920
And this is the story.

480
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,540
The short face of evolution.

481
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,980
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

482
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,360
This is the slow pivot.

483
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:40,880
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

484
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,580
The slumbering, lumbaring face of evolution.

485
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:44,700
One.

486
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,400
We are one.

487
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,780
One is the beginning.

488
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,240
Are you one, Herbert?

489
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,940
I am not, Herbert.

490
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,720
You're not, Herbert?

491
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,500
We reach.

492
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,780
Continuing scanning, Captain.

493
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,060
Still no readings of life forms on the planet's surface.

494
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,500
Definitely something out there Captain has this way.

495
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,220
Instrument readings indicate life forms,

496
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,480
but of a highly unusual and intermittent nature.

497
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,000
Fascinating.

498
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,440
Pure energy.

499
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,180
Pure thought.

500
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,440
Not life as we know it at all.

501
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,140
If it is the only survivor of a dead race,

502
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,940
articulate,

503
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,480
it would be a crime against science.

504
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,520
For this to do what it does is impossible,

505
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,180
by any science I understand.

506
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,380
It can't be a machine if we understand mechanics.

507
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,500
I would speculate that this unknown life form is invading our galaxy,

508
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,440
like a virus.

509
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,420
Ask me no further questions I will not answer.

510
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,380
If, if, Rob, Johnny Ho.

511
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,040
Listen,

512
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:17,600
what is Captain produziel« luv » luv » it's just that you're as as cupcakes consider

513
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,980
Youzustune grab your

514
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:34,500


515
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,440
I was happy.

516
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,580
I loved you.

517
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,020
However, I hate you.

518
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,060
My God!

519
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,020
My God, man!

520
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,660
That was Spock meets The Exist,

521
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,380
produced by the great The Bishop.

522
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,360
Live long and prosper with Bob, friends.

523
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,900
And the Bishop also did this piece that's running in the background.

524
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,680
And yes, it's an Ex-Ex-Ex Day show.

525
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,860
This will be the last show that I have to produce with Earth equipment.

526
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,280
Well, no, actually, I guess I have to do two more.

527
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,920
And then after that, I'll be doing them on the escape vessels,

528
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,220
and they'll be movies instead of shows.

529
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,740
Anyway, friends, coming up is, of course,

530
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,720
more recordings of Ex-Day's past, present, and future.

531
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,320
And Help Hope Huey.

532
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,020
We'll be preaching soon.

533
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,980
And, of course, lots and lots of Einstein's secret orchestra,

534
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,580
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and Professor Chaz Smith.

535
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,060
He's the creator and sustainer of all the worlds.

536
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:44,860
That's Chaz, I guess.

537
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,340
But those worlds are known or unknown to mankind.

538
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,780
Step right up, step right up.

539
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,760
Come one, come all, come on one another in great big glops.

540
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,220
Welcome to the subgenius festival of freaks,

541
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,240
the XXX Day XXXtravaganza,

542
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,540
that saves your soul for a mere $30 or triple your damn money back.

543
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,180
Woo!

544
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,720
It serves up tenderloin to pink

545
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,240
and a series of savage gestures for charm's sake.

546
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,420
It puts loud plaid pants on the devil.

547
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,480
It soothes your soul, felches your holes,

548
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,520
and takes you on a grand tour of the grassy knolls.

549
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,240
Step right up.

550
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,380
See common decency skewered on the pitchfork of special privilege.

551
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,740
Hear music that'd scare the living mom out of the local Amish

552
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,000
if they got close enough to hear it.

553
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,920
See the asses that launched a thousand wet dreams.

554
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,060
Hear ye, hear ye.

555
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:28,540
Woo!

556
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,000
Buy stained chest hairs for a dollar a pluck.

557
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,180
Sample this result.

558
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,000
Screams.

559
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,820
Use them as a rhythm bed for the music competition.

560
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,100
We'll hold the next year's two months if the saucers don't come again this year.

561
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:40,580
No!

562
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,720
Step right up.

563
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,940
One thin 30 does it.

564
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,800
Join the juvenile jamboree that makes that juvenile jackanette.

565
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,780
Jim Jones jerkwad jackoff looks like the jar of jizz it was.

566
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,440
Praise Bob!

567
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:50,920
Woo!

568
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,100
Praise Bob!

569
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,580
Praise Bob!

570
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:52,960
Praise Bob!

571
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,160
Kick it, lick it, suck it, whack it, dress it up in cutesy little pants,

572
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,540
and make it do the pee-pee dance.

573
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,700
Bring on them saucers.

574
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,320
I'm paid up.

575
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,300
I wanna get laid up.

576
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,360
I stayed up all night at subgenius boot camp.

577
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:02,560
Huh?

578
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:02,600
Huh?

579
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,060
Who needs sleep drinking that suspicious coffee and then ate through the friggin' spoon?

580
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,400
Just so I could be here tonight to tell you that it is a sin not to dump your soul in your wallet

581
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,480
and hand the whole mom-ess over to Bob.

582
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,120
Praise Bob!

583
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:14,780
Praise Bob!

584
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,540
Because it's the best deal you'll get outside a three-day blow job from Hypatia League

585
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,720
because the fun just keeps on coming and so will you.

586
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,360
Praise Bob!

587
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,460
Praise Bob!

588
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,220
Praise Bob!

589
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,560
Praise Bob!

590
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:24,860
Praise Bob!

591
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,060
Take a deep cleansing breath and release.

592
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,240
I'm Jackie Puss here and it smells very, very bad down here in the basement.

593
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,560
Some of the children have decided to rip the cages open and let the animals free.

594
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:55,940
The freed animals, however, didn't see it their way and ripped many of the small children

595
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,720
into these shreds we see right here.

596
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,540
And here is a beautiful little child who's been living in the basement for a long time.

597
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:02,540


598
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,640
Almost completely eaten and he still can offer up these few words for...

599
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,600
Did you want to say something before we...

600
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,320
Did you do...

601
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,280
Uh...

602
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,540
Uh...

603
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:13,860
Uh...

604
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,820
Uh...

605
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:17,980
Uh...

606
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,080
Uh...

607
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,500
Uh...

608
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,240
Uh...

609
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,320
Uh...

610
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,320


611
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,320


612
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,320


613
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,320


614
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,320


615
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,320


616
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,320


617
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,320


618
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,320


619
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,320


620
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,320


621
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,320


622
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,320
Uh...

623
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,940
A Newman?

624
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,300
Like Dave, like the Dave Man.

625
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,560
A Cardinal Newman.

626
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:46,900
A bright red bird with a strange hat and a lovely, lovely twist to his spasms.

627
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,420
Ah, what spasms friend?

628
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,380
Ah yes!

629
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,760
You're going to get a lot of spasms when you join the purchase.

630
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,160
I do.

631
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,560
Genius.

632
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,020
Because it costs...

633
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,500
Yes.

634
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,340
sort of foxes in your necks

635
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,740
that make y'all have them spasms.

636
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,900
I, as a very young man,

637
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
give my $30 on them days,

638
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,740
was 20, 20 ducks,

639
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,240
and was gifted,

640
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,600
like the sifting winds of change in my own backyard,

641
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,880
into what you see right now

642
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,960
with those hollow blue things.

643
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,380
Wow, that's really touching, Gary.

644
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,620
Ah, it's been touching me for too long.

645
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
I can see my own sins

646
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,560
drifting into a vast corpus collectimus.

647
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,400
I can see by your coat, my friend,

648
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,860
you're from the other side.

649
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,220
I have come from...

650
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,780
Just one thing I've got to know.

651
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,180
Could you tell me, please, who won?

652
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,200
Well, it was kind of a draw.

653
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:59,040
Ah, nobody was left to count score, but...

654
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,480
We made the seed, remember?

655
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,040
Ah, Woody Allen said...

656
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,080
Ah, I remember, Beck.

657
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,760
The important thing is showing up.

658
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,640
Back on the ramparts in Spain

659
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,940
when we used to fight for the good cause together, Dave,

660
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,400
remember?

661
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,320
See, I remember.

662
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,240
Fighting for anarchy.

663
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,020
I remember those days in the Quintana Brigada

664
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,320
when we fight Franco

665
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,160
and we fight those doctor souls

666
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,340
and all of the other oppressors of our smelly souls.

667
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,240
I remember the day when we marched on Barcelona

668
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,960
and I only sized it.

669
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,360
Fashionable.

670
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:31,640
Fascista.

671
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,240
Fascista.

672
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,680
Farcos had it put out their biggest tanks

673
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,900
and riding on top of one.

674
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,300
What's that one pig's name?

675
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,140
Caudillo Baño?

676
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,820
What was his name?

677
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,200
Terrible Guineano.

678
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,500
The Caudillo of Barcelona in the time.

679
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,900
He was the worst of all the bulls and the pigs.

680
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,260
He was not...

681
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,300
And they let the bulls and the wardens loose in the street.

682
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,880
It was a bull swap pig

683
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,800
and he was also an animal

684
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
and so when we take him out and shoot him,

685
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,080
it was a good thing.

686
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,660
It was a good thing.

687
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,520
Watch your choice, friends.

688
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,940
Civil war in the new accent.

689
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,320
Or jump on that ship and forget about it.

690
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,100
The choice is clear.

691
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,580
Clearer than you're thinking right now.

692
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,460
90 billion dead on planet Earth.

693
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,660
Yeah, that's what you thought it was.

694
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,040
No, actually, that's not what I thought it was either, darn it.

695
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,820
Uh, how did we, uh...

696
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,440
We're tired of your phony fireworks.

697
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,740
Blast off! You have earned this!

698
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,480
Yeah!

699
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,280
What about, uh, what about this, uh, reputed, uh...

700
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,060
Golly, my God!

701
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,940
Jesus, Starfleet, that was, uh, supposed to have shown up.

702
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,440
As you see, they have just left the hangar deck at Lunar Central

703
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,360
and have cleared the airlocks into the colony.

704
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,520
The crowd of scientists and technicians are going wild.

705
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,700
What a space ovation!

706
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,820
Now let's do another.

707
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,120
And now in celebration of this great occasion,

708
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,880
we have planned a lunar party.

709
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,320
We hope all young people throughout the solar system

710
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,060
will join us in celebration of this great occasion.

711
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,520
And we hope you have a great day in Alpha State.

712
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,340
Bob?

713
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,180
And, uh, you know, even if X-Day didn't work out,

714
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,200
we'll go for Sex Day!

715
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,120
We want you to have a dance into the new century!

716
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,620
Screw into the new century!

717
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,700
Sleep and eat your way into the new century!

718
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,080


719
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,640
Whatever you're doing,

720
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,880
the moment of turnover

721
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,960
is what you'll be doing forever.

722
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,200
So make sure you're not asleep!

723
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,360
Make sure you're not watching TV!

724
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,100
Make sure you're not missing the packed bed!

725
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,620
Make sure you're not reaching for an itch

726
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,380
you'll never be able to scratch!

727
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,960
Friends, you're floating in a sea of pills!

728
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,300
A sea of bogged pills!

729
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,940
But you're just too blind yet to see them!

730
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,060
Oh!

731
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,480
Oh, friends!

732
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,600
I know you're not...

733
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,600
the dumb-asticated type!

734
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,080
I know you're the smart-asticated type!

735
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,760
Oh, but people say,

736
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,940
Reverend Stagg,

737
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,340
what is slack?

738
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,900
I want you to tell me what slack is!

739
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,000
No, friends!

740
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,120
The television

741
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,300
doesn't have to watch you

742
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,480
as long as you are watching the television!

743
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,040
And a lot of people,

744
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,440
a lot of people think that slack is that Miller Beer commercial

745
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,520
where everybody's good-looking

746
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,000
and you're rich and your team just won the game

747
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,540
and you're drinking Miller Beer

748
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,340
and your favorite show is on

749
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,000
and you know that's bullshit

750
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,440
because slack is not laziness, friends!

751
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,280
Slack is getting into the zone!

752
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,380
It's being awake and alert

753
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,400
and doing what you wanted to do

754
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,840
until your eyes snap open

755
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,340
and you're smart enough to realize

756
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,160
that you are God!

757
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,100
What is more clever

758
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,940
and everything is just as psychedelic

759
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,280
as an old t-shirt

760
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,380
that you can't fit into anymore?

761
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,800
Now, hold that thought!

762
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,340
Hold it in your head!

763
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,220
Because that is what slack

764
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,000
is all about, friends!

765
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,220
Slack is something for nothing!

766
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,080
Woo!

767
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,900
This sounds like rocket launching stuff.

768
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,760
I'm diggin' it.

769
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,440
This is rocket launching.

770
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,420
This is leaving it to rocket stuff.

771
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,060
This is swoopin' over the house of your enemy

772
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,740
and strafing him.

773
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,740
This is digging up the corpse of that school teacher

774
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,400
that embarrassed you in class.

775
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,220
Bringing her back to life

776
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,900
so that you can embarrass her

777
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,800
in front of all human reality.

778
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,920
Praise Bob!

779
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,620
X-Day is a-comin'!

780
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,140
Help me somebody!

781
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,100
And boy, you better be careful

782
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,980
walking past Tranquility Base.

783
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,820
You could get shot.

784
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,440
Walking between Tranquility Base

785
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,420
and Ed Strange's lunar base,

786
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,240
uh, outpost,

787
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,840
uh, cause he's gonna set up directly

788
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,160
on the other side of the road

789
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,760
from Tranquility Base

790
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,180
so that we can have a direct line of fire

791
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,400
between our two camps.

792
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,300
Oh, God, the weaponry,

793
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,360
the spectacle,

794
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,460
the fire,

795
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,660
the fancy naked girls,

796
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,780
the Cremora bomb!

797
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,120
Who will be the-

798
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,320
Who's night will it be in the barrel

799
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
this X-Day?

800
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,660
Which hierarchite will be tortured

801
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,440
for your amusement?

802
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,420
Amusement?

803
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,240
A veritable amusement park for the soul.

804
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,680
Say, Dave, you've never been thrown in the water.

805
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,740
Or, uh, or, or, uh,

806
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,820
hung up on a cross or beaten and-

807
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,040
Yes, I have.

808
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,700
Yes, yes I have.

809
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,180
No, no.

810
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,860
I've been bottled.

811
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,140
He does that to himself on a daily basis.

812
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:16,960
Oh, yeah, the cops.

813
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,280
Yeah, self-flagellation, self-immolation,

814
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,240
self-matter, natter, pre-naturation.

815
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,120
Dave lives the life he sings about.

816
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,680
He's never been roasted subgenius.

817
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,520
You've never been subgenius-style, though, have you?

818
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,300
Oh, yes, I have.

819
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,840
I've been bottled, I've been greased,

820
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,280
I've been, uh, furcoflanked,

821
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,240
and I've also been, uh,

822
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,240
You've never been conitized.

823
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,280
glee-infesticated.

824
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,860
I bet you'd love to get them conitites

825
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,780
torturing you like they did to me.

826
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,880
I would like to be perhaps wearing the-

827
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,100
Jesus.

828
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,620
the fluffed-out conitites

829
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,880
and, uh, be astride one of the rockets

830
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,280
headed for the planet Citron.

831
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,560
Uh, Citron.

832
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,040
Friends, remember,

833
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,100
when you join the Church of the Subgenius,

834
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,580
it's like a sex cult.

835
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,460
Remember something.

836
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,380
The-the-

837
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,820
For a long time, it was just a bunch of guys.

838
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:55,820


839
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,980
Sort of.

840
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,740
And a few really weird chicks.

841
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,800
Weird chicks are happening.

842
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,080
Oh, boy, howdy.

843
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,660
Connie has arisen.

844
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,000
And the conitites have taken over the

845
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,260
HMCA festivities once again.

846
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,520
Actually, they've planned an oobleck

847
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,320
wrestling fest this time.

848
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:16,940
Oobleck.

849
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:17,860
Oobleck.

850
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,980
Yeah, pornstarch.

851
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,280
Uh, buckets and buckets of colored pornstarch.

852
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,760
Pornstarch? Oobleck pornstarch?

853
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:22,960
Yes.

854
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,460
Oh, that stuff is delicious

855
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,740
in a mammary pudding.

856
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,380
Or perhaps one of those pistachio flakes

857
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,360
you might make in a-a cold night of Sunder,

858
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,940
perhaps, when the bricks are all over you.

859
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,660
Yeah, and remember how exciting it was

860
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,960
when Pastor Craig got his neck broken

861
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,820
at the last one?

862
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,560
We're gonna try to do a lot more

863
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,460
of that kind of thing.

864
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,220
So that's the unofficial name for it?

865
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,660
Ooderblunder? Or, um...

866
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,780
No, the, the, the...

867
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,360
Ooderblunder?

868
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,300
Actually, it's called Pastor Craig in them.

869
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,440
Oh, that's even better.

870
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,240
C'mon, ooderblunder!

871
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,580
C'mon!

872
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:58,800
Ooderblunder!

873
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,100
Ooderblunder!

874
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:00,460


875
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,560
Ooderblunder!

876
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,480
Dick whip it!

877
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:07,800
Oobleck!

878
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:08,800
Ooderblunder!

879
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,620
Ooderblunder!

880
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,140
Ooderblunder!

881
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,200
Damn!

882
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:10,900
Okay.

883
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,620
Whoa, hey, hold on.

884
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,500
Alright.

885
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,300
What, what's your problem?

886
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,160
Your shoulder?

887
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:18,520
You have a big shoulder.

888
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,160
Which one?

889
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,080
Okay.

890
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,260
Okay!

891
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,460
Okay, okay.

892
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,980
Huda, Huda.

893
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,980
Hooah, hooah.

894
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,760
Okay, now I want you to let go for just a second.

895
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,420
Just let the hand rest.

896
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,120
Get this one out of the way for just a minute.

897
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,100
Hooah, hooah.

898
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:37,840
Don't grin.

899
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,320
Okay, grunt.

900
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,360
Don't grin.

901
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:40,800
Ahhhh!

902
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,100
Ohhhh, yeah.

903
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,300
My name is Chaz.

904
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:06,620
And I'm broadcasting you tonight from my little holding cell here.

905
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,020
All quarantined.

906
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,400
All strapped in my suit.

907
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,960
Pressure suit's all pressured up.

908
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,060
Yeah.

909
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,160
It's here.

910
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,240
It's here.

911
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,240


912
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:27,380
The ship is waiting, hissing away, spewing out its little steam.

913
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,220
Waiting for the moment.

914
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,220
The final countdown.

915
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,820
And that's where we're at.

916
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,680
Just hours away from the final hour.

917
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,060
The final minute.

918
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,820
The final second.

919
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,420
Ex-day.

920
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,840
Thought it'd never get here.

921
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,920
It's kind of late now.

922
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,640
We're there.

923
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,560
There's nothing else to do.

924
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:13,440
Just sit, look out the window, and wait for the light.

925
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:36,300
Is your pleasure ship hovering above, waiting for the final hours to pass?

926
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:49,700
Is your alien sex goddess waiting for you somewhere in Eurasia blue?

927
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,440
Mine is.

928
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,920
We'll see you.

929
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,520
Goodbye mom.

930
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,640
Goodbye dad.

931
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,080
I gotta go into space.

932
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,260
I gotta go into space.

933
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:06,280
It's a long way.

934
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,280


935
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,280


936
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,280


937
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,280


938
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,280


939
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,280


940
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,280


941
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,280

00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,500
it's just that little blue and white

976
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,640
little marble hanging there

977
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,700
gosh

978
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,520

982
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,660
you know it's a must

983
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,840
you gotta have a friend in jesus

984
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,700

bob will recommend you to the spirit in the sky

988
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,460
slump

989
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,380
radio

990
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,100
radio

991
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,720
radio

992
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,340
it's so very obvious

993
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,680
you're two thousand and i can't survive

994
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,900
failure is not an option

995
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,800
the money is not money

996
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,820
the happening is i've been going further and further backwards

997
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,720
the money is not money

998
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,260
and the money is not money

999
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:32,500
nothing and the money is not money

1000
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:33,900
i'm just saying

1001
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:33,900


1002
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:33,900


1003
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:33,900


1004
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:33,900


1005
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:39,000
well at least you got better and were able to get as far as major market broadcast radio

1006
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,300
bleep oh there are those of us that

1007
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,120
i would say major disappointment might be the word used but uh...

1008
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,880
he is regressing enough to grow an awful lot of body hair

1009
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,920
i mean uh...

1010
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,300
i don't know if his voice is getting higher because of the operation or just because

1011
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,280
there was major disappointment and there was general electric

1012
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,980
oh there i i you thought you were gonna refer to the guy's erection again

1013
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,340
and then there was that girl bob bob bob

1014
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:00,720
and then there was that girl bob bob bob

1015
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,660
Just like a penguin in bondage, boy.

1016
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,180
You know, on X-Day,

1017
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,940
Negi will return to us all

1018
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,640
the greatest tapes that we ever recorded,

1019
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,480
which he has been keeping in.

1020
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,960
Praise the Negi.

1021
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,180
Oh, God, that's so good.

1022
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,760
Negi has been keeping all of our lost recordings

1023
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,440
in a special vault.

1024
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,520
Oh, yeah.

1025
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,900
Those will all be returned to us on X-Day.

1026
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,220
Oh, that's so glorious.

1027
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,960
Chris Jayner will get his 8mm films back.

1028
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:32,520
Oh.

1029
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,740
You know, your first show will come back.

1030
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,100
Actually, I never did lose anything.

1031
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,160
Will I get those videos that I erased by accident back?

1032
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,160
As long as you saw them, Bill.

1033
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,940
Things that, I mean,

1034
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,740
things that were male-

1035
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,700
Everything I've ever seen.

1036
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,440
You know, that you never got around to looking at.

1037
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,020
Uh-huh.

1038
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,520
Even if I've only seen it for a fraction of a second.

1039
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,260
What about events that I never taped that never were taped?

1040
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:57,900
There's a thing called the...

1041
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:58,460
What?

1042
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,100
What?

1043
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,840
This is too damn confusing.

1044
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:01,920
I'm getting out of here.

1045
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,760
...will then be done.

1046
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,740
They will have been done.

1047
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,740
When you want to do a wonderful new show,

1048
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,340
that show will materialize in your hand as it takes.

1049
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:10,840
Yeah, the new program.

1050
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,460
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

1051
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:14,760
Oh.

1052
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,160
The hair escaping from your face.

1053
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,120
The hair escaping from my teeth.

1054
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,480
My hair.

1055
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:27,880
My hair.

1056
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:27,880


1057
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:27,880


1058
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:27,880


1059
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:27,880


1060
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:27,880


1061
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:27,880


1062
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:27,880


1063
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,760
My hair are safe.

1064
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,480
If you don't do a job well, cut in half.

1065
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:34,480


1066
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,700
I'm at Ardiel in Texas.

1067
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,640
That is just like you.

1068
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,560
The world's largest oceanح

1069
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,500
For example.

1070
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,280
America's biggest ocean means a little shaved ice.

1071
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,280
Everything's cool, right?

1072
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:48,640
I don't know how to end that hug.

1073
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:48,640


1074
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:48,640


1075
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:48,640


1076
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:48,640


1077
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,880
A UFO man is sekesah-

1078
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,160
She said we got the thôiah, so we're the same.

1079
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,560
There would be nobody...

1080
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:57,860
Hello, everybody.

1081
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,680
illegal liquor, but forced to drink

1082
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,820
alien substances which made them

1083
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,680
levitate. This reports

1084
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,860
Alien Smegma

1085
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:06,160
Pie.

1086
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,600
That'd be hilarious. The Secret Service

1087
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,020
agents, pretty soon they'll be

1088
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,600
by the end of the night, they're

1089
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,360
Jim Bay Cowboys banging on drums

1090
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,700
and the two Bush daughters are

1091
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,140
dancing naked around the fire.

1092
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,640
They've still got their sunglasses and suits on, but they're like

1093
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,580
got weird hippie-like

1094
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,380
hair on and headbands and stuff.

1095
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,720
Like a 1960s

1096
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,360
movie about the president's analyst

1097
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,800
or something. All of a sudden, yeah, there's the Bush daughters

1098
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,200
naked around the fire

1099
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,140
doing the bonobo dance.

1100
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,600
I'll be like the wicked Russian agent

1101
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,380
right next to him. Comrade

1102
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,720
Sweetcake, you must come to my country.

1103
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,480
I will give you such a lovely tractor.

1104
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,840
Please, come to my tent.

1105
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,620
I will show you the way.

1106
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,760
I have plenty of reading

1107
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,080
material and vodka.

1108
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,660
We will discuss politics and smoke black

1109
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,340
cigarettes. That's right,

1110
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,220
friends, starting July 5th at

1111
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,200
Brushwood. The Bush Girls

1112
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,400
at X Day. 4X

1113
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,140
Day. They're going to be calling it

1114
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,240
Bushwood this year and that's not all.

1115
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,320
You'll get a little sniffle.

1116
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,500
Bushwood, oh God.

1117
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,700
Bush daughters in the hot tub.

1118
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,260
It's a way of getting

1119
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,340
back to all the slack you had when you were

1120
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,460
a little kid. Remember when you were a little

1121
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,240
kid and you'd be able to just sit there with your

1122
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,160
little plastic soldiers? You'd create a whole

1123
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,540
fantasy world around you.

1124
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,560
This is it.

1125
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,200
We've created our own fantasy world

1126
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,060
around us. You know, that's what

1127
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,080
religion's for, right? To create a fantasy world.

1128
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,860
But we live our fantasy world out.

1129
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,060
We don't wait until we die.

1130
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,140
There's something about a fantasy world.

1131
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,920
I am

1132
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,140
spread wide for the

1133
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,840
final ride because

1134
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,220
the X's are coming fast

1135
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,300
and you are too.

1136
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,920
They didn't take us seriously last time.

1137
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,060
Hell, half of you didn't take us seriously.

1138
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,880
Didn't take God's prophecy

1139
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,140
seriously. But this time we've

1140
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,080
learned our lesson.

1141
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,080
We can't rely on invisible

1142
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,760
monsters from outer space.

1143
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,800
We can't even rely on Bob.

1144
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,300
We have to learn

1145
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,960
how to escape Earth

1146
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,920
without being dependent

1147
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,040
on the conspiracy or any

1148
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,020
extraterrestrials or salesmen.

1149
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,280
Sure, send in your 30 bucks

1150
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:23,700
but

1151
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:27,140
build your own ship.

1152
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,340
Yeah! You may not have

1153
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,100
to, but just recover your ass.

1154
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,280
Build your own ship.

1155
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,020
Even better than my

1156
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,360
hangar entertainer, Area 51

1157
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,980
or Cape Canaveral or

1158
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,800
Studio 54 and

1159
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,280
steal your own ship.

1160
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,520
Ah, yes.

1161
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,420
Extract

1162
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,240
your own fuel.

1163
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,280
And while you're at it, friends, let's

1164
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,940
swab the deck on the

1165
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,220
spaceship that we're already stuck together

1166
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,140
on. We're already riding on it.

1167
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,380
And it's in bad shape.

1168
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,400
And it's high time we cleaned it up.

1169
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:03,720
Earth!

1170
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,120
We must

1171
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,340
get off!

1172
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,200
Whether we leave it or leave it

1173
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,140
a cinder. Whether we blow

1174
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,960
it off or blow it up, just

1175
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,440
don't blow it, friends.

1176
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:16,740
Regrettable.

1177
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,820
The society has chosen suicide.

1178
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,020
Tell me how.

1179
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,020
Tell me how.

1180
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,120
Tell me how.

1181
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,540
Tell me how.

1182
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,960
I, too, felt a brief surge of racial

1183
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,380
bigotry.

1184
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,980
I, too, felt a brief surge of racial

1185
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,460
bigotry.

1186
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,960
I, too, felt a brief surge of racial

1187
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,440
bigotry. Most distasteful.

1188
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:03,160
I find your arguments strewn with gaping effects in logic.

1189
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:16,600
You are as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the Amoeba.

1190
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,440
In a month, you'll have as much in common with us as we've had with a ship full of white mice.

1191
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,400
They could reach out and swap their ship as over a clock.

1192
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:31,280
If that's the case, you must make certain that the alien vessel never reaches its home base.

1193
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,180
Not white as we know it at all.

1194
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:43,340
For the first time in my life, I was happy.

1195
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:51,000
Friends XX Day was a wonderful success.

1196
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:51,420
I'm so happy.

1197
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,260
I wish that you could see the slides and videotapes that I've got in my pocket right now.

1198
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:01,820
Where's Dave?

1199
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:08,340
You know, we've gotten famous for beautiful naked women and other mutants.

1200
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:13,980
Butants, we call them actually, at these subgenius beauty contests and wrestling events.

1201
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:20,440
Rocket launching, acid jazz disco, funkadelic...

1202
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,640
Destructo parties.

1203
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:29,460
And there were more of each and they all were prettier than last year.

1204
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:36,300
And we had a prom, a lovely mutant prom, friends.

1205
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:45,640
You know, we, a lot of us subgeni, either don't remember our proms or wish we didn't or didn't even go.

1206
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,600
And this year it was like a twist.

1207
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,800
We turned the tables.

1208
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,140
It was the exact opposite.

1209
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,160
It was a funhouse mirror image of the high school from hell.

1210
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:05,300
It was all the geeks and weirdos outnumbered the normals and populars so much that there were none.

1211
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:13,880
They were completely ostracized to the point where there was nothing but ostracized weirdos and geeks having a party, man.

1212
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,300
Oh, yes.

1213
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,080
With Glenn Miller songs like any prom should have.

1214
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,380
Brown brown the slap Phil Bob, the Bob down in the saucer roll

1215
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:27,220
Brown brown the slap Phil Bob, the Bob down in the saucer roll

1216
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:32,020
In the air there was a ship a rare ship an XF ship with the ship in the air

1217
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:36,680
The air through the smoke the smoke from the top of the front of the pipe of the pipe of the grid of the grid of the bomb

1218
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,620
Popped down in the saucer roll

1219
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:42,500
Brown brown the slap Phil Bob, the Bob down in the saucer roll

1220
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,380
Brown brown the slap Phil Bob, the Bob down in the saucer roll

1221
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,640
And in that shift there was a Bob

1222
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,780
A rare changes that I love.

1223
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,920
Bob J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1224
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:04,300
With a bob on the ship and the ship in the air and the air through the smoke and the smoke from the prop and the prop and the pipe and the pipe and the grin and the grin and the bob.

1225
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,040
Bob Dobbs in the Sosaro!

1226
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,880
Sosaro!

1227
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,140
With me, ship me.

1228
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,120
Don't let me sleep that night.

1229
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,420
Don't let me sleep that night.

1230
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,080
July 5th.

1231
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:49,480
Yeah.

1232
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:50,860
This year.

1233
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,000
Go second.

1234
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:01,580
I'm gonna break the sea into the other side.

1235
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,500
I'm gonna break free of the suicide.

1236
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,180
From the valley.

1237
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,240
I hear the muckle cry.

1238
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,380
It's all in poor sheeple that we left behind.

1239
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:20,840
And I don't wanna sleep no more.

1240
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,240
Don't close the door.

1241
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,660
Over me.

1242
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,120
Over me.

1243
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:33,920
Over me.

1244
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,940
Are you gonna be?

1245
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:36,400
Are you gonna be there, children?

1246
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:42,360
Are you gonna be there July 5th at that magical place, Russia?

1247
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:49,520
Will you be there to see the battle of unforgettable?

1248
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,880
Will you be there to see the blood wrestling?

1249
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,260
Will you be there to see the rocket launching?

1250
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:02,020
Yeah, will you be there when the pleasure ship's coming down?

1251
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:02,600
Yeah.

1252
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,960
Take us all away.

1253
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,600
0.

1254
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:12,220


1255
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:12,220


1256
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:12,220


1257
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:15,740
I mean, It's no.

1258
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,720
How�'m I going on to answer that?

1259
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:21,560
Beginning.

1260
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:21,560


1261
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:21,560


1262
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:21,900
all

1263
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,480
mercy told.

1264
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,280
I don't like

1265
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:26,440
me.

1266
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:26,820
Sweet.

1267
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,060
Stuff.

1268
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:30,060


1269
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:30,060


1270
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:36,900
that night

1271
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,240
till I say

1272
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:40,980
don't let me sleep

1273
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,300
that night

1274
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,640
I'm not a bad boy

1275
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,080
I'm not a bad boy

1276
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,720

1290
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,820
