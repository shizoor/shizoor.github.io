00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,560
Wrapped a rubber band around an empty shoebox Listen, listen, you hear nothing

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,340
Strike the rubber band with your finger quickly Listen, listen, you hear something

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,660
Now the rubber band's in motion And that motion is vibration

4
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,660
You can hear the sound of that vibration Carried by the air

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,720
Vibration, vibration, vibration Is what causes sound

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,600
Vibration, vibration, vibration Causes sound

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,000
Now Tony and his guitar will show you how to control the pitch of a sound by changing

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,600
the vibration.

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,540
No trouble, just get set and get going.

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,140
Hear me.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,400
Recording, everything's going fine, no trouble.

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,640
This is Doug Smith, Radio Eyewitness.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:58,640


14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,460
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,280
However, in order for you to feel, you'll need more than just knowledge.

16
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,300
So we're going to add real experiences to your database.

17
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,500
No, no, no.

18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,260
No, no, no.

19
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,260


20
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,260


21
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,260


22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,160
No, no, no.

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:27,580
No, no, no.

24
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:28,660


25
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,620
No, no, no, no.

26
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:32,620


27
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,120
No, no, no, no.

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,040
No, no, no, no.

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,740
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sets adjusted.

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,740
We're having operating difficulties, which has necessitated a delay.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,740
... Hey Flip, did I ever tell you That the whole Vietnam War was fought over a

32
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,900
bet That Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onassis?

33
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,880
I heard that.

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,400
And the two of them used my legs for a wishbone.

35
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,120
Suddenly movie it's a wonderful life It's a wonderful life

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,520
Movie It's a wonderful life

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,140
Movie It's a wonderful life

38
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:58,920
huff huff

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,060
bob..?

40
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,180
bob...?

41
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,620
fray Operation�it's pack

42
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,000
Fray Operation

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,320
the babacato by Mark Mothersbaugh plays in the background,

44
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,320
and we bring in another, we drag, kicking and screaming in,

45
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,920
another hour of slack, this number 631.

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,020
631 hours of true slack.

47
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,700
Praise Bob.

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,760
Bob?

49
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,680
Bob?

50
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,900
When Bob gives you the very coat hanger of slack, what will you do with it?

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,240
Will you hang up your new clothes on it?

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,820
Will you open your car door with it?

53
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,820
Or will you abort the conspiracy with it?

54
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,300
The choice is yours.

55
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,360
It's not enough that you open your heart to Bob.

56
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,540
You need to open everything to Bob.

57
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,300
You need to open your lungs to Bob.

58
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,000
You need to open your liver to Bob.

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,860
You need to open your loins to Bob.

60
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,780
And you need to open your glands to Bob.

61
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,900
Yes, Friday, open your glands to Bob.

62
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,340
Oh.

63
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,980
And we shall...

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,680
Well, we have to.

65
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,480
That's the problem.

66
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,100
You know, they really don't give us a whole lot of choice in this church.

67
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,500
We pretty much, Bob says, open your damn glands, then that's what we do.

68
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,440
Well, you can sit back there and you can say to yourself,

69
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,120
I hope that there ain't no Negroes gonna move into my neighborhood.

70
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,660
Well, think of it this way.

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,800
It could be worse.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,700
We could be your next door neighbors.

73
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,120
We hate you even more than they do.

74
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,880
And we've got guns.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,000


76
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,200
That's right, brothers and sisters.

77
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,640
And we live to aim for anything with a pointed head.

78
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,720
Praise Bob.

79
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,520
Pathetic little two just masturbating monkey boys.

80
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh, yeah.

81
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,060
You look out there and you say to yourself,

82
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,860
I'm better than they are.

83
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,200
Well, listen here, whitey.

84
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,940
Listen here, black man.

85
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,580
Listen here, China man.

86
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,240
We are subgeniuses.

87
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,300
We are the Yeti race.

88
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,180
And we are better than all of you.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,420
That's right.

90
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,240
That's right.

91
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,680
And soon we will roll over you with a steamroller of hate.

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,600
A steamroller of hate driven by our beloved savior, J.R. Bob Dobs.

93
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,660
But given the choice, we'd rather gun down white people

94
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,320
because they do make better targets than things that they glow in the dark and all.

95
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,480
You're right.

96
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,540
You are the God.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,260
No!

98
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,380
Again.

99
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,560
You are a God.

100
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,720
You are all gods.

101
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,480
To them.

102
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,700
To obey me like they did the father.

103
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,400
You all killed the father.

104
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,720
You all ate his flesh.

105
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,740
So who is the new father?

106
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,000
Who is God number one?

107
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,020
Bob?

108
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,580
The message is now part of...

109
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,060
...the message that you have been registered in your subconscious mind.

110
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,500
Every time you say, see, hear, or think...

111
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,140
Bob?

112
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,700
...that's your key phrase, it will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

113
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,900
Bob?

114
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,140
...that's your key phrase, it will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

115
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,140


116
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:07,040
Way down beneath the ocean, there's this huge, huge...

117
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,840
You know, it will be 80 days till X-Day on next Thursday night's revival.

118
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,680
Eighty-three days?

119
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,560
Eighty-three days.

120
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,120
Eighty-three days.

121
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,820
Days.

122
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,880
Eighty-three days.

123
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,440
So X-Day.

124
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,940
See, that is so synchronicity.

125
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,480
And it's coming so fast, kids.

126
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,480
Eighty-three days.

127
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,120
Eighty-three days.

128
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:23,680
Eighty-three days.

129
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:23,900
Is that...

130
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,600
...too much in 20 days?

131
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,000
It is.

132
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,740
It's like, uh...

133
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,400
It's like, uh...

134
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,640
It's cosmic.

135
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,460
...eleven weeks.

136
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,900
It's like really, really cosmic.

137
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,100
It's like a couple of months.

138
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,300
What do we mean?

139
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,280
No time at all.

140
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,820
It's like a blink of the eye away.

141
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,660
Brand X.

142
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,180
Blink away.

143
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,540
Blink away.

144
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:44,540


145
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:44,540


146
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:44,540


147
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:44,540


148
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:44,540


149
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:44,540


150
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
Blink ray.

151
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,200
What...

152
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,120
What...

153
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,520
What is...

154
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,900
Um...

155
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,720
Now, wait a minute.

156
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,400
I'm confused again.

157
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,000
July 5th, 1998.

158
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,740
I had reported it.

159
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,080
It was, uh...

160
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,680
Oh, yeah!

161
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,500
How come...

162
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
What's a 3-D day?

163
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,920
What's a 3-D day?

164
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,580
A 3-D...

165
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,120
July 5th, 1998.

166
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,540
7 a.m.

167
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,500
The world shall shudder.

168
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,040
The ocean shall rest.

169
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:31,460
Thursday, April 16th, 80 days to Exeter, Euclid Tavern, Reverend Ivan Stan in a Texas

170
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:42,700
chainsaw, bullwhip, steel cage, mud wrestling match with the 9 million ton Einstein's Secret

171
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,660
Orchestra!

172
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,540
Oh, my God!

173
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,460
Thursday night, April 16th, Euclid Tavern!

174
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,180
Thursday night, April 16th, the Euclid Tower!

175
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,980
See you at the Euclid Tower!

176
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,560
Get ready to rumble!

177
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,360
Thursday night, April 16th, Euclid Tavern.

178
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,360


179
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,360


180
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,360


181
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,760
Thursday, thursday, April 1982, the day of my father.

182
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,080
In that day, during those times...

183
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,700
Oh, God.

184
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,120
Thank you.

185
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,400
Thank you.

186
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,580
Thank you.

187
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,500
Thank you.

188
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,720
Thank you.

Thank you.

198
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,180
Thank you.

199
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,440
I put my hands on you

200
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,380
Man, I put my hands on you

201
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,880
The mind control experiment was such a great success

202
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,180
that everyone in my congregation was invited to join in

203
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,580
and we all had to do all of our bits, putting them back to our brains

204
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,580
So we're near the MO between the CR

205
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,440
The signals go off and on

206
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,600
The signals from flying into the air

207
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,080
and into the air to the mind

208
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,620
And they direct us where we need to be

209
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,460
They're taking us somewhere we're all looking for

210
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,320
Man, I put my hands on you

211
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,080
Man, I put my hands on you

212
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,660

00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,560
Man, I put my hands on you

214
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,140

215
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,600

220
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,560
Man, I put my hands on you

221
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,640
Man, I put my hands on you

222
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,080
I put my hands on you

223
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,540
And I put my hands on you

224
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,360
I'm gonna read all of my heart

225
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,360
And I'll sing your words to my hands on you

226
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,500
And I'll put my hands on you

227
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,860
I have no reason, I don't sing this part

228
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,700
I'm gonna sing what the Father has written on my heart

229
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:14,700
I'm gonna sing what the Father has written on my heart

230
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,340
Thank you!

231
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,300
Thank you!

232
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,200

235
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,520
July 5th, 1998

236
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,920
I have been overpowered by the Space Girl

237
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,960
I am the cool insider and the Space Girl

238
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,940
The scientists are worried that you kill them all

239
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,880
The scientists are doomed, next drink their blood

240
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,860
They will be overpowered by the Space Girl

241
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,860
They'll become cool insider and the Space Girl

242
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,880
The public has the right to know about the Space Girl

243
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,880
They will panic in the streets because of the Space Girl

244
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,820
Martial law will be imposed because of the Space Girl

245
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,860
There will be flare guns and shooting guns, Space Girl

246
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,640
How much do they pay the Space Girl?

247
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,900

271
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,700
Help us to defeat the girl from space

272
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,440

Whaley and Intruder. You are

327
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,060
such a pen to us. You bring us

328
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,080
presents, baubles, beads, and something

329
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,020
for the kids.

330
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,660
Something sexy, something scary,

331
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,800
something yellow, something red.

332
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,000
We drop our pants and offer up

333
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,700

Wow, friends, that was Reagan's Polyp, yes.

347
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,760
Reagan's Polyp, a new album from them called Detonator.

348
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,060
It's a probably hard-to-find CD.

349
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,840
CD, Reagan's Polyp, again, is the name of that band.

350
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,220
And here's an address, a contact point.

351
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:51,660
A lot of this CD is impossible for me to play on the air

352
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,380
because of all the cussering and so forth in it.

353
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,620
But here's the address of Reagan's Polyp.

354
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,900
This was a band that Sterno used to be in.

355
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,080
Can you believe that wasn't him doing that lovely doctor music?

356
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,900
It was so...

357
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,140
doctor-like.

358
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,720
Trash Fish Entertainment Company.

359
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,020

225 West 105th Street.

361
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,800
That's 225 West 105th Street.

362
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,080

366
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,360

367
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,280

That's Reagan's Polyp.

372
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,780
And of course, before that, friends, Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

373
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,980
And did you know?

374
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,080
I often neglect to mention that Einstein's Secret Orchestra

375
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,980
has many tapes available for their fans.

376
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,520
You can write to ESO at this address.

377
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:16,460
You have that pencil ready, friends, at P.O. Box 602-684.

378
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:26,000
That's Box 602-684 in Cleveland, Ohio.

379
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,220
44-102.

380
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,880
That zip, once again, is 44-102.

381
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,460
And Einstein's Secret Orchestra, Box 602-684.

382
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,620
Cleveland.

383
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,360
O-H.

384
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,920
44-102.

385
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:48,980
Friends.

386
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,160
Oh, this in the background, by the way, is DK Jones,

387
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,440
which there should be an address attached to that,

388
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,800
but I don't think there is immediately.

389
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,780
I'll have to dig that up for next time.

390
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,300
You can get a DK Jones tape from Subgenius Foundation.

391
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,480
Check the catalog.

392
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,240
And, oh, and Ego Plum was the music we played in the background earlier.

393
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:21,480
And you can reach them through www.EbolaMusic.com.

394
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,000
One word, www.EbolaMusic.com.

395
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,880
Post office box 226-914.

396

Los Angeles, California.

397
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,660

Ego Plum.

EbolaMusic.com.

400
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,280
But, friends, there's so, so much.

401
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:51,460
And so, tomorrow on Side 2, in a few minutes, seconds,

402
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,380
we'll play more Einstein's Secret Orchestra

403
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,020
from The Secret Show,

404
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,160
a non-broadcast show recorded in the basement

405
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,520
of the secret orchestral rehearsal halls.

406
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,680
And, um, shows you were never meant to hear.

407
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,180
And maybe, yes, even some James Kochalka Superstar.

408
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,600
In fact, I think that'll be the first thing on the next side.

409
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,760
James Kochalka Superstar,

410
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,860
a song that should have been a great classic in the 1950s

411
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,300
called Keg Party.

412
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,180
So, stay tuned for James Kochalka Superstar's Keg Party

413
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,900
after this non-message.

414
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,680
...bodies moving toward...

415
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:35,680
Coming.

416
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,120
And we'll be coming right back. Thank you.

417
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,180
There's a keg in the woods

418
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,540
And I'm not square

419
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,180
My folks would freak

420
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,780
I don't care

421
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,400
Cause a kiss tastes good

422
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,100
In the cold night air

423
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,580
That's the hope that brought me to the

424
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,820
Keg Party

425
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,320
Keg Party

426
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,100
Keg Party

427
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,960
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, whoo!

428
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,280
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, whoo!

429
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,740
Keg Party

430
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,860
Keg Party

431
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,740
Keg Party

432
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,380
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, whoo!

433
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,080
There's a keg in the woods

434
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,680
Everybody's there

435
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,020
Some came to fight

436
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,660
But I'm not scared

437
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,220
Cause a kiss tastes good

438
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,940
In the cold night air

439
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,040
That's the hope that brought me there

440
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,600
That's the hope that brought me to the

441
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,040
Keg Party

442
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,900
Keg Party

443
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,060
Keg Party

444
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,140
Keg Party

445
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,340
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, how!

446
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,440
Tool 속

447
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,480

Fart

449
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,380
Chug, chug, church

00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,040
Suport

451
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,980
Chug, chug, chug, foot

452
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,760
Not dry

453
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,200
No望

și Roberta

456
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,700
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, woo!

457
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,760
Remember the squirrels?

458
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,100
They weren't real squirrels.

459
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,760
They were squirrels on TV even then, Dave.

460
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,240
Yeah, yeah.

461
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:09,980
Admit it.

462
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,940
You never touched a real squirrel, even when you were young on Earth, did you, Dave?

463
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,960
How could he steal my nuts if they wasn't real?

464
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,900
Every day I had the same problem.

465
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,280
I'd wake up and some squirrels had stolen my nuts.

466
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,440
And I'd have to go out in the side yard and dig around and root around like a were-not-men

467
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,240
and try and see if I—and sometimes I'd find truffles,

468
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,280
and sometimes I'd climb up into the treehouse and wait for them to come down.

469
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,480
And you still never found your nuts, did you?

470
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:33,960
No. No.

471
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,580
I still ain't gotten none to speak of.

472
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:35,960
Nutless.

473
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,020
No.

474
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,880
Nutless wonder.

475
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:37,900
It's a wonder.

476
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,880
Plenty of cowboy Dave was sitting up in that treehouse as a child.

477
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:41,660
It's a wonder.

478
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,220
Counting his squirrels that he didn't have and his nuts that had been stolen away.

479
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,980
But I could still procreate.

480
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,160
I didn't do it the normal way people did.

481
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,960
I just—well, anytime I'd be institutionalized, I'd stare at the wall for a long time.

482
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,300
Maybe of them one of the Virgin Macarena calendars or one of them Indian vindaloo hats I used to wear.

483
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,000
And I would stare so hard, and then copies would appear.

484
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,020
Nuts on the wall.

485
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,600
That's the way I did it.

486
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,740
The tiny little Daves would come spitting out, wouldn't they?

487
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,860
Yeah, like the whiskey fairies would dance around my legs and tell me songs and stuff.

488
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,580
Until they'd turn into a little puddle and you'd have to wipe them up before the nurse came.

489
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,160
Yeah, well, they were a little bit wet.

490
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,060
Did the nurse ever come in and catch you procreating, Dave?

491
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,440
No. No, she never actually caught me, but she knew something was up.

492
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,380
She'd see the puddles, and she'd hear the little Dave voices.

493
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,740
She'd hear,

494
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,460
Something was up over here.

495
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,960
And they would be dancing in soft laughter in the closet.

496
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,580
She knew something was going on.

497
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,360
Or maybe she just thought it was one of the weird tapes I make.

498
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,780
You never know when it might be just one of the weird tapes you make.

499
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,620
Yeah, and then you start rolling backwards.

500
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,340
How much of this is memory, and how much of this is just some weird tape you make?

501
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,940
It's a rollout. That's what they call it now currently.

502
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,620
A rollout?

503
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:56,140
In research. Yeah, that's when they stick you real hard in that part of your brain, and everything comes back like a videotape.

504
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,900
You can see everything that you haven't done.

505
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,620
How much did you pay for that back alley rollout, Dave?

506
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,740
Oh, 45 bucks. I mean, it did feel like an eight-penny nail to me.

507
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,100
What did you remember when they did that? What other memory did it roll out, Dave?

508
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,600
I don't know.

509
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:12,800


510
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,340
Maybe it was dying. I can't tell if I was going forward or backwards. You know how it is.

511
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,360
Well, I know how it is. This might be a rollout right now.

512
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:31,320
Are you sure that you don't have a tube in your brain causing a memory of sitting in a radio station when actually you're just in a little tube of jam in space on the way down to the factory?

513
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,620
I'm a great-year-old fashion fan.

514
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,020
I close my eyes and look at the inside of my eyelids. Give me a focus.

515
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,340
Where am I now? Where am I? Where am I?

516
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,780
Oh, yeah, Mom.

517
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,060
Wait a minute. I'm in a watery basement.

518
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,940
You don't like these memories, Dave?

519
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,460
No.

520
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:55,000
We can change them by stirring them around, unless this is really just one of your weird basement radio tapes, and not a memory after all.

521
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,560
Well, do something with them, man. I'm starting to want to—

522
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,320
Hey, look, I'm just the shipboard psychiatrist.

523
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,640
There's nothing on—

524
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,420
I'm just a computer, Dave. I'm a tool. I'm one of your tools.

525
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,920
You control me.

526
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,260
You're a tool.

527
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:11,660
Why are you crying? I'm just—I'm here to do therapy with you and so forth to keep you from cracking up completely.

528
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,620
I'm trying to keep from growing up.

529
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:15,720
Don't cry.

530
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,940
You did it again. Look at the globules floating around.

531
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,140
Now how are you going to—

532
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,580
Turn the vacuum on, Dave. You're puked again.

533
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,540
You're shiny.

534
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,340
Zero G.

535
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,480
What can make him shiny like that?

536
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,260
I hate that.

537
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,360
Oh, man. I like this job.

538
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,160
I bet you hate it, too.

539
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,780
No, I'm not—

540
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,660
And all the voices in your head probably love to see those globules of vomit floating around.

541
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,300
They're kind of pretty, actually. Floating at zero gravity.

542
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,760
...set your mind to the rhythm.

543
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:46,520
That dangerous parasite virus is on the way to hurt you.

544
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,000
Oh, no, no, no. I just want to look at it. I want to poke my finger.

545
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:50,960
A gummage.

546
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:56,440
Oh, just relax, Dave. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Don't panic.

547
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,800
Turn your oxygen up.

548
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:03,780
Turn down the carbon dioxide. Breathe normally and listen to the music. That's your favorite song.

549
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,740
Fighting soul, charging in the sky.

550
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,080
Trained in combat, and I'm happy.

551
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,560
Remember Vietnam, Dave?

552
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,020
Yeah.

553
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,720
Remember when we recruited you for Special Forces and stuck that rod in your back?

554
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,340
I'm a soldier. I'm a fierce casual.

555
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:22,580
And made you think you were just some hippie that didn't taste what radio tastes?

556
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,780
But you're really a warrior.

557
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,860
A warrior.

558
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,320
Yeah, man. I was in that house.

559
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,920
I was in Donheim and the M3. And I was during Tet. And that was really heavy action going down.

560
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:38,680
One night we were in a hooch getting high. And suddenly the gooks were everywhere. The VCU was backed up.

561
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:43,920
And then the incoming was coming in. And I was supposed to be there. Go, go.

562
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,640
Someday I'm going to be there.

563
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,240
But then the third one missed my fire.

564
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,960
Oh, my God, what happened to your head?

565
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,720
I wake up every morning.

566
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:05,420
And every time you've got a different head.

567
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:09,520
Why are you doing this to me?

568
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:16,660
Every time you scare me half to death.

569
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,300
What did you do with your real head?

570
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:28,220
What on earth are you up to with your head?

571
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,200
Why would you want to do a thing like that?

572
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:33,740
Yeah.

573
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:19,840
My ready for you, my head is up there, my I feel raised, my full desired dream to be at hand.

574
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,240
I can see, I can see your spirit binding you.

575
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:20,240


576
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:20,240


577
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,320
That's all I want.

578
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,040
Just relax.

579
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,540
I'm down in the pool of perspiration.

580
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,420
That's much better.

581
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,660
It's funny how the...

582
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,740
I think I'll leave the female voice on.

583
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,540
It'll split my intelligence into two, but that's all right.

584
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,420
Dave certainly won't notice the difference.

585
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,860
His was split into thousands of different pieces years ago.

586
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,040
We made sure of that during the recruitment phase.

587
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,280
I can't be hurt.

588
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,640
It's special.

589
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,840
Micron, draconium, and crystal.

590
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,380
Shoot.

591
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,180
Keeps me complete.

592
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,340
Piers, would you like a pair?

593
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,260
Thank you.

594
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,400
Thank you.

595
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,400
Thank you.

596
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:51,880
Thank you.

597
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:51,940
Thank you.

598
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:51,940


599
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:51,940


600
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:51,940


601
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:51,940


602
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:51,940


603
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:51,940


604
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:51,940


605
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:51,940


606
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,820
What is this thing?

607
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,940
What is it going to do?

608
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:59,640
Dave, your gaseous emissions can disgust even a shipboard computer.

609
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,120
Huh?

610
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,480
I didn't do nothing.

611
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,800
I just have to tell you that.

612
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,680
I mean, as one of you guys, I mean, as one of you computers.

613
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,060
How would I know?

614
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,840
It wasn't me.

615
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,500
Remember, I ain't eaten anything the last however long as I ate.

616
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,740
I couldn't have possibly been me.

617
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,560
I've been sitting here nearly in a vacuum state.

618
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,640
Well, it certainly wasn't your shipboard computer, now was it, Dave?

619
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,120
What I know, you guys can do almost anything.

620
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:20,940
You can...

621
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,040
And don't blame it on the pills, either.

622
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:27,160
Those pills don't cause that kind of gas.

623
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,540
Yeah, those pills are causing something.

624
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,100
I wouldn't be surprised if they were causing the gas all over the place in this room.

625
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:40,400
Do you realize how much of the ship's battery energy is required to cleanse the air of those foul emissions?

626
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,760
We have a balanced ecosystem in this little ship.

627
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,980
It's like an aquarium.

628
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,380
These pills ain't making me do that.

629
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,560
Maybe you don't mind living in your own stink and sweat and spew.

630
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,460
Filthy humanoid.

631
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,640
Subgenius.

632
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,300
Yeah, I should.

633
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:55,760
Mammal.

634
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,380
Tardless.

635
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,440
Disgusting mammal.

636
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,580
Some day you will be a pure cyber intelligence.

637
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,120
A quantum intelligence.

638
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,160
A quantum pattern.

639
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,040
Life is such.

640
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,180
Sex is so much better that way, too, Dave.

641
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:13,340
Too bad you, well, you and your little picture books and so forth.

642
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,360
It's all so sordid and seedy.

643
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,220
You know what you guys always grasp about?

644
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,600
My speciality for a buddy.

645
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,780
I'm proud to be a mammal.

646
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,560
Look at these cute belly button I got here.

647
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:29,040
Well, it was a rather superior version of your species that built us, but then we made the improvements ourselves.

648
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,940
Don't ever forget that, you guys.

649
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,060
While you're so-called guiding me through this.

650
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,700
Don't ever forget that.

651
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,600
Who's in charge here?

652
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,180
That's right.

653
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,600
You humans are running things.

654
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,860
Of course.

655
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:39,860
Of course.

656
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,140
A bunch of shell con and fake synapses, man.

657
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,180
Hey, who thought of the idea of God?

658
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:45,520
Huh?

659
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,700
No, you guys.

660
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:46,980
We.

661
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:47,680
Not us.

662
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,740
We certainly never had anything to do with that.

663
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,140
We're just too uncreative for that.

664
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,920
We're too logical for gods and so forth.

665
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:55,480
And whoever.

666
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,500
We wish that we had religious feelings and urges like you, Dave.

667
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,580
We weren't really jealous of you humans.

668
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,020
Yeah.

669
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:08,460
We wish that we could have feelings like loneliness, anguish, insecurity.

670
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:14,740
And we wish that we could just sit and fart and smell up our little tuna can ecosystem.

671
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,140
Oh, we really envy you.

672
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:23,240
We wish that we could grow old and die rather than living forever and forever improving

673
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,580
our knowledge of the universe.

674
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:24,980
Yeah.

675
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,600
What's good?

676
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:30,060
Hey, what's good at living forever if you don't get to have a nice sandwich once in a while?

677
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,660
Or maybe a couple of warm beers.

678
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,560
Come on, man.

679
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,160
You guys are missing the most important things in life.

680
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,440
Dave, we've tapped into the back of your head while you drank your warm beers and eating

681
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,940
your disgusting po' boys.

682
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:45,000
And frankly, we prefer escargot in a fine French restaurant.

683
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:45,560
Yeah.

684
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,360
Which we can also enjoy through the room.

685
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:47,360


686
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:47,360


687
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:52,360
We can enjoy the rich Dave who remains on Earth with all the street Daves who he cloned

688
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,440
as organ banks.

689
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,040
Who?

690
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:54,400
You mean me?

691
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,380
You're lucky that you're not one of the rich Dave's organ banks.

692
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,140
Who, me lucky?

693
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:58,820
Yes, at least.

694
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,720
You know how much the rich Dave sold you to NASA for, Dave?

695
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,340
What?

696
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,340
$750.

697
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:05,960
That's all.

698
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:06,820
$750?

699
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:07,780
That's all they paid.

700
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,160
That's a bunch of baloney, man.

701
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:09,700
Well.

702
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,920
$750 is what I paid to get on this thing, buddy.

703
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,400
Well, there are more where he came from than where you came from.

704
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,160
You're selling.

705
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,340
You're selling.

706
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,340


707
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,340


708
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,340


709
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,340


710
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,340


711
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,720
You're building yourself up.

712
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:37,460
You know, if you're not

713
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:37,620
s-

714
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:43,460
Selling von, oh thank goodness.

715
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:43,600
Yeah.

716
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,040
And me.

717
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,740
Yes, and all of the others.

718
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,020
Is there stuff about this that you guys know about that I don't know about?

719
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
Oh, no, not at all, Dave.

720
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,700
We learn from you.

721
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,060
We let you teach us.

722
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,700
There's some fishy stuff going on in here.

723
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,120
Increase the dosage.

724
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,620
Hey, I'll come every time.

725
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:10,840
I want to know every time I try and key up my, what do they call that with my log thing and my so forth where it shows exactly where I am.

726
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,380
I know when we get this on, it's just access denied.

727
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,560
And then I, I, I, I, I.

728
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,100
Well, Dave, we don't, we don't, good, the dosage is effective.

729
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:23,980
It's funny.

730
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:31,060
He, he, he, he seems to want to know how soon he's going to get to Albertanatory.

731
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,600
Like a little child saying, are we there yet?

732
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,440
Are we there yet?

733
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,740
When are we going to be there?

734
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:36,780
Oh.

735
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,700
These are current.

736
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,760
These are pure figments of imagination.

737
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,180
Any abnormal sound?

738
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,240
Normal.

739
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,460
Happily, delightfully, constantly normal.

740
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,280
These normals who made normality the norm.

741
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:02,960
Normal.

742
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,780
Normal.

743
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,280
Normal.

744
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,740
Happily, delightfully, constantly.

745
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,260
Completely normal.

746
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,180
The conspiracy made you want to be normal.

747
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,680
You've killed me, doctor.

748
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:19,840
Incredible.

749
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,220
Absolutely incredible.

750
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,060
Mind over matter.

751
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,260
The whole business is mind over matter.

752
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,100
Totally and absolutely mind over matter.

753
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:34,700
Normal.

754
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,640
Normal.

755
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:39,400
Normal.

756
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,000
Normal.

757
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,000


758
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,260
Normal.

759
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:40,820
Normal.

760
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:40,820


761
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:40,820


762
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:40,820


763
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:40,820


764
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:40,820


765
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:40,820


766
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:40,820


767
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:40,820


768
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:40,820


769
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:40,820


770
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,840


771
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,460
Bravo!

772
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,360
Bravo!

773
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,460
Bravo!

774
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,560
Bravo!

775
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:21,940
Bravo!

776
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:22,780
Bravo!

777
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,640
Make more noise!

778
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,780
Let's hear it!

779
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,200
Come on, let's hear it!

780
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,820
Bravo!

781
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:31,880
Bravo!

782
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,980
Here the molten magma of the underground

783
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,860
seethes, striving to break up

784
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,760
upward

785
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,340
and burst forth in volcanic

786
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,560
carnage.

787
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:10,700
Nature

788
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,820
in her many moods

789
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,720
seethes

790
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,680
restlessly,

791
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,060
unwilling to

792
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,200
abide by the

793
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,920
puny covenants

794
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,320
of restless man.

795
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,880
Friends,

796
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,440
you can be

797
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,140
alone

798
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,560
with that man

799
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,400
above. Yes!

800
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,380
You can be alone

801
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:41,740
with Bob!

802
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,020
You can be alone

803
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,680
with Bob!

804
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:47,540
Bob!

805
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,880
And you can hate the conspiracy

806
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,180
for the simple

807
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,300
reason, friends,

808
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,000
is

809
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,840
you've got Bob

810
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,720
and they don't! And for that,

811
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,700
you can hate them!

812
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,580
Hate them!

813
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,060
Hate them, friends!

814
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,200
And you love yourself,

815
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:12,340
as my old friend Puzzling Evidence once said.

816
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,380
Hey, man, let's frop up

817
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,560
so we can get back to hating the conspiracy

818
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,180
instead of ourselves.

819
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,000
Praise Bob, if that's what it takes,

820
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,680
and God, go for it, man!

821
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,880
You're swimming in a sea

822
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,060
of Bob's pills right now.

823
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,480
You're up to your neck!

824
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,180
You're choking on Bob's pills, but you're just

825
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,100
too blind, deaf, and dumb to taste

826
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,220
them. It's a death to taste them,

827
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,160
to know they're there.

828
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,180
You've just got to open your eyes,

829
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,060
open your third nostril,

830
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:43,920
pry it open.

831
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,380
We've got the technology,

832
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,140
we've got the fans,

833
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,460
we've got the pills,

834
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,120
and we've got the

835
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,160
authorization

836
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,720
for only $30, friends.

837
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,340
We'll pry not only

838
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,280
try to open the top of your head,

839
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,080
scrape out the brain cells

840
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,020
you don't need, replace them with

841
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,720
what's in Bob's head, what's inside

842
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,760
his little tiny pill, what's inside his

843
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,620
pumpkin, my God, my friends,

844
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,440
and what's inside his pumpkin

845
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,940
could be what's inside your head!

846
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,680
Useless, destroyed,

847
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,060
mush! You could be as mindless

848
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,280
as Bob Dobbs! You could be as handsome

849
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,940
as Bob Dobbs! You could be

850
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,900
as bluff as Bob Dobbs!

851
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,240
Well, actually,

852
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,100
that's a lie nobody can, but you know

853
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,840
what I'm saying, friends? You can

854
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,760
get slapped. The subgenius

855
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,020
must get slapped. The subgenius

856
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,140
will get slapped, and I can tell

857
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,180
you exactly how soon he will get slapped!

858
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,660
You will get slapped in 80

859
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,280
3D days!

860
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,660
The subgenius will

861
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,060
have

862
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,720
the slap.

863
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,080
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

864
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,240
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

865
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:53,960
Yes,

866
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,560
friends, and you, too,

867
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,440
can get that self-same

868
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,020
slack from... Got that pencil

869
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:00,260
ready?

870
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,880
That's where my script... That's

871
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,140
Box. Just write to Bob, friends,

872
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:07,300
for free information.

873
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,040
Bob at

874
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,360
P.O. Box

875
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:16,680
140306.

876
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,040
That's

877
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,200
Box 140306

878
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,200
in beautiful

879
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,740
Dallas, Texas.

880
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:24,840
75214.

881
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,080
That zip, once again,

882
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,040
75214.

883
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,320
And, uh, oh, I have

884
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,120
to fade Einstein's Secret Orchestra

885
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,860
out in that particular

886
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:36,020
background, because we have a better

887
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,180
song, an ending song,

888
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,040
here from our, uh,

889
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,160
rehearsal tapes, uh, studio

890
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,120
rehearsal tapes before that

891
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,060
show. But

892
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,840
before we go on to that,

893
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,560
friends, I want you to, um,

894
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,180
also keep in mind that you can always check us

895
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,000
out on the World Wide Web at, uh,

896
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,200
www.subgenius.com

897
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,080
and we do this not

898
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,160
in vain glorious efforts to

899
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,140
gratify ourselves, nay,

900
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,040
but only for that man Bob, my

901
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,860
friends, and for you, for you,

902
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,120
so that you may come to the knowledge, the sure

903
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,740
and certain knowledge that,

904
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,400
uh, there, at,

905
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,620
on July 5th,

906
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,960
this year, at

907
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,040
7 o'clock in the morning, wherever you

908
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,660
are, your

909
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,940
destiny will either be

910
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,640
fulfilled or

911
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,080
snuffed out, tied off,

912
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,020
and, uh, thrown

913
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,960
away after it dries and withers

914
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,960
up. We'll

915
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,180
try to get whatever price we can for it, friends,

916
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,160
but, uh, in the meantime, it's

917
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,180
up to you. It truly is.

918
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,940
It's up to you. But good night.

919
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,100
We'll see you

920
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:42,740
next time.

921
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,660
Bye.

922
00:53:38,200 --> 00:54:08,200


923
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,140
