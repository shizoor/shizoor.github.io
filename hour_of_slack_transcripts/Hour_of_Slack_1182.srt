1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:07,160
This is station ABC, broadcasting the Thailand Review!

2
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,120
From PR news in Washington, I'm Donna Busk.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,540
Before reaching Cuba, pro-government demonstrators are demanding 30% of PR's reports.

4
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:32,440
Wrong, and 30% 23% for 418 18,000 months of PR news.

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,460
On Wall Street 53373, this is PR news.

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Residents along the Gulf Coast are preparing for the possible arrival of PR news at Denver's football stadium.

7
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,200
PR comes from social and environmental problems at home and around the world.

8
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:14,160
I caught a catch in a high-f光

9
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,200
and never took out my gloves.

10
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,820
People are acting like taxis, and in fact, people have become a slowing down country.

11
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:25,840
don't

12
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,800
If you happen to tune in within the last few minutes and you are wondering about what's going on,

13
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,540
we'd like to tell you that this is a program about

14
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,040
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

15
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,980
We want to pry into people's private lives to record anything that is really none of our business.

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,680
Look inside.

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,180
Bob.

18
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,860
I'm not afraid because I'm crazy.

19
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,300
Bob.

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,740
Protect the crazy.

21
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,220
This is the way it all started, isn't it?

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,020
Freaks like you infiltrating.

23
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,480
Scouting out the lay of the land and then you move in for the kill.

24
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,840
I'm seeing history in the making.

25
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,440
Bad but true.

26
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,080
Bob.

27
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,560
Bob.

28
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,080
Bob.

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,560
Bob.

30
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,040
Bob.

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:13,640
Bob.

32
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:13,980
Bob.

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,200
Bob.

34
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,320
Bob.

35
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,840
Bob.

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,080
Bob.

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,080


38
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:15,940
Bob.

39
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:15,960
Bob.

40
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,260
Bob.

41
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,880
Bob.

42
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,840
Broke into the house.

43
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,860
He raped you.

44
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,580
You liked it.

45
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,640
He died.

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:26,940
Bob.

47
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,100
Bob.

48
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,280
Bob.

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,420
Bob.

50
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:27,420


51
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,340
Just that noisy little…

52
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,040
Hey, let's get the microphone.

53
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,940
Well, you'd be surprised how coherent it sounds when you listen to it today.

54
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,100
We have to clean this mess up.

55
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,320
If she gets excited, this…

56
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,800
Yeah, here.

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,080
Cut the bad parts out right now.

58
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,660
Let's not even bother editing right now.

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:40,800


60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:40,800


61
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,300
Sniff, sniff.

62
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,080
Fix, fix.

63
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,740
Now it's all better.

64
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,300
Okay, here we go.

65
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,060
Let's do so.

66
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,020
Welcome to the Saturday Morning Subgenius Radio Show on…

67
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,600
Hi, Bob.

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,140
Hi, Bob.

69
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,720
Hi, Bob.

70
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,860
Or just kill me children!

71
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,200
With a tried and true video…

72
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:19,980
plan recording everything's going fine I call some Denver and us we get called

73
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:32,200
side of the earth on this program we're going to import China to Iowa and build big hills of

74
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:40,120
what's left over that's a great party down here at the studio I read somewhere once Bob got in a

75
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,880
kind of competition as it were but with L Ron Hubbard over who could recruit the most people

76
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,680
and make the most money is this true well obviously L Ron Hubbard won

77
00:03:49,680 --> 00:04:00,480
that one became here's the reason most people are dumbasses that pretty much explains Scientology

78
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:10,340
Britney Spears Amy Winehouse and so many many other all television is explained by that fact

79
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:18,660
so we wouldn't be surprised at anything the humans do yeah and it's hard for us to come up with

80
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,660
things to surprise people

81
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:28,040
yeah but somehow I always managed to get scared to death by some subgenius almost every day

82
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,760
George strolled away with an earnest and thoughtful air reappearing a few minutes

83
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,440
afterwards with a dead water rat in his mouth as his contribution to the dinner but we all

84
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,340
had good teeth so that didn't matter much as George said there was good stuff in it

85
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,280
a little too rich perhaps

86
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,560
a weak stomach but nutritious then we struck we said the rat should go in George came and had a

87
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,620
look at it all bumps and warts and hollows he said you must scream

88
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,080
presenting first of all sisters

89
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,600
listen little children when you grow up you ought to know what to sing

90
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:25,260
you'll never be a social blow up but you can show up with being

91
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,340
when you leave your toys in the room swing these intellectual melodies

92
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:42,220
through me is if you're God you swoon just keepоты

93
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,920
so

94
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,980
coming behind a crane

95
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,820
he will cloud a boat

96
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,780
poppy down

97
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,300
goodbye

98
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,000

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,000

00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,700
well christmas has other meanings hasn't it bob bob bob

101
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,500
forget about it now you should be destroyed again that's right you don't mean right now do you

102
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:27,140
it's important to us it was my fault but why what's the big deal bob you should be destroyed

103
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,960
bobs

104
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,120
You probably already heard that Dobson has been nominated to the national infamous Slack Hall of Fame.

105
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,320
Just cut me some slack.

106
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,780
The future's so scary.

107
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,460
Wah, wah, wah.

108
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,460
The future's so scary.

109
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,180
Wah, wah, wah.

110
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,960
Just cut me some slack, please.

111
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,700
Wah, wah, wah.

112
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,140
You probably already heard that Dobson has been nominated to the national infamous Slack Hall of Fame.

113
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,960
Just cut me some slack, please.

114
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,420
Will you cut me some slack?

115
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,940
Just cut me some slack, please.

116
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,420
Will you cut me some slack?

117
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,940
Just cut me some slack, please.

118
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,640
C, L, C, C, L, C, C, C.

119
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,740
The future's so scary.

120
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,320
Wah, wah, wah.

121
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,500
The future's so scary.

122
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,460
Wah, wah, wah.

123
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,440
Will you cut me some slack?

124
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,480
Norrell Preff begs for slack, friends.

125
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,800
Before that, the Psychoskeletons did Good King Bob.

126
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:09,280
And Lemur, of course, did so many of the collages, Christmas with Bob, George there.

127
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,680
Earlier in the show, we heard a Puzzling Evidence opening from KPFA, probably from the 80s.

128
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,980
The Puzzling Evidence subgenius show started in 1982.

129
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:29,640
And we have a new collagist, Reverend Sweetness McGee, who did the collage right after the titles.

130
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,680
We also had some weird bobbly sound effects up in there from Sodi.

131
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:44,100
And our background music of this kind is by Lamprey Systems.

132
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,820
But what I'm about to play, friends, is a Christmas song from the Atteries.

133
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,480
Squash in England.

134
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,100
This is our friend Reverend Diva Schematic singing.

135
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,260
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.

136
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,240
Although you'll hear there's another voice right at the beginning, which I trust you will recognize.

137
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:03,920
Praise Bob.

138
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,540
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

139
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,700
I'm Santa, and I endorse this product or service.

140
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,200
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.

141
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,600
It's Christmas time again.

142
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,680
You hear it in the songs of joy promoting fiscal gain.

143
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,760
You see it in the credit cards that platter down the drain.

144
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,620
Cause Santa's laughter mocks the poor, and here it comes again.

145
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,180
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.

146
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,900
It echoes in the night.

147
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,580
A nagging sound that makes you wonder if you've got it right.

148
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,780
Everybody lies awake and thinks there's more to life.

149
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,580
But Santa's laughter mocks the poor, and you're to blame tonight.

150
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,020
Santa, be happy.

151
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,060
Santa.

152
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,720
Santa, can't you hear?

153
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:59,740
Why don't you record as Santa at this time of year?

154
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:07,680
Santa's laughter mocks the poor, a liability that taunts you every time you turn on one of your TVs.

155
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,680
Or choose the leather option or a nice Moroccan tee.

156
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,580
Oh, Santa's laughter mocks the poor across the seven seas.

157
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,100
Santa.

158
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,540
Santa.

159
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,020
Santa.

160
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,740
Santa, you're worth about a hundred stars.

161
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:22,740


162
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,860
Santa, don't you care?

163
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:31,420
You're watchin' Santa's Porque chipa entire uniform

164
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,800
Santa's laughter mocks the poor, the catchiest of songs

165
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,060
Santa's laughter mocks the poor, the catchiest of songs

166
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,740
If everybody else is singing it, it can't be wrong

167
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,740
You hear it in the news reports of panic in Hong Kong

168
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,760
Santa's laughter mocks the poor, you've known then all around

169
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,180
Santa's laughter mocks the poor, you've known then all around

170
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,920
Santa's laughter mocks the poor, you've known then all around

171
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:49,920


172
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:49,920


173
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:49,920


174
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:49,960
Santa's laughter mocks the poor, you're watchin' Santa at a jam

175
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,880
They just don't have the clout

176
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,840
To make a difference in the way societies turn out

177
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,720
Share out all the money in the world

178
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,880
We've still run out

179
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,180
Oh, Santa's laughter mops the floor

180
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,780
Of that there is no doubt

181
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,180
Santa, we love you

182
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,740
Santa, don't you care

183
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,280
Why don't you ignore us

184
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,840
Santa, I think I'm on the game

185
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,180
Santa's laughter mops the floor

186
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,700
It's Christmas time again

187
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,180
You hear it in the songs of joy

188
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,760
Promoting fiscal gain

189
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,220
You see it in the credit cards

190
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,780
That plod down the drain

191
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,200
Santa's laughter mops the floor

192
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,680
And here it comes again

193
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,400
A credit card, Christmas, and a happy new year

194
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,740
If it's not worth anything

195
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,100
Then it's blood

196
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Worth having

197
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,500
Remember, children everywhere

198
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,020
Keep your receipts

199
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,080
Here is the Attery Squash

200
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,500
Santa's laughter mops the floor

201
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,080
Santa's laughter mops the floor

202
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,000
You can see what I look like

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,200
And what Reverend DeViskey Mata looks like

204
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,020
When you look at that video

205
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,720
It's also on MySpace.com

206
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,840
Slash

207
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,080
The Attery Squash

208
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,420
We're about to expect a call from LonesomeCowboy Dave

209
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,460
But first, The Large

210
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,120
And a little bit of puzzling evidence

211
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,420
A ho!

212
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,040
A no whiffy

213
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,920
Praise Bob

214
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,500
Yeah, I mean it's a giveaway. What can I say? We've got a special

215
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:26,340
I want you to look especially in our bargain basement. I remember that one, you know, we've got such wonderful bargains here

216
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,060
I think we all take it up for granted

217
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:34,660
But the customer comes we all use the customer is Keely Plaza here at sub genius department store

218
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:41,120
And I want each and every one of them not to forget that this job made to I'm the luckiest guy in the world to work

219
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,060
in the lingerie department of the subgenius

220
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:50,420
Of mcpartain store. Here's a rose for you. A lot of people thought it was a radio show, but it was really a subgenius mcpartain store

221
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:57,620
Yes, the ladies all the people came down to the mcpartain store and they met hard at each other not the mcpartain store

222
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,580
That's the wordles in their needles and that vulgar chain store

223
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,160
They held their grumman's over their head and whirled them around in the air

224
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,500
every Christmas we set up the model trains for the kiddies on the roof and

225
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,720
there's gizmo the clown and

226
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,080
That jolly old elf st. Nick himself really playing with your party standing there

227
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,780
in Santa's workshop children will be

228
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,820
dandled and not diddled

229
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,160
They'll be dandled around with a little can

230
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,840
They'll be falling into their diddle can with their dandle boy

231
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,040
Meanwhile mighty bargains can be heaved up from the deep

232
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:43,600
Riddling each other the sub basement where bargains reign supreme in

233
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,720
Pluto's kingdom

234
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,220
yes, and even Pluto will

235
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,520
Cord wangle his his

236
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,860
Vogel

237
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,540
He'll wangle his Vogel. He'll cord wangle his Vogel.

238
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,980
Pluto is giving a party that's where the fun begins

239
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,400
Pluto will cord wangle his Vogel. He'll donate a son and daughter to the mother of the twins

240
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,260
Beep beep beep beep do dah do bo bo be do

241
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,800
oo wa wa

242
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,840
Beep beep beep beep do dah do bo bo be do

243
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,400
oo wa wa

244
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,540
Oh the mist is frisky moon is shining way up in Maine

245
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,760
All the Eskimos are pining for this refrain

246
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,280
When the moon comes over the mountain

247
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,860
Every dream is a memory of

248
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,840
Beep beep beep do dah do bo bo be do

249
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,980

00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,700
la do da dee da dee do do dee do

251
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,100
Tch

252
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,980
Uh, yes

253
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,760
That's from a

254
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:52,420
An old cartoon called Toyland. I mean a really old cartoon

255
00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:02,220
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and we're expecting the lonesome cowboy to call in any second now. Oh, he's so well

256
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,880
Look, there's a little flashing light

257
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,060
I see his green dial now

258
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,520
Dear doctor, is it not conceivable?

259
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,900
It is conceivable that in a realm as vast as the universe, there is no one who can be the master of the universe.

260
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:13,900


261
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:13,900


262
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:25,040
There is no such thing as vast as space, as vast as infinity, that there is no such thing that there cannot and could never be such thing as an X on your forehead.

263
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,900
Never?

264
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,820
But what about sex on my forehead, Dr. Cowboy?

265
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,660
And blacks?

266
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:39,280
We don't have sex day, even though you're trying to get it a little more perked up there.

267
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,880
But it's still basically the Xs, not the sexes we have to find.

268
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:43,880


269
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,060
I'm afraid that we are going to have to have sex with the Xs, because they are the Xs, the Xs, and the Xs.

270
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,500
And they're the ones that we fear and at the same time yearn for.

271
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,680
You know, David is getting close to Christmas time.

272
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,260
Well, as an...

273
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,060
Were you aware of that?

274
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,920
As an avid follower of the crucified child, I know it's right around the corner.

275
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,640
And that's why I'm staying over here, staying away from corners.

276
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,260
Good idea.

277
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,360
90 degree, you know, blockhead.

278
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,460
They can be sharp.

279
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,580
Yep, we've all been abraded numerous times by those little pointy heads.

280
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,500
Indeed.

281
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:13,860
And we're not going to let them go.

282
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:13,860


283
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:13,860


284
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:14,780
Elves.

285
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,800
Well...

286
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,080
Pointy headed, pointy toed.

287
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,480
That's what they tell the kids, they're elves.

288
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,880
We all know they're little demonic beings who can barely hide their spindly wings.

289
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:35,200
Now, I heard that there's some sort of problem with the little elves that help make cars for the Detroit automakers and so forth.

290
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,180
They were asking for a loan and couldn't pay the elves.

291
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,520
And the elves were going to have to...

292
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,880
The elves' kids were going to have to go without college educations.

293
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:43,860
Well, they're...

294
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,440
The old elves have no healthcare and no help.

295
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,360
Yep.

296
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,800
Well, see, the deal is, some of the elves, on the corporate level, not just Santa, who's really a big fat elf himself,

297
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,240
that's the way you want to think of it too, conceivably.

298
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:08,540
That elf, as Santa, as the fattest, largest, almost human elf of all, has been made fat by the fruits of the labors of others.

299
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,060
And by the labor and the sweat on their brows.

300
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,560
So, I think there's nothing short of a revolution needed at the North Pole.

301
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,500
But, aside from that, just think of these...

302
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,060
Some of them claim to be ascended masters of the Illuminati.

303
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,360
I mean, you don't want elves with that kind of knowledge, especially in that kind of control thing.

304
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,440
I didn't know that the North Pole elves were concerned with that sort of thing.

305
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,260
Well, it's just...

306
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,080
Aside from Claus himself.

307
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,040
Well, Claus is, as you know, the master of the geomagnetic lines of the Earth.

308
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:48,100
That's why he's situated for the North Pole, and has a jolly throne there where he puts underage girls on his lap.

309
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,880
And that's how his UFO works, right?

310
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,500
Well, if you read your...

311
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:57,000
Off of the ley lines and the orgasmic radiation from using the girls?

312
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,560
Yeah.

313
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,400
Yup.

314
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,060
That's what I hope we were driving at.

315
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,780
On dancer, on prancer, on...

316
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,340
Blitzer.

317
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,160
Blitzer and Blitzen.

318
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,240
Who did Blitzen? Richard M. Blitzen.

319
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,440
He was the one with the longest, shiniest nose...

320
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,240
Of them all.

321
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,900
Because every time he told a fib, it kept growing.

322
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,040
And then a little leaf spurted out of it, and he...

323
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,920
Never mind.

324
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,500
How would you like to be a president that was famous for lying?

325
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,020
Or for...

326
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,760
Um, dribbling?

327
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,700
That's what we've got right now, isn't it?

328
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,260
Uh, the... Well, no, drooling.

329
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,900
Oh, drooling? Okay.

330
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,600
Clinton was famous for dribbling on blue fabrics.

331
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,380
You know, they don't get remembered for their accomplishments.

332
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,440
They get remembered for whatever was embarrassing.

333
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,780
Gerald Ford was lucky, because he's only famous for falling down a lot.

334
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,520
Well, I remember the... What was her name? That one lady with the funny accent?

335
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,580
Bob Lewald, who said that every president needs a little part of himself in the Oval Office.

336
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,060
And DNA tests can prove what they did with that part.

337
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,140
And it's odd markings.

338
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,620
It makes you wonder if a solemn-faced Marine wasn't facing the other way with his...

339
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,880
Like, you know, at the at-rest position while everything was going on, you know?

340
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,440
Yeah. Carry on.

341
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,080
At all times.

342
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,040
Agent Smith.

343
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:24,900
Uh...

344
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,040
Uh, choking on pretzel-wise.

345
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,380
You're choking on pretzels, too?

346
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:29,840
Yeah.

347
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,980
I... They make you hard to lugubriate when you're on a talk show and stuff, but I was just chomping on pretzels, too.

348
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,880
Now, you were supposed to be doing your homework, Dave, for your breakfast.

349
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


350
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,220
You were supposed to be doing your brainwashing class, weren't you?

351
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,620
You're not allowed to eat pretzels while you're taking your brainwashing class?

352
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,960
No, that's what I thought you...

353
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,020
No, I know.

354
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,380
You could. I mean, you're not even supposed to be calling the show.

355
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,460
You told me you had to do homework for your brainwashing class.

356
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,220
I took a nice one-hour break from that BS.

357
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:02,260
But I did learn some interesting things about the proscenium arches and, um...

358
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,480
Our, um... Well, I guess I'm gonna flunk tomorrow.

359
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,040
I guess so.

360
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,560
I guess so. That's all you know.

361
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,000
So they're teaching you modern communication, right?

362
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,900
But you have to cover proscenium arches and the Greek tradition?

363
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,620
No.

364
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,740
The Aristotelian tradition of drama and so forth?

365
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,540
Well, even in... Yes. Yes. Even in the actual communications classes,

366
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:30,120
I was supposed to learn about those freakin' Greek diner owners back 5,000 years ago, or BCE, whatever the hell it was,

367
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,240
who made up all this crap that we have to do right now.

368
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,360
And then, now in this class, which is actually a theater, or the art of theater class,

369
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,960
I have to, um, learn about the stuff even more so.

370
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,240
And they even talk about those guys. You know?

371
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,440
Now, I remember, Dave, you used to write scripts for Brain Rock Radio Theater all the time.

372
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,780
And now you're taking... You're finally getting around to taking lessons in how to write scripts?

373
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,280
All you have to do to learn how to write a script is look at the book that says,

374
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,140
How to Write a Script.

375
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,120
Go to Borders or... No, that's a commercial message.

376
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,060
Go to not any of those places.

377
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,540
Go to any of those places and get a copy.

378
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,140
Get a book that says, How to Write a Script.

379
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,260
But, Dave, you did it long before you ever looked at those books.

380
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,320
That's true. I did, Janet.

381
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,040
And for all of this, what have I got today?

382
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,720
Nothing but this photograph of Bob.

383
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,940
Oh, but that's all you need, Dave, isn't it, really?

384
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,000
I mean, not that it's gonna keep the snow off of you during the winter.

385
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,300
Well, some of the snow.

386
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,220
Well, it's a faded photograph.

387
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,300
But doesn't it bring you succor?

388
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:41,160
And the type of sustenance so much more important than a roof over your head or food in your belly?

389
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,520
That's what I thought.

390
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,760
That's what we try to tell people.

391
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,320
That's what we have to tell them.

392
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,140
The love of Bob will warm you, my friend, in the winter.

393
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,020
And it will cool you in the summer because he's so cool.

394
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,380
And when needed, we'll put a fire under your ass.

395
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,460
Yes, he's hot. He's a hot guru, baby.

396
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,960
And he'll cool your brow in those necessary times, too.

397
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,440
With the edge of a samurai sword.

398
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,760
Not really.

399
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,980
We don't do the head-launchings anymore very much.

400
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,580
Not that way.

401
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:15,800
Try not.

402
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,920
Yeah, we try not.

403
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,260
We're trying to hold the head-launchings down.

404
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,360
The inadvertent wonder.

405
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,600
You know how the kids are, though.

406
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,220
They've got it.

407
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,920
It's like they read it in Book of the Subgenius.

408
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,660
They take it all literally, word for word.

409
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,160
They can't see it metaphorically.

410
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,580
The spontaneous ones, though, are, to me, the biggest problem.

411
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,280
Not just the kids who have no respect for anything.

412
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,280


413
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,980
Even after you've told them numerous times.

414
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:46,400
It's the times when you're just walking by someplace at a park or a picnic ground or perhaps out there in Brushwood and stuff.

415
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,920
And the head of Bob just goes flying by.

416
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,820
It's just like, you know, when frogs rain.

417
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,180
Have you ever seen them do that?

418
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,440
It's never happened to me.

419
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,160
I've been in a fish rain.

420
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,940
Did you really?

421
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,640
Yeah.

422
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,200
Purple rain.

423
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,760
And I've been...

424
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,160
I was in a freak hailstorm once in Texas.

425
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,440
On a bright, cloudless, sunny July day.

426
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,940
I was suddenly pelted with dangerously large hail.

427
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,060
Well, freakish folk deserve freakish phenomena.

428
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,760
And frogs, yes.

429
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,280
Frogs have been known to fall out of the sky.

430
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,000
And little fishies.

431
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:34,380
Did they ever dress up like Jehovah One's false witnesses at your door and try and sell you things in suits and coats?

432
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:34,380


433
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:47,020
Those as well as the frogs that fall from the sky are all bait that Jehovah One and the other Elder Fisher gods of the universe use to bring us out so they can hook us.

434
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:47,900
We are being...

435
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:53,680
Well, Charles Fort said we are being fished for, but I think it's more like we're being shopped for.

436
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:54,760
Yeah.

437
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,860
Well, it's obvious.

438
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,740
And Bob is the ad agency that's trying to get... sell us.

439
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,200
Well, there's a lot of names behind that.

440
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Not just Bob.

441
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,300
It's Bob Wooderson, Witterstein...

442
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:12,480
Bob Kahn, Kahnbo, Dobbs Kahn, Dobb Kahn Kahn, Dobbs.com, dot com.

443
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,700
Hunga Dunga.

444
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,760
You left out the most important Hunga Dunga.

445
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,200
The least third of them.

446
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:18,540
Huh?

447
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,800
I forgot.

448
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,160
Connie's company?

449
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,240
Yeah.

450
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,280
Connie's Perfume Line?

451
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,640
Hunga Dunga, Hunga Dunga, Hunga Dunga, Hunga Dunga and McCormick.

452
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,220
Heh heh heh heh.

453
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,560
Heh heh heh.

454
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,280
I'm looking...

455
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,060
Here at the studio, Dave, I'm...

456
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,480
There's...

457
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,480
There are two monitors in front of the control board.

458
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,780
That monitor you're...

459
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,100
Right.

460
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,340
One of them shows the PSAs, MP3s, which I never play.

461
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,140
And the other one shows the news on Yahoo Group.

462
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,680
And here's the big headline news, featured news on Yahoo tonight is...

463
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,520
Giant Potato is Potential World Record Holder.

464
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,640
That's the headline tonight?

465
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,040
That and Save Big with online coverage.

466
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,940
Coupons codes.

467
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,180
There are so many people out west who have been waiting for the birth of this potato.

468
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,880
It's as if the Messiah were laid asleep in a manger.

469
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,940
And we can only think of this potato not only as an omen of Christmas that we're probably

470
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:23,860
gonna eat a lot of potatoes, that our Lord, if you wanna call him that, I don't know what

471
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,320
his official title is.

472
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,540
This potato may be the...

473
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,080
Right.

474
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,020
This could be like the red heifer that ushers in the second coming of the new year.

475
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,020


476
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,000
What potato?

477
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,440
Well, it could be the actual potato Christ itself.

478
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,620
I don't know.

479
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,720
A farmer from Lebanon couldn't believe his eyes when he discovered he had grown a prize-winning

480
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,380
tater on his land, he told God on Saturday, saying he was hoping to enter the Guinness

481
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,100
World Records.

482
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:57,320
This giant weighs 11.3 kilos, Khalil Semhat said at his farm in the Tyre, Lebanon area.

483
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,960
Well, don't...

484
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,000
Maybe pounds or bigger, we're using those foreign words and stuff is definitely not

485
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,000


486
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,260
an American thing to do.

487
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,740
I bet we...

488
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:10,840
You know, a lot of us think of ourselves nowadays as small potatoes, but I bet somebody in America

489
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,220
grew a much bigger old Idaho red or something.

490
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,760
Oh, this thing, there's a photo of this man holding this huge spud and it doesn't look

491
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,840
anything like a potato.

492
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,800
It's grotesque like a monster.

493
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,500
Yeah, it looks like something that fell from outer space and is gonna start growing.

494
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,840
Then it probably is a religious figure come back to haunt us.

495
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,980
Semhat 56 said he had not done anything special to cultivate it.

496
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:32,980


497
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,840
He said he had never used any chemicals, but he said he was lucky enough to find a

498
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,900
friend who helped him make love to the huge tuber in the ground in the traditional Lebanon

499
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,400
fashion.

500
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,820
That's weird.

501
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,800
I didn't know that that was the way they did that.

502
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,240
I don't think they were traditionalists at all about it.

503
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,040
From what I've read, you know, I read the Encyclopedia Bittencourt, you know, one of

504
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,380
those larger ones.

505
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,100
It's 24.9 pounds.

506
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,960
He is proud to have grown the enormous specimen on his land.

507
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:02,960


508
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:02,960


509
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:02,960


510
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:02,960


511
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,280
He's got a huge farm, which took a pounding in 2006 during the war between Israel and

512
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,660
Lebanon's Shiite Hezbollah movement.

513
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,440
So then it's a munitions potato.

514
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,080
It's a munitions mutate.

515
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,580
Mutate, by the way, is the new word for mutant.

516
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,400
A mutate, eh?

517
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:21,820
Yeah.

518
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,460
I never thought it would come to that.

519
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,440
You don't say it's a mutate.

520
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,640
That sounds so crass.

521
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,400
Isn't it mutate?

522
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,300
I'm a mutate.

523
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:26,960
Right.

524
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,940
Actually, I saw the first movie to use the word mutate, mutant in it.

525
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:32,940


526
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:32,940


527
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:32,940


528
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:32,940


529
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,060
And they didn't say mutant.

530
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,420
They said, this world seems to be populated by hideous, deformed mutates.

531
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,720
I thought, that's cool.

532
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,660
Well, that's funny.

533
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,980
I kind of like that.

534
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,440
That's different.

535
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,340
I'm tired of, you know, saying, oh, beautiful mutants.

536
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,420
This is a mutant, one of our servants.

537
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,240
No, it's like a mutate.

538
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,020
This here's a mutate.

539
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,220
We're a bunch of mutaters.

540
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,600
Mutator tot.

541
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,360
Mutator tot.

542
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,060
God.

543
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,040
What?

544
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,520
What?

545
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,180
I think there's a couple of horrible things will befall us.

546
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,820
Well, I can tell you that we have lots of things that I'm not going to look forward

547
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,080
to, because luckily I'll be dead before most of them happen.

548
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,460
But my little grandson will live to see the death of the oceans, for instance.

549
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:25,340
He'll live to see the last mountain gorilla, the last bonobo chimpanzee, or at least he'll

550
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:29,280
read about him or experience them in the virtual, plugged in reality.

551
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,940
If they even can afford to get plugged in.

552
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,720
in at that point. Yeah, well, they won't have to afford to get plugged in. They'll be plugged in

553
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,020
and charged later. And then when they can't pay, I don't know what happens when they can't pay.

554
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:48,500
The point of that Matrix movie was the humans were literally, once they were plugged in,

555
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:53,680
they were charging. They were being used as human batteries, Copper Top.

556
00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:00,380
Well, that's what I expected them to do. Actually, in reality, that's bad science.

557
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:05,360
Humans don't make that good of a battery, although they make excellent doormats.

558
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:13,060
I made a few dollars selling my internal e-ism-ism-ism-ism-ism-ism to the Matrix seats,

559
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:20,180
and I'm charging them up right now. Dave? Yes? You cut off? The way you said

560
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,940
charging up right now? See, it sounded like a cut. It sounded like I had made a bad cut.

561
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,900
Someone is beeping me, and someone beeped me again, so don't hang up on me because

562
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,360
I'm going to avoid that. I ain't doing nothing.

563
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,240
I'm going to avoid this for the next few weeks. Anyway, as you were succinctly putting

564
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,300
about bonobo monkeys being of equal importance to the world's future as the oceans, ahem,

565
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:46,400
ahem, ahem, what the hell does that mean? I wasn't saying they were equal in importance

566
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,760
to the oceans. They're much sexier than that. You can't make love to the whole ocean unless

567
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:58,660
you're Jimi Hendrix, but anybody can have a lot of fun with a bonobo chimpanzee. They're

568
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,160
not monkeys. They're chimpanzees.

569
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:00,360


570
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,360
They're apes. Great apes.

571
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,200
They go in heat like practically every 35 minutes, don't they?

572
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,400
Right.

573
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,400
They have the same estrous cycle we do, which is all the time if you want.

574
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:13,040
Right, and when they're feeling hot and sexy, there's this sort of red cabbage-y looking

575
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,960
thing that hangs from their behind. That's, no, seriously.

576
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,940
I think they've just been eating too much red cabbage.

577
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:26,280
It would make you like to puke. The chimps that you see on TV are all juveniles. A full-grown

578
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,360
female in estrous is so hot you could barely hold her.

579
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:35,580
Hold your stomach in, really. It's disgusting.

580
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:42,120
Princess Wee's laughing. It's not funny. It actually looks like that potato. The hideous,

581
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:49,660
mutated potato is what hangs off a chimpo-bonobo female's backside, and that's what turns

582
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:56,400
the boys on. And that's nature. This is science. This isn't some kind of sexy talk we're doing.

583
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,740
Well, it is kind of sexy.

584
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,060
Well, beautiful.

585
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,560
What was the allusion to cabbage, dear, that just got me, you know?

586
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:08,580
Girls like vaginal farts. I mean, they think that's the funniest thing there is. So, just

587
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,680
forget about it.

588
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,960
I'll have to take your word for that, lonesome cowboy guy.

589
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:19,000
I guess they don't all think it is, but it just seems like the other kind seems crude,

590
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:24,160
but when they hear themselves make that clapping sound like that, they can't stop laughing.

591
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,980
Or maybe they're just laughing at my body. I don't know.

592
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,760
No, it's...

593
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,140
At least you have a body to laugh at.

594
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,720
That's right. I'm not discorporated yet. At least I can slap myself on what's left of

595
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,340
my back and say, thanks, Dave, for not totally disappearing into the ether. For crying out

596
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,160
loud. Well, that's... I'm sorry.

597
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,800
It's the comparison to the vegetable, you know? Like, uh, my... mon petit chauve-fleur,

598
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,100
my little cauliflower.

599
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,220
Chou-chou-chou.

600
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,020
You know, I mean, these love vegetable names are just, you know, the cabbage and all. Just...

601
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,420
I don't know. It just got me.

602
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,060
Bon petit chou-chou.

603
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,200
I can say it more than that. It's just...

604
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,820
I asked you guys not to talk Russian behind my back.

605
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:05,180
Love vegetable names. Vegetable love names. It's just...

606
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,360
You know, I think it's really weird. One thing that's especially weird about Bonobos is how

607
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:16,720
it's like a signpost for the direction we have to go because apparently... I don't know about

608
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,120
yours, Doug. I mean, Ivan. I mean, Larry. What's your name again?

609
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,520
Larry?

610
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,200
Larry?

611
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,540
Mo?

612
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,180
Yeah, I'm Reverend Confused Larry.

613
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,040
Reverend Conferry... Conferry?

614
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,040


615
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,000
I'm Reverend Confirmed Fairy Boat.

616
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,260
Rezily Confirmed Fairy Boat, did you know...

617
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,300
What's his name?

618
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:39,500
...the sperm count of the... everything and everybody has gone down over the last 50 years

619
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:45,220
to half of what our grandpappy... our pappies and our kids' grandpappies was?

620
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,380
No.

621
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,360
No.

622
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:52,200
Speak for yourself. I just counted mine the other day and there's still one of them.

623
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,720
Well, I guess one...

624
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,440
The same one is still hanging there. That one sperm.

625
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,020
That one.

626
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,540
that's all I have left is one sperm.

627
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,700
I'm saving it for the important moment if I ever need it again.

628
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,340
Stan, you've got to let go.

629
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,040
You've just got to let go.

630
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,000
Kick it out of the nest, you're saying.

631
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,100
You're saying I should just...

632
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,700
Man, I've raised a sperm for like 10 years now.

633
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,540
I know your name.

634
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,500
And you want me to just kick it out of the nest.

635
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,040
It hasn't learned to fly.

636
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,340
It hasn't learned to impregnate yet.

637
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,040
It doesn't even know what a girl looks like without her skin on.

638
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,380
It's never even seen a skeleton.

639
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,000
And buying it all kinds of weird gifts on the wall,

640
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,000
purgish knock and all that stuff.

641
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,500
Don't you think that's a little bit too far from here?

642
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,420
I don't want to end up with empty test syndrome.

643
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,840
Yeah, but you've got to let the little guy go.

644
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,400
Just one time.

645
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,660
He'll feel better.

646
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,580
Oh, he'll feel better.

647
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,520
Well, and I understand it'll feel real good when I finally let him go.

648
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,100
But I just...

649
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,140
It's my last one.

650
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,360
You're only born with so many sperms, you know.

651
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,720
And...

652
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,660
And...

653
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,260
I'm almost blind.

654
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,500
I have to shave my palms three times a day.

655
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,720
But I've still got that one little fellow left.

656
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,320
He's mostly deaf.

657
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,460
There's not much hearing left.

658
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,000
You're claiming to have a masturbatory-originated myopia or something?

659
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,540
No, I said I've got one sperm cell left.

660
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,260
Who you call Polly Wally.

661
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,360
Polly, you know, Polly the Pollywog is my cute name for him.

662
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,680
He is a boy, of course.

663
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,760
All sperms are boys.

664
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,300
Well, I don't know what a doctor would say.

665
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,820
Where do these baby sperms come from, Dave?

666
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,020
Do they come from mommy and daddy sperms?

667
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,440
They have to.

668
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,040
I mean, if we were to be logical miscreants, we would have to think that they came from somewhere.

669
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:46,340
And it takes two to tango, at least in our species, in the whole world.

670
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,260
Unless there's some kind of cell division.

671
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,660
Maybe they're just part of another sperm that popped apart.

672
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,020
You know?

673
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,120
Could that be an...

674
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,480
An...

675
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:56,840
An...

676
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:56,900
An...

677
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,060
An...

678
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,320
An...

679
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,500
An...

680
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:57,620
An...

681
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:57,840
An...

682
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,340
An...

683
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,060
An...

684
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,160
An...

685
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,160


686
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,160


687
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,160


688
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,160


689
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,160


690
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,120
Each time, if you cut one in half, it grows into two sperms, like a planarian worm.

691
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,260
Behind every good sperm...

692
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,660
Yeah, like one of your planarium jars.

693
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

694
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,360
Behind every good sperm is a bossy, herodin-like ovary.

695
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,600
A harpy of an ovary.

696
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,000
Nagging and nagging the poor hen-pecked sperm.

697
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,160
Throwing rolling pins at it.

698
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,660
Another cartoon-like object.

699
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,540
Yeah, it's got wings.

700
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,400
Hail the ovary.

701
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,820
It's the battle of the sexes, man.

702
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,980
It's the eternal battle.

703
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:32,520
Hail the ovary.

704
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,200
But it's such a beautiful battle.

705
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,800
It's the fight that's so much fun.

706
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,420
Some people say it's a dance, but no.

707
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,160
It's more like a battle.

708
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,460
The beast with two backs, and each back is fighting for its life.

709
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,420
Ah, yes.

710
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,080
And whoever wins first has to take care of the other one afterwards.

711
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,400
That means whoever wins first loses.

712
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:55,840
Yes.

713
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,080
So that's what...

714
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,460
The political message we need to take from our sexual adventure is that

715
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:06,800
whoever wins, much like George Bushki on the flat top of the cruising thing there,

716
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,800
wearing his official uniform and so forth,

717
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,520
and the weird cryptic diagrams on his back,

718
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,020
but nobody knows about those.

719
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,720
And just like that, then it's just...

720
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,460
Ergo, it is...

721
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:21,740
Therefore.

722
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,400
Therefore.

723
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,100
I.E.

724
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,780
I.E. to it, and to wonder.

725
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,960
It is like...

726
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,120
So.

727
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,200
I don't know what was like, so...

728
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,820
Did I say it?

729
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,320
On time?

730
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

731
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,820
And you filleted on time as well.

732
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,020
Ah.

733
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,380
So everything's lined up.

734
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,000
Chop, chop, chop.

735
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,060
Dreaded and filleted.

736
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,420
Just the way it should be.

737
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:45,040
The meat of knowledge, poured out from the wisdom teat of the radio.

738
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,140
Sit back, ladies and gentlemen,

739
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,140
and enjoy the primal breakfast you used to love so long ago.

740
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,380
The breast milk of the radio airways.

741
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,600
Oh, damn it.

742
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,460
Anybody who's able to sit through this,

743
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,240
all the way through this one-hour show,

744
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,000
should get a diploma at the end.

745
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,840
All the way around the sharp corners

746
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,640
that are now chamfered perfectly for you.

747
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,840
Yeah, we try to sand off the edges of this show

748
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,260
so it doesn't hurt too much.

749
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,380
Like those other shows do.

750
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,620
Some of them actually bruise organs.

751
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,640
And we're not talking about the official organs.

752
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,200
We're talking about things that are buried deep below your pituitary thyroid.

753
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,720
But the aerosol act just...

754
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,540
It just bounces easily into your ears.

755
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,980
And it's just lovely in there.

756
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,100
Well, for some people,

757
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,360
remember my daughter says it gives her a headache.

758
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,860
Even two seconds of the hour of slack

759
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,800
gives her like a migraine, a throbbing migraine.

760
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,160
Even if it's pretty, even if it's her favorite song,

761
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,860
if it's being played on the hour of slack

762
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,520
and she hears one second of it,

763
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,380
she's going to get that splitting headache.

764
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,360
It's just a family thing.

765
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,200
A time when she was very little

766
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,540
and she had some peanut butter

767
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,920
jelly and toast and stuff

768
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,220
and was walking by you

769
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,520
and you were being irritating and annoying constantly.

770
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,420
And that is the...

771
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,240
That one moment,

772
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,700
even though your relationship was fine

773
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,520
forever of the rest of time,

774
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,320
she remembers that you are irritating and annoying.

775
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,440
Oh, that's all they remember.

776
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,100
All they remember is the time I sat on

777
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,080
the special Transformers decorated birthday cake.

778
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,640
Oh, they remember that.

779
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,540
They don't remember me picking up,

780
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,460
driving them to school on time every morning.

781
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,580
They just remember me

782
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,720
being late to pick them up

783
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,940
and take them home every afternoon.

784
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,280
They're selective.

785
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,520
You know how kids are.

786
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:31,900
Critical.

787
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,480
They're mad at you for giving them life.

788
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,220
Yeah.

789
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,740
They are.

790
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,800
They're resentful.

791
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,400
For a while.

792
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,120
Of course, once you kick them out of the nest

793
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,400
and they get a job,

794
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,280
then they love you again.

795
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,780
Like that little sperm of mine.

796
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,300
It's got that teenage attitude.

797
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,960
You know, it's in its preteens.

798
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,260
It's not really a teenager yet,

799
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,940
but already it's got to wear

800
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,260
whatever is the...

801
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,320
whatever looks like a clown outfit

802
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,360
to its parents.

803
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,860
That's what it's going to wear to be cool.

804
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,500
I hope you don't have to teach it to shave.

805
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,080
Well, their hair...

806
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,280
Sperms are hairless.

807
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,840
Oh, well, that makes...

808
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,560
At first.

809
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,180
...everything in life easy.

810
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,460
But then when each...

811
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,420
You know, every sperm starts out so innocent,

812
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,360
hairless.

813
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,260
It's pure.

814
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,880
It's got original slack.

815
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,160
But then it meets up with the ovary

816
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,220
and next thing you know,

817
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,260
it's...

818
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,260
it's...

819
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,720
it's got...

820
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,140
it has to go out and get a job.

821
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,420
It suddenly has to

822
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,840
straighten up and fly right.

823
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,980
Little sperm can't go out

824
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,640
and play pool at the bar

825
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,680
with his buddies anymore.

826
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,160
No, sir.

827
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,540
Got to stay home.

828
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,900
Do tokens sitting around

829
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,820
with little wifey, the ovary.

830
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,880
Until finally the two of them

831
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,260
turn into a great big hairy

832
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,640
screaming creature

833
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,800
called my grandson.

834
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,260
Well, then that's another form

835
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:53,940
of cell division

836
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,360
is the cell multiplication.

837
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,240
Okay.

838
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,840
See, when you let

839
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,040
little Polly Wally go,

840
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,720
one day what you're going to have to,

841
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,300
you know, you know you're going to have

842
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:02,920
to get with it

843
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,720
and make some...

844
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,460
I know, I know.

845
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,440
Eventually I'll have to cut him loose.

846
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,080
Okay, now, if he finds

847
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,920
the right surface,

848
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,260
he's going to die instantly.

849
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,280
If he finds the wrong surface,

850
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,000
he...

851
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,620
surface.

852
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,580
He's going to be absorbed

853
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,980
by one of these ovum creatures

854
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,100
that you're talking about.

855
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,680
Well, yeah, right.

856
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,320
It's like the life for a sperm,

857
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,640
their life expectancy

858
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,520
is not great.

859
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,380
They can either plunge

860
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,000
to a freezing cold death

861
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,260
on the bathroom tile

862
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,940
or maybe at best

863
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,140
use as a sort of glue

864
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,040
between pages

865
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,060
in a convenience store stroke book

866
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,800
or at best

867
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
they get absorbed

868
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,360
by the ovary woman

869
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,520
and turned into a thing,

870
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,940
a screaming, sucking thing

871
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,960
that goes...

872
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,940
...

873
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,600
...

874
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,540
...

875
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,620
...

876
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,360
...

877
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,280
...

878
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,240
...

879
00:41:59,240 --> 00:41:59,240


880
00:41:59,240 --> 00:41:59,240


881
00:41:59,240 --> 00:41:59,480
But they're so cute.

882
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,220
...and all you were looking for

883
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,360
was a fuzzy sock.

884
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,940
Are you gonna change anything?

885
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,940
How do I do that?

886
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,540
Just for a wit,

887
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,800
put your hands down there

888
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,740
and pull those...

889
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,260
and unsnap those things there.

890
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,760
Now, pull the diaper back slowly

891
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,500
and...

892
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:20,660
...

893
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:20,880
...

894
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,640
Now, to really change it,

895
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,560
you've got to make

896
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,280
and a member of the Church of the Subgenius.

897
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,640
Yes, friends, and if you're interested in the Church of the Subgenius

898
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,100
and the scientific evidence that we've been presenting tonight,

899
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,440
you can always look up subgenius.com on the Infranet.

900
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:48,480
Or you can write to Post Office Box 181-417.

901
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,400
What?

902
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,440
What?

903
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:59,300
Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

904
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,940
The Subgenius Foundation Incorporated.

905
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,020
I was always wondering about that address, Cleveland Heights,

906
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:15,420
and I thought it would be funny if it were changed to Cleveland Loads.

907
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,100
Heights, Loads.

908
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,420
You know, it's great.

909
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,100
It's kind of a double bad thing.

910
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,360
Heights, Loads, you know, high and low.

911
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:26,940
Oh, you're right.

912
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,360
Heights and Loads.

913
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,360
The Cleveland Loads.

914
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,480
Yeah.

915
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,620
No, that's bad.

916
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,700
I'm very, very bad.

917
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,900
No, I have...

918
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,440
I'm not good at calling.

919
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,540
I feel bad now.

920
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,940
It's all right, Dave.

921
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,540
It's really, really all right.

922
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,400
Everything is all right.

923
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,820
You're mostly all right.

924
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,360
You're the most all right of all.

925
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,040
All all rights.

926
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,900
I'm all right, most of all, right?

927
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,460
All right now.

928
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,160
All right.

929
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,600
It's going to be all right.

930
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,680
It's going to be all right.

931
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,180
Hey, you know what I'm worried about not being all right?

932
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:01,500
No.

933
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:08,460
If the incoming DJ, radio show, professional radio show DJ,

934
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,460
Dr. Sinister, for instance, were to buzz the new station buzzer,

935
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,980
since we're both in headphones, would we hear it?

936
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,280
How would like to inform you, Reverend,

937
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,000
staying that Dr. Sinister is in the house?

938
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:26,900
Oh, he is.

939
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,360
He's in the house.

940
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,660
Oh, well, that's so good.

941
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,720
Because while you were all occupied with talking with Dave,

942
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,460
I went down and let him in.

943
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,960
You mean you left this place and went down and came back without me even noticing?

944
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,460
I most absolutely did.

945
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,660
Oh, wow.

946
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:47,120
You know, I might as well just chop off my eyes and ears

947
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,300
and just plug my brain into the right recording devices

948
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,240
and just...

949
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,080
Just do nothing but show forever,

950
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,520
because I didn't pay any attention to anything else.

951
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,220
You said you was going blind.

952
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,540
You remember that plain as day, don't you?

953
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,920
No, I'm losing my memory.

954
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:01,980
I don't have a...

955
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,640
What are you talking about?

956
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,480
My memory's shot.

957
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,540
I don't remember telling you I'm going blind.

958
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,240
I just remember...

959
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,760
I don't even remember being able to see in the first place.

960
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,900
I can barely remember hearing.

961
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,580
I'm just guessing what you're saying.

962
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,200
For the hump and love of cripes,

963
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,540
you've said you're going blind and you're losing your mind

964
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,580
and lost your memory.

965
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,420
You can't hear.

966
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,400
You can't hear what somebody just said

967
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,320
when they poked you in the ear.

968
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:23,800
Now, go...

969
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,520
Crying, crying, crying.

970
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,520
What's wrong with you, man?

971
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,740
We're being abducted by aliens,

972
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,240
one little piece at a time.

973
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,660
I knew you were going to say that.

974
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,380
You always do.

975
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,280
Yeah, I have got an answer for everything.

976
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,660
Everything's stupid.

977
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,880
If I hadn't seen parts of you and Wee's body

978
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,640
just, like, disappearing instantaneously in front of me,

979
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,100
I would say you are full of BS,

980
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,140
but I have seen it, so...

981
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,660
It is true, I guess.

982
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,800
Uh, making something disappear isn't really the trick.

983
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,600
The trick doesn't pay off until you bring it back, you see.

984
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:01,900
That's the trick.

985
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,940
Anybody can make anything disappear.

986
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,500
But bringing it back, that's what you call the prestige of the trick.

987
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,760
That's where the golden stroke is.

988
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,040
That's where the happy lumber lies at the edge of the trail.

989
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:20,220
I don't know, something about a bird or something huge,

990
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:20,640
something huge.

991
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,340
Falcon-like bird?

992
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,200
No, two tiny little yellow chickadees.

993
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,860
And one of them dies in the cage,

994
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,340
and the other one flies around and makes the audience go,

995
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,140
oh, what a wonderful magic trick.

996
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,120
He made that bird disappear and come back.

997
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,420
But actually what he did was smush one bird

998
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,360
and release another one that looked just like it.

999
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:39,520
You see?

1000
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,680
And that is how the conspiracy works.

1001
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,660
Not just the politicos and the big businessmen,

1002
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,460
but the conspiracy in your own head does that.

1003
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,620
It holds out...

1004
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,480
It holds out two things that you can either believe this one thing that's true

1005
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,780
or believe this other thing that you like.

1006
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,480
Which one are you going to go for?

1007
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:06,440
It's kind of like a spiritual, psycho-spiritual version of Sesame Street

1008
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,680
when they say one of these things is not like the other.

1009
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,180
One of these things is not the same.

1010
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,880
And that's when you see your old mommy and daddy turn into monster heads.

1011
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,980
As a matter of fact...

1012
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,460
You have been fabricated and reused numerous times.

1013
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,500
Well, I was talking to my pappy just today,

1014
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,580
and he said, I don't...

1015
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:28,820
He goes, I don't believe anything until I need to.

1016
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,820
I thought, wow, that's pretty honest.

1017
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,020
That's pretty honest.

1018
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,840
Well, gee, that's the only one that makes sense.

1019
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,160
That explains why he likes Rush Limbaugh so much.

1020
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,140
He didn't believe anything until he wants to believe it.

1021
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:44,140
That's what it is.

1022
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:44,940
That's what it is.

1023
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:45,360
Yeah.

1024
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,200
Well, that's where old Flesh is at.

1025
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,560
I don't think Flesh even...

1026
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,480
I think he just gets that big fat check,

1027
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,100
and he's just such a hedonistic, egocentric swine.

1028
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,220
He doesn't care if the whole world goes to poopy

1029
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:02,220
while someone likes his however they can.

1030
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,400
Speaking of that,

1031
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:10,260
you wouldn't happen to have any of those little pills on you, would you, Dave?

1032
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,420
Those roll-on big, oh, kind of a Cleveland joke

1033
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,760
that older people would say roll-on big.

1034
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,120
I'm talking Vicodin, Oxycontin, Oxycodone even.

1035
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:20,620
I'll take that.

1036
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:20,720
I'll take that.

1037
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,340
Hydrocodone, whatever you got, man.

1038
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,120
V's nose, cortisol.

1039
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,960
I only need about 100,000.

1040
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,820
I'm a conservative talk show host.

1041
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,880
You know, I have pain.

1042
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:38,120
I'm going to play golf after I inject this Vicodin into my brain.

1043
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,180
Well, we should talk.

1044
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,580
Dave, I'm taking drugs even as I talk

1045
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,520
because I'm eating a mint furry jolt.

1046
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,400
Caffeine energy mint.

1047
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,900
A mint furry jolt?

1048
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,540
It's the very last one that I had.

1049
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,420
In this little can.

1050
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,540
Yes, it says what?

1051
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,520
It's furry?

1052
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,480
It says mint furry jolt of caffeine.

1053
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,620
Five equals one cup of coffee.

1054
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,420
Mint flurry.

1055
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,100
Did you ever drink like maybe four or five bottles of NyQuil?

1056
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,820
Five, six, seven, maybe ten bottles of NyQuil

1057
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,920
like in a real quick period of time?

1058
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,380
That's a lot of dextromethorpham, Dave.

1059
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,960
Yeah, it could make, you know, make sure,

1060
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:17,400
make sure that verticals get like a dizzy and stuff.

1061
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,000
Yeah?

1062
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:18,880
Yeah.

1063
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,000
I had that.

1064
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,620
I had that.

1065
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,260
I had that.

1066
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,000
Do you have that?

1067
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,000
I had that.

1068
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,360
I wish I had that.

1069
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,840
We are from Brazil.

1070
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,260
Do you have children?

1071
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,740
May I inspect them?

1072
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,820
I have that.

1073
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,860
Let me inspect your children.

1074
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,400
We are from Brazil.

1075
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,880
We are doctors.

1076
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,980
We have that.

1077
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,560
You speak English.

1078
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,740
It's the ancient language of my countrymen.

1079
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,660
And the hidden nuances are not hidden to me.

1080
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:58,680
I noticed that you said your children are fat

1081
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,160
with two dots after the,

1082
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,660
that your children are,

1083
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,560
may I inspect your fat, Dr. Weissmuller?

1084
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,700
Is that what you said?

1085
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,540
And now it's time for the obituaries.

1086
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,320
You may not inspect my children.

1087
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,620
We lost two famous monsters this week.

1088
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,440
Some of you may not know, but Forrest J. Ackerman,

1089
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,660
the editor of Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine,

1090
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,420
which was more important to many of us than the Bible,

1091
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:35,400
believe you me, and certainly more influential, died.

1092
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,280
Supposedly the originator of the title, the genre, science fiction.

1093
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:43,120
Yes, he invented the term sci-fi, not science fiction,

1094
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:48,740
but the bastardized term sci-fi was coined by Forrest Ackerman.

1095
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,420
Forrest Ackerman.

1096
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,700
I actually shook his hand one time.

1097
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,360
He was giving me a film award when I was 18

1098
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:01,260
for best amateur crappy movie at the Fantasy Fair in Dallas.

1099
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:06,820
And I was such a snotty 18-year-old that I didn't even,

1100
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,140
I felt like I'd outgrown monsters.

1101
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,200
You know how it is.

1102
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,640
It's like, well, I've discovered rock and roll,

1103
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,820
so I don't need monsters.

1104
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,600
You know, the funny thing is,

1105
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,620
I don't listen to rock and roll hardly at all anymore,

1106
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,940
but I watch a monster movie every night.

1107
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,500
See, your glands haven't really changed

1108
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,800
since that first time you exchanged glands with Forrest Ackerman.

1109
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,660
And I finally have admitted that.

1110
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:31,940
Oh, the other person who died was the great actress Beverly Garland,

1111
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:37,500
star of such movies, bulldata classics as The Neanderthal Man,

1112
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,540
It Conquered the World, Swamp Women,

1113
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,560
Kuruku, Beast of the Amazon, and Not of This Earth,

1114
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,560
as well as The Beginning of the End.

1115
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:49,920
What we might really call a B-girl.

1116
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:50,460
Yes.

1117
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,680
So we say goodbye to Beverly Garland, the B-girl.

1118
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,320
That was another movie she was in, The B-girl,

1119
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,640
versus The Wasp Woman.

1120
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,100
That was a great one.

1121
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,700
As this show gets older,

1122
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,540
the obituary section is becoming more and more

1123
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:10,240
a firm portion of the program.

1124
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,960
Every live hour of Slack, we've had obituaries.

1125
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:14,280
You're right.

1126
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,400
Because they're dropping like flies.

1127
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,620
The greats of bulldata, both advertent and inadvertent,

1128
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,760
are peeling off from this earth plane

1129
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,040
and meeting the exes prematurely.

1130
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,120
Actually, Forry Ackerman was 92 years old.

1131
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,500
Luckily, yes, he did go for a long time.

1132
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,520
But what we see is that our heroes are aging

1133
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,480
as much as some of the soft fiber in our shoes

1134
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,400
and the meaty part there.

1135
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,840
These heroes are...

1136
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,940
And the old song is,

1137
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,380
No more heroes anymore.

1138
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,200
No more heroes anymore.

1139
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,460
And that brings us to the...

1140
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,200
Whatever happened to...

1141
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,900
Well, it brings us to the end of our show.

1142
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:55,460
We, the heroes of this show,

1143
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,200
are about to die and go away

1144
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,680
and be replaced by another show.

1145
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,140
Hey, watch how you say that.

1146
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:00,540
We.

1147
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,700
In fact, I have a tape from the other show

1148
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,300
that I'm going to use to close this show

1149
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,080
because it's very apropos Christmassy commentary.

1150
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,040
So, Dave, what this means is we're going to hang up.

1151
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,520
Well, not if I hang up first.

1152
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,360
Okay, you and your hangups.

1153
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,500
Look, there he went.

1154
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,100
That was it.

1155
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,160
Is that really it?

1156
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,380
Yeah.

1157
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:24,380
Okay.

1158
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,160
And, friends,

1159
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,720
we're now going to cut to three years ago at Christmas

1160
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,680
on the Radio Synesthesia program.

1161
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,140
Thank you.

1162
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,900
I don't understand all this argument about Christmas.

1163
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,540
I never associated Christmas with Christianity

1164
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,680
when I was growing up.

1165
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,480
To me, it was always about Santa Claus

1166
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,400
and greed,

1167
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:48,640
satisfaction,

1168
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,380
satisfied greed.

1169
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,360
Yes.

1170
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:54,200
You know, the moment that you see the presents under the tree.

1171
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,800
Now, I disagree with you young people

1172
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,500
who think that there's no Santa Claus.

1173
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,040
Oh?

1174
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,740
Yeah, I really do.

1175
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,300
Because, for one thing,

1176
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,640
the time when you hear the great lie

1177
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,240
that you're, like, say, eight years old

1178
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,720
and your parents just can't bear to see you being that naive anymore

1179
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,420
and they say,

1180
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,360
you know, there's Santa Claus is really us.

1181
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,000
You probably guessed that by now.

1182
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:26,340
And it just absolutely breaks that kid's heart.

1183
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,420
That is some of the most valuable education

1184
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:32,140
about growing up that they'll ever get.

1185
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:37,780
Yes, even your parents will lie their asses off to you

1186
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,920
as if for your own good.

1187
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,820
But, you know, you remember back to those times

1188
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,020
of sparkling magic

1189
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,620
when you came down the stairs

1190
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,540
and there were,

1191
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,900
you know, those presents under the tree

1192
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,560
unless you were poor

1193
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,020
or Jewish or something.

1194
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,680
And in that moment,

1195
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,380
it was so wonderful.

1196
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,260
And then when you actually opened up the presents,

1197
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,120
by the end of the day,

1198
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,320
you were already bored with them

1199
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,640
or had broken them

1200
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,520
if you were like most kids.

1201
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:11,220
And that's another important lesson.

1202
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,540
That it's, as Bob said,

1203
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,520
it's going to be a bummer, man.

1204
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,460
It's going to be a bummer.

1205
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,420
That was really,

1206
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,480
our happy holiday thought for everybody.

1207
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,080
Well, thank you for sharing your thoughts.

1208
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:29,560
I'm planning to have merry, merry holidays as always.

1209
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,500
And we'll be playing the Christmas reruns,

1210
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,760
which is the tradition at Christmas.

1211
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,860
Actually, personally, I celebrate Mithrimus.

1212
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:36,920
You, what?

1213
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,380
I'm an old-fashioned kind of guy

1214
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,780
when it comes to the holiday season.

1215
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,660
I celebrate the birthday of Mithras.

1216
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,280
Oh, the Mithra.

1217
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:43,880
Yeah.

1218
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,660
Yeah, sure.

1219
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,060
Mithras.

1220
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,740
Well, and...

1221
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,520
His birthday was December 25th,

1222
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,100
long before Jesus got that birthday.

1223
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,280
Well, technically, as a subgenius,

1224
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,680
I'm celebrating Existlessnessmas.

1225
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:56,740
Exmas.

1226
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,980
Well, no.

1227
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,440
Existlessnessmas.

1228
00:55:59,580 --> 00:55:59,860
It's...

1229
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,780
We are Existless.

1230
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,820
The Exists have not arrived

1231
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,680
from outer space to save us.

1232
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:09,580
And this is the time of year when we go,

1233
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,140
maybe that's a good thing.

1234
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,300
Mm-hmm.

1235
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:15,420
Who knows what Bob really has in store for us?

1236
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,320
So we celebrate Existlessnessmas,

1237
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:18,620
but we...

1238
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:19,940
What am I?

1239
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,400
I don't think...

1240
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,000
Anyway, you know what I mean.

1241
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,340
And yet, I can still say Christmas,

1242
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,680
and everybody knows what I mean.

1243
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,220
That holiday that has always existed

1244
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,660
throughout Western civilization,

1245
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,580
and I guess everywhere else in the world,

1246
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,760
in the middle of winter,

1247
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,420
they always get as drunk as hell

1248
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,540
and stay up all night

1249
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,940
and do outrageous, goofy things.

1250
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,640
You know how they knew Jesus was the Messiah?

1251
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,260
And get their hearts broken.

1252
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,900
You know how they really knew he was the Messiah?

1253
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,300
This is going to sound kind of ridiculous,

1254
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,600
but I've seen some nativity scenes,

1255
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,060
and that's with, like,

1256
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,620
an anatomically correct baby Jesus.

1257
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,780
I thought it was when he got up and flew around.

1258
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,280
He was born circumcised,

1259
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,940
according to this one nativity scene I saw.

1260
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:56,360
Oh, really?

1261
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,220
I mean, I'm sure not every nativity scene says that,

1262
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,140
but, like, I saw one where it's like...

1263
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,540
Surely he is the chosen one.

1264
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:03,420
He must be, you know.

1265
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,600
It was said one would come who was without skin

1266
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,720
before being cut.

1267
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,540
That's right.

1268
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:09,860
And he didn't...

1269
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,100
He wasn't screaming.

1270
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,760
He just sat there happily,

1271
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:14,760
playing with himself.

1272
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:15,700
Yep.

1273
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,380
The little baby Jesus had discovered,

1274
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,660
the tool of the preacher,

1275
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:22,500
upon...

1276
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,380
Well, think how scratchy that hay was,

1277
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,580
and that manger and all that.

1278
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:27,560
Yeah.

1279
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,420
Yeah, and that's what gave him his masochistic streak

1280
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,440
for the rest of his life, you know?

1281
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,500
Considering that, you know, if the Trinity is really true,

1282
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,660
he chose the fate for himself,

1283
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:40,120
because it was all part of the divine master plan, right?

1284
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,380
So that means he chose to get crucified,

1285
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,880
he chose to wear a crown of thorns,

1286
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,320
all because he was in that itchy straw manger,

1287
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,360
and boy, did it feel good.

1288
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,500
Well, the part of him that was God

1289
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,940
knew exactly what was going on all the time

1290
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,300
and knew what would happen

1291
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,720
and knows what will happen all the way up to Judgment Day.

1292
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,240
And he had a severe Oedipus complex, too, you know?

1293
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,280
Because not only did he go through his entire life

1294
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,400
believing his mother was a virgin,

1295
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,860
but in fact, the only sex his mother had ever had

1296
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,360
was with him in his other iteration.

1297
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,920
You know, that's kind of sick.

1298
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,460
It's the family values of the Bible.

1299
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,880
It's a beautiful story, though, really.

1300
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:17,780
Yeah.

1301
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,040
Yeah.

1302
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,600
Well, I guess...

1303
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,460
I can go into...

1304
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:22,740
You know, when God incarnates in a human being,

1305
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,240
for him, that's like when we go to a movie.

1306
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,720
We go to a movie...

1307
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,020
Well, maybe that's kind of like slumming.

1308
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,540
For two hours, we're Indiana Jones.

1309
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,880
Yeah, that's like slumming.

1310
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:35,380
Okay, God goes to Earth, and for 30 years, he's Jesus.

1311
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,560
And that may have been one where, when it was over with,

1312
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,440
he went, whoa!

1313
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,320
Man, that was scary!

1314
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,160
Well, you know, I think I'll save for another week.

1315
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,360
You know, actually, two weeks from today will be Christmas Day,

1316
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,240
and I will be on the air.

1317
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,240
Yeah, yeah.

1318
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:49,860
I was...

1319
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,600
I'm going to...

1320
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,540
Unfortunately, I've got to be out of town.

1321
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,620
Well, fortunately for me.

1322
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,580
And so I have to leave a rerun there, but...

1323
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:02,540
So one of these days, I will tell a story of why that's...

1324
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,540
I will explain why I don't think that is such a heartwarming story,

1325
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:07,900
unless you're an absolute sadist.

1326
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,400
Well, it's a story designed for losers,

1327
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,180
because the meek shall inherit the earth,

1328
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,300
and those rich guys are all going to fry in hell,

1329
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,820
and it's okay if you're poor, because you're good,

1330
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:21,760
and you're going to go to heaven.

1331
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,340
Well, you know what?

1332
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:22,860
I say...

1333
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:23,520
It's made for losers.

1334
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,300
I say the geek shall inherit the earth.

1335
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,580
And with that, I'm afraid we're going to have to part right now.

1336
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,300
Six to an even, over and out.

1337
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,600
Over and out.

1338
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,420
Thank you very much.

1339
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:35,520
Be we are.

1340
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:35,920
Be we are.

1341
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:36,640
Be we are.

1342
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,580
Our guest there was the Reverend Ivan Stang,

1343
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:42,200
Sacred Scribe number 278, I think, or is it 273?

1344
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,260
I can never remember.

1345
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,100
One of those Sacred Scribes of the Church of the Subgenius.
