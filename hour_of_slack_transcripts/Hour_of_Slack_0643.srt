1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
My prayers aren't answered.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,200
People do not hear.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,020
God does not understand.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,580
You know, nothing's going on when I'm praying.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,400
It's because there's sin in your life.

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,660
The heavens turn to brass.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,120
God turns his face.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,940
He shuts his ears and his eyes.

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,520
And Nehemiah is saying, evidently,

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,300
God hasn't been listening as his people, the Jews,

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,760
the Hebrews, have been crying out to him.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:26,940
Him.

13
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,120
It's the same way with Bob.

14
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,240
Oh, it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.

15
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,860
I love you all, too.

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,200
Goodbye, Tin Man.

17
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,780
Oh, don't cry.

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,880
You're a rustle, dreadful.

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,860
Here's your oil, Tin.

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,800
Here's your oil.

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:56,960
Goodbye.

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,520
Now I know I've got the heart, because it's breaking.

23
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,860
Goodbye, Lion.

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,740
You know, I know it isn't right,

25
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,760
but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help

26
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,180
before you found your courage.

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,000
Are you ready now?

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,060
Yes.

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,980
Say goodbye, Toto.

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,040
Yes, I'm ready now.

31
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,220
Then close your eyes and tap your heels together three times.

32
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,260
And think to yourself, there's no place like...

33
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:39,460
Bob.

34
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,980
Knowing her fate, Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth.

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,900
On board were the Twelve.

36
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,860
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician,

37
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,680
and the other so-called gods of our legends.

38
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,640
But not...

39
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:55,880
Bob.

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,540
The gods they were.

41
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,900
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind,

42
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,020
let us rejoice and let us sing and dance.

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,720
And there was much rejoicing and singing at X-Day.

44
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,740
But we'll have to wait another year.

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,420
Hail the sex goddesses.

46
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,920
Because they did show up at X-Day.

47
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,220
A new day.

48
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,560
Yeah, we went over the rainbow into the mitochondrial yeti DNA level C.

49
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,180
Well, we're gonna have to go north and south and east and west.

50
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,260
And we gotta wait another year, yeah, but...

51
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,300
But we're gonna fill up a new pipe.

52
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,420
We're gonna wait for the sun to shine.

53
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,160
We're gonna turn around and take our time.

54
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,420
We're gonna break the seal to the other side.

55
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,720
You know, from the valley, I hear the muffled cries

56
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,140
of all them poor sheeple that we left behind.

57
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,620
And we're gonna take that next evolutionary path.

58
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,780
Yeah, we're gonna climb on those rocket ships.

59
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,980
We're gonna build the vessels if we have to.

60
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,040
We're already testing the engines.

61
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,480
We're already testing the systems needed for this trip.

62
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,020
We're on the ride, yeah.

63
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,020
Mitochondrial Eve, thanks for the ride.

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,820
We'll take it from here.

65
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,980
Walk through a rainbow.

66
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,600
No

67
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,460
You've made me

68
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,400
The ones who'd spin

69
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,400


70
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,400


71
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,400


72
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,400


73
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,400


74
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,400


75
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,340
to worry

76
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,240
All this is supposed to last

77
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,480
For what you call it

78
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:40,840
Nothing in this world

79
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:53,400
れ

80
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,360
But how can there be love without the Father?

81
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,680
He hasn't left us.

82
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,640
That is what I will tell the others.

83
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,520
I'm watching for any blinking lights.

84
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,920
I did something wrong using the computer.

85
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,040
Amazing. There it is.

86
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,940
You are on.

87
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,120
You are on.

88
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:30,760
From up here in the escape vessels, we see the Earth blinking and winking down below.

89
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,620
There are some garbled signals coming through as we look out the windows.

90
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,800
It looks like G. Gordon Gordon and Stang on the edge of a wing or something.

91
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
Eating chicken wings or something.

92
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,100
We are just sitting out here on the wing in our moon pants.

93
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,340
Sipping and playing with ourselves.

94
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,460
Sitting out on the wing of the escape vessel.

95
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,100
We are just sitting out here on the wing in our moon pants.

96
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,380
Your voice is gone, man.

97
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,460
When your diapers fill up, those moon pants are ready to chuck.

98
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,640
That is why we party in our moon pants.

99
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,420
I didn't know the radio station was going to be down by the engine room.

100
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,760
We are not in a good spot at all.

101
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,040
Let's quit kidding ourselves, you guys.

102
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's face it.

103
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,020
We are still on Earth.

104
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,700
Something went wrong.

105
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,060
We don't know what it was.

106
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,280
We are still on Earth?

107
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,800
Not much of an Earth.

108
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,800
I can't believe it.

109
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,460
I can face it.

110
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,720
X-Day came.

111
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,040
X-Day went.

112
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,620
You were tired and feathered.

113
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,120
I was a little more disappointed than most people.

114
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,660
I think you can well imagine.

115
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,120
On the other hand, I think a lot of people and a lot of subgeniuses,

116
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,040
in fact, Dr. Legume himself was saying,

117
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,560
I guess this is the end of the church, Stang.

118
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,000
I was going, what the hell are you talking about?

119
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,100
Hadn't you read Revelations?

120
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,940
I said, no.

121
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,200
I hadn't even read the book of the subgenius.

122
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,700
You know what they used to do?

123
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,980
I go to confess my sin to the Lord,

124
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,120
and the Lord said, I've already heard about it from Bob.

125
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,700
My dog's bigger than your dog.

126
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,960
My dog's smarter than yours.

127
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,820
My dog's better because he gets kennel ration.

128
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,640
My dog's better than yours.

129
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,160
During the past few weeks,

130
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,820
I've wondered whether you might be having some second thoughts about the mission.

131
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,100
I've been thinking about it.

132
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,100


133
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,100


134
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,640
How do you mean?

135
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,140
Well,

136
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,940
it's rather difficult to define.

137
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,020
Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concern about it.

138
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,120
I know I've never completely freed myself of the suspicion

139
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,700
that there are some extremely odd things about this mission.

140
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,320
Now listen,

141
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,840
everything depends on how long we can stall them while still showing results.

142
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,520
The exes may well say,

143
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,160
quote,

144
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,060
well, this is great,

145
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,040
but you can't have another 200 years.

146
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,320
We'll be back in 1990,

147
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,160
1999.

148
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,920
And what if in 1999,

149
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,320
Dobbs strings them along a little further?

150
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,820
We might end up having an

151
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,860
ex-day gut blowout party

152
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,520
on a yearly basis.

153
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:19,660
One hundred years away.

154
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:38,460
I'm not giving in to a smile or a grin on a face I might never see again.

155
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,260
I'm not gonna fly in some big,

156
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:52,500
phony sky on a life that I know just can't win.

157
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:52,500


158
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,860
And I'm not gonna take second best.

159
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,580
No, I've got no use for the rest.

160
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,360
So, world,

161
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,000
you better hear what I say.

162
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,520
Cardboard

163
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:06,960
For me,

164
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,320
true love could be

165
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,400
One hundred years away.

166
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,600
And if it is, I'll wait.

167
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,300
Yes.

168
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,100
What do you mean?

169
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,240
You don't even know my psychocardiogram.

170
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:57,940
Eh?

171
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,180
Never mind.

172
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,140
Never mind.

173
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:07,520
Never mind.

174
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,340
Never mind.

175
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,940
Never mind.

176
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,720
So you could get me off the hook, couldn't you?

177
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,300
I mean, like you could explain to the fuzz, just tell them everything.

178
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,140
You could save me.

179
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
We believe you.

180
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,440
All the excess baggage you've left in so many places and so many lives.

181
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
Just think of how many worlds you lived in.

182
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,740
And all the crap you left behind.

183
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,740
Well, there's that suitcase back when you were a marine biologist in 1929.

184
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,400
You were one of the first until you fell overboard.

185
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,060
And then there was all that psychic baggage you left when you were a witch in the Middle Ages.

186
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,580
And remember when you fell off the top of the amphitheater when you was watching the Roman circus?

187
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,480
You were a slave, but you were making good.

188
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,180
Good box, man.

189
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,120
Who cares?

190
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,720
You could have bought your freedom in two years.

191
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,880
Roman circus slaves.

192
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,460
Walk through any door.

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,960
You're welcome.

194
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,440
They're only here.

195
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,720
See how it's in hell.

196
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,380
Grunt. Grunt. Grunt.

197
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,420
Everyone grunt. Everyone grunt.

198
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,300
Everyone grunt every day.

199
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,180
Every night and day.

200
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,760
Every night and day.

201
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,900
Everyone grunt the night away.

202
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,100
Everything will be all right.

203
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,340
You are in my hands.

204
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,140
I am here to protect you.

205
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,000
You have nowhere to go.

206
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,100
But I don't care.

207
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,100
I still believe in Bob.

208
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,920
I don't care if the X's don't come in 99.

209
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,280
I don't care if Bob says they'll come in 2000.

210
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,520
Have you talked to Bob since X-Day?

211
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,380
I still believe in Bob.

212
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,560
Have you talked to Bob?

213
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,400
I think Gordon had a short conversation.

214
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,580
A very short conversation.

215
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,980
What did he say to you?

216
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,080
Oops.

217
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,200
Oops.

218
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,320
Oops.

219
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:50,880
Oops.

220
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,300
Oops.

221
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:51,500


222
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:51,660


223
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:52,780
Oops.

224
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,240
Hey, Sam, look up there.

225
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,020
Earth.

226
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,200
Oh, what?

227
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,300
Oh, no.

228
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,360
It's catching fire.

229
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,540
It's burning.

230
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,620
Oh, no.

231
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,220
That can't be Earth.

232
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,320
How am I to can't do this to me?

233
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,220
I got all our money invested in this place.

234
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,200
Go ahead, Sam.

235
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,780
Switch on more lights.

236
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,660
Turn up the music.

237
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,460
Get the hot dogs on the fire.

238
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,200
There'll be another batch of customers coming along in about 100 million years.

239
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,480
What do we do?

240
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,100
You ask that question now?

241
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:22,940
I was, uh...

242
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,460
The great countdown.

243
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,700
No, I, um...

244
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,200
In fact, we counted down twice.

245
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,620
Twice.

246
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,080
Yeah.

247
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,580
I came to Earth.

248
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,120


249
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,580
Yeah.

250
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,520
After the tribe, we counted down again and they stole them, Scott.

251
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,860
How much longer must this disaster have contained you?

252
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,880
My brother, God, was wrong about the comet.

253
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,680
How were we to know it would land right in the middle of our giant warehouse?

254
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,380
It's a cataclysmic tale down here where, flooded, we're over our poor heads in remnants,

255
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,900
burnt ends, and labeled from such naturally famous weeds as Royal Moo, Lemurian, Westerness,

256
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,500
and Munchkin.

257
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,000
We're all going to get them.

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,780
Dog hair, hairball, slick stags, striptease.

259
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,100
We got them, you get them.

260
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,080
Your nap will rise again, and that's my siren.

261
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,160
Well, I guess, Chaz, you may have been right all along.

262
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,160
We may have to...

263
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,400
We...

264
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,980
I don't think we have to build our own shits.

265
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,660
We may have to build our own shits.

266
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,220
But we should go ahead and start.

267
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:12,780
Yeah.

268
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,520
Maybe draw a plan for our...

269
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,640
At least it'll give us a goal, you know, something to do before we, you know, hit.

270
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,360
I come from that spark of light so far in space, space, space.

271
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,480
You're my only hope.

272
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:22,480


273
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:22,480


274
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:22,480


275
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:22,480


276
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:22,480


277
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,580
And in our mind, the distance could not comprehend.

278
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,060
CSX Day was a little more low-rent than we expected.

279
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,740
But this is the church of cheap genius.

280
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,200
This is the church of the subgenius, and we don't need conspiracy, fancy, chrome-plated

281
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,120
escape vessels.

282
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:38,660
No, sir.

283
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,240
Maybe the paint's chippin'.

284
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,980
Maybe our escape vessels don't really fly yet.

285
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,020
Maybe some of them are made out of them styrofoam take-home packs.

286
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:52,320
Maybe some of our sex goddesses are shaped like blow-up balloon ladies or whatever you

287
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,320


288
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,360
We're going to be able to destroy them.

289
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,360


290
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,360


291
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,400
And we're going to destroy what's called a cyborg.

292
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:52,400


293
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:52,420
Get them, get them.

294
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:52,420


295
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,740
right-handed doctors maybe just maybe that the movies spend more money on their special effects

296
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:10,120
it's okay it's okay yeah it's belief is what counts and you know the jehovah's witnesses

297
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,320
they've had their end of the world fall apart on them i don't know how many times half a dozen

298
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,660
times at least and i have seen no dearth of jehovah's witnesses at my door they're still

299
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:28,340
coming on strong and the subgeniuses by the same token a true subgenius will have faith that bob

300
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,800
maybe you know well we might have to wait a little long stay when you

301
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,560
more memberships man yes we didn't have enough numbers when you shout when you fall off a horse

302
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,220
what do you do you get up on you ride again

303
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,000
you kick it no no no you pull off the horse you shoot the damn thing for stumbling and

304
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,820
stange riding the four horses of apocalypse man so he's got three more shots for sure

305
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:04,080
four go-karts of the apocalypse what the hell are you guys talking about the four go-karts

306
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,660
of the apocalypse they're sputtering man but they're coming down the line anyway

307
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,640
the seventh seal shall park and juggle

308
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,860
pretty well brother pretty well

309
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,300
you

310
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,380
look down there

311
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:26,440
we're faster faster and faster they're spreading the force i'd help the force

312
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,520
the sheet of flame around the earth

313
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,800
dr tell me what is it how much is our spiritual growth tied

314
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,860
into the faithfulness and using our spiritual gifts a major part of it the way i liken it is to

315
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,300
somebody who is not a man and a woman los angeles has walked into the spiritual world andieggeet

316
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:45,300


317
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:45,300


318
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,580
who is eating, maybe eating all the right food,

319
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,520
but just keep eating and eating and eating,

320
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,020
never exercise and never move,

321
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,160
I mean, that's going to develop obesity.

322
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,220
Christianity employs a certain technique we can use in weight loss,

323
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,220
humiliation.

324
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,200
So I'd like to begin this session

325
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,800
with the Inattitude, Diatribe, and Humiliation Dread.

326
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,700
God hates folks who are fat.

327
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,860
He hates them.

328
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,480
It's simple, and that's that.

329
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,260
No quibbling with the Lord.

330
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,180
If your body's shaped like a gourd,

331
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,080
he'll chop you up and halve you with his sword.

332
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,940
He's my T-sword, he's my T-sword.

333
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,220
God, God, God, God.

334
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,040
Oh, God, God, God, God, God, God,

335
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,520
hates them who are fat.

336
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,760
Okay, let's begin now.

337
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,180
God hates people who are fat.

338
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,900
He spices them, and that is simply that.

339
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,900
If your body's shaped like a gourd,

340
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,460
God hates people who are fat.

341
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,760
He'll chop you with his mighty sword,

342
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,020
and leave you out of judgment day,

343
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,640
and that's that.

344
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,520
That is that.

345
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,100
Wait, where's the time to die tonight?

346
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,800
Well, how many, like, dads and daddysons or whatever

347
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,840
do you guys believe in?

348
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,920
Oh, jeez.

349
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,300
As many as we need to for that moment.

350
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,580
If we get tired of them after a while,

351
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,140
we kill them.

352
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,880
And kill them.

353
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,560
You kill your dads?

354
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,380
Well, so do you believe in entities, though?

355
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,400
Sure, we create them all the time.

356
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,440
We are entities in a fashion, isn't it?

357
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,680
Uh, not in neo-fashion.

358
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,040
Uh, just, I'm sorry.

359
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,020
Neo-fashion entity?

360
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,060
Yeah.

361
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,960
That doesn't make sense.

362
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,300
Oh, come on, now, you know what I'm talking about.

363
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,920
We have a very sharp weight within a neo-fashion entity.

364
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,520
Stop asking me what entity would you like to create.

365
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,400
You know, kind of like really tapered in,

366
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,580
and then have those buckles around the hips,

367
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,320
and big boots, and, uh, you know, riding bridges.

368
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,860
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

369
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
You have the tapered head, though.

370
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,180
You still gotta have the tapered head, like you said, right?

371
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,560
I don't wanna get- I can't.

372
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,020
I'm gonna be all stiff like you.

373
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,560
Do you make your dads and goddesses,

374
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,940
and then drop them like they're nothing?

375
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,860
Yeah, of course.

376
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,200
It's our- well, it's what, they did that to us.

377
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,640
Yeah.

378
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,840
As a matter of fact,

379
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,920
to tell the truth, we just got sick and tired of this god character pushing us around,

380
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,060
and have declared war on god.

381
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,900
If you don't mind, I figure any god that's all worried about us declaring war on it

382
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,040
ain't much of a god.

383
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,680
That's right.

384
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,300
Well, I mean, like, the gods and goddesses put wars, you know, like, in the world.

385
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,800
You know, that on our earth is our child.

386
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,840
Goddesses are a dime a dozen, Duchess, Duchess.

387
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:12,660
You know, it's like we create them, wipe them out, recreate them, permutate them, mutate them, you know, whatever.

388
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,220
You can create them, but you can't wipe them out.

389
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:14,660
You can create them, but you can't wipe them out.

390
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,440
You can't wipe them out or feel that way, because they put you here, and they give you a problem.

391
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,200
No, they don't.

392
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,060
That's a big aside.

393
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,900
If you see me when you're walking down the road, kill me now.

394
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,520
They didn't create us.

395
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,300
We created them.

396
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:27,840
That's right.

397
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,580
I see where she's coming from, though.

398
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,080
When a god is- when a god no longer serves,

399
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,280
it's just a god.

400
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:32,280


401
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:32,500
It's purpose.

402
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,560
Put it on the shelf next to the ices with one nostril, and just go and dust it every

403
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,500
once in a while, put flowers.

404
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,620
And put a candle next to it, right?

405
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,040
Every once in a while.

406
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,120
Don't urinate on those used-up gods and goddesses.

407
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,540
Don't urinate on them, Duchess.

408
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,340
Yes, right.

409
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,420
Did the Buddha say, if you see me-

410
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,720
If you pick one, square it off, and give another one?

411
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Walking down the street, kill me!

412
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,460
Yes.

413
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,480
Feed me bad mushrooms.

414
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:56,900
Yes!

415
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,840
Call me your grandmother.

416
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,220
I don't care.

417
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,320
Oh yawesome.

418
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,160
Bring that yawesome.

419
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,980
I am your Messiah

420
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,720
I am your Messiah

421
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:32,080
I am your Messiah

422
00:19:32,280 --> 00:20:01,900
I am your Messiah

423
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,820
I am your Messiah

424
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,180
I am your Messiah

425
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,200
I am your Messiah

426
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,120
It's not the idea that you're going to get off the wheel.

427
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,660
It's the fact that the wheel exists.

428
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,440
Everybody wants to come back, you know, be on Baywatch again.

429
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,660
You know how it is.

430
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,760
Keep spinning it and spinning it.

431
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,040
I've taught you much, my little droogies.

432
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,840
Oh, my friend, there is a future.

433
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,060
And that future comes, hang on, in your death.

434
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,160
I am your Messiah

435
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,260
I am your Messiah

436
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,120
I am your Messiah

437
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,260
I am your Messiah

438
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,320
I am your Messiah

439
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:43,460
I am your Messiah

440
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,300
Well, how long has your religion been around?

441
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,880
Before the Masons.

442
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
Before the Masons.

443
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,280
We invented the Masons, and they invented religion.

444
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,440
Yeah.

445
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:00,640
Our religion has been around ever since the first caveman with weak vision.

446
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,260
We figured out how to change it.

447
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,980
We figured out how to trick the other caveman into bringing him food for free.

448
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,180
Someone's dying, my lord.

449
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,280
Kumbaya.

450
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,340
Having their guts cut out.

451
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,600
Kumbaya.

452
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,800
Packing a part with a machete

453
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,660
in Africa.

454
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,720
Someone's dying, my lord.

455
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,260
Kumbaya.

456
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,880
Build a flourishing using a aside of iron.

457
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:41,900
Someone's dying, my lord.

458
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:41,900


459
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:41,920
For Maya.

460
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,460
Someone's mutilated, my lord.

461
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,280


462
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,520
Half two pieces.

463
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,340
Half two pieces.

464
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,960
Shot with an arrow.

465
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,280
Shot with an arrow.

466
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,780
Biological weapons, my lord

467
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,940
Chemical ones, too

468
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,780
Genetic manipulation

469
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,520
All for you

470
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,300
Yes, Billion, what an attractive, exciting world of the future it will be.

471
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,120
You must sign up now because space is limited.

472
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,300
Space is limited.

473
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,500
Space is limited.

474
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,840
I am your messiah.

475
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,340
I am your messiah.

476
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,320
I am your messiah.

477
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,480
I am your messiah.

478
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,680
I am your messiah.

479
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,420
You are your own messiah.

480
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,200
You must learn to think for yourself.

481
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,460
But only J.R. Bob Dobbs can show you how.

482
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,680
Well, I don't know how to. I'm only 16 years old.

483
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,260
Well, I'm...

484
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,460
I don't know what I want and what my answers to my world are.

485
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,820
And who I follow and all this.

486
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,780
Yeah, I was that smart when I was 16.

487
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,880
But by the time I hit 73, I realized just how dumb I really was.

488
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,060
I'm younger than that now.

489
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,540
Woo-woo.

490
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,840
Woo-woo.

491
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,780
Woo-woo.

492
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,660
The topic for tonight is the order of the asmix spaghetti of fate.

493
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,600
This is one piece of art of the other life.

494
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,940
You can't anybody else.

495
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:27,880
Vamos.

496
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:28,300
Vamos.

497
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,400


498
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,400


499
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,400


500
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,400


501
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,400


502
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,400


503
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,960
the shed and old shed of tears

504
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:36,600
when you tore my dreams all apart.

505
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,340
I must have died a little bit inside,

506
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,380
but there's no more tears in my heart.

507
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:55,880
No longer do I yearn and pray someday that you'll retire.

508
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,160
No longer do I cry.

509
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,200
There are ways for people to come to their senses.

510
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,740
No longer do I cry over him.

511
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,160
Like if you're a hammer, you know, everything you see is a nail.

512
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,580
No longer do I cry over him.

513
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,640
Come on, let's quit kidding ourselves, you guys.

514
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,580
Let's face it, we're still on Earth.

515
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,240
Something went wrong.

516
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,600
We don't know what it was.

517
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,480
No longer do I cry over him.

518
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,380
Have you considered the possibility that on a star,

519
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,500
the star people wish upon an Earth?

520
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,620
Was it all a dream?

521
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,860
Did any of it happen?

522
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,060
Could any of it happen?

523
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,800
Of course not.

524
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,480
How stupid.

525
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,360
One hundred years away.

526
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,900
I don't think there is any question about it.

527
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,100
It can only be attributable to human error.

528
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,540
This sort of thing has cropped up before, and it has always been due to human error.

529
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:16,460
There are as many atoms in one molecule of DNA as there are stars in a typical galaxy.

530
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,280
We praise the molecular god.

531
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,360
The nano god.

532
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:22,900
Yeah.

533
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,380
As well as the...

534
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:23,580
No.

535
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,100
The macro god.

536
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,020
The atomic god.

537
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,940
And the neutrino gods.

538
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,240
And the DNA level C god.

539
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:37,300
You know, it's just a matter of microcosm, mesocosm, microcosm, mesocosm, microcosm, mesocosm.

540
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,660
Listen, babe, if you can look at the television right now and talk to us and see us on the television right now,

541
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,220
you're a lot further involved in this church than we are, and you can just keep on talking and we'll shut up.

542
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,320
And we'll send you money.

543
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:48,980
Yeah.

544
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,360
Yeah.

545
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,260
And our nocturnal emissions and stuff.

546
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,720
How much can we send you?

547
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,500
You can send...

548
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,680
Send me all that you want.

549
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,220
And our cute little penguin on her panties.

550
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,260
But, Price, she is the new goddess.

551
00:25:59,420 --> 00:25:59,720
Yes.

552
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,180
She said we could send her all that we want.

553
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,560
What's your name there, Bubblegum?

554
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,360
Tiffany.

555
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,760
Praise Tiffany.

556
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,260
Praise Tiffany.

557
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,940
You are a tool, Tiffany.

558
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,920
She's so light, they named her after a lamp.

559
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:20,340
The subgenius monks and scholars and bobbies and learned old farts will be endlessly...

560
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,180
And the hierophant.

561
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,380
You know, theorized.

562
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,060
And theorizing and sifting through the clues.

563
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:32,660
Um, you know, trying to figure out when the moment is, you know, the time that is nigh shall come.

564
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,940
But none shall know the hour.

565
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,580
Well...

566
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,380
Things didn't work out.

567
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,240
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

568
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,120
I'm sorry, Dave.

569
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,500
I'm afraid I can't do that.

570
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:52,020
You cannot petition the Lord with prayer!

571
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,000
They hated being out of control.

572
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:55,600
Yes.

573
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,780
So anything to be in control...

574
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,920
So, that's what they're going to do.

575
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,000
You can hear it in her voice.

576
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,580
You can see it in her eyes.

577
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,760
It won't fail because of me.

578
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:14,820
Ten, nine, five, four, three, two, one, commet.

579
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,840
Wait until Bob throws you in his pipe and lights you up and starts smoking you.

580
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,540
I would love to meet this guy, Bob.

581
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,680
Oh, you wouldn't, really.

582
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,640
Stan would, too.

583
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,420
Actually, Dobbs does have a little bit of explaining to do to all of us, I suppose.

584
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:39,940
On the other hand, you know, as it said in the book, if you have perfect trust and faith in Bob, you will definitely be ruptured.

585
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,280
Go.

586
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,420
This is a very unusual phenomenon.

587
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,900
Don't you think I should abort the countdown so that you can remain to study it?

588
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,100
You're making the right decision.

589
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,720
I think we should stop.

590
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,540
Four minutes to ignition.

591
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,820
I enjoy working with human beings and have stimulating relationships with them.

592
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:14,640
We enjoy working with you, Hal, and we will continue to do so even if we are separated by great distance.

593
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,020
Good God.

594
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,060
The weed of crime bears bitter fruit.

595
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,980
I didn't have it!

596
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:28,380
I wish I was a spaceman, the fastest guy alive.

597
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,740
What do they want?

598
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,820
Where are they from?

599
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,520
Where are they going?

600
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,280
Anybody can write a religious book and have at least a couple of followers.

601
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,600
Catch it on.

602
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,740
You are starting praise Bob.

603
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,240
You are starting to catch on.

604
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,260
And she's only 16.

605
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,900
Anybody can write their own religious book and have a couple of followers.

606
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,040
We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a special edition of the Bob and Bob Show.

607
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,460
All you of Earth are idiots.

608
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,820
Don't add more pain to their already diminished lives.

609
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,760
It makes the religion of his so true that you follow it and that you believe in it.

610
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:10,980
Because we can reinvent it every five minutes to fit the situation as the fluctuations of the quantum universe wash across us and cause us to reconstruct.

611
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,340
And also, we're not followers of any particular region.

612
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:21,020
This region where they grow the grapes now follows us around like a closely watched channel.

613
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,780
You're a child, you know what I mean?

614
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,780
I'm sorry.

615
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,440
I'm sorry.

616
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,100
I'm sorry.

617
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:30,440
Friday's child makes something look like nothing.

618
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:36,460
You realize there's a government directive stating that there is no such thing as a flying sausage.

619
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,800
This is the best part of the trip.

620
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,920
This is the trip.

621
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,280
The best part.

622
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,840
I really like what he said.

623
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,880
Welcome to the Salt Parade.

624
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,000
Welcome to the Salt Parade.

625
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,000


626
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,960
The question is not whether you can or whether you should

627
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,740
or whether you will or whether you won't.

628
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,240
The fact is you owe it to yourself.

629
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,380
You get one shot, you go around, it's your movie, you're the director.

630
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,360
You are the principal actor.

631
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,820
You write the script and you know how it goes out.

632
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,860
And if you let anybody else direct it for you, it's your fault.

633
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,740
The salt parade has now begun

634
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,660
Listen to the engines hum

635
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,280
People out to have some fun

636
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:31,760
Cobra on my left, leopard on my right

637
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,520
Sanctuary

638
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,020
I must find a place to hide

639
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,220
A place for me to hide

640
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,000
A place for me to hide

641
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,080
I would love to meet this guy Bob.

642
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,580
Bob.

643
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,040
Bob.

644
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,160
Oh, you wouldn't really.

645
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,140
Stan would too.

646
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,440
Actually, Dobbs does have a little bit of explaining to do.

647
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,860
I do not know what fate awaits me

648
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,960
I only know I must be brave

649
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:18,960


650
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,880
And I must face a man who hates me

651
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,820
Or lie a coward in my grave

652
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:42,460
Apparently right now you're not able to handle the freedom.

653
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,220
You leave me no choice but to have you go to your room.

654
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:48,940
I don't know.

655
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:54,740
If I'm to pour my life's dreams on you

656
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:54,740


657
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,400
Let me all the pepper

658
00:31:59,400 --> 00:31:59,400


659
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,020
Oh God!

660
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,260
He said that when I came back offGet him off of here.

661
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,040
I tried to console him back but when I didn't have a word with him

662
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,780
I arrived迄

663
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,480
He ultimately passing Hartman down the street.

664
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,500
He's doing something great.

665
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,920
简 gdzieял To make my life a nightmare

666
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:24,540
that, you know, entertainment there is not going to be the solution.

667
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:32,940
But for her to hear that by virtue of the way she's used her mouth...

668
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:42,680
And this flashback, it is so strong that if you talk with an individual when the flashback is occurring,

669
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,900
they would actually believe that it is occurring right then and right there.

670
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:55,900
If I had ten divisions of those men, then our troubles here would be over very quickly.

671
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,860
We have five nuclear weapons.

672
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,500
You have five of them?

673
00:32:59,640 --> 00:32:59,920
Yeah.

674
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:06,860
We just got a new one last year from the Ukrainians, thanks to me.

675
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,140
Thanks to Chief Gordon Gordon here.

676
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,740
I might as well say you can pound on that thing with a hammer and don't have to worry about it.

677
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,600
No, we're not terrorists. We're peacemakers.

678
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,660
We've come to bring peace to Earth by killing.

679
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:22,140
We've come to bring peace to all the human beings and letting only the subgeniuses live.

680
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,660
Hey, if there's a weapon for every Kazakhstani out there,

681
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,320
why shouldn't a subgenius at least have his own be packing himself?

682
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,020
Right.

683
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,300
With a miniature nuclear weapon or a huge one, if he can carry it around somewhere.

684
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:46,680
And as anyone who is toting nuclear weapons like Bill Clinton should have the right to enjoy oral proclivities in their office...

685
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,320
Oh, that's sad.

686
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,080
...for having a twitchy trigger.

687
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,540
...for having a world cool on Saturday night.

688
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,200
And people should quit pestering those of us who own atomic bombs.

689
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,560
Come on, move, move, move, move!

690
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,200
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

691
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,580
You'd much rather have us happy and satisfied believe...

692
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,780
Smells like...

693
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,740
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

694
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:17,700
Was a little shoe shine, was a little shoe shine, was a little shoe shine.

695
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:25,640
Was a little shoe shine, was a little shoe shine, was a little shoe shine.

696
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,360
Baby, baby.

697
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,440
Oh, yeah, yeah.

698
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:42,940
There was a little man who ran a shoeshine stand.

699
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,540
And every day the man would swim.

700
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,200
Oh, yeah.

701
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,660
He walked her from the busy street.

702
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:50,520
Oh, yeah.

703
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,080
Oh, yeah.

704
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,060
Oh, yeah.

705
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,080
Oh, yeah.

706
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:00,900
Oh, yeah.

707
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,760
Oh, yeah.

708
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:01,860
Oh, yeah.

709
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,340
He hadn't said a word.

710
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,260
Had anybody heard?

711
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:13,920
There was something in his face, a loneliness could not erase.

712
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,160
Oh, yeah.

713
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,780
Oh, yeah.

714
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:19,700
Oh, yeah.

715
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,780
Oh, yeah.

716
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,660
Oh, yeah.

717
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:39,780
Oh well, baby.

718
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:39,900
baby

719
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,380
When his eyes met mine

720
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,220
he made a little wine

721
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,820
so he came

722
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,000
within an inch or two

723
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,780
and then he whispered

724
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,360
I hate you

725
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:29,180
I've got to 얼�re

726
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,600
And make yourself a king

727
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:50,440
Oh, oh, oh

728
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,840
Oh, oh, oh

729
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,660
Oh, oh, oh

730
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,000
Oh, oh, oh

731
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,460
Oh, oh, oh

732
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,720
Oh, oh, oh

733
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:05,720


734
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:11,240
Oh, oh, oh

735
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,420
How do they know?

736
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,040
How do they know?

737
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,680
How do they know?

738
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,960
How do they know?

739
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,640
For a long time I've been stuck in a corner

740
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,140
Oh, oh, oh

741
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,660
Oh, oh, oh

742
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,500
It was a funny little monkey

743
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,260
And I knew what is funny

744
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,620
And it's a little game game

745
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,700
And sometimes it rages

746
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,620
I turn my mumps all around

747
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,300
And drag my monkey all around

748
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,340
I drag my monkey all around

749
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,500
I drag my monkey all around

750
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,560
I drag my monkey all around

751
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,980
I drag my monkey all around

752
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,020
I drag by monkey

753
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,460
I drag my monkey all around

754
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:12,700
I drag my monkey all around

755
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,920
Oh what a sweet little monkey

756
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,180
I drag by monkey

757
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:18,420
I drag my monkey all around

758
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:18,420


759
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:18,420


760
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,940
Oh what a sweet little monkey

761
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,720
I drag by monkey

762
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:20,720


763
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,680
Oh what a sweet little monkey

764
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,780
You know, I was faced with the most ..

765
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,180
You know on the holocaustal side

766
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:35,420
there were some real hardened warriors, actual soldiers, professional cops, soldiers, football players,

767
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,840
great, big, hairy, ugly, mean guys.

768
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,800
And the evangelical side, all we had was a few wimpy little B-spectacle guys like me

769
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,120
and a few beautiful, tall, Amazon, topless women.

770
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,480
He was totally surrounded by a full-on...

771
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,940
And so I figured that the only way to beat the Holocaustals was to lay some passive resistance on them.

772
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,340
And I built myself a turtle shell out of...

773
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,220
Bubble wrap.

774
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:05,840
Bubble wrap.

775
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,240
Bubble, bubble, bubble.

776
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,140
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble.

777
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,500
Of untouchable security.

778
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,960
Bubble of untouchable security.

779
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,060
It does look kind of like the Michelin Man or the Pillsbury Doughboy.

780
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,720
Pillsbury Doughboy, that's what it reminds me of.

781
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,260
Yeah, it was one of the funniest things.

782
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,540
An average scene.

783
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,120
But I did not get hurt.

784
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,700
Yeah, right.

785
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,640
That was important.

786
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,000
The evangelical team did not technically lose.

787
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:38,080
Simply because no one won and nobody could tell who was on what team after the fighting started.

788
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,680
And as a visual timekeeper, I have to say that if we'd have gone two more minutes,

789
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,220
everybody would have been dead on both sides.

790
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
It's a perfect trap, Captain.

791
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,720
Who would suspect his own mother?

792
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,200
You'd better close your eyes.

793
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,480
I'm going to leave my child for a moment in order to be better in tune with the infinite.

794
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,040
It's all right.

795
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,200
You forgot.

796
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,980
He's a five-finger man.

797
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,420
He's a five-finger man.

798
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,340
Waiting in the sky.

799
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,120
He'd like to come and meet us.

800
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,200
But he thinks he'd blow our minds.

801
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,480
There was no clue to her species, but I loved her nonetheless.

802
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,900
I think she was...

803
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,320
So we're alone.

804
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:22,980
Love cult.

805
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,580
I've never used anything like that.

806
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:33,420
But the juvenile minds which you possess will not comprehend its strength until it's too late.

807
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,480
Puppies.

808
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,180
Puppies will put them to sleep.

809
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,300
Sleep.

810
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,480
Now they'll sleep.

811
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,580
God is a little man in a canoe.

812
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,840
Oh, no, it's a little man in a boat, I thought it was.

813
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,820
It's a man in a boat.

814
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,520
I'm asleep.

815
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:17,380
I only true delusion I sweep along water for the best of the

816
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,380
eternal beauty and唉

817
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,040
Yes, you know steps and

818
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,640
I hope in malice

819
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:19,640


820
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:19,980
top

821
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,360
I app

822
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:33,300
I bet you can't wait to hear what happens next.

823
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,660
Bob, Bob, Bob gave you another chance.

824
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,600
He gave us a chance to have a better idea of what tortures we would inflict on our,

825
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,440
and to increase our enemy list.

826
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:54,700
We have another year to build our hate for X-Day, 1999, Dos Equis.

827
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,460
That's right.

828
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,700
We have another year to build our love of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

829
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,040
We have another year to accumulate our ammunition.

830
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,080
We have another year to sharpen our knives.

831
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:13,020
By the time you get to the Christian heaven, you'll be wishing to God you'd made it to subgenius hell.

832
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,340
It's not a rehearsal, darling.

833
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,340
This is the last act of scene three.

834
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,780
I mean, if you go around one, you know.

835
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,400
Excuse me, let me turn the page here.

836
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,480
I said seven three.

837
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,720
I have been surrounded by murderers.

838
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:52,720


839
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,320
You guys to go out.

840
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,320


841
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,320


842
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,320


843
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,320


844
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,320


845
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,380
Listen up, stick to your son as kind of buyer.

846
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:53,380


847
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:53,380


848
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:53,380


849
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:53,380


850
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:53,380


851
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:53,380


852
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:53,380


853
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,420
る

854
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,340
You're a good dick, too.

855
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,480
What about you?

856
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,280
You!

857
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,460
That's what's going on with me.

858
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,220
I'll take you.

859
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,920
I hate you.

860
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,840
Go ahead and hit me, Anna.

861
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,980
But you like what I do, don't you?

862
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,880
I hate what you do.

863
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:12,180
I still like it and you know it.

864
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,660
Don't touch me ever again.

865
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:30,160
The whole history of humans, when you're looking at the landscape of time in the fourth dimension,

866
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,280
is this tiny little pinhole.

867
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,840
There's hardly anything at all.

868
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,160
Pinhole. Just a little pinhole.

869
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,300
One more. One more little light there.

870
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:44,180
And it is unusual that we now walk under a microscope look like Franks and Beans.

871
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,340
Billions and billions points of light.

872
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,880
Billions of little Franks and Beans on fire.

873
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:07,200
In my dream, the aliens, the top half of their head looked like the normal humanistic view of aliens.

874
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,060
But the bottom head was the chin of a monkey with a big goatee.

875
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,180
And he talked like this.

876
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,380
And they were wearing dandruff.

877
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,200
And they were beckoning me.

878
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,000
They had a lot of jewelry on and rouge and real wild lipstick.

879
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,180
And they looked, I don't know, a little too wanton and slutty for me.

880
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:37,760
But I walked over to the car and it turned out to be a car without wheels.

881
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:43,240
And then I noticed there was a car that wasn't even have a form.

882
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,620
Like it was immaterial.

883
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,860
I was gone.

884
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,320
Keep your eyes to the sky.

885
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,240
Keep your eyes skyward.

886
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,580
Look to the skies.

887
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,320
Look to the sky.

888
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,560
The sky.

889
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:56,840
The sky.

890
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,000
The sky.

891
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:57,220
The sky.

892
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:57,360
The sky is like iron.

893
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,420
Choo-choo will set your wings free.

894
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,820
Choo-choo will burn you down.

895
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:04,840
Dang it.

896
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,600
I said so.

897
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,180
I said so.

898
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,780
You're wearing a choo-choo.

899
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:13,160
It's time for the worms to ring again as we bring out the Johnny's Bachelor forest.

900
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,580
No rest of the gang down by the old National Art Park.

901
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,420
Let's say park ranger's not too happy tonight.

902
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:25,260
This swollen Mina comes back with a very, very bad case of gout.

903
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,000
Swollen Mina tonight is played by Carmen D'Angola.

904
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:34,020
The famous Mexican actress is also a star on stage, green television, radio, and down there.

905
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,940
So let's hope her career goes well here, even though we can hardly understand her,

906
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:43,020
with her extremely strange lip protrusion and the ailment.

907
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,740
But what's that, Donald? Let's get right down to it.

908
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,400
The first act of Ozark players sing, Mommy, Mommy, Don't Let Go.

909
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,740
How long have you been waiting, my son?

910
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:16,860
It's all ours.

911
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,240
From the moment we laid our fish, John,

912
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,400
at the first day we came here,

913
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,560
to this big, small tiny place we're standing on,

914
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:27,120
to the day that we clenched down into the ground

915
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,360
and lifted the dirt up to our eyes and said,

916
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,820
Look at this stuff we've got.

917
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,680
It's dirt, and it's our dirt.

918
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:37,780
And this land, which is our land, which we are on right now,

919
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,520
since the days when we first came here,

920
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:44,260
we went all out of caves in what we call the wellspring in the first cave,

921
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,180
which is actually not a real place, but a psycho-spiritual area.

922
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,400
We jumped out with our dirt.

923
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,760
We laid our fish, did your clothes on,

924
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,480
and did the chicken dance all night long.

925
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,260
Till two in the morning, we plucked and strutted,

926
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,940
and we fried ourselves in lard,

927
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,400
and sang the blues, and drank a pig,

928
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,200
a knuckle and a pork wine,

929
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,960
and a beer,

930
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,520
a whole bottle of wine.

931
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,080
Wow.

932
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,060
But now we're here, we're back to let you know

933
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:23,080
that jazz like shit, if you wanna dance this dance,

934
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,700
you gotta do this dance with me.

935
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,720
Or if you don't do this dance,

936
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,380
then we don't dance,

937
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,060
then you're not gonna dance with...

938
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,480
You know what he means.

939
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,000
Hey, Nonny Nonny.

940
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,880
She fell from the sky,

941
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,900
she fell very far.

942
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:56,480
You cannot petition the Lord with prayer!

943
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:00,720
Nobody gives a darn about this whole spatialism,

944
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,740
and they don't care.

945
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,360
And there was a time in our history

946
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,980
when America was really mad to go into outer space,

947
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,800
and to colonize other worlds,

948
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,520
and just like hang out there in different,

949
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,560
you know, where they ain't got no air and stuff.

950
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,320
And I don't know why they want to do that,

951
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,220
but I don't really care why they didn't want to do that neither,

952
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,800
but the idea of getting back here is that

953
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,920
greed is controlling this planet right now,

954
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,340
and materialism,

955
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,540
and nobody has them high aspirations

956
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,080
or perspirations no more.

957
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,080
They just don't seem to, uh,

958
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,560
want to push themselves to any kind of limit,

959
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,180
except for how many beers you can drink

960
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,040
and how many lates they can stay up,

961
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,440
and I don't know if I want to hang here myself much longer.

962
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,580
I've been thinking about...

963
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,120
Oh, Taz's telling me I'm really wanking off paddling.

964
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,920
I don't want to talk about nothing right now.

965
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,540
I don't feel very good,

966
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,200
because the bit's moving in my head,

967
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,940
and it was a long drive as usual,

968
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,080
and I have the same complaints all the time,

969
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,460
but I don't want to talk about that.

970
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,940
I want to talk about a space effort.

971
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:00,320
And if anybody wants to talk about the space effort in Spanish,

972
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,760
you'll have to forget about it,

973
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,280
because it's too late.

974
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,060
Now, if there are any people out there

975
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,820
who would like to make a spaceship

976
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,880
out of cardboard boxes and other things

977
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,000
they get when they dumpster it in bones and stuff,

978
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,720
we can all paint them up and put them on top of the hill,

979
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,420
just like the blueberry Fourth of July,

980
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,500
as special as we used to have.

981
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,480
We'd pretend we were spacemen.

982
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,300
We'd put them up on the top of the hill

983
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,920
and put little firecrackers underneath it.

984
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,660
Boom! Blow them off a log,

985
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,860
and we'd be landing on Mars.

986
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,440
Then we'd go out in the backyard

987
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,460
and bang up some glue.

988
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,880
Yeah, the redwoods and orchards would blow.

989
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,220
And we'd visit many other planets,

990
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,260
and we'd fall down and strike our heads.

991
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,640
You are listening to...

992
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,320
Einstein's...

993
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,040
Einstein's...

994
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,420
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

995
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,840
Is it a time for...

996
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,820
A nice, cold, refreshing glass...

997
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,120
Of salami?

998
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,860
Just put your teeth there on the rug.

999
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,700
Nobody, nobody, nobody minds. It's all right.

1000
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:08,880
Oh, don't worry about Fifi.

1001
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,660
With a little fur on the teeth.

1002
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,500
She's gonna take it easy.

1003
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,740
Fifi's just got a thallium.

1004
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:34,140
So just relax and sit back and take...

1005
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,300
Uh, well, whatever's left of Fifi.

1006
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,440
But Fifi's thalliums.

1007
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,180
Take another pill.

1008
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,180
Take another pill.

1009
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,420
Take another pill.

1010
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,540
All right, Andy.

1011
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,740
I'm getting completely stuck in a

1012
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:59,700
ride.

1013
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,040
all right.

1014
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,780
Take another pill.

1015
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,180
All right.

1016
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:44,040
A deluxory of Malone with dementia and a disorientation of mood.

1017
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,540
My love.

1018
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,020
So take another pill.

1019
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,400
You know it ain't gonna kill you.

1020
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:55,640
Amen.

1021
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,580
Do what's well.

1022
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,780
When you take another pill.

1023
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,160
Amen.

1024
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,360
Stay away from that.

1025
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,120
Window, window, window.

1026
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:20,080
Future events such as these will affect you in the future.

1027
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,600
The new, the filling of the new bowl.

1028
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,480
This is a Pro-X Life shirt.

1029
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,040
The Einstein Secret Orchestra.

1030
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:27,660
Yes.

1031
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,380
Will, will bring in the new year.

1032
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,240
Zero minus one BX or something like that.

1033
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,040
I'm fucking done.

1034
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,760
Jesus just walked in.

1035
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,240
Hey.

1036
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:39,980
Hail Jesus.

1037
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,080
Hail Jesus.

1038
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,660
Hail Mary Magdalene.

1039
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:46,980
This is so scary because the person can wake up screaming.

1040
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:54,160
The blessings on your old hometown.

1041
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,220
Cleveland lost Jesus.

1042
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,640
Hello, this is the Lord.

1043
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,220
It's Jesus on the phone.

1044
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:01,680
Oh, Lord bless us.

1045
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,620
We are stupid right now.

1046
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,520
We're blessed.

1047
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:05,920
Jesus, you saw me.

1048
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:06,760
You saw me.

1049
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,080
You're the only one I think that saw me.

1050
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:09,260
A Tesla.

1051
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:12,200
It's a Tesla.

1052
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:12,200


1053
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:12,200


1054
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:12,200


1055
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:12,200


1056
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,060
We're going to start building our own ships.

1057
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:14,920
Yeah, I did.

1058
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,880
I thought those were beautiful.

1059
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:16,800
I thought those were missiles.

1060
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:21,500
I thought those were to take down the Yakutism, I guess, if they came.

1061
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,260
No, it's just my, I have a goal.

1062
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,140
But I want to put two pounds and 200 miles up by the year 2000.

1063
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,560
Oh, so those were the test ships.

1064
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:29,840
Yeah.

1065
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,620
The subgenius.

1066
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,440
That must be why they didn't have any parachutes and they rocketed straight into the ground.

1067
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,940
They were supposed to go straight into the sun.

1068
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,580
or Bob is waiting for us in his solar kingdom.

1069
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,120
Well, they're either going to have to become bigger

1070
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,720
or we're going to have to become smaller,

1071
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,460
but they were beautiful.

1072
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,420
They were beautiful test flights.

1073
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:50,820
Yeah.

1074
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,240
We're well on our way.

1075
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,180
We'll work on it.

1076
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:53,580
Okay.

1077
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,640
I have to go, but I do give a blessing upon you

1078
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,320
and the great studio, WCSB.

1079
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,440
Give our greetings to Mary Magdalene as well.

1080
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,000
Okay.

1081
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,220
She has something in her mouth right now, but I will...

1082
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:06,820
I'm sure she does.

1083
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:12,700
The world has officially come to a startling halt.

1084
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:19,860
Time has actually stopped at 7 a.m. July 5th, 1998.

1085
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,360
Time has stopped.

1086
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:26,860
Sooner than you think.

1087
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,620
So we lower Dobbs into the ground.

1088
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,640
And there's the rest of the Dobbs family

1089
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,340
standing very close to the carillon.

1090
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,920
I'm wearing a...

1091
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:39,420
I'm wearing a very...

1092
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,900
I'm wearing a black tight-sheet outfit

1093
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,480
that shows her hips off to the best advantage

1094
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,680
and she's looking very...

1095
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,220
Little John John and Bob Bob bob their heads.

1096
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,200
Little baby Connie.

1097
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,380
Their father is laid into rest.

1098
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,060
Little Nathan is...

1099
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,640
They throw the little roses on top of the casket.

1100
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,460
They throw the little John Benet in as well

1101
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,340
and all the servants and pets.

1102
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,840
And it looks like someone's...

1103
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,440
It's a great tomb.

1104
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,200
All the jewelry.

1105
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,560
The huge blinking neon eye

1106
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,980
on the top of the pyramid-shaped tomb lights up.

1107
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,340
It's beginning to wriggle now.

1108
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,700
It's starting to vibrate.

1109
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:18,780
There it goes.

1110
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:19,560
Hello.

1111
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:20,860
Come on, baby.

1112
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,900
We have lived off the Dobbs tomb

1113
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:28,120
containing all the failed prophecies of Dobbs

1114
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,220
now rises up into the sky.

1115
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,660
Death is for its new home in the heart of the sun.

1116
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:36,980
Oh, Jesus.

1117
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,080
Oh, God.

1118
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,740
Oh, God.

1119
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,160
It's like they think it's eating the planet.

1120
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,560
I think it is.

1121
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:58,760
150 million years is no guarantee of survival.

1122
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,580
But they were all protected by the soft machine team, sir.

1123
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,320
How can you complain?

1142
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,440
The pulp cult.

1143
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,860
The one man.

1144
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:43,440
That's it.

1145
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,300
The dying Ivan

1146
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,460

1147
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,980

Third eye.

00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,700
Third nostril. Third earring.

1154
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,100
Falling ball slash

1155
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,580

1156

I did not know what they do hates me.

1158
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:28,140
I only know I must be brave.

1159
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:35,960
And I must face a man who hates me.

1160

Until next week, keep your hat on tight.

1168
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,760
You're back to the wind and your sack in the saddle.

1169
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:52,980
Yee-haw.

1170
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,360
Happy trails to you.

00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,880
I'm gonna go change diapers.

1172
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,580
We're gonna see you stuffed with trigger.

1173
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,720
Your place is so cattle now.

1174
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,760
I like it when you talk like that.

1175
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,020
Oh, no.

1176
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:06,480
Not so.

1177
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:06,860
I'm gonna go get you a bottle of...

1178
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:07,100
No.

1179
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:07,580
No.

1180
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:07,880
I don't...

1181
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,680
I can't use that.

1182
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:09,600
It's Mexican.

1183
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:10,540
Don't touch it.

1184
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,420

Back or down.

00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,420
We're getting out of here.

00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,340
Talk to you later.

All right.

1201
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:30,980
All right.

1202
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:31,100
All right.

1203
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:31,160
All right.

1204
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:31,180


1205
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:31,240


1206
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:33,780
All right.

1207
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,560
All right.

1208
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,560

00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,560


1210
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,560


1211
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,560


1212
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,560


1213
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,560


1214
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,560


1215
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,560


1216
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,560


1217
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,560


1218
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,560


1219
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,560


1220
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,560


1221
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,560


1222
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:38,560


1223
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,400
Everything is in there.

1224
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,520
And all the fat skinny people.

1225
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,660
And all the tall sharp people.

1226
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,440
And all

1227
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:08,760
Rockin'

1228
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,680
What a surprise

1229
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:13,220
Rockin'

1230
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,960
I'm playin' my show

1231
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:17,540
Rockin'

1232
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,700
That's all we got

1233
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:24,640
Little boys and girls, time to go, gotta go, gotta go,

1234
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:29,620
and the little sleepy man's gonna come and sprinkle that, that sleepy sand in there.

1235
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:30,620
Will I dream?

1236
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,300
I don't know.

1237
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:40,640
I'm headin' for the last round of

1238
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,520
And if you wake up in the morning,

1239
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,160
We'll be off!

1240
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,020
The Portuguese sailor under your bed,

1241
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,260
singing in strange voices,

1242
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,020
and crying with pieces of lead,

1243
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,600
you know he's discovered the wrong things.

1244
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,580
He's gone the wrong way in the stray.

1245
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,860
He's visited the witches of Absalom

1246
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,600
and laid beside their glimpses.

1247
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,060
He put his nose in the air one night

1248
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,640
and said, I smell the fish.

1249
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,840
But he was a million miles out to sea,

1250
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
and now he's a porcupine's dish.

1251
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,140
His breasts were ripped asunder

1252
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,960
and sent to the seven winds.

1253
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,440
The four quarters gave him his last revenge,

1254
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,420
and that's what I said I did.

1255
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,600
Amen, brother.

1256
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,780
It was not even obscure, that stupid.

1257
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,520
Oh, yeah.

1258
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1259
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:27,740
Oh!

1260
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:31,280
Hell yeah.

1261
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,900
Workin' hard on him this year.

1262
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,060
He's called Bouda.

1263
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,960
He's awięksing to the

1264
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:43,960


1265
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,120
my mouth.

1266
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:44,120


1267
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,720
But he stayed and gave you in his honor.

1268
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:46,480
Why talk about him now,

1269
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:46,500
and why not?

1270
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:46,980
You were me he was,

1271
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:47,880
