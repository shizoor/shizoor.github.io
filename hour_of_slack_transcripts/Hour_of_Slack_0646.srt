00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:12,840
No, no dear friends, we're back and we're beautiful and it is the subgenius radio ministry hour of...

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,100
Oh wait a minute, we have a much better way to get into this. Stand by.

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,920
Welcome to the Travelers Insurance Company's exhibit.

4
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,600
You are about to start on an unforgettable journey.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,000
A journey across two and a half billion years of life on Earth.

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,100
You are going to walk through the history of man.

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,340
You will be with him as he meets his greatest challenges.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,880
For this is your story.

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,500
And now, in the post-end times, end times, Einstein's secret orchestra...

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,100
Seven million, billion, billion, billion, trillion, billion...

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,160
Five billion, billion, billion, billion, billion...

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,500
...

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:04,400
...tillion different little brain cells of all those other people who are out there doing the same thing that we are, only different, present...

14
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,000
...the subgenius hour of slack.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,600
This edition...

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,940
...brought to you by us...

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:15,960
...saturn...

18
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,300
...whatever, it's...

19
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,320
...and them.

20
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid we have to...

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,820
There were others before.

22
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,080
We have to include them.

23
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,480
More.

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,800
Where were others before?

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,220
They came long before us.

26
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,740
Two days before the dream.

27
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,260
Three days before the dream time is back.

28
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,500
The ones you spotted in the woods that afternoon aren't gone.

29
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,540
And others shall follow.

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,340
What do we do?

31
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:55,480
What do we do?

32
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,920
You ask that question now?

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,760
There's a race gentleman against time.

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:20,260
Welcome to subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

35
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,440
It's the same genuine magic authentic Christmas...

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,160
...and the same true.

37
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,440
...used by the priests of Isis and Osiris in the days of the pharaohs of Egypt...

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,700
...in which Cleopatra first saw the approach of...

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:33,880
...the...

40
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,580
...these are not the things that men do.

41
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,680
We are men.

42
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,980
Are we not?

43
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:42,700
...

44
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,360
...

45
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,600
...

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,040
...

47
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,040


48
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,040


49
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,040


50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,040


51
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,040


52
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,040


53
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,040


54
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,060
...

55
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,140
...

56
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,160
...

57
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,160


58
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,160


59
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,200
...

60
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,260
...

61
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,260


62
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,260


63
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,260


64
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,320
...

65
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,320


66
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,320


67
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,320


68
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,140
...

69
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,000
...

70
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,040
...

71
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,320
...

72
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,440
...

73
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,440


74
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,440


75
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,440


76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,440


77
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,440


78
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,620
The

79
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,100
...

80
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,080
...

81
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:25,480


82
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:25,480


83
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:25,480


84
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:25,480


85
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:25,480


86
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,740
today. All futures continue to look pretty dismal, but that's what you should expect

87
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:35,520
if you're a hog. That's because most farm-dwelling parkers know the end of the line is food around

88
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,380
the corner for somebody else's breakfast table and maybe even yours. Because if you have

89
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:47,360
four legs, hooves or trotters, and you live on a farm, if it isn't the grim reaper, it's

90
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,860
the international harvester. And now this.

91
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:58,700
He is ape-like, clothed in coarse hair, but he stands upright. He can think. He can learn.

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:16,020
Imagine yourself 50,000 years ago, living in what today might be known as the Netherlands.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,140
Walking around in your caveman clothes.

94
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,780
Grabbing your little phone.

95
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,380
Huddling around your fire.

96
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,920
Walking through the plains.

97
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,520
All chanting together.

98
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,760
I'm a person in the crowd.

99
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,740
I go with the in crowd girls.

100
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,420
I'm in with the in crowd.

101
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,100
And I go with the in crowd girls.

102
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,380
Get on with walking.

103
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,640
Get on with talking.

104
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,240
Get on with walking, talking, all that stuff.

105
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,260
And all the stuff I can do.

106
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,840
And you go down.

107
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,420
You go down to the other valley.

108
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,520
And you check out the babes from the other tribe.

109
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,020
Yeah.

110
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,980
And a whole pack of you go walking into their camp.

111
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,260
Yeah.

112
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,800
Driving your little caveman car.

113
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,440
And you grab your Mr. Caveman microphone.

114
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,120
Hey, hey, babe.

115
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,960
Hey, babe.

116
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,680
Hey, baby.

117
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:50,840
Hey, baby.

118
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey, baby.

119
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,660
Hey, baby.

120
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,660
We'll be back to kick you up later.

121
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,960
And then you stopped at the caveman disco tent.

122
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,340
Find yourself a couple nights.

123
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,220
Babes from the other tribe.

124
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:18,800
Yeah.

125
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,020
Something about them.

126
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,820
Yeah.

127
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


128
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


129
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


130
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


131
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


132
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


133
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


134
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


135
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


136
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


137
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


138
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


139
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


140
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


141
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


142
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


143
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


144
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


145
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


146
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:20,820


147
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,740
And you walk into that caveman disco tent inside that cave.

148
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,220
And the candles are all flittering on the wall.

149
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,600
And the torches are lighting up the ceiling.

150
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,660
And they're burning some kind of strange herbs that they don't grow in your little tribal

151
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,520
village.

152
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,400
Yeah.

153
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,880
I've never smelled that before.

154
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,180
Take a few weeks to make this herb mixture.

155
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,320
Take a hand, a stick and a spoon.

156
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,820
Pull up dirt.

157
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,980
Throw on fire.

158
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,220
Eat.

159
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,160
Repeat as needed.

160
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,500
You're walking in the road.

161
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,780
I'm in with the intro

162
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,240
I'm in with the intro

163
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,540
I'm in with the intro

164
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,940
And I know what the intro's

165
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,420
No

166
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,360
Got a long way of walking

167
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,080
No

168
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,920
Got a long way of talking to

169
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,440
No

170
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,700
I'm in with the intro

171
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,640
Hey baby

172
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:44,740
Hey baby

173
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,180
Any of your boyfriends know how to

174
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,920
Build a fire?

175
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,800
I have fire

176
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,120
You say to her

177
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,620
I have fire

178
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,480
And that's all it takes

179
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,280
50,000 years ago

180
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,620
In what is known today as

181
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,420
The Netherlands

182
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,760
I have fire

183
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,440
And so you see the legend is Promethean in nature

184
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,840
Fire, fire

185
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,180
If you've got fire you can get the chips

186
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,240
Fire

187
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,140
Look I have a torch baby

188
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,360
I can turn a torch for you

189
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,760
Fire

190
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,000
Look at my stick it's all hot

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,460
Fire

192
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,560
A similar sort of thing but

193
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,340
I'll bring you fire

194
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,640
Ooh, fire

195
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,600
Fire

196
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,020
I'll bring you fire

197
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:37,800
Fire

198
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,080
You guys are really hot

199
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,280
Fire

200
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,520
I'll bring you fire

201
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,220
Fire

202
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
Ooh, fire

203
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,300
I'll bring you fire

204
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,560
He fashions small stone tools to help him cut through tough highs

205
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,460
His world is violent, cruel, but he survives

206
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,060
And this simple pebble tool is the beginning of a technology

207
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,860
Which will take man to the stars

208
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,660
Oh mama, oh mama, oh mama, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

209
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:26,300
Bob, the drummer of ESO, was there at 6 in the morning on X-2 day, or whatever, Starwood day.

210
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,600
You know, after the big Saturday night, after all the hippies and methamphetamine addicts had drummed and danced all night,

211
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,780
Bob was still there.

212
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,840
Drumming away.

213
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,680
Still drumming away.

214
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,040
Anyway, there was hardly anybody left but the alcoholic and the caffeinaholic.

215
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,900
And Bob.

216
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,680
And Bob.

217
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,380
And Bob.

218
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,100
And Bob.

219
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,780
And Bob.

220
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,360
And Bob.

221
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,700
This is City Probe Scanner.

222
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,420
We've run across some illegal sexual activity.

223
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,400
It should be on your DTO screen now.

224
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,340
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

225
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,500
Hello, Bob-Omb.

226
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,560
Bob-Omb!

227
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,560
Bob-Omb!

228
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,340
Let me out!

229
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,480
Let me out of here!

230
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,660
You can't keep me in here!

231
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,020
Let me out of here!

232
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,640
And the log jamming monkeys that you tape to the bonfire...

233
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,460
Yeah, the log jammers.

234
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,560
The log...

235
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,120
That's a lot of stuff to be hauling around.

236
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,020
The ones with the long...

237
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,540
Wait a minute.

238
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,480
Wait, wait a minute.

239
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,360
Wait, wait a minute.

240
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,440
Wait, wait a minute.

241
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:28,740
Wait a minute.

242
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,720
Wait, wait a minute.

243
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,160
The log jamming monkeys that you tape to the bonfire did you say?

244
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,120
Yeah, the ones with the red suspenders on.

245
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,980
They come out after, see what's this device?

246
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,840
Kind of looks like a Maytag washing machine from the 50s.

247
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,720
And he gets that going with the smoke machine at the same time,

248
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,960
and pretty soon they're not real blue monkeys.

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,740
It's kind of like a sordid evacuation from the back of part of your imagination.

250
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,700
It is a sordid evacuation.

251
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,680
But they appear to be.

252
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:09,320
For a million years, man faces life like the animals with only primitive tools to help.

253
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,340
Man has long known of fire, but he runs from it in fear.

254
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,680
Then man discovers he can use this energy.

255
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,340
The small flames light his nights.

256
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,660
He is able to cook.

257
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,900
With fire, man can now live in colder climates,

258
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,660
and he endures.

259
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,880
Man inhabits more of the earth.

260
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,340
In northern China, 250,000 years ago,

261
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,760
we find man gathering his family around the fire.

262
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,760
These are the pills, my friends.

263
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,580
These are the pills.

264
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,180
They prevent you from getting killed.

265
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,020
And what's inside these pills, my friends,

266
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,280
is the same thing that's inside my head.

267
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,740
It's a rain of pills in a fucking revolution.

268
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,220
It's a rain of pills in a fucking revolution.

269
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,440
It's a rain of pills in a fucking revolution.

270
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,640
It's a rain of pills in a fucking revolution.

271
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,820
It's a rain of pills in a fucking revolution.

272
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:56,820


273
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:56,820


274
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,560
Break on through to the other side.

275
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,540
Break on through to the other side.

276
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,500
Because some genius must have a right.

277
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,140
Too much is always better than not enough.

278
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,680
What is the law?

279
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,660
We are not made for this.

280
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:24,660


281
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,780
A quarter of a million years go by.

282
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,500
Man is now aware of a world beyond his own senses.

283
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,720
A world of emotion, imagination, the supernatural.

284
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,840
It's time for all the animals, whether they slither or run,

285
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,300
to come and play.

286
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,500
Yes, in their skeleton costumes,

287
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,480
carrying signs of abandonment,

288
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,660
the world will not end.

289
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,480
It's already over.

290
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,980
We're all sober young,

291
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,760
and we don't know.

292
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,720
But babe,

293
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,440
I don't give a damn.

294
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,220
hope

295
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,500
home

296
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,220
Papa

297
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,540
Papa

298
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,560
Mama

299
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,340
Papa

300
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,520
Papa

301
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,720

302
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:23,500
you can't force me force me force me to have that which is perfect

303
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,560
they made you think that mars was heaven and we fell into the trap can you hear me earth

304
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,360
you've got to stop the next rocket

305
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,560
here

306
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:54,500

313
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:34,600
back into time when the only people that existed were troglodytes

314
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:43,940
cavemen cave women neanderthal neanderthal neanderthal

315
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,080
neanderthal

316
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:54,200
you know they say that an orangut a a neanderthal man dressed in a business suit would pass for just

00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:00,440
a particularly ugly human well i don't know if you put them in a white tux maybe but i don't know

318
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,580
if a regular business suit do it yeah i take that personally well the neanderthals are still here

319
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,460
i mean everyone kind of thinks that they're not here anymore but they are here oh yeah

320
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,680
long torso the short legs the low brow

321
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,700

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
elongated arms actually um i understand that the name smith is basically means neanderthal

324
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,040
well yeah where do you think they lived up in scotland and you know the northern climb the

325
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:40,280
northern area yeah ancient right the ancient pig the big nose actually that's what they say it's

326
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,500
the big nose that's how you can tell that uh the neanderthal is still with us

327
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,680
the huge snout yeah the big the big the big snorting

328
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:03,620
when in doubt snort you got it formations the the sloping forehead we're not talking piltdown man

329
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:13,880
here either no the gigantic long huge throbbing veiny tongue and peking man has nothing to do with

330
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,700
this either peking man has nothing to do with this either peking man has nothing to do with this either

331
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:23,140
this is neanderthal no peaking now no peaking man you know the latest uh evidence indicates that

332
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:33,220
neanderthals were could not interbreed with chromagnon and uh thus uh were literally just

333
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:39,900
made extinct and were not um you know what do you what do you call it uh integrated integrated into

334
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,200
the into the human race and but you know

335
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,500
was this human this was the organism uh that uh got destroyed in amount compared to what we jogo

336
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,100
they say we'll just never really know because we're the only one we won

337
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,420
체員은 그냥關係 oneola

338
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,900
there used to be a whole lot of different kind there were there were a bunch there

339
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:02,140
there was the gigantanthropith yeah or giganticus i'm i'm afraid they still call it

340
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:09,400
yeah and we we won but none of them by the winners including natural history yeah

341
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,400
yes we if only they could speak to us through Afterwards

342
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,040
we could ever understand who they really are

343
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,040


344
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,040


345
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,040


346
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,700
to understand that a kromag logical Behringen or shaman was just one of themselves

347
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:14,700


348
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,000
versus Chaz, the Neanderthal.

349
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,080
I'm stunning.

350
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,820
Friday, the Homo erectus.

351
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,320
This is the Neanderthal show everyone meanders about.

352
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,620
But Dave, the Australopithecus.

353
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,200
Are you sure that's not Nostrilopithecus?

354
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:44,040
The Nostrilopithecus, whose nostril hairs were of such fine sensory.

355
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,220
Well, they used to make vests out of them for wearing into battle

356
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,920
because the arrows couldn't penetrate a vest made of those hairs.

357
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,560
Do I hear Dave moaning in the background?

358
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,680
No, that's Bob.

359
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,840
That's Bob the drummer, Bob.

360
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,360
Dave was speaking through Bob.

361
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,780
I'm transforming.

362
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,340
Bob is channeling Dave.

363
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,600
The most primitive of all.

364
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,360
Bob was channeling Dave.

365
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,340
That's exactly right.

366
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,740
I tell you.

367
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,200
Bob was the very poor man.

368
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:21,380
The first of the two-legged primates to branch off from the newts.

369
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,380
Fig newts?

370
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,340
In subgenius science.

371
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,060
The fig newt.

372
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,800
Yes.

373
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,700
First there was the fig newt, the four-legged amphibian,

374
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:35,200
which evolved directly, suddenly, into the Yeti under excess technology.

375
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,700
Into the Yad newt.

376
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,920
Then instantly devolved back down into Pithecanthus,

377
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,480
which is represented now by Bob Mosick.

378
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,520
Which is a pig.

379
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:44,700


380
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,780
Yes, the many stages of man's development are represented by the various members of

381
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,320
Einstein's secret orchestra.

382
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,020
Universal appeal.

383
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,440
All of the members have huge craniums.

384
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,280
Enlarged.

385
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,660
Yeah, grossly, hideously enlarged craniums.

386
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:09,960
Slowing.

387
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,460
But frighteningly diminished.

388
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:13,980
Diminished.

389
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,680
Centered.

390
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,340
The subgenius was a vestigial organ.

391
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,000
Through years of evolution.

392
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,780
Eons upon eons of evolution.

393
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,840
In fact, the subgenius was so gigantically huge, egotistically wise,

394
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,120
that he required a tiny secondary brain just to control ethics and morality.

395
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,180
Now, seen here, in front of the grand jury,

396
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,840
testifying about the stain.

397
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:55,140
A world of emotion, imagination, the supernatural, the succession of day and night, the rhythm

398
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,860
of the seasons, the pattern of life and death are mysteries he tries to understand.

399
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:06,040
These cavemen hope to exert a magical power over the animals by painting their images.

400
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,080
It's all right, you can relax, now, go back to sleep.

401
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,720
Is that a Neanderthal stain or a Cro-Magnon stain?

402
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,160
Was it just a dime?

403
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,160


404
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:32,940
a dream? Are you getting all of the guilt and none of the sex? Bob gets the guilt. Out of man's desire to influence forces beyond himself, a simple religion arises in the hostile world of 25,000 years ago.

405
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,120
auf Wiedersehen.

406
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:21,320
I'm just another guy standing in line with his quarter, waiting to drop it in the slot.

407
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,380
Out of man's desire to influence forces beyond himself, a simple religion arises.

408
00:22:44,640 --> 00:23:05,800
Like the hands of Bob, like the hands of Bob, like the hands of Bob, kicking like a clock, like the hands of Bob, bringing you round the block, you know.

409
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:13,980
Like the hands of Bob, like the hands of Bob.

410
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:24,460
He's gonna turn your life into a rocket, send you $30, don't forget.

411
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:35,240
From the hands of Bob to the hands of Bob, from the hands of Bob to the hands of Bob.

412
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,760
Because Bob takes on the part of you that is him, that is you.

413
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,980
Because if you aren't listening to this right now,

414
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,420
you are in the place that's supposed to be hearing this signal.

415
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:52,620
In whatever form the signal may be taking, it is still seeping its way into your mind, whether you like it to or not.

416
00:23:52,920 --> 00:24:10,360
By the hands of Bob, like the hands of Bob, like the hands of Bob, holding you down.

417
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,140
Like the hands of Bob.

418
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,080
Like the hands of Bob.

419
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,500
Or slapping you upside the head.

420
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:27,920
Like the hands of Bob, till you're better off than not dead, like the hands of Bob.

421
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,740
Like the hands of Bob.

422
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,980
Like the hands of Bob.

423
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:42,540
Like, like, like the hands of Bob, like the, like, like the hands of Bob.

424
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,640
Like, like, like the, like, like the hands of Bob.

425
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:43,640


426
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,140
And am I right and am I not wrong, why aren't you there?

427
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,140


428
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,140


429
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,140


430
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,140


431
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,140


432
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,140


433
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,000
quicker than me

434
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,120
I've got the hands of I

435
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,460
Don't you watch out for that one

436
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,660
Hands of I

437
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,340
Oh Pete, my guitar's stuck!

438
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,000
What is this, a pie fight?

439
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,320
Get away from my

440
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:58,780
blister!

441
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,040
Stop punching mannequins!

442
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,360
Please, no!

443
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
You thought this was high ground entertainment?

444
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,740
Yeah!

445
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,400
This is low class free vodka, folks

446
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,880
Sadistical sputum

447
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,260
from the bottom rotten

448
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,260
We do this for the free corn on the cob

449
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,940
Make no doubt about it

450
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,340
But you will too

451
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,520
come the real X-Day

452
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,660
Right, princess?

453
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,880
The corn and the bobs

454
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,800
Hands of I

455
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,820
Hands of I

456
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,080
Hands of I

457
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,800
Hands of I

458
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:34,800


459
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Hands of I

460
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,080
Hands of I

461
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,020
Hands of I

462
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,660
Hands of I

463
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:49,740
Hands of I

464
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:49,760
Hands of I

465
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:49,820
Hands of I

466
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,320
Hands of I

467
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:50,840
Hands of I

468
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:50,860
Hands of I

469
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,180
Hands of I

470
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,280
zony

471
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,820
Hands of I

472
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,880
Hands of I

473
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,320
Hands of I

474
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:11,860
Hands of I

475
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,620
I'm talking to you ladies as well as you men.

476
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,980
He's gonna make you come here all over again.

477
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,740
Till you don't know whether you're doing a bad Bob Dylan imitation.

478
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,400
Even though you didn't really start to do the real Bob Dylan's part.

479
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,580
And I'm not gonna go there. No, no. I don't go there.

480
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,300
That's the old 1970's radio production, cheap production shop.

481
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,120
And I'm losing it anyway.

482
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,620
By the hands of Bob.

483
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,340
Hey Mr. Bob, play a song for me.

484
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,460
I'm not sleepy and I'm not sleeping.

485
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,760
By the hands of Bob.

486
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,920
This is not copyright by the Dylan Organization.

487
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,940
By the hands of Bob.

488
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,500
By the hands of Bob.

489
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,380
Bob's gonna protect you folks.

490
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,940
By the hands of Bob.

491
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,020
Yes, even if you get thrown into jail for that copyright lawsuit.

492
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,400
By the hands of Bob.

493
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,860
Bob will keep smiling and working for you.

494
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,700
By the hands of Bob.

495
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,820
Even while you're behind bars, Bob will secretly be making deals.

496
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,000
By the hands of Bob.

497
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,540
On your behalf in ways that you'd never even expect.

498
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,320
By the hands of Bob.

499
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,600
So that when you get out again in 40, 50, 70 years, whatever it is.

500
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,520
By the hands of Bob.

501
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,220
And they've been able to increase life expectancy to the infinite.

502
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,820
By the hands of Bob.

503
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,300
You'll appreciate the hands of Bob.

504
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,520
Having turned that rollercoaster control out of the hands of the conspiracy.

505
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,460
All the while lubricating them with your money.

506
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,120
So don't forget folks, that's P.O. Box 14030675214.

507
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,400
It's never too late.

508
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,020
Dallas, Texas, I'm sorry 75214.

509
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,900
It's never too late to at least send that dollar in and find out more about the church and suching as friends.

510
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,160
But even more important right now is the city we're in.

511
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,300
The city of Cleveland.

512
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,900
And the hands of Bob are everywhere in this city, aren't they?

513
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,460
They're everywhere here.

514
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,100
We've noticed that since we've been here.

515
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:20,680
Even as I was strolling through the arc-rum-produced streets of the 1962 industrial wasteland.

516
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,280
It's the backyard of this very swamp itself.

517
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,940
I could feel the hands of Bob.

518
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:33,560
As the street guy told us that he was going to run a shop through that kid that might have stolen that car next door.

519
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:33,920
Had not.

520
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,660
The very hands of Einstein's secret orchestra reached out in old-fashioned hillbilly style.

521
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,120
And scared the crap out of the boy.

522
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,540
With a rock-salt filled...

523
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,140
Well I won't say what it was.

524
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,160
But let's just say that that boy probably won't be coming by these parts again anytime soon.

525
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,000
No, we used the pluvius tube though, didn't we?

526
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,920
Yeah. And it makes us feel better.

527
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:57,960
Sometimes.

528
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,540
Sometimes as we contemplate our lives across this great internet of time and space.

529
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,240
That brings us here.

530
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:10,120
Princess Ouillardeau and Chaz Smith and Bunsen Cowboy Dave and myself this evening.

531
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,800
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy with you once again.

532
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,540
And me Reverend Stang.

533
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,820
We're just talking trash about Bob and everything that we can think of.

534
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,700
I'm here too.

535
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,600
What's the number here Chaz?

536
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,780
Of this studio?

537
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,580
I think it's 655.

538
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,600
Is Radio 5 on the air?

539
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,420
No, we're not on the air.

540
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,580
But we are alive dear friends.

541
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,100
And obviously this is a very Einsteinian secret.

542
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,120
Orchestral show.

543
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:45,580
That bunch got together in the basement of the Swamp Radio outside of the WCSB studios.

544
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,780
Deep in the ESO psychedelic basement itself.

545
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,560
And cranked out some amazing radio.

546
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,920
I tried to join in by telephone now and then.

547
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,460
And what you've been listening to is a mixture of that and various other Einstein secret orchestra radio shows.

548
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,040
There at WCSB Cleveland.

549
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,380
Friends, we've been beginning to decompress the X Day rant and music tapes.

550
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,340
And maybe we'll get to those later on in the show.

551
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,460
But probably not.

552
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,360
Dear friends.

553
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:17,900
Thank you.

554
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,020
Ah yes dear friends.

555
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,980
And we're back.

556
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:29,780
And we'll be going back down deep into Einstein's secret orchestra.

557
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,680
But first I'd like to give you their address.

558
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,440
And I'll give you their address.

559
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,160
Because you can get the amazing Einstein secret tapes from, got that pencil ready?

560
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:47,920
ESO at post office box 81555.

561
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,520
That's an easy one.

562
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:57,940
PO box 81555 Cleveland, Ohio 44181.

563
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,580
And I did manage to dig up a little bit of X Day.

564
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,780
Ranting.

565
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,580
I've got the Luciferian Liberation Front.

566
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,900
And Papa Joe Mama.

567
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,340
And we will go into X Day.

568
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,980
Back to X Day.

569
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,480
But first.

570
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,140
This.

571
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,960
You find yourself saying.

572
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,960
We now we know.

573
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,140
We now we know.

574
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,140
It keeps you.

575
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,360
We now we know.

576
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,340
Do you know?

577
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,700
We now we know.

578
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,280
That it took a concerted effort.

579
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,940
We now we know.

580
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,540
To track comets.

581
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,260
We now we know.

582
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,260
That could be on a potential course for.

583
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,620
We now we know.

584
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,160
Earth.

585
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,020
We now we know.

586
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,340
We now we know.

587
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,040
Did you know?

588
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,620
We now we know.

589
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,320
That whales.

590
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,640
Talk to each other.

591
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,060
Planet wide.

592
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,840
We now we know.

593
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,760
We now we know.

594
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,000
We now we know.

595
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,000


596
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,900
There they are now.

597
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,180
The big sperm whale.

598
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,200
We now we know.

599
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,300
With its huge massive head.

600
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,640
We now we know.

601
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,380
Thin little lower jaw.

602
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,320
And its beady little eyes.

603
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,560
We now we know.

604
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,120
The greatest largest living thing on the planet earth.

605
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,680
Now or ever.

606
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,820
We now we know.

607
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,560
Can you tell the difference between these two species?

608
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,060
We now we know.

609
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,420
One is highly appalled.

610
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,960
The other one is barely exact.

611
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,960
A comparison between these two species reveals one vital.

612
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,320
Insightful.

613
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,860
We now we know.

614
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,140
We now we know.

615
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,460
We now we know.

616
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:48,960
It is all known.

617
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,700
It is all thought.

618
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,540
We now we know.

619
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,040
We now we know.

620
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,620
We now we know.

621
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,440
We know, we know.

622
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,780
We now we know.

623
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,540
We know, we know.

624
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,000
Raw, raw, raw.

625
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,040
We now we know.

626
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,740
We know.

627
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,100
We now we know.

628
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,120
We know.

629
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,400
We now we know.

630
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,540
We now we know.

631
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,000
We know.

632
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,100
We know.

633
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,480
We know we know.

634
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,380
now we know.

635
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,660
We now, we know.

636
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,400
We now, we know.

637
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,580
We now, we know.

638
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,260
We now, we know.

639
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:41,780
Happy trails, heads or tails, bombs away.

640
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,400
Happy trails, bombs away.

641
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,520
Here we go.

642
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,520
We now, we know.

643
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,920
We now, we know.

644
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,240
We now, we know.

645
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,800
We now, we know.

646
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,440
We now, we know.

647
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,220
I would say, Dr. Lester, your experiment very definitely should go on.

648
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,860
Why should people not know about this?

649
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,640
Why cannot people know this?

650
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,880
This is the greatest discovery since the invention of fire.

651
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,320
Come on.

652
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:24,820
I can't believe it.

653
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,960
You know, you know, Dwight.

654
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,960
It's, it's...

655
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,260
Dr. Lester, please sit down.

656
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:29,640
Sit down.

657
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,160
You're babbling.

658
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,540
Now just keep your hands where they are and I'll remove the beasts of Dendrite from the

659
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:35,900
safe.

660
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,240
Just keep your hands where they are.

661
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,860
Do not move, Dr. Lester.

662
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,200
I know what you're capable of.

663
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,880
Ah, now I'm hypnotified, Dr. Lester.

664
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,820
Not the hypnotified.

665
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,000
It's getting hot up here.

666
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,760
I've got to get, I've got to get to that safe.

667
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,060
I've got to get the Dendrite before Lester destroys the world.

668
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:54,500
I've got to get the Dendrite before Lester destroys the world.

669
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,640
Who am I talking to?

670
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,840
I'm not talking to anyone.

671
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,120
I'm, it's an aside.

672
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:58,460
That's right.

673
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,160
It's a stage command.

674
00:34:59,220 --> 00:34:59,600
An aside.

675
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,260
I'm speaking to Earth.

676
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,260
You and Fiona know that my cell phone is...

677
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:07,740
Lester, Lester, those waves, those brain waves are killing me.

678
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,220
I...

679
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,600
I'm not talking to anyone.

680
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,080
I'm talking to the Earth.

681
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:53,800
I'm talking to the Earth.

682
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,180
I'm not talking to anyone.

683
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,360
I'm not talking to anyone.

684
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,360
I'm not talking to anyone.

685
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:16,880
I'm talking to the Earth.

686
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,060
I'm talking to the Earth.

687
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,440
I'm talking to the Earth.

688
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,680
I'm just talking to the Earth anyway.

689
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:37,800
Not with anyone.

690
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,620
I'm not talking to Earth.

691
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:39,680
I'm only talking to people.

692
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:39,680


693
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:39,780
We're talking to Earth.

694
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:39,780


695
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:39,780


696
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:46,800
It's everybody else.

697
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:01,740
Thank you.

698
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,340
Thank you.

699
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,200
Thank you.

700
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,760
Thank you.

701
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,560
Thank you.

702
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,560
Thank you.

703
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,760
Thank you.

704
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,340
Thank you.

705
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,940
slightly skew in the hair sticking up out of the brassiere i don't know sometimes it's the best we

706
00:40:53,940 --> 00:41:01,960
can do man and you know false slack is better than no slack at all no that's true at least

707
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:09,060
there's the illusion of going there at least you had the hope that one day you might slip it into a

708
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:15,060
self-lubricated socket yeah that's what we've all been dreaming of but you know i'm just getting so

709
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,900
tired of waiting i think i might you know just go out and cut off one of my legs and just use the

710
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:26,160
bloody stump on myself until i can pass out that beats pumping a dry hole yep that's what most of

711
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,760
us have been doing now if one of them is say for instance dressed up like a priest or something

712
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,200
like that then it's probably got a dry hole for sure right well if they're dressed up like a nun

713
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:41,700
that would probably be more like what you were looking for if i know we don't know neither one

714
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,560
of us have had carnal knowledge of one of the ladies of the lord

715
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:44,840

717
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:59,480

718
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:05,420
they had actually eight women of the log they had ho-hos for what is the log

719
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,160

00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:44,540
you

734
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:44,640
you

735
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:44,640


736
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,040
you

737
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,040


738
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,040


739
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,040


740
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,040


741
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,040


742
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,040


743
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,040


744
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,040


745
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,040


746
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,500
hope

747
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,140
are we

748
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,180
having a good time tonight

749
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:48,700
nope

750
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:51,480
good

751
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:52,860
emotion

752
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:54,940
good

753
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,580
you aint

754
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,360
buy

755
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:58,560
'm

756
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:58,960
and

757
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,020
you

758
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,600
won't

759
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,560
dr

760
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:05,560


761
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:05,560


762
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,480
are we

763
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,140
pretty messy

764
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,160
a lot of times but if we keep interviewing trip apart

765
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,740
Diana and Mother Teresa.

766
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,860
I mean, let's just think about it, friends.

767
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,100
It was so ironic and it was so tragic all at the same time.

768
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:28,700
I mean, they died within just one week of one another.

769
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,980
And they had so much in common, too, didn't they?

770
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,760
Well, maybe not really, but...

771
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,020
I mean, they both supported important charities and did great deeds.

772
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,000
And they were both very popular with the media, weren't they?

773
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:52,140
It's only natural after these very public and popular figures die

774
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,220
that we take a step back and reflect to ask ourselves,

775
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,720
what now?

776
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,600
What happens to the spirit of these two great women?

777
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,380
Will both souls be present

778
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,740
when we reach the end of the world?

779
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,240
Will both souls be present when we reach the promised land on next day?

780
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:08,920
No!

781
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:19,320
Well, friends, it's very difficult to predict what Bob and his infinite wisdom will do.

782
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:25,740
But God would not give us guidelines unless he intended us to use them.

783
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:31,560
And like any religion, it's always funner to apply those guidelines to other people than it is ourselves.

784
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,720
So let's put these two needs...

785
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:46,400
So let's start off with our freedom consciousness.

786
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,700
We'll look into both of these kids.

787
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:49,680
Let's start off with these girls this week.

788
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,500
They're the ditz imprint,

789
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:51,980
although if you remember,

790
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,140
they

791
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:52,140


792
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,440
RES la

793
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,700
PRES C sin

794
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:06,480
en

795
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:14,780
model. Now isn't that nice? I guess the message that she emanated was that if you take real good

796
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:20,460
care of your skin and wear cute little outfits, that at age 16 you can quit school and marry

797
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:27,520
royalty, right? Now I'm not really sure that that's a very realistic option for most women,

798
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:33,500
but you know, hey, if it helps just one person grow up and become a princess, then I guess it's

799
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:39,980
worth it. After all, the media wouldn't say it if it weren't true now, would they? They also claim

800
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:46,280
that she devoted a great deal of her time visiting the sick, raising money for AIDS, and urging to

801
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:54,040
stop for landmines. Well, that's pretty daring of her, isn't it? I mean, if you really want to

802
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,820
endear yourself to the media, I can't think of a better way to do it than to publicly embrace the

803
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:03,020
sick, raise funds for AIDS, and campaign to stop landmines. I mean, those are all very politically

804
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:03,480
correct. I mean, those are all very politically correct. I mean, those are all very politically

805
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,860
correct. Little items, and you know, it's kind of a non-brainer, isn't it?

806
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,360
So, no doubt, if we were all given millions of dollars, you and I, and we never had to work a

807
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:23,140
single day in our lives, then maybe some of us might also show how considerate we were for the

808
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:27,360
down-and-out by giving, not our money, because we might need that later on to buy ourselves

809
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:33,200
another castle or something, but our time. Our time. Not too much of it,

810
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:38,660
you know, a few hours every week or maybe every other month in order to waltz into the limelight

811
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:44,160
and soak up all that attention and show how much we care about whatever the favorite cause of the year is.

812
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:50,060
Now, some people, they might criticize Lady Di for being a slut.

813
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,260
A slut!

814
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:59,500
Not claiming that she was passed around from one rich Arab to another like some hussy in a harem.

815
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,860
But I feel that's a little harsh.

816
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,020
I mean, after all, the British have been screwing the Arabs for centuries.

817
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,940
It's only fair that every once in a while the tables get turned now, isn't it?

818
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,900
So you strip away all the glamour and the media myth-making, and what do you have left?

819
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,060
Well, in my humble opinion, you have just another rich kid trying to prove how unsnotty,

820
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:26,500
how unpretentious, and how unsuperficial she really is.

821
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,380
But, you know, compared to everyone else who's rich, who doesn't really give a shit,

822
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,360
I guess that's pretty magnanimous of her also.

823
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,600
So let's give her a big hand for Lady Di.

824
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,740
Yes, come on now.

825
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,720
Lady Di, we salute you.

826
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:48,100
Now, in the other corner, weighing a measly 87 pounds and wearing a worn-out smock,

827
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,680
is Mother Teresa.

828
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:57,420
For all the talk about how much she had in common with Diana,

829
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,520
there were far more differences than there were similarities.

830
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,760
Mother Teresa?

831
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,720
Mother Teresa was the opposite of young and attractive.

832
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:06,920
Damn straight.

833
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:11,200
In fact, I guess you could say she was downright ugly and old.

834
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,700
I mean, yeah, okay, we'll be realistic, all right?

835
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,500
If you gave her a broom and a pointed hat, she'd win the Halloween contest every year.

836
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:25,300
But, you know, despite her god-awful looks, she did something Diana never did.

837
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:29,520
She put our money where our toothless mouth was.

838
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:33,200
And she gave everything she had for what she believed in.

839
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:33,560
Yeah.

840
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,880
Boy, she's totally...

841
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,880
While Diana donated a few of her used designer outfits,

842
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,720
these dresses to charity auctions,

843
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,660
and then wrote them off on her million-dollar taxes,

844
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,460
Mother Teresa kept her clothes.

845
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,200
And you want to know why?

846
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,180
Why?

847
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,560
Because she had no extra ones to give.

848
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,460
She only had two dresses in her entire wardrobe.

849
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:00,000
And besides, if she had tried to sell either of them,

850
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,020
who would want to buy a sneaky old dress that would stand up by itself in the corner

851
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:03,480
without any...

852
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,180
I mean, that's disgusting, isn't it?

853
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,600
But that's not the point, friends.

854
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,080
The point is that while Diana did so little for what she had and believed in,

855
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,180
Teresa gave up everything.

856
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,520
Everything but those two sneaky dresses and a dog-eared copy of the Bible.

857
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,960
Her only three possessions in the entire world.

858
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,900
So I ask you, if you were Bob,

859
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,040
and you had to decide which soul you were going to save

860
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,880
and give that free ride to the promised land,

861
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,820
would it take you long to decide?

862
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:35,720
Would it?

863
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,320
Hell no.

864
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,920
You'd toss that wrinkled old bitch Teresa out on her withered old ass

865
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,700
and make that voluptuous young princess on board to service the troops.

866
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,080
I mean, come on now.

867
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:52,800
Let's be realistic.

868
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:53,800
She's rich.

869
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:54,700
She's beautiful.

870
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,100
She's promiscuous.

871
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,340
And she's dead.

872
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,400
And she's dead, but she can still be warmed up.

873
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,460
I mean, what more could a subgenius want?

874
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,300
They don't call them pleasure saucers for nothing, my friends.

875
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,780
And you know, that's the beauty of Bob.

876
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,100
Because he never forgets the little guy.

877
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:19,800
Even if you're poor, ugly, arthritic,

878
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:26,400
you still get your chance at begging royalty for just 30 lousy bucks on X-Day.

879
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,640
Now, I think that's worth the price of admission alone,

880
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:33,220
but, you know,

881
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,420
that's just 30 bucks.

882
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,280
That's worth it for me and my membership.

883
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,340
But, you know, you get celebrity sex and eternal salvation at no additional charge.

884
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,360
That's why they call Bob the Patriot Saint of Sales.

885
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,180
That's why Bob figures all these things out.

886
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:51,740
Because he knows that you can sell anything once you've got sex appeal.

887
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,580
So, for Bob's sake, get out there, buy that membership,

888
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,140
grease yourself up to give old Lady Di a bang on X-Day.

889
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,720
And we expect to see you there at 7 a.m. on July 5th, 1988.

890
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,140
Do I have Grace Bob?

891
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:05,920
Grace Bob!

892
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:13,980
Yes, dear friends, Papa Joe Mama,

893
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,400
the, uh, what, what, what, what,

894
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:25,240
the amazing Father Joe Mama there at X-Day at Brushwood in 1998,

895
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:30,480
uh, waiting for the saucers to arrive

896
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,940
with a crowd of about 450.

897
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:36,300
Of the faithful, the truly faithful.

898
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:36,980
And you know what?

899
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,780
I think a whole lot of them are going to be just as faithful next year as they were this year.

900
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,980
And I don't think we'll have to, I don't think we'll have to do it again after this year.

901
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:50,820
I'm a, I'm a Dos Ekean, Dos Ekean myself.

902
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,940
I think on X-Day 2, 1999, July 5th, 1999.

903
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,840
I'm pretty sure that that's probably what Bob was talking about.

904
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,600
Friends, if, if that, uh,

905
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:09,400
throws you, then throw, uh, a self-addressed stamped envelope our way for free information.

906
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,780
Just send that self-addressed stamped envelope,

907
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:20,500
or, or a buck or something to, uh, www.subgenius.com.

908
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:25,100
Or, if you want to do it the other way, send it to Bob.

909
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:29,600
And I'm going to give that post office box, it's a P.O. box,

910
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,960
Box 140306.

911
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,520
That's Box 1-4-0-3-0-6.

912
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:41,400
Dallas, Texas, 7-5-2-1-4.

913
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,360
7-5-2-1-4.

914
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:52,400
Friends, and I love Einstein Secret Orchestra so much that I'm going to go back and find this...

915
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,560
E-t-t-t-t-m, hmm.

916
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:58,340
You know, it's kind of like Donna Fosse.

917
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,580
The, the, uh, um...

918
00:52:59,580 --> 00:52:59,580


919
00:52:59,580 --> 00:52:59,580


920
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:06,480
the scientists and Jane Goodall, both of those scientists who studied the great apes,

921
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,880
had to live among them for a long time before they were able to photograph them.

922
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:17,420
By the same token, I went and lived among the subgeniuses, the pagans, and the other bonobo

923
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:23,920
times, and was until that they became adjusted to my presence with the camera,

924
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,640
and I was able to bring back photographs of my adventures among these strange people.

925
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,880
So when are you going to take off your full-body subgenius suit

926
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,060
and reveal your perfectly normal human form within?

927
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:45,500
Only when the time comes for shucking the ship, the shell. The time is not yet for the shedding.

928
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,380
Ah, no public shucking yet?

929
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:53,760
Only after the hunt then comes the shunt.

930
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,080
Dog heaven.

931
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:57,540
Ah.

932
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:58,800
Uh.

933
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,480
I want to go to dog heaven.

934
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,200
Take me to dog heaven.

935
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,140
I want to go to wee heaven.

936
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:08,740
Oh.

937
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:09,840
Didn't we go to wee heaven last year?

938
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,700
I don't know whether you could handle wee heaven, seriously.

939
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,520
I could try. I could grab on with both hands.

940
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:22,400
Well, first of all, you're going to have to take this little pill right here.

941
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,600
And then you're going to have to take another one.

942
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,500
It's shaped like a little UFO.

943
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:26,380
Huh?

944
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,540
The pill is shaped like a little UFO.

945
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,220
It is a little tiny UFO.

946
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,880
It tastes like a little UFO, too.

947
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:43,920
Well, and you know, X-Day did happen, and the escape vessels of the sex goddesses did show up at Brushwood out there.

948
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,540
But they were the size of shirt buttons.

949
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:50,400
And when they landed on the ground, the subgeniuses went and trampled them all.

950
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:58,100
Just smashed them in their confusion, chasing after the little empty pills that we were dispensing.

951
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:04,020
At the same time, it's kind of sad that the entire exit fleet was destroyed that way.

952
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,180
Not all the pills were empty.

953
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,700
But that is only one theory.

954
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:14,000
That doesn't preclude the Dos Equis X-Day arrival next year.

955
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:23,040
I trust that you all do have faith that the Xs are going to arrive in 1999.

956
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:26,360
I am a Dos Equis. I am a Dos Equis.

957
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,220
Let me down.

958
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,060
You know, Nostradamus was, too.

959
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:42,380
If you study Nostradamus, he says the great king of Jacare, or jokery, will descend from the sky on July 5th, or the fifth day of the eighth month, 1999.

960
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,000
We were aware of that.

961
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,620
I think Dobbs himself was probably aware of that when he prophesied 1998.

962
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,660
But I think Dobbs was going with Edgar Cayce, you know, as being a more recent sleeping prophet.

963
00:55:55,660 --> 00:56:01,040
And then there's Nostradamus, who says that the saucers will be arriving on Nos Equis.

964
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:04,680
Damn that old Nostradamus.

965
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,200
Yeah.

966
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,240
Well, she was a great prophet.

967
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,340
If only she had plucked her nose hairs a little better.

968
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,000
I can see why she was fixated on that date, though.

969
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,900
She hung the little coffee cans off the nose hairs.

970
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,820
Listen, you can hear those coffee cans now.

971
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:22,380
Yes.

972
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,640
Connie is pounding on those coffee cans.

973
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,820
With her little drumstick.

974
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,460
Yeah, we're gearing up big time for Dos Equis.

975
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,360
Everything. Everything.

976
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,600
Oh, I just bought a new, a new, uh, I just bought a parachute.

977
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:37,580
What?

978
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:42,400
Yeah, I bought a 35-foot personnel army parachute.

979
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,160
Yeah.

980
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,740
We're gonna inflate it.

981
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,820
You were just so disappointed when that puffer domed it came down and collapsed.

982
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,500
Yeah, now I have my own puffer dome.

983
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,080
We have to make our own.

984
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,340
Oh, we need two domes.

985
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,700
Build your own ship.

986
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:57,820
Build your own ship.

987
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,420
That's a good one.

988
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,860
Don't you understand what I'm doing here?

989
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:00,760
Piece by piece.

990
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,280
You gotta have a parachute.

991
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,360
I'm with you, man.

992
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,540
Change is affected one little step at a time.

993
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:06,980
Yeah.

994
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:12,120
You gotta have a parachute because even if you can't open the hatch, even if you can't

995
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:16,580
get out in time to use the parachute, at least it gives you something to do until you hit.

996
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:17,660
It was great.

997
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,020
Louie's goat cheese was so good in the end.

998
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:25,320
It was great.

999
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:32,000
In the end, it was the goat cheese that lay in the refrigerator of Einstein's secret

1000
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,340
orchestra once again in the swamp in New Haven, Ohio, deep beneath the sycamore trees.

1001
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,700
And the crying locusts in the night sing once again the Whippoorwills and remind us that

1002
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:47,720
the entire radio audience is also along for the ride.

1003
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,560
So friends, don't forget to remember what you didn't remember to forget.

1004
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:56,700
And those car keys that you left in the other left-hand dresser drawer can't be the other

1005
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,060
ones because those are with your friend Murray.

1006
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:05,740
So this is just a friendly reminder from all of us to all of you to keep track of all the

1007
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:06,620
little details.

1008
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,900
Isn't that right, Frank?

1009
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:12,080
The pre-cli-suit potentates have been brought to you by a generous grant from the people

1010
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:12,980
who bring you down.

1011
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:17,760
Also by Immaculate Wonder goat cheese, the goat cheese you need when it's time to get

1012
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,060
down.

1013
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,540
And by Alien Smegma pie for a taste that's out of this world.

1014
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:21,540


1015
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,420
And by Bleepo's naughty little panties.

1016
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,100
Want to get those ladies screaming?

1017
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:29,640
Buy a heapin' humpin' stag of Bleepo's little panties.

1018
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:39,860
We turn with the reclusive bat after this word from...

1019
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,080
Is that...

1020
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,060
No, I'm reading the wrong...

1021
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,680
Antique frequencies!

1022
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:45,500
Antique frequencies!

1023
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:46,980
Wow!

1024
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:47,900
Look at that!

1025
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,540
All you can uncover are the things that are covered before.

1026
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:56,100
And look, open it up and the red filter filters out the useless information you don't need

1027
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,080
and you can only read what they want you to.

1028
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,440
And there's plenty of bindings too.

1029
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:05,480
In case you read the wrong things, you'll be slapped down with a high voltage shot to

1030
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,960
the brain from this electromagnetic current force finder.

1031
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,700
Uh oh, that's a thought crime.

1032
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,000
Uh oh, that's another thought crime.

1033
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,520
I tossed it.

1034
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:20,520


1035
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:20,520


1036
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:26,780
So I thought, kind, if you find you're getting too strong in any one area, don't worry, we'll

1037
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:27,560
weaken you.

1038
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:28,480
And your will.

1039
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:29,680
Boop!

1040
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,340
There's another thought crime.

1041
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,220
Look out, they're around you.

1042
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:40,620
So keep that hat pulled down over your ears and keep your blinders on and buy this brand

1043
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:41,740
new package from...

1044
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,200
Ankle Weights Unlimited.

1045
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,940
And forget what the sensors say.

1046
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,580
Forget everything.

1047
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,400
Try some today.

1048
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:50,800
And try some of the stuff you don't know.

1049
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:50,800


1050
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,780
Forget what you weren't told before.

1051
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,080
Forget what we just told you.

1052
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,320
Forget.

1053
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,460
Forget.

1054
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,380
Remember.

1055
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:00,460
Forget.

1056
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:01,560
Remember.

1057
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:02,760
Forget.

1058
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,000
Go to sleep.

1059
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,500
Forget.

1060
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:05,840
Forget.

1061
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:06,880
Remember.

1062
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:07,660
Forget.

1063
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:08,400
Forget.

1064
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:09,720
Forget.

1065
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:10,140
Forget.

1066
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,400
We're all sitting together listening to this.

1067
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:12,820
Forget.

1068
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,740
Remember.

1069
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,220
Forget.

1070
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,160
Remember.

1071
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:17,320
Forget.

1072
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,320
Remember.

1073
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:18,320


1074
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:18,320


1075
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,460
We're all sitting together just like that.

1076
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:27,160
Children just love to bite Bob.
