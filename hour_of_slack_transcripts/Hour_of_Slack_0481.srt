1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,820
I can do three shows by three o'clock this afternoon, don't you think?

2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,620
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,220
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

4
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,020
The subgenius hour of slack!

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,640
There is absolutely no other possibility.

6
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,900
Now, let me introduce your tutors.

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,780
She's also been to Nicaragua.

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,360
By the way, she may also speak Spanish.

9
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,580
Welcome back to the program.

10
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,000
Tony Bennett moves me. He moves me.

11
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,740
He was tremendous singing the Duke Ellington, ladies and gentlemen.

12
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,300
Folks, you know, do you like your cults? Do you enjoy your cults?

13
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,920
You follow the antics of the Jim Jones, the People's Temple.

14
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,720
You follow the David Koretz and the...

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,820
They're gone. Who are you going to turn to now?

16
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,760
Well, folks, I'll tell you.

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,680
All over the country, people are reading the teachings of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

18
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,300
Ladies and gentlemen, from the Church of the Subgenius,

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,080
please welcome the Reverend Ivan Stang!

20
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,360
He can help you find Bob.

21
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,260
No.

22
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,400
You must ask him first.

23
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,260
How do I do that?

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,140
Oh, you have all the clues.

25
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,980
You know.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,680
Me too.

27
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,660
You guys really are...

28
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,660
Who are these guys?

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,400
Are they insane?

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,680
Are they insane?

31
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,600
They're not insane.

32
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,100
They're the true saviors of this existence.

33
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,840
Turn off this tape.

34
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,860
But now, this doesn't involve anything like flying saucers or anything.

35
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,900
These people sound credible.

36
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,760
He was completely insane.

37
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,820
Think so?

38
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,060
But people saw Bob.

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,240
People saw him in visions.

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,100
Laura, Maddy, Sarah Palmer.

41
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,220
Gentlemen, there's...

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,880
more in heaven and earth than is dreamt up in our philosophy.

43
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,540
Amen.

44
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,580
I saw the experiments he had performed on the others.

45
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,160
I did not want to be like that.

46
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,380
It was niggi.

47
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,620
They were horrible.

48
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,040
If I could not believe it, it was ghastly.

49
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,980
It killed me.

50
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,860
I thought, my God, these people are no longer human.

51
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,680
Can you hear me, niggi?

52
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,220
You killed me, niggi.

53
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,140
And left me here to thank the wrath.

54
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,920
You committed the perfect crime.

55
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,940
You killed me.

56
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,740
Niggi, stop.

57
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:07,940
Laura.

58
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,880
I killed her.

59
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,640
Oh, my God.

60
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,820
I killed my daughter.

61
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,000
Niggi, he made me kill her.

62
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,340
He made me.

63
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,960
I did not want to kill her.

64
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,040
But what could I do?

65
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,460
He blackmailed me.

66
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,140
Die.

67
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,460
What?

68
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:25,760
No.

69
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,440
No.

70
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,280
No, it can't be.

71
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,660
Not Bob and Niggi.

72
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,200
The carrier wants to kill her.

73
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,200


74
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,200


75
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,200


76
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,200


77
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,640
It is really scary.

78
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,620
And the New Testament is more sweetness than light.

79
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,340
They are both scary.

80
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:32,720
Yes.

81
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,740
These are both scary.

82
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,820
They are real scary.

83
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,460
Now, unlike like the Scientologists and stuff.

84
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,720
Scientologists.

85
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,120
And some of these other mail order type religions.

86
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,200
I lift my leg against these rival cults.

87
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,300
I see.

88
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,320
Well, now you have to pay many thousand.

89
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,000
Bob uses them as fire hydrants.

90
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,160
Now, basically you have to pay many thousands of dollars to get the secrets out of the Scientologists

91
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,900
and stuff, right?

92
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,380
That is right.

93
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:56,680
And.

94
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:03,520
Oh, yeah, $15,000 or something just to get the same kind of lousy advice you'd get for $8 at the local psychic fair.

95
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,060
Uh-huh.

96
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,860
So you guys actually guarantee salvation.

97
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,080
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

98
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:20,700
In other words, if you end up at the gates of hell as a result of believing on Bob's word, he'll be there with a $90 check for you.

99
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,780
And that $89.95 book held on five cents in eternity.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,780
And that's all you need.

101
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,860
I mean, you know, but that's, you know, besides the point.

102
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,700
I mean, why Southern Baptists would have to be right for that to be true.

103
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,760
And, you know, if that happened, look, we're all in big trouble.

104
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,860
Let me put it this way.

105
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,420
They said that we were going to go to hell, right?

106
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,220
Uh-huh.

107
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,000
What choice did we have but to start our own religion?

108
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,400
You know, if they're going to back you up against a wall like that, you just have to start from scratch all over again.

109
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:55,760
Try it.

110
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,320
Change the rules.

111
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,960
Yeah, I mean, some people may think that that can't be done.

112
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,380
And, well, I guess we'll find out the hard way, won't we?

113
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,460
Abandon all hope.

114
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,240
He who enter here.

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,420
Ah, can you give me a sentence with the word ismus in it?

116
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,520
Uh-huh.

117
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,120
This must be my lucky day.

118
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,120
Welcome to United.

119
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,580
Ah, yes, dear friend.

120
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,240
We're back, I guess.

121
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,360
And, oh, there's so much tape here, I just don't even know where to start.

122
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:46,220
But I guess I better start somewhere and explain to you perhaps just what the heck's been going on here in lovely subgenius foundation world.

123
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,160
Oh, listen to that phone going off.

124
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,800
He, he, no way, man.

125
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,540
Forget it.

126
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,820
And, ah, yes, yes, yes.

127
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,440
We do have.

128
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,680
Uh, tapes and tapes galore stacked up.

129
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,880
A wonderful new album from, uh, the Rudy Schwartz project is here.

130
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,440
Uh, Joe Newman's new album on Sealand Records, so you can actually get it in the United States.

131
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:15,100
We've got, uh, well, there was a lot of PR since the last show.

132
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:24,680
Um, the Fox network actually deigned to lower themselves to allow the church of the subgenius on network TV.

133
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,480
It was on the John.

134
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,340
Stewart show.

135
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,340
And, um, we'll just play some little clips from that.

136
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,360
So it's not to, you know, infringe anybody's copyright or anything.

137
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:40,500
Because it's sort of, uh, you know, trying to explain the church of the subgenius in ten minutes.

138
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,080
Well, five minutes.

139
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,060
Four and a half minutes.

140
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,180
It's tricky.

141
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,340
And, uh, also, uh, did an interview with, uh, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy at K-Rock there in New York.

142
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,740
He was, uh, trying to pretend he didn't already know everything about the church of the subgenius.

143
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:02,720
But, but more than that, friends, why, there's, there's, uh, there's records, actual records here from subgenius members.

144
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,620
There's some tapes I haven't even begun to listen to.

145
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,280
And we've got lots of the old sad stuff.

146
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,140
Yes, we could, we're gonna kind of do a combination old-timer show and, uh, new introduction to the church.

147
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,520
Uh, Fudge McGurger, you know.

148
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,300
Because it is a satanic cosmos, friends.

149
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,700
It's small, it's inexpensive, but it reaches millions.

150
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,760
And it's growing in better condition.

151
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,600
And it's getting closets everywhere.

152
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:41,140
Incidentally, we recently, uh, learned last night that the Hour of Slack is going to be one of the first radio shows in history to be, uh, broadcast worldwide over the internet.

153
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,800
And that is actually, uh, technically feasible.

154
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,300
I was kind of surprised myself.

155
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:53,340
But if you have the right equipment, you, uh, would be able to, uh, pick up the Hour of Slack being broadcast from the Sun site.

156
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,080
Uh, uh.

157
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,800
In, uh, North Carolina.

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,020
Praise Sun site.

159
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,320
What, what this means, although, you know, most of you don't, I mean, if you're hearing this on the radio, it's a moot point.

160
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:17,500
But what this means is that, uh, the, we can say that we're, that there's no place in the world where you can't technically receive the Hour of Slack.

161
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,560
They can't get Rush Limbaugh in Moscow.

162
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,720
Well, maybe they can by shortwave.

163
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,580
But can they get it in Beijing?

164
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,760
You, people can get it in Beijing.

165
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:34,180
People will literally be able to listen to this show and a few others, um, in any corner of the world they would want to go to.

166
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:43,860
And that little piece of music back there was Stevie Ray Vaughan, of all people, with a, a, a song that I had to play just because of the title of it.

167
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,440
Stang's Swang.

168
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,540
Yeah, I like that.

169
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,860
Uh, the, the swangin' meat Jesus, huh?

170
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,760
And it is like no other Jesus you've ever seen before.

171
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,220
But let's put on this, uh, Arnold Mathis here in the background.

172
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,700
That's a little bit more, uh, spaced out and full.

173
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,920
Um, this Arnold Mathis is, uh, Galaxy A-Go-Go.

174
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,160
It's, it's spacey.

175
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,040
Okay, um, well, we, we shall continue.

176
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:23,460
Well, let's, let's just go, let's forget about Bob just for a few minutes and go directly to, uh, uh, the Rudy Schwartz project.

177
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,420
Yes.

178
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,000
Uh.

179
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,080
And, uh, we have a new album, um, called, now get this, Gunther Packs a Stiffy.

180
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:39,180
That's the title of the new Rudy Schwartz project, Joe Newman album on Sealand.

181
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,760
And, uh,

182
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:41,820
.

183
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,520
.

184
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,380
.

185
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:44,940
.

186
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,220
.

187
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,320
.

188
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:01,400
.

189
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,520
.

190
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,860
I'm the guy who's trying to tell a lie that would exist

191
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,800
I eat all the schmuppin' since then

192
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,360
Slowly slid it in both my wrists

193
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,260
Metaphorically speaking, that is

194
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,020
Would you F.I.B. to the FBI

195
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,560
Which told you them a dirty lie

196
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,940
Everything doesn't turn out alright

197
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,920
My, my, my, my, my

198
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,620
Would you F.I.B. to the FBI

199
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,200
Which told you them a dirty lie

200
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,600
Now make me have some apple pie

201
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,580
My, my, my, my, my

202
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,780
Play it now

203
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,460
Play it now

204
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,620
Play it now, my baby

205
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,980
Oh, ooh, oh, ooh

206
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,680
¶¶

207
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,720
¶¶

208
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,000
¶¶

209
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,540
Yes, dear friends, that Rudy Schwartz project,

210
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,360
our good friend Joe Newman,

211
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,800
and I'm going to give you a number

212
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,660
to write down.

213
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,200
Write to and to call.

214
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,080
This is also Rudy Schwartz project

215
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,920
in the background.

216
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,700
In fact, it is the dance theme

217
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,780
from the incredibly strange creatures

218
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,660
who stopped living and became mixed up zombies.

219
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,720
Classic feature film.

220
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,300
Rudy Schwartz project is finally available

221
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,640
at Post Office Box 4542

222
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,280
in Austin, Texas,

223
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,660
780,

224
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,900
765.

225
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,340
That's Box 4542,

226
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,840
Austin, Texas,

227
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,320
78765.

228
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,960
Telephone 512-371-0986.

229
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,780
And that's distributed by Sealand Records,

230
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,780
which is basically negative land.

231
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,340
So you just take,

232
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,400
you can also take your negative land information

233
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,380
and order the Rudy Schwartz project album

234
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:05,660
through Sealand Records.

235
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,240
And yes.

236
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,260
And because, you know, friends,

237
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,040
just as you are spurred by your differentness

238
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,660
and mysterious unnameable foresees,

239
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,840
these words on this show must be here.

240
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,180
They must be broadcast here to lead you,

241
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,660
you, specifically you, to enlightenment.

242
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,540
Not unlike a pig to slaughter.

243
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,140
But my friend, you,

244
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:42,280
You are about to learn secrets once revealed only to faithful students of vast quantities of rigorous cosmic lore.

245
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:48,820
But this time, without the boring recitations, priestly mumbo-jumbo, and hocus-pocus.

246
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:56,500
Because you, yes you, are about to enter the Akashic Records and play them at 78 RPM.

247
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,020
This is addressed to people who have the intention to work.

248
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,520
And clearly if it is addressed to those people, it is intended to be accepted and acted upon.

249
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,980
And this is emphasized by the final passage.

250
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,180
It is intended to be taken as a way of life.

251
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,300
We ourselves wish to work.

252
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,600
We must ask ourselves whether this document represents for us a way of life.

253
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,720
A way of life.

254
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,820
You know, Bob called sex the divine battle.

255
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:48,420
But is there an unbridgeable, undestroyable barrier between men and women that will keep them forever warring against each other?

256
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,480
Sure there is.

257
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,580
And if you don't believe it, you'll see it.

258
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,180
It's just been a heck of a war so far here.

259
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,700
We're trying to march all the slack squads back to their barracks now.

260
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,480
And they're a little bit hard to deactivate.

261
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,720
They get belligerent late at night.

262
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,660
But they seem to be able to make it.

263
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,380
We're going back to the barracks here.

264
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,560
Look, they've started now.

265
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,380
This is what we call the monster beach party.

266
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,420
Hey, well, so welcome to the subgenius beach party.

267
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,220
Yes, last week it was in Houston on KPFA.

268
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,520
You'll never know where the subgenius beach party is.

269
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,940
And don't you wish you did.

270
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,940
Oh, dear, that ding.

271
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,300
Felt great.

272
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:26,880
Well, Dr. Howell, is there any way you can fight through the sound effects and tell us about the relationship between the demopods and the ussopods?

273
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,480
Well, the demopods and the myriapods got together at the end.

274
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,220
No, demopods and ussopods.

275
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh, the demopods.

276
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:31,940
It says right here on the script.

277
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,520
We're supposed to...

278
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,280
I didn't understand that.

279
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,220
I thought you meant...

280
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:35,660
You meant this.

281
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,360
This script right here.

282
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,020
The one with the red lines on the cover.

283
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,880
Listen, never read anything with red dots.

284
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,460
I never believe anything with red dots.

285
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,280
It says read addresses that people don't like on the show.

286
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,060
God, they're coming in from all sides.

287
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,980
Too many buttons to push.

288
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,080
Too many tape recorders to watch.

289
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,220
This is the golden age of offensive comedy.

290
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,220
I'm your host, Philip Crawley.

291
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:01,160
And I'll be taking you down the alleyways which turn off the back streets of the old town of radio yesteryear.

292
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,500
We'll be listening to objectionable humor involving senseless violence.

293
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,020
Godless filth.

294
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,620
Deviant sexual behavior such as fisting and felching.

295
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,060
But let's start with racial slurs.

296
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,780
I am a subgenius.

297
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,580
And by that virtue, I am in touch with forces greater than men.

298
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,080
I dare you to kill me.

299
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,080
I am not a duper conspiracy.

300
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,620
I know more than they do.

301
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,120
I am a subgenius.

302
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,060
That's all I need to be.

303
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,140
I'm one of the good guys.

304
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,960
I shall prevail.

305
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,580
Let out the crazy man inside you.

306
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,580
He knows what's what.

307
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,140
Smile when you call me a fanatic.

308
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,960
Me primate.

309
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,880
Me overman.

310
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,140
I shall do the piece.

311
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,260
Give me your money.

312
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,080
You won't need it.

313
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,740
The future offers you nothing but destruction.

314
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,900
What do they believe in?

315
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:41,940
Everything.

316
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,400
Who do they believe in?

317
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,720
A mysterious character named Bob.

318
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,440
Bob never said there was anything wrong with repenting on your deathbed, just in case.

319
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,960
In fact, we sort of recommend, just in case, the rival cults are right.

320
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,460
You know, if you see that Mack truck coming at you head on, go,

321
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,000
Oh, I believe in you now, Jesus.

322
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,160
Okay, I'm forgiven.

323
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:04,840
Whoa.

324
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,820
Whoa, that was a close one.

325
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,040
Now, this, now, I saw you.

326
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,420
All you have to do is pay lip service.

327
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,820
I mean, that's been made obvious over the centuries.

328
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:19,980
I saw you on the Jon Stewart show just recently, and I noticed, well, God, I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on there,

329
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,540
but what you were managing to do in five minutes there was pretty interesting.

330
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,000
Praise God!

331
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,440
All right, sir, what do you got on your hand there?

332
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,580
Is that a special religious thing, or were you at a club last night?

333
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,480
We all have to do that.

334
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,020
Oh, do we?

335
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,160
We have other ones in other places, but you don't want to know.

336
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,620
No, I don't, sir, I don't.

337
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,860
Tell me about this.

338
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,780
We're all very excited.

339
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,400
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

340
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,140
Who is Bob?

341
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,660
Well, now, you're giving me ten minutes to explain the unexplainable.

342
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,400
Sir, I'm giving you four and a half.

343
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:48,940
Oh, okay.

344
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,320
J.R. Bob Dobbs, my friend.

345
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,360
Well, who is this man, Bob?

346
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,200
I asked you first.

347
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:54,720
Okay.

348
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,120
Well, I wish somebody would explain it to me to tell the truth.

349
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,380
Bob Dobbs came and comes again and again to this plane, this planet, in order to,

350
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:11,000
bring slack, yes, slack to the mutants, the misfits, and the abnormals.

351
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,440
That would be us.

352
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,580
The, the, and talk show hosts, disbelievers, and those who will believe anything.

353
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:24,480
The reason he has done this was because in the 50s, he underwent his, what we call his divine immaculation.

354
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,160
He was a mere salesman at that time.

355
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,100
I see. What was he selling?

356
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:28,880
Anything.

357
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,160
He was the man who can sell anything.

358
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,100
He's the legendary saint of sales.

359
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:33,540
I see.

360
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,640
He discovered.

361
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,460
He discovered that there was a conspiracy of normal people robbing away the slack, John.

362
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,900
The original slack with which everyone was born.

363
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,500
Even you.

364
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,480
I still live with my mom.

365
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:45,900
What do you want from me?

366
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,680
Do you have enough, do you have enough slack?

367
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,740
I have slack.

368
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,240
How do you know?

369
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,520
You know, as the Hell's Angels said, those who know don't say, and those who say don't know.

370
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,200
Then I don't know.

371
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,000
And I shouldn't even be talking about it.

372
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,620
No, you shouldn't.

373
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,760
Is the world gonna end?

374
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,820
That's what I'm asking you.

375
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,480
Is, do you have a prophecy of doom here for us?

376
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,820
The world will end for those who deserve it.

377
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:16,360
For those who have the discernment to purchase their, to prove their faith in Bob, shall we say, by purchasing their $30 membership ministership.

378
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,080
So we have to send you, alright.

379
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,180
Those who, wait, wait, wait, now we're getting somewhere.

380
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:19,480
Yeah.

381
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:19,740
Alright.

382
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,320
We are.

383
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,520
So basically here's your deal.

384
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,140
For $30, you don't die at the end of the world.

385
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,060
For $30, you get two paradises.

386
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,160
One while you're alive, one after you're dead.

387
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,780
And the subgenius hell, John.

388
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,820
But for $30, we don't have to go to the subgenius hell.

389
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,360
No, you want to go to the subgenius hell.

390
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,960
Just that, it's so much fun.

391
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,920
That's what you're gonna need to prepare yourself for the ecstasy of subgenius heaven.

392
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,640
Do you need money in the subgenius hell?

393
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,940
Well, let me put it this way.

394
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,920
If, what we're peddling is eternal salvation or triple your money back.

395
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,260
And I challenge any other religion.

396
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,600
That's terrific.

397
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,120
Jim Biker, Jimmy Swagger, come on out here.

398
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,320
You get, in other words, if you end up in the normal hell.

399
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:02,880
Okay.

400
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,720
As a result of praising Bob and.

401
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:04,820
Okay.

402
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,540
And gaining slack and reading our books, our special pornological irretainments and so forth.

403
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,000
How much are those?

404
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,480
Well, those are extra.

405
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,440
Just look at the back of the book for the catalog.

406
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:14,760
Okay.

407
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:23,920
If you end up being, getting eternal damnation instead, Bob Dobbs will be there at the gate of hell with $90, triple your money back.

408
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,420
That's terrific.

409
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,360
Well, that's certainly a guarantee.

410
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,740
And the $89.95 book, hell on five cents.

411
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,340
Hey, it's better than the second hog line, my friend.

412
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,760
Hey, $33.95, that kills you.

413
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,700
Oh, the, you were talking about Jim Jones.

414
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,200
No, I wasn't.

415
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,020
I was talking about Jim Jones and, and David Koresh.

416
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,220
Yes.

417
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,180
Those guys were pikers, amateurs.

418
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:37,380
Pikers, nothing.

419
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,300
Induct me, give me a little ceremony.

420
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,260
Give me a little something to, to bring me into the Bob thing.

421
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,740
Without the, I'll give you the 30 bucks.

422
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,620
Well, I can give you a demonstration of what we do.

423
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,940
We, we hold devivals.

424
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,640
Okay.

425
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,920
We're not like these other religions where the preachers have to preach to the pew packers and the saved.

426
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,200
We're out there in bar, nightclubs, bars.

427
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:55,720
Yeah.

428
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,620
Preaching to the sinners.

429
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,720
I like that word, pew packer.

430
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,620
And, and it, and it's not because, it's not, Bob did not come to forgive anybody's sins.

431
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:01,960
Okay.

432
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,680
It's because he doesn't frankly care about your sins.

433
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,260
All right.

434
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,520
He comes to bring an excuse, which is what we really need.

435
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,420
Can, can we do it?

436
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,740
What we like to do at our devivals and so forth among, well, we do see, have healings and sickenings, depending.

437
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,540
Sickenings.

438
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,260
And, you, would you like one of those?

439
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,700
We can kind of do that at the same time.

440
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,500
No, no, thank you.

441
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,620
We have the Shang Dong.

442
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,440
I have, you know.

443
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,040
Short duration marriages so that, you know, for 24 hours anything you do is sanctified.

444
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,740
Oh, that's very nice.

445
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,940
But there is a beautiful thing.

446
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,760
Beautiful, really a beautiful ceremony.

447
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,160
Okay.

448
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,020
Which I can just show you with this handy chopping block.

449
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,340
Okay, great.

450
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,200
That happens to be here.

451
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:38,540
Great.

452
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,260
This was invented by Reverend Buck Naked in Dallas.

453
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:42,660
Okay.

454
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:52,300
And it's meant to demonstrate the difference between the conspiracies doctrine of time control, time control.

455
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:52,700
Yeah.

456
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,940
Time control.

457
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,140
Okay.

458
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,640
And the subgenius doctrine of time control.

459
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,060
Okay.

460
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,300
Okay.

461
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,480
A guy named Buck Naked came up with this.

462
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,680
Now, but I need your help.

463
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,560
You need my help?

464
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,720
I'm with you.

465
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:02,800
I'm with you.

466
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:02,880
I'm with you.

467
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,560
Not the other Buck Naked.

468
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:03,800
Okay.

469
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,220
Do you have a watch or something on you?

470
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,220
I haven't had one in my pocket.

471
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,280
In your pocket?

472
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:08,640
Yeah.

473
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,640
I don't wear one.

474
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,620
I don't think.

475
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,200
There you go.

476
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,800
What do you think?

477
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,140
This is nice.

478
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:12,860
My grandpappy should.

479
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,260
Well, it's good that you don't have it, you know, on your wrist all the time because what

480
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,100
this really is, friends, is a hand.

481
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,620
This is a set of handcuffs.

482
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,200
Okay.

483
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,860
This is the conspiracy controls your time by handcuffing you to one of these things.

484
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,100
Here is the subgenius form of time control.

485
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:29,740
Whoa.

486
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,020
I almost hit the mic.

487
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,340
Yeah.

488
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,480
And it's still ticking.

489
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,920
It's a miracle, dear friends.

490
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,420
Sorry about the watch, but you're free now, man.

491
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,480
By the way, you'll notice that I wear a watch, but as Bob Dobbs said, I don't practice what

492
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,140
I preach because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to.

493
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,820
The Reverend Ivan Stein is going to stick around a while while I fleece him for another

494
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,160
watch.

495
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,780
We'll be right back after this.

496
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,640
Let's love this.

497
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,000
You can have this, too.

498
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,920
Thank you, Bob.

499
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,120
Thank you, Bob.

500
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,460
Thank you, Bob.

501
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:57,740
Thank you, Bob.

502
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,660
Thank you, Bob.

503
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,060
Thank you, Bob.

504
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,020
Thank you, Bob.

505
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:05,940
John Stewart was the subgenius form of time control whereby we simply take a big

506
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,400
sledgehammer and smash the watch to pieces.

507
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,060
I wanted to do it while he had the watch on, but he chickened out.

508
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,680
I mean, he didn't have enough faith in Bob and I don't blame him.

509
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:21,140
In fact, Bob probably smiles upon those who have the least faith in him.

510
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:21,720
Yeah.

511
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,860
You actually encourage hate.

512
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,980
Bob encourages his followers to hate him as well as to hate Bob.

513
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,540
Well.

514
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,420
We're just the only ones that come out up front.

515
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,620
You know, we come right out with the hate doctrine.

516
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:44,300
With most of the rival religions, it's not that they, it's not really that they love God all that much.

517
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,120
It's that they love the idea of the rest of us going to hell.

518
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:56,300
And they talk love this and love that, and their whole thing is based on hate and everybody's not packing the pews along with them.

519
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,540
We're just, we're just going to bypass all of that and go ahead and hate everybody.

520
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,280
You know, let's get down to the point of having a religion.

521
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,560
Hate them.

522
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:13,500
That's who we've, you know, Bob has ordered us to hate not only them, and that means everybody but us.

523
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,580
And also, in fact, for most subgeniuses, it includes most of us.

524
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,080
Hey, yes it does.

525
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,300
And that's a good place to break in with a little disclaimer.

526
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,200
You notice.

527
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:35,220
Just on that Jon Stewart show, I credited the former subgenius pastor, Buck Naked of Dallas, for the watch smashing concept.

528
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,340
And when I got back to town, there was a call from Buck saying,

529
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,040
please don't ever, ever associate me with the church of the subgenius anymore.

530
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,940
He said, you know, you can go ahead and use my old ideas, my old songs, but I hate the church now.

531
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And I'm in a new cult, and I've sent out a letter.

532
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,820
I'm in a new cult, and I've sent out a letter about what an evil man you are.

533
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:08,600
Even though I still like you, Reverend Stagg, since you're such a coward and a jerk and bad guy and so forth.

534
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,140
And since you've sold out so much, Buck just doesn't want to.

535
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:19,880
So, okay, from now on, don't even think about Buck Naked as being a subgenius.

536
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,380
He was a great subgenius when he was a subgenius.

537
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:23,680
Yes.

538
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,340
Yes.

539
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:25,780
Yes.

540
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:25,980
Yes.

541
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:25,980


542
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:25,980


543
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:25,980


544
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:25,980


545
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:25,980


546
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:25,980


547
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:25,980


548
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:25,980


549
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,640
That's where all the different types of subgeniuses go.

550
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:35,660
And it's a shame that he feels that way, friends, but the less said, the better.

551
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:45,760
You know, the problem with most people is they're mired in this silly, pathetic kind of hate.

552
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,380
This, oh, I hate my job.

553
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,400
Oh, I hate the president.

554
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,380
Or, oh, I hate the president's critics.

555
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,800
I hate my hair today.

556
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,720
I hate myself.

557
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,660
Friends, I mean, that's it.

558
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,380
That's just a sorry, sickening kind of hate.

559
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,140
If you're going to hate, hate fully.

560
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,140
Hate with gusto, with relish.

561
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,020
Get some slack out of your hate.

562
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,960
We advise people on, you know, drive down, drive through the neighborhoods of those you hate the most.

563
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,140
Feed your hate.

564
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,360
Pump it up.

565
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,860
You know, just get it big.

566
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,300
Get on a big hate.

567
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,240
A big hate on.

568
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,840
And you'll find.

569
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,860
You'll find that you gain quite a bit of slack out of that.

570
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,820
And you'll, for the end, will in fact be a lot less likely to want to punch out the next person that irritates you.

571
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:39,860
Instead, you will have the slack to sit back and wield your hate in a more effective way.

572
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,540
A more sneaky way.

573
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,180
A way you can get away with.

574
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,440
A way you won't be caught.

575
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,880
Made me do things.

576
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,040
Terrible things.

577
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,540
It forced me.

578
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,960
It forced me to do strange things in front of the head.

579
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:55,980


580
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I was humiliated.

581
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,460
Negi relied on mental torture to break me down.

582
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,700
I didn't want to do it.

583
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,540
I did not want to kill her.

584
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,660
It was Negi.

585
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,980
I did not want to kill her.

586
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,960
It was Negi.

587
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,620
And he had the photograph.

588
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,840
And it was Negi.

589
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,940
He said he wanted lives.

590
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,780
He wanted others.

591
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,760
Others that they could use.

592
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,660
Like they used me.

593
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,440
Bob is the gun and you are the bullet.

594
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,840
The showdown is fast approaching.

595
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,360
The church is still unknown, but its infectious doctrines spread across continents.

596
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:51,060
Church headquarters, the first Megafis temple lodge, is housed in this Dallas skyscraper, from which Dob's secret mandates are issued to his agents in the dreaded Brotherhood of Bob.

597
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,880
But this mighty edifice represents but the tip of a wandering rogue.

598
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:08,640
The words, hymns, and sound effects of Dob's are disseminated on a weekly basis to thousands of devout radio listeners in most major cities, even as far away as China and darkest Africa.

599
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,200
This show is so popular that we're studying it from all angles.

600
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,240
You can even watch this show on Channel X.

601
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,640
As Hal plays the microphone and flies backwards around the other side of the planet.

602
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,120
The subgeniuses in China have to listen on shortwave radios.

603
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,700
Very hard.

604
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:30,500
You'll notice we've switched to spewage music for the background for this segment of the show.

605
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:36,780
As the psychic surgery is performed, Dob's sweaty brow is wiped by a small nuclear explosion.

606
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,940
Oof. All better now.

607
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:40,840


608
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,080
The show is now on.

609
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,620
The show is now on.

610
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,120
The show is now on.

611
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,200
Hello.

612
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,100
You're improving, Jack.

613
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,680
You just can't seem to get over it.

614
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,120
You're not getting rid of that streak of honesty in you.

615
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:02,260
He gave you a vision of moral order in the universe, and there isn't any.

616
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:11,080
Those stars twinkle in a void, dear boy, and the two-legged creature schemes and dreams beneath them all in vain.

617
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,900
All in vain, Jack.

618
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,360
Did you hear anything?

619
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,460
Listen to me.

620
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,520
Two-legged creature won't believe anything.

621
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,000
And the more preposterous, the better.

622
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,860
Whales speak French at the bottom of the sea.

623
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,600
The horses of Arabia have silver wings.

624
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,840
Pygmies mate with elephants in darkest Africa.

625
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,620
I have sold all those propositions.

626
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,720
And they were all fools, and none of it matters.

627
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,260
Ah.

628
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,400
Ah.

629
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:55,460


630
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:56,660


631
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,320
Ah.

632
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,160
Ah.

633
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,400
Ah.

634
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,800
Ah.

635
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:07,820
Ah.

636
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,020
Ah.

637
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,300
Ah.

638
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,640
Ah.

639
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:09,860


640
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,680
Ah.

641
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,080
Ah.

642
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,460
Ah.

643
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:18,460


644
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:18,460


645
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:18,520
Ah.

646
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:18,520


647
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:18,520


648
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:18,520


649
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,700
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

650
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,420
What sins do you have to confess, my son?

651
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:23,980
I have sinned.

652
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:23,980


653
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,100
Well, Father, I, uh...

654
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,760
You can say it.

655
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,760
God will forgive.

656
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,080
I don't know.

657
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,920
It's pretty bad, Father.

658
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,200
I, uh, I don't know.

659
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,400
Remorse is the first step to absolution, son.

660
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,960
But this is really, really bad.

661
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,560
I've heard worse, my son.

662
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,100
I assure you, I used to work near the daycare center.

663
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:49,480
But, no, I, this is just, just about the absolute worst thing you're ever gonna hear.

664
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,820
Well, then, all the better you confess it.

665
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:00,020
Well, it's, it's that, uh, I, I love Jesus.

666
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,640
You love Jesus?

667
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,180
Yeah.

668
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,720
Well, that's no sin, my son.

669
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,340
In fact, it...

670
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,160
No, no, Father, you, you don't understand.

671
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,260
I love Jesus.

672
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,000
You love Jesus?

673
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:17,540
Yeah.

674
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,820
Did you ever take a good look at him?

675
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:20,880
Well, I...

676
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,800
I mean, he is one good-looking man.

677
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,940
I mean, if you ever get a, get a look at one of those full-bodied renderings...

678
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,020
Yeah.

679
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,360
...like on your stained glass window over there, check out the ass on that guy.

680
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,380
Bah, bah, bah, boom!

681
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,860
I mean, that is one heck of a nice tush.

682
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,140
Uh, uh...

683
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,320
Jesus is the full serving of what I like.

684
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:37,580
Hey.

685
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,700
He could sure turn my water into wine.

686
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,240
Ooh, ho!

687
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,280
I'd like to jump his resurrected bones.

688
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,480
Wouldn't mind taking a peek under that roll-bares.

689
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,460
Peek-a-boo!

690
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,160
Who's in there?

691
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,140
Holy hunk!

692
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,860
Heh, heh, heh!

693
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,840
I think I died and gone to hunk heaven.

694
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,280
Oh.

695
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,980
He could be my salvation, I'll tell you.

696
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,880
Whoa, ho, ho!

697
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,220
Save me, Jesus!

698
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:54,900
Save me!

699
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,860
Use your big, strong arms and save me!

700
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,120
Son.

701
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,760
Hold me tight!

702
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,080
Son.

703
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,200
Then I'll get on my knees and pray!

704
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,240
Stop, stop, stop!

705
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,500
Please, please stop!

706
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,480
You're right.

707
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,920
I don't know if I can forgive you.

708
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,440
You're sick.

709
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,060
Oh, it, it gets worse, Father.

710
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,340
No, don't, don't tell me.

711
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,220
I want to do it!

712
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,280
Why, son!

713
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,040
My son, the, the Catholic Church does not condone such behavior.

714
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,260
I'm sorry, Father.

715
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:21,960
I'm sorry, Father.

716
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:21,960


717
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:21,960


718
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:21,960


719
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:21,960


720
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:21,960


721
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:21,960


722
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,820
I am a JP2 and I am here to be saying that you should not have the sexual intercourse.

723
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,720
For God has said in his master plan that it is a sin to lay with another unless you have

724
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,260
been married.

725
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,140
I am the Pope.

726
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,020
You must be married or you cannot have sexual intercourse.

727
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,560
Please, not to be having the sexual intercourse.

728
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:50,560
If you should want to go and do the nasty with the dope fly hole, don't be hasty.

729
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,340
Wait until the wedlock and you won't regret it.

730
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,300
And if you don't wait, you will burn in the eternal fires of hell.

731
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,020
You will be dying in hell and you will suffer.

732
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,980
And your skin will boil and you will be suffering and blistering and burning.

733
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,720
Well, baby might have the butt, she might have the cute butt, but the earthly reward

734
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,080
will put you in a rut because God has a plan.

735
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,000
If you spoil it, you will be burning and boiling in the hot oil.

736
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,540
You will be burning and boiling in the hot oil.

737
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,920
You will boil on judgement day.

738
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,840
I am the pope.

739
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,660
I am the Pope.

740
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,100
You should listen for the nuns.

741
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,480
You must listen to the pontiff and you cannot be going wrong.

742
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,420
I'm part of God's posse and I have the long hat.

743
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,520
If the prince of darkness should be leading your astray, waste him with your rubbish and

744
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:43,940
drive away.

745
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,980
Wait a minute, no, stop the music.

746
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,600
Wait a minute, stop the music.

747
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:49,980
I have to go back.

748
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,200
It's my own loss so I am going back.

749
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,200


750
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,200


751
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,200


752
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,200


753
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,200


754
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,200


755
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,200


756
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,200


757
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,200


758
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,420
You should listen for the nuns.

759
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,320
Stop the music. I cannot say these things.

760
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,920
Is there a problem, Your Holiness?

761
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,320
I am sorry, but I cannot say this.

762
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,160
The Catholic Church does not advocate the murdering of any kind.

763
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,440
Look, Your Holiness, if you want to reach the kids, you know, you've got to spice it up like we talked about.

764
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,060
I will not glorify murder even of the devil.

765
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,240
All right. Change the line if you want. You know, just, you know, make it hip.

766
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,400
I know what to say. I know what to say.

767
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,260
Listen to the pontiff and you cannot be going wrong.

768
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,740
I am part of the God's posse and my heart is long.

769
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,600
If the prince of darkness should lead you astray, you tell him,

770
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,140
Hey, you jive turkey man, you shut up, you.

771
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,720
I will not listen to you, you demon man, you.

772
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,760
You are a prince satan.

773
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,740
Get behind me.

774
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,280
And listen to the nuns.

775
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,680
The nuns know what they are saying.

776
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,540
The nuns have abstained from the sexual intercourse that is so sinful.

777
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,560
Tell the devil to go away.

778
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,720
Read the Bible every day.

779
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,120
I swear there's nothing on the radio but...

780
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,360
Nothing on but this, friends.

781
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,380
And, uh...

782
00:34:54,380 --> 00:35:00,840
Oh, but we've got a wonderful little piece of propaganda here in the email

783
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,300
that I thought I should share with you

784
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,700
to the tune of Doctors for Bob in the background.

785
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,560
Let's see, I've got this from...

786
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,840
This was sent to us by Andy Jacobson

787
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,960
from Dr. Memory, Nuclear UCLA.

788
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,580
dot edu.

789
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,900
And it came to him through various different...

790
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,780
The cyber salon transmission.

791
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,580
The title of it is

792
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,160
Very Scary Politics.

793
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,920
Forwarded message.

794
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,560
Quoting Rex Bennett.

795
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,640
To all.

796
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,320
According to Ralph Reed,

797
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,940
director of the Christian Coalition,

798
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,060
the religious right is going to use...

799
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,680
Bob Dole and the new wave of right-wing victories

800
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,820
in a major attempt to seize power

801
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,940
for the Christian Coalition and other Christian groups.

802
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,300
He is asking members of his 1.5 million group

803
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,000
to ease off abortion issues for a while

804
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,140
and direct all their energies to achieving

805
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,820
a major stranglehold on government

806
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,960
through right-wing legislation.

807
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,360
Their strategy is to replace government

808
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,360
with organized religion, wherever.

809
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,820
One major objective is to weaken

810
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,500
non-right-wing media availability

811
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,960
by undermining the public broadcasting networks

812
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,660
while funneling government taxes into religious coffers,

813
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,120
thereby increasing the propaganda and control potential

814
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,840
for the religious right.

815
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,580
Reed says that Gingrich's 10-point contract with America

816
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,340
is the perfect plan for achieving this

817
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,220
and that he intends to rally the full strength

818
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,340
of his organization and its members,

819
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,240
to pressure congressmen to pass the legislation required.

820
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:56,340
Public broadcasting does not promote Christian values

821
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,940
and is too humanistic in nature, according to Reed.

822
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,820
The wide availability of science programming

823
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,740
also weakens religious faith.

824
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,340
The presentation by public broadcasting

825
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,320
of social and cultural information

826
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,800
on those not in the religious mainstream

827
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,980
confuses the public and leads them away from the church,

828
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,880
and to the Christian values.

829
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,440
Reed says that he wants religious programming

830
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,640
to place its own imprint on the public knowledge base

831
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,100
and that the recent Republican victories

832
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,800
have given him, quote,

833
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,200
faith that they can attain what they have always sought,

834
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,400
a sense of legitimacy and a voice in the conversation

835
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,240
that we call democracy.

836
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,420
Besides the elimination of public broadcasting,

837
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,620
Reed stated that it is crucial to gain control

838
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,340
of education and school systems

839
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,880
by using tax dollars to underwrite their efforts.

840
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,880
He wants to abolish the education department

841
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,040
and give states grants for scholarships or vouchers

842
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,380
for public or private schools,

843
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,260
including religious institutions.

844
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,240
In other words, not only do they not have to pay taxes,

845
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,500
but they get to collect them.

846
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,080
He indicates this is where their real efforts will pay off

847
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,060
and will cause a massive influx of capital

848
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,880
into the Christian network.

849
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,520
Every effort will be made to replace inefficient public schools

850
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,180
with more effective private ones,

851
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,560
and that means primarily religious organizations,

852
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,220
since they already have the structure and the power to do so.

853
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,660
Profitability will allow Christian Network

854
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,600
to enlarge and expand religious programming

855
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,780
on television and radio, as well as in the print media.

856
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,680
He also, of course, wants to reinstate public prayer

857
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,960
in all public schools.

858
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,380
Reed says that it is crucial that they abolish funding

859
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,000
for the Legal Services Corporation,

860
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,240
since they represent an alternative power base

861
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,960
for the poor, besides religion.

862
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,420
Reed said that the proper place for the poor

863
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,620
to seek help is in the church.

864
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,560
He also said that the Legal Services Corporation

865
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,220
has helped poor people with over 200,000 divorces annually.

866
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,440
He wants divorce to be far more difficult to attain

867
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,680
and would like to see it made expensive.

868
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,740
Reed says that we must dismantle the federal welfare system

869
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:22,740
and shift responsibility for the poor back to the church.

870
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,520
And we know how kind-hearted those churches are, friends.

871
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,520
Public welfare has made poor people too independent

872
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,880
of organized religion, and he says this is not healthy.

873
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:37,180
He says the poor should be dependent on God

874
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,700
and not the state.

875
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,500
Of course, God would be represented

876
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,540
by the right-wing Christian coalition,

877
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,140
of course.

878
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,200
Reed claims that Newt Gingrich's contract with America

879
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,520
is a godsend that will take power away from the state

880
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,420
and give it back to the church where it belongs.

881
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,900
This is the opportunity that they've been waiting for,

882
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,600
and he indicates that his membership must bring all the power

883
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,360
and influence that they can to force passage

884
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,700
of the Republican contract.

885
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,560
He says that his organization plans to pressure

886
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,180
every congressman and senator,

887
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,660
and that they will launch a massive public vote

888
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,680
in favor of passage.

889
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,800
We want to pull in everyone that we can.

890
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,200
And, uh, well, friends,

891
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,160
I guess, uh, they...

892
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,960
I mean, it's not like it's anything new.

893
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,820
It's just that it's funny how they get a little...

894
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,520
You know, despite all their bitching and griping

895
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,360
about the liberal bias media,

896
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,620
it seems like all you hear is these guys.

897
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,980
Of course, you're listening to Church of the Subgenius right now.

898
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,600
Notice how hard it is to get the signal in.

899
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,160
Notice how you can only hear it in a few cities.

900
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,880
Well, we're gonna change that.

901
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,120
We're gonna do the same things

902
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,340
that any of those other religions do, friends.

903
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,820
Uh, only we're gonna succeed!

904
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,520
And because it's funnier.

905
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,060
And some of the funny stuff that I played a little earlier,

906
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:03,320
the, uh, that piece there called, uh,

907
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,320
Holy Hunk, the I Love Jesus routine,

908
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,880
and, uh, Pope John Paul doing don't have sex,

909
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:11,960
and, uh, the Pope John Paul doing don't have sex,

910
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,980
is from a CD called Not For Broadcast.

911
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,700
Uh, a tasteless sketch comedy featuring the radio pirates.

912
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,840
And I don't see an address on here.

913
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,260
It says that it's not for broadcast,

914
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,180
and some of it...

915
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,440
I did have to cut a little bit of, uh,

916
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,000
iffy material out there,

917
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,520
but it looks like it's going to do us lots of good

918
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,160
in the coming, uh, end times.

919
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,580
This was sent to us, by the way,

920
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,980
by the lovely Reverend Velveteen,

921
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:46,140
at our lovely sister station in Madison, Wisconsin.

922
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,760
And, uh...

923
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,060
Hey...

924
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,260
Oh, DK Jones is in the background.

925
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,300
Let's just listen to this for a second.

926
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,500
And then let's get back to some more of this radio comedy.

927
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,940
Let's see what it sounds like.

928
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,320
What do you want to do?

929
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:10,960
I don't know.

930
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,640
You want to listen to some devil music?

931
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,260
Devil music's cool.

932
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,200
Maybe later we can go out and throw stuff at cars?

933
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,080
Yeah.

934
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,820
After we throw stuff at cars, we can pee off the overpass?

935
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,620
We better drink some beers.

936
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,640
Then we can kill Mom and Dad?

937
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,740
Yeah, kill Mom and Dad.

938
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,520
Then we can drink some acid?

939
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,960
Yeah, all right.

940
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,820
Then die and take over Hell

941
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,180
and create a huge army of zombie meat people

942
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,060
and send them up to the world of the living to enslave everybody.

943
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,940
And then, when all of you make it,

944
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,980
humanity is reduced to a slobbering, subservient mob.

945
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,740
We'll come back and rule!

946
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,440
If we accomplish this,

947
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,800
I shall no longer go by the name of Steve.

948
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,720
Take the hoses around to the south!

949
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,680
Fire team!

950
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,140
Oh, Inspector, I'm glad you're here.

951
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,060
I see your men have the fire under control.

952
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,840
It completely destroyed the secret laboratory?

953
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:07,460
Yes, sir.

954
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,880
But I'm afraid your work's just begun.

955
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,560
The plans for the Atomic Fusion Laser Defense System

956
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,780
for America's eastern seaboard?

957
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,260
Missing.

958
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:14,520
Oh!

959
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,200
And whoever stole them knew his stuff.

960
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,800
Why, the only way to get into this facility was through the keyhole.

961
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,720
The keyhole?

962
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,220
Only one being could have crawled through that keyhole,

963
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,180
stolen the plans, and ignited the entire science compound.

964
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,000
Damn. So he's back, eh?

965
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,300
I curse you.

966
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,720
I curse you, oh, first trimester fetus!

967
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,580
First trimester fetus.

968
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,160
Criminal mastermind!

969
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,120
Sarge, he's back.

970
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,780
First trimester fetus?

971
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,100
Check.

972
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:53,740
Damn. You know, Inspector, it wasn't long ago that he and his kind had no rights at all.

973
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,020
But now...

974
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,760
But now, yes.

975
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,340
We realize that the unborn are not only people such as you and I,

976
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,920
but they are capable of love, joy...

977
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,680
And envy, greed, lust.

978
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,600
He's not just protoplasm, he's a person.

979
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,900
And he's...

980
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:08,980
evil.

981
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,480
First the armored car robbery,

982
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,280
then the worldwide distribution of counterfeit Fabergé eggs.

983
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,760
His heart may not develop for another trimester,

984
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,060
but when it does, it will be black as night!

985
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,920
If only we could get fingerprints, sir.

986
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,160
If only he had fingers.

987
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,720
Slimy gob of cells.

988
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,440
Sarge, that slimy gob of cells has got the laser defense plans.

989
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,020
No!

990
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,740
I'd give anything to know where that satanic blob of tissue is right this minute.

991
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,260
You were brilliant.

992
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,560
Brilliant, first trimester fetus.

993
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,800
Thank you, Lola.

994
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,020
I guess they'll take me more seriously now.

995
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,040
Kiss me.

996
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,000
Not now.

997
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:46,560
But...

998
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,120
Later, when I've grown lips.

999
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,680
But I'm tired of waiting.

1000
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,760
Lola, darling, I'm growing as fast as I can.

1001
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,880
Why, by next week, I'll be three or four hundred undifferentiated cells.

1002
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,660
And then we can be married.

1003
00:44:58,940 --> 00:44:59,540
Why, uh...

1004
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,600
Sure, baby.

1005
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,660
Say, light a cigarette for me and hold it over my beaker.

1006
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:04,540
Here.

1007
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:05,540
Uh...

1008
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,100
Ah, we'll never find his secret lair.

1009
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,580
Wait, there's an abortion clinic.

1010
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,760
They might know something.

1011
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,300
Get out of our way!

1012
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,340
This is a police emergency!

1013
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,560
Oh, wait, Sarge.

1014
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:16,960
Sir?

1015
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,680
I just realized we have no photo of first trimester fetus for witnesses to identify.

1016
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,380
Grab one of these posters with an aborted fetus on it, will you?

1017
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,400
Let go of your sign, lady.

1018
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,040
No, God himself has called me.

1019
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:28,760
I got it.

1020
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,380
Let's go.

1021
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,760
Doctor, doctor, we're police.

1022
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,220
Yes, officer.

1023
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:33,900
We need some information.

1024
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,460
Take a good look at this poster.

1025
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,380
Have you seen a fetus matching this description?

1026
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,140
Let me take a look here.

1027
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,920
Yes, it looks, it looks, it would look so helpless.

1028
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,180
And, oh, maybe abortion is wrong.

1029
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,100
Forgive me, Jesus.

1030
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:44,960
Snap out of it, doctor!

1031
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:48,700
Try to set aside your sympathy for precious unborn lives.

1032
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,520
The fetus we're looking for is a cold-blooded killer.

1033
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,920
Why, you don't mean first trimester fetus criminal mastermind?

1034
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,220
We do.

1035
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:56,980
You've seen him?

1036
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,180
His lair is in an abandoned warehouse across town.

1037
00:45:59,400 --> 00:45:59,960
Thank you, doctor.

1038
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:00,560
Let's go.

1039
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,920
Listen up, all of you pro-life wackos.

1040
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:12,400
I have the right to choose, and I choose to find this fetus and fill him full of lead.

1041
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,480
Take cover.

1042
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,280
Stay around.

1043
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,580
What's our next move?

1044
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,060
First, we smuggle the laser plans to Bulgaria.

1045
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,380
I've made all the arrangements.

1046
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,600
There's a freighter full of jello leaving at midnight.

1047
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,340
But there will be one extra bowl of gelatin on board.

1048
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,020
Brilliant.

1049
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,440
Hold it right there, you microscopic Machiavelli.

1050
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,700
The police!

1051
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,820
Inspector, wait.

1052
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,500
Stand back.

1053
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:50,980
I've got a sperm right here, and if you make one false move, I'll strangle him.

1054
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:51,920
Why, you.

1055
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:52,680
Sarge, no.

1056
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,540
The semen.

1057
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,400
Let the sperm go, fetus.

1058
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:57,720
I'm leaving now.

1059
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,940
See you later, sucker.

1060
00:46:59,100 --> 00:46:59,440
Bye.

1061
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,040
Bye.

1062
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,020
He's gone.

1063
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,920
You'll never find him.

1064
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,920
He may be just a fetus, but he's more man than you'll ever be.

1065
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,420
At least my sex has been determined, but I'm not through.

1066
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,900
I'll get you, first trimester fetus!

1067
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:28,160
And now, some more Rudy Schwartz project from the new album Gunther Packs a Stiffy.

1068
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:40,700
There's been some really weird briefly sex-ㅠㅠ cricket.

1069
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:40,700


1070
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,020
We're catching Macon, that's why RonО właśnie этот called the Greatacao.

1071
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:42,080
The common allowed name was thusосьI, I guess.

1072
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,220
Our attempt was tooh.

1073
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:43,320
And it tirar

1074
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:43,320


1075
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:44,380
Ooh!

1076
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:44,560
Oh no!

1077
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,380
You sound like a high-level head of aiggerou.

1078
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,040
"...unторов par surprising guy."

1079
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:00,040


1080
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,980
guitar solo

1081
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:30,160
solo

1082
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:30,520

1083
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:32,920

1084
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:35,980
solo

1085
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:40,580
solo

1086
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,920
Who for them Dallas Cowboys are coming on the table?

1087
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,100
I thought it makes the cast look like they knew

1088
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,940
It's like they know

1089
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,400
Damn you, I was watching that football game.

1090
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,580
I want to watch Porn Dog Theater.

1091
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,780
You can watch that some other time.

1092
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,160
I'm watching them Dallas Cowboys.

1093
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,660
Now, there's no reason to set this up.

1094
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,800
Okay, excuse me.

1095
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,780
Come on, come on.

1096
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,260
Yes, sir.

1097
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,500
Waldo, them Cowboys are driving through the big scar.

1098
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,700
Turn it back to the football game.

1099
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:10,920
No.

1100
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:11,820
Damn it, Waldo.

1101
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,560
You got three seconds to change that channel.

1102
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,320
One, two.

1103
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,920
God damn it, Waldo.

1104
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,000
Damn it, what's up with that?

1105
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,240
Get out of the car, sir.

1106
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,940
Damn it, I'm going to learn how to play now.

1107
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,000
You remember, I'm not here to hear about me.

1108
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,240
I'm just also upset.

1109
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,660
Hey, Waldo, did you order a pizza?

1110
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,480
Yes, sir.

1111
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,040
Yes, I vow.

1112
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,080
Here this night this way.

1113
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,120
You will drink the black sperm of my vengeance.

1114
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,740
Here's Buck Owens.

1115
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,380
Who raised up brain squelchy, made it glisten with pain,

1116
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,020
and served up beer?

1117
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,500
Big stupid, so yous all take a drink.

1118
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,060
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

1119
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,040
Who spent Sunday morning praising in church,

1120
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,100
then danced from the touchdown when he's doing God's work?

1121
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:19,720
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

1122
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,600
Yip-de-tum-landry, won't you come out tonight

1123
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,940
with your Cowboys in heat and sweet Jesus inside?

1124
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:31,980
Crum-fish on pickup trucks, who could it be?

1125
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,380
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

1126
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,860
Who danced around naked with long dangling meat?

1127
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:44,220
Down at the school yard, let the girls get a pee.

1128
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:49,000
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

1129
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,200
Who says he's sorry for what he's done?

1130
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,420
For playing pre-birded and flashing his bun?

1131
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,980
He's a good ball player.

1132
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:57,920
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me. Who says he's sorry for what he's done?

1133
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,440
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

1134
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,680
Put Roger Stavok in the governor's seat.

1135
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,760
Illegal abortions and white bread to eat.

1136
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:14,020
Ask any Cretan you happen to see

1137
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:18,100
about the Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

1138
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,660
I just want to kill for God.

1139
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,000
I just want to kill for God.

1140
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,280
I just want to kill for God.

1141
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:27,900
I just want to kill for God.

1142
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,540
I just want to kill for God.

1143
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,660
I just want to kill for God.

1144
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,120
I just want to kill for God.

1145
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:40,060
Who made roly-poly, roly-poly, roly-poly?

1146
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,900
Hot dang it's spicy cheese ball.

1147
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,660
Let all them friends and neighbors come a-calling,

1148
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,920
cause anything's good if it sits on a wrist.

1149
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,160
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

1150
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,900
What kind of thing is it that's got one head like Andrew's?

1151
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,400
The other head like Bob Tilton's.

1152
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,560
And two scoops of raisins,

1153
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,080
cause that's the only way he could get it to

1154
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,980
sit up straight at the gawd darn table.

1155
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,060
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

1156
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,940
Yip-dee-tum-landry, won't you come out tonight?

1157
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:21,400
Put your hair up in curlers, pull your nipple rings tight.

1158
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,500
Stretch your urethra around a sycamore tree.

1159
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,880
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

1160
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,660
Yip-dee-tum-landry, won't you come out tonight?

1161
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,140
Put your hair up in curlers, pull your nipple rings tight.

1162
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,200
Stretch your urethra around a sycamore tree.

1163
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,400
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

1164
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,800
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

1165
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:54,440
Me, Jesus and me.

1166
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,300
I'm out driving for the touchdown score.

1167
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:57,860
I'm out driving for the touchdown score.

1168
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:57,860


1169
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:57,860


1170
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,240
I'm out driving for the touchdown score.

1171
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,840
Yes dear friends, um, a beautiful beautiful moment there

1172
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,820

1173
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,780
Where's my devices?

1174
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,600
Okay, yeah, that was, um,

1175
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,900
with Joe Newman of the Rudy Schwartz project,

1176
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:23,800
new album, Gunther packs a stiff.

1177
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,740
It's got a great picture of Waldo here,

1178
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,840
Waldo as the little girl.

1179
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:27,840


1180
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,020
guy who talks like this.

1181
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:34,760
And, uh, inmate, well, I'll give you that number again one more time, uh, for information.

1182
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,960
Joe Newman at P.O.

1183
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:44,440
Box 4542, Austin, Texas, 78765.

1184
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:53,700
Uh, yes, and I think it's time for me to do some, uh, subgenius, uh, addresses and so

1185
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,360
forth as well.

1186
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:59,780
Friends, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack here in the hideous

1187
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:06,020
Dallas, Texas, uh, where we teach them to shoot at presidents and at people who shoot

1188
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:06,740
at presidents.

1189
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,560
And you can write for free information from the Church of the Subgenius.

1190
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,460
Uh, if you throw in a stamped self-addressed envelope, that would help a lot.

1191
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,520
And, uh, you got that pencil ready?

1192
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,320
I'm sure you just about do.

1193
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,460
Just write to Bob.

1194
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,660
It's that simple.

1195
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,140
Uh, at post office.

1196
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:36,760
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1197
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:43,960
Once again, dear friends, that's Bob, or the Hour of Slack, or Subgenius Foundation, what

1198
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:50,920
have you, at a box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1199
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,280
And, uh, here's an email address for you.

1200
00:54:54,360 --> 00:55:01,380
That's i.stang at metronet.com.

1201
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:10,340
For you civilians, that means i.stang at metronet.com.

1202
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:18,500
And, uh, if you need to send us a fax, that's 214-320-1561.

1203
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,860
You know, because there really are two churches, friends.

1204
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,340
Two versions of the Church of the Subgenius.

1205
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:30,240
There's the public church for the fans, the bobbies, and the other human suckers.

1206
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:36,860
And then there's the true church, that one which has always existed, albeit by a thousand

1207
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:44,900
different names, and which is composed of those rare doctors, apostles for Bob, and

1208
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:49,680
fishers of wallets, who truly kno slack.

1209
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:54,340
Ironically, you know, most true subgeniuses...

1210
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:59,280
have never even heard of the church yet, and are still latent.

1211
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:05,700
But in the meantime, you can continue listening to this station, recognize those of true intellectual

1212
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,320
status, and surround yourself with them.

1213
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:12,480
Those who run things now are lost.

1214
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,460
They're lost, friends.

1215
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,780
But those who will control things tomorrow still have hope.

1216
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,960
And we, friends, we are those tomorrow people.

1217
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,840
Ah, yes.

1218
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:27,940
.

1219
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:27,940


1220
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,880

1221
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:33,880

1223
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:33,880


1224
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:33,880


1225
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:33,880


1226
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:33,880


1227
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:33,880


1228
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,620

1229
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,340

1230
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,080

1234

1235
00:56:59,320 --> 00:56:59,440

1236
00:56:59,440 --> 00:56:59,440


1237
00:56:59,440 --> 00:56:59,440


1238
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,120

1239

00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,820
here it is.

1243
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,480
See it didn't take long at all.

1244
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,340
In real-time, Arnold Mathis, we had DaVinci series cast.

1245
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:24,340


1246
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:51,200
This is a wonderful syntho soundtrack-y type of stuff

1247
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,100
by Good Arnold.

1248
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,480
But instead I want to play something really ugly to end up...

1249
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,660
Oh no, it's near the end of the show.

1250
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,700
I was going to play Shock the Livin' Gee out of me by Doctors for Bob.

1251
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,340
Well we'll start it.

1252
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,180
And we'll finish it next week.

1253
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:21,180


1254
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,560
I will then.

1255
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,760
But why?

1256
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,080
Why will you call me mad?

1257
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,040
Could a mad man have written songs such as these?

1258
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,080
I think not.

1259
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,460
I'm not mad.

1260
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,360
I'm merely an ordinary person seeking life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

1261
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:41,520
My pursuit of happiness includes machine gunning 127 innocent children.

1262
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:44,160
If that's mad, go ahead, lock me up.

1263
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:51,180
Just because I enjoy washing my face in the blood of infants and children, I don't mean

1264
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,180


1265
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,180


1266
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,180


1267
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,180


1268
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,180


1269
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,180


1270
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,180


1271
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,180


1272
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,180


1273
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,180


1274
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,180


1275
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,180


1276
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,180


1277
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,640
to be a mad man.

1278
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,220
Is that any reason to lock me up?

1279
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,060
I think not.

1280
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,760
I've even got a piece of paper that says my mind is still okay.

1281
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:05,620
Hell, I bet that guy down at the employment agency who wouldn't give me a job just because

1282
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:09,220
I'd been locked up one time, bet he ain't got a piece of paper that says his mind is

1283
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:09,740
still okay.

1284
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:17,180
Hell, I tried to tell them it was not me, it was the green energy demons, but they merely

1285
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,040
laughed at me.

1286
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,160
But now those green energy demons are ruling the world.

1287
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,160


1288
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,160


1289
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,160


1290
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,160


1291
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,160


1292
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,160


1293
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,160


1294
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,160


1295
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,160


1296
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,800
They're not laughing, they're not leaving the planet, they're not laughing right so

1297
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,940
hard now, are they?

1298
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:31,460
But that wasn't nearly as bad as that time they shocked the living geek out of me.

1299
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:38,620
I tried to explain it was not me, it was the brain, the brain of Arnold Palmer, which was

1300
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:44,720
controlling my mind via laser beam, via the FBI, via the CIA, via the Communist Party,

1301
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:45,880
via satellite.

1302
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:50,720
It was the demon, the demon that forced me to do the deed.

1303
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:51,140
I was a demon.

1304
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:51,140


1305
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,480
I was a symbol would he.

1306
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,120
I was a symbol would he.

1307
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,540
I was a symbol would he?

1308
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,200
Oh, God, that's a big believed statement.

1309
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:06,820
People I, I was most lovely but people I was most trying to fix only again, me.

1310
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,480
Come on.

1311
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,400
I got to be in a scene now and be clear.

1312
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,080
Much please don't go at the people who tease you.

1313
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:11,080


1314
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:11,400
I got to apart from the best, and I'm gonna함n so if I'm going to fight, that's many and

1315
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:11,400


1316
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:11,660
Thank God he was.

1317
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,500
Hurt nobody,anesバ.

1318
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,500
In fact, I kind of enjoyed it when they shocked the living shit out of me.

1319
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,160
I mean, that time they ran over my face with a pickup truck.

1320
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,340
Oh, yeah, that was fun.
