1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,620
Oh, that was a laid-back show.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,840
Oh, it's not laid-back anymore!

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,180
Look out!

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,120
Whoa!

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,400

00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,700

Welcome, dear friend.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,240
To the Soap Genius Hour of Slash.

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,160
I walked back up to the grassy knoll again

24
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,660
and started heading back down.

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,100
I left that group of wacky Zenos

26
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,680
and the gazebo and the Sodbusters Museum

27
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,940
and that wing-ding nut-flanger on the accordion.

28
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,960
Well, I just didn't know what to think, you know.

29
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,920
Coming up here, hanging around with the grass and the trees,

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,880
it's just natural,

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,860
but these people were talking different,

32
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,920
and I don't know.

33
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,960
I'm just interested in sitting around

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,160
and picking my nose and spitting and stuff like that,

35
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,540
and, well, it just made me think an awful lot.

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,720
Golly, my head got big,

37
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,520
and, well, I never knew I had so many ideas.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,780
I began to think about writing,

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,600
or taking some pictures,

40
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,500
or getting a tape recorder or something,

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,400
and them things,

42
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,340
but, well, I know I didn't want to mess with them.

43
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,660
I just wanted to be natural, you know,

44
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,440
sitting out here with the old rocks

45
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,160
and watching the clouds roll by.

46
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,200
But that...

47
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,040
that old stranger with the accordion,

48
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,000
why, he made me feel a little different.

49
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,680
I...

50
00:02:59,680 --> 00:02:59,980
I...

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,880
I kind of got excited,

52
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,380
and, well,

53
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,460
I liked it a little bit.

54
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,240
It never happened like that before.

55
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,580
Suddenly, I began to reflect on my whole life,

56
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,060
why it was like a rock or...

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,980
or a polka.

58
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,420
No, my life wasn't like a polka,

59
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,320
but here it was again,

60
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,760
and, God Almighty,

61
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,480
hiya, mister!

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,280
How are you?

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,860
How are you, fella?

64
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,620
Hello?

65
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,980
Uh, the only cult they want to talk about

66
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,380
is the Subgenius Foundation,

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,380
the Church of the Subgenius.

68
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,080
Doug Smith says we're different.

69
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,800
Doug's right, Virgil.

70
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,900
We are different, thanks to Jesus,

71
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,480
the Genetic Engineering Corporation of American States.

72
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,580
Mommy too?

73
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,360
Yep, the whole family.

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,260
Yay!

75
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,220
Everybody like us?

76
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,620
No, son, but we're working on it.

77
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,820
Round the clock!

96
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,600
The helicopter which plucked the reentry capsule out of the water.

97
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:12,660
It moved up, took off at fantastic speed at the at least 45 degrees angle and they just

98
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,360
disappeared between the stars.

99
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:23,180
During the debriefing which we always had after each combat mission, the officer who

100
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,080
was receiving this made a joke of it how many beer I had.

101
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,440
How many beer he had dear friends.

102
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,640
Ah yes.

103
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,800
Quiet down you little creatures of the night.

104
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,100
You've got a show to do.

105
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,480
Huh.

106
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,480
Oh dear friends this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

107
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:54,200
You're listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack on KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

108
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:02,240
Hey Zaphod, our theory about Reverend Ann Leonard was just shot to hell the other night.

109
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,780
Friends I feel sorry for those of you who couldn't make it to the subgenius meeting

110
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,600
and for the people who didn't dare to come and...

111
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,280
see the reflection of themselves.

112
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,240
But it was very interesting the way that turned out.

113
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,700
You know we announced last week that there was going to be a meeting for people who wanted

114
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:34,000
to volunteer to help with KNON and the church of the subgenius specifically and we got like

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,820
30 people called Reverend Cecilia and asked directions and said they were going to come

116
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,300
and so forth.

117
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,140
But only half showed up.

118
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,240
And the mighty...

119
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,960
Reverend Cecilia who now dear friends is Popes, the Pope or Popestress of Dallas.

120
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:58,440
Popes Cecilia bowed down to her ye unworthy unclean ones for she is truly worthy.

121
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,020
She allowed us to have this meeting at her house, a meeting of subgeniuses who had never

122
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:11,040
in many cases had never laid eyes on another admitted quote subgenius unquote before in

123
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,520
their lives.

124
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,000
But it turned out quite interesting.

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,460
There was no real Bobbies.

126
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,320
It was real nice.

127
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,660
It was all folks that I think could give us a real hand and I haven't managed to sit down

128
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,300
and plot it all out on the big computer yet.

129
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,800
But oh yes we'll have places for you all in Dobbs Town dear friends.

130
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,380
Don't worry about that.

131
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,260
All of ye chosen who showed up.

132
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,860
It was just the meeting was just what you'd expect.

133
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,840
It was a at a seedy S&M bar in Oak Cliff full of demon worshippers.

134
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:42,980
And I'm sure you've heard of them.

135
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:42,980


136
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:42,980


137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,320
Yes and you see you missed out on it.

138
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,920
Missed out on it.

139
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:53,860
Oh and there was a one young subgenius there gave me a Christmas a wonderful Christmas

140
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:00,520
present a sign professionally made sign that said Bulldada Time Control Laboratories is

141
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,980
subsidiary of the Church of the Subgenius.

142
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,320
Subgenius Foundation Incorporated.

143
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,300
And that was wonderful.

144
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,260
But you know when I put that sign up.

145
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,980
Bill know where the subgenius is.

146
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,300
The subgenius castle is on Swiss Avenue.

147
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,920
That guy now see that guy he was obviously CIA.

148
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,660
You can't fool Reverend Stan.

149
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,280
That was CIA but he was also a subgenius.

150
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,900
So it's OK if the CIA knows where we are.

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,940
But there's many of you out there who are thinking what's he doing in the jungle.

152
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,860
I thought this was a church.

153
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,680
And on top of that how come how come he's talking about this church and the subgenius.

154
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,120
What is that?

155
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,280
They say what are you?

156
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,420
What are you?

157
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:42,960
They chant.

158
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,240
They chant.

159
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,580
Wanting to know just what it is we're talking about.

160
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,940
And every 10 or 12 shows I play this lovely tape.

161
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,580
Three, two, and one.

162
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,800
Now to continue with the tape recording.

163
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,280
Superior mutants repent.

164
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,100
Quit your job.

165
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,560
Slack off.

166
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,960
The world ends now.

167
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,760
Tomorrow is tomorrow and you may die.

168
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,140
Well no probably not but whatever you do just keep listening.

169
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,880
Are we controlled by secret forces?

170
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,380
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

171
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,960
Do people think you're strange?

172
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
Do you?

173
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,300
Then you may be on the right track.

174
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,260
Are you abnormal?

175
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,940
Then you are perfect.

176
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:42,940


177
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:42,940


178
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,340
Probably better than most people.

179
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,520
Yes your kind shall triumph.

180
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,220
Now at last the step by step process is revealed.

181
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,380
This is it.

182
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,280
The only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

183
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,080
Having all the guilt but none of the sex.

184
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:11,980
Having intercourse with a beautiful live girl or damn near anything else.

185
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,580
You've bloody tried everything.

186
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,700
You ain't seen nothing yet.

187
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,560
Learn to think big.

188
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,740
Develop the tricks of length extension.

189
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:28,060
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

190
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,180
Stand erect for your own abnormality.

191
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,860
Mom is a way of life to millions.

192
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,460
Yet half of them don't even know it.

193
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,920
She's the one true living slack master with the spirit of the living.

194
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,960
She will know how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

195
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,000
She is the one real shortcut to slack.

196
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,960
Now see another dimension on your TV.

197
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,680
Yes fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

198
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,620
Become physically attractive overnight.

199
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,820
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

200
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,840
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

201
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,280
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

202
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,200
And coming right back.

203
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,520
To bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

204
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:38,000
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

205
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,220
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.

206
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:42,920
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality. To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.

207
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,700
And channel them into an illusion of creativity.

208
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,680
That will fool normals and get you sex.

209
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,860
I don't believe you J.R.

210
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,500
Well, I did benefit from it of course.

211
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,680
But so did a whole bunch of old Dallas boys.

212
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:08,800
In other words you want to know, you want the government to know that you're in there to make money and to pay taxes.

213
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,540
Well we're already treading a pretty thin line Bill.

214
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,420
And I'm sure there's plenty of other things they'd love to get us for.

215
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,960
Just be, you know, well, I don't know whether we want to talk about the conspiracy on the air but...

216
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,800
Oh yeah, go right ahead.

217
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,720
This is the conspiracy, the one, the conspiracy behind the conspiracy.

218
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,520
Ah, the conspiracy to end all conspiracies maybe.

219
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:40,420
Well part of the church's goal is to wake people up to the fact that our lives are being controlled by forces.

220
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,920
Ah, the conspiracy to end all conspiracies maybe.

221
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,800
Well part of the church's goal is to wake people up to the fact that our lives are being controlled by forces.

222
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:44,800


223
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,920
Well okay, this light, as we were looking at it, both of us were watching the light,

224
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,700
and we thought anything just in, you know, in a split second it was suddenly,

225
00:12:54,520 --> 00:13:00,700
this two-story, I'd say the diameter around thing, the height of this room.

226
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,840
Wow, you mean it was like a little bobbing?

227
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,880
Well it wasn't bobbing, as steady as this table if it were carried on a caterpillar, it was that steady.

228
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,740
And walking speed.

229
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,500
And the...

230
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,060
And the speed never changed.

231
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,140
It just suddenly got that...

232
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,200
It just suddenly was huge.

233
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:18,500
Yeah.

234
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,380
It gets really complex when you get into conspiracies, and we believe...

235
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,020
Um...

236
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,240
.

237
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,620
.

238
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,140
.

239
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,020
Ah, yes, dear friends.

240
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:49,320
Ha ha, have you two not gotten enough slack on the ropes of life?

241
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:57,940
This is Dr. Philodrumon speaking to you from on the road way out there,

242
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,980
somewhere where you nor your friends can even perceive.

243
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,340
Ha ha, yes, dear friends.

244
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:11,740
We're out here, you're out there, and we're thinking about you out there.

245
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:17,260
And about all the wonderful things that can be found when you find Bob.

246
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:26,440
I'm talking to you tonight about the only God, the one and only Bob, the church of the subgenius.

247
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,840
Praise Bob, praise Bob.

248
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,220
Can I get a witness?

249
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,360
Can I get a witness?

250
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,640
Can I get a praise Bob?

251
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,820
Can I get a praise Bob?

252
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,080
Can I get an amen?

253
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,380
Can I get an amen?

254
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,280
Thank you children, thank you.

255
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,140
Thank you, thank you.

256
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,600
.

257
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,340
.

258
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,540
.

259
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:54,740
.

260
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,420
The purpose of the church.

261
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,320
What is the purpose of the church?

262
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,720
The purpose of the church is to have what?

263
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,120
Slack!

264
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,800
Can I hear that again?

265
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,400
I need more slack!

266
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,740
Can I get some slack?

267
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,120
Can I get some slack?

268
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:19,840
Can I get some slack?

269
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:32,620
World Without Slack, Chapter 3, by Lies.

270
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:39,160
The fightin' Jesus looked out over the bridge of the excessed battle saucer, Blood of Christ.

271
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,040
He looked and laughed.

272
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,160
He laughed and looked.

273
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,180
He looked and looked.

274
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,300
He laughed and laughed.

275
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,480
He was finally going to have his revenge on the natives of Dust Moat 89 AB.

276
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:01,920
Aboard Jesus' flagship, dozens of killer theologians, the shock priests, were busy at their weapons terminals.

277
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:10,900
On the power decks, the proper orgone cycles were being timed by mass fornications between the ritual crew and the cancer beings from Theta Z.

278
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:17,520
An invasion-ready state existed in the ship and the 900 others floating over the doomed planet Earth.

279
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,980
Jesus was in a psychopathically elated state.

280
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,720
His face resembled many of the perverts.

281
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,800
The universe icons, the humanoids of the Dust Moat, painted of him.

282
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,320
They prayed to these for the salvation of their souls.

283
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,640
As if they had any souls to save.

284
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,580
As if anyone would want to save them, which they didn't.

285
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,040
A whole disgusting religion now centered around his murder.

286
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,660
They had to gall to nail him up like a common criminal and then paint pictures of him enjoying it.

287
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,480
And they thought he loved them for it, that he was forgiving.

288
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,600
Oh, the anticipation.

289
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,300
He was sick to his stomach with glee.

290
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,640
He would show them the true face of pain and sin.

291
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,440
It had taken him 2,000 long years to return here.

292
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,900
And now he would pay them back for the scars he still carried in his hands.

293
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,800
Sweet stigmata.

294
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:15,220
Even the slightest thought of the scars made them glow red through his fists.

295
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,140
Through the boxing gloves.

296
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,580
The hold of the spacecraft was manned with angelic power.

297
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,140
The angels of light personally lent by Jehovah One.

298
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:32,800
They supervised the demon teams operating on all tangible destruction spectrums.

299
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,220
All in attack mode.

300
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,960
Nagas, Orzuma, Shiva, Horus, Aeons.

301
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,340
The dark bodies.

302
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,280
And at time and a half, too.

303
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,700
It was expensive to ravage a planet.

304
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,880
No matter.

305
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,920
The host of judgment.

306
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,620
That which comes had finally arrived.

307
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,400
And on Jesus's birthday.

308
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,860
What do you think, Dad?

309
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,680
His second in command, Jim Jones, stood by with the final attack coordinate, Codices.

310
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,240
A whole graphic map of Earth rotated slowly next to Jones in midair.

311
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,760
On its surface, grids of the natives' planetary defenses were lit up in green.

312
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,440
Ones, some depicting their pathetic communication structures in violet.

313
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,860
All in scale.

314
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,940
Quite pretty, actually.

315
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,800
A colorful net surrounded the sphere.

316
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,200
It would soon enough be dark.

317
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,700
These children wait for us below, Jesus.

318
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,620
We will walk among them and we will smile.

319
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,160
At your moment of choice, of course.

320
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:50,200
Jesus studied Jones' puffy, tired face in the pink glow of the neuron banks that ran around the walls of the mighty dreadnought and shuddered.

321
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,460
He was no stranger to resurrection of the undead.

322
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,080
But whoever had brought Jones around again had slipped up.

323
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,760
Something was missing.

324
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,940
Something else was added.

325
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,040
Something.

326
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:08,480
Jones had been forced on him by the Djinn bankers who had financed this angelic war fleet.

327
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,240
Damn them.

328
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,620
He never forgot the price they had demanded for this mercenary raiding fleet.

329
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:22,300
Jones' constant reminders of their influence and expectations irritated Jesus no end.

330
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,440
Not to mention the fact that he was a man of the world.

331
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,080
And the annoying habit Jones had copied from dogs.

332
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:32,040
The twisted creature insisted on smoking a pipe, even here near the sensitive nerve relays.

333
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,440
Jones might have been left dead a little too long.

334
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,880
He moved with a constant jerk and always poked at his throat.

335
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:47,320
He never removed his sunglasses and he still took massive injections of methamphetamines even though they no longer had any effect on his regenerated shell.

336
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,940
You know, Jimbo, said Jesus.

337
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,380
The best part is that they think there's an afterlife.

338
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,800
That's why they strung me up the first time.

339
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,360
They think like bugs down there.

340
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,380
I'm well aware of that, Commander.

341
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:11,420
It bothered Jones to be back on Earth so soon after his failure with the social programming research post he had been running there.

342
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,140
It wasn't really his fault.

343
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,480
The administration change at Central merely cut off the funding for it.

344
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,440
He was forced to abort the experiment.

345
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,420
Terminate.

346
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,660
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,320
There is a great deal of speculation about what is going to happen next.

348
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,060
The tape is ready now.

349
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,840
The lights have gone down just slightly.

350
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,740
The Mr. Science Lecture Series.

351
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,600
Volume 1, Number 1.

352
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,100
The Neutron.

353
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,240
Delivered by the Reverend Seth Deitch, First Church of Mr. Science, Boston.

354
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:08,440
Outside the realm of conspiracy science and in the clear light of the so-called forbidden sciences, we will find we have a far greater chance of understanding the true nature of the universe.

355
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:18,500
What the conspiracy feeds us under the guise of the most advanced system of natural philosophy is nothing but a complex sham.

356
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:27,140
A decoy to hide from us the true fact of how much bigger and more complex and nut-wrenchingly frightening a place the universe really is.

357
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:45,040
We are told about matter and energy and space and time as being either consistent realities governed by laws or as foggy abstracts that have no particular being outside of that of being convenient linguistic aids to make the whole thing easier to swallow.

358
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,480
We at the Temporal Management Research Society are the ones who are going to find out.

359
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,220
We are told that the

360
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,860
The Neutron.

361
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,960
The truth must now be told.

362
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:17,080
How it was covered up for so long would make a story intriguing enough for a separate book, but it's too involved to be told here.

363
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,460
The actual issue is that the Neutron is a mystery.

364
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,700
The issue at hand is the Neutron and its pivotal role in the management of the true cosmos.

365
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:30,040
In order to properly understand the following, it must first be made clear what actually constitutes an elementary particle.

366
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:41,460
The first of these basic particles is the electron, which has no mass but possesses a charge that is commonly described as possibly infinite, thus making it the fundamental unit of energy.

367
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,320
It and other related particles, i.e. positrons, photons, gravitons, etc.

368
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:54,220
acting in concert make up the Iacotismic field, which is responsible for holding everything that is anything together.

369
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:00,460
The second is the much rarer infinite mass particle, commonly called a black hole.

370
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:08,660
These particles, like the electrons, occupy no space, but the influence of a single particle can be felt at a much greater distance.

371
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,460
They often have event horizons many miles wide, beyond which not even light can escape.

372
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,960
The third fundamental particle is the Neutron.

373
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:30,260
The Neutron carries with it an infinite temporal capacity that makes it alter the rate and intensity and general quality of the passage through time of anything it touches.

374
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,360
The Neutron is very likely the rarest particle in this universe.

375
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:43,460
As far as we know, there might well be only one of them, though there could be as many as a few dozen without generating a dangerous concentration of Neutron phenomena.

376
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,300
The first segment of this report will deal with the Neutron phenomenon.

377
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:52,560
It will deal with the general implications of the Neutron in regards to existing ideas on the workings of the universe.

378
00:23:52,840 --> 00:24:01,640
The second will concern the incredible potentialities of using the potent forces of the Neutron in time control research and in practical time control.

379
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:05,700
Section A

380
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,800
Just how fucking big everything really is.

381
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,800
What we know as the universe can be envisioned as a giant atom with the black hole acting as the nucleus,

382
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,180
and the Neutron or Neutrons acting as the electron cloud,

383
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,100
with the electrons providing the energy for the Neutron to drive us forward through time.

384
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,880
Just about everything else in the universe is just so much debris, cluttering up the works of things.

385
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,740
The fact that there is one such atom more than suggests the existence of others.

386
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,220
Section B

387
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,660
The Neutron has a corresponding antiparticle known as the tachyon,

388
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,520
which travels through time in a direction which we perceive as backwards,

389
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,000
so that to someone who is not in the know it will appear to exceed the speed of light.

390
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:57,960
The simple fact of the matter is that tachyons are extra universal Neutrons impinging on our universe at a different temporal angle.

391
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,000
These are the Neutrons of atom universes that ours is in compound with.

392
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,880
After this the atomic metaphor breaks down.

393
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,580
Section C

394
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,960
Section D

395
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,400
Section C

396
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,080
Section C

397
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,340
Section E

398
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:15,360
Section F

399
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,360


400
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,400
Section B

401
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,900
Section Q

402
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,260
Section A

403
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:17,260


404
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:17,620
Section B

405
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:22,660
A six million year cycle will end in 1998.

406
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,760
Bob sees the world entering a new Aeon,

407
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,540
which in a few years will bring more wondrous and miraculous change,

408
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,100
and carnage, insanity, and destruction,

409
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,600
than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.

410
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,060
Bob brings a new destiny for us.

411
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,820
America, a time of

412
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,660
cataclysmic economic change

413
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,540
that will offer untold riches

414
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,860
and power to those in the

415
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,620
know, while billions

416
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,440
of deserving conspiracy

417
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,300
dupes fry

418
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,440
in hell on earth.

419
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,360
Uncontrolled thinking,

420
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,200
controlled by Bob,

421
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,600
will usher in a spiritual

422
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,580
rebrief and a cascade

423
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,860
of astounding mysteries,

424
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,300
supernatural

425
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,280
riches, and a

426
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,240
restoration of lost psychic

427
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,800
abilities that will

428
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,500
transform the lives of those

429
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,180
who dare to seek them

430
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,820
and pay for them.

431
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,340
That's right, you're lucky

432
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,640
to live in the end time.

433
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,160
Here's more money, Bob!

434
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,480
Wise up!

435
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,440
That's right, dear friends,

436
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,600
wise up.

437
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,080
And I must apologize there

438
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,160
for the choice of language used

439
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,020
at one point by Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger

440
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,340
there with the Church of Mr. Science.

441
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,840
I'm sorry, he cut in on our normal

442
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,980
broadcasting spectrum wavelength

443
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,980
here and inserted

444
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,240
that into our show.

445
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,340
That is not an official part of the

446
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,720
subgenius show. You did not hear

447
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,040
that.

448
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,780
It does not exist

449
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,560
technically as part

450
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,640
of the tapes that I chose to play.

451
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:17,660
I just

452
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,400
want you to know that, dear friends.

453
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,660
That's pretty important around here.

454
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,980
And I'll

455
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,420
probably get in

456
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,740
loads of serious

457
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,260
trouble.

458
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,220
Uh, what a...

459
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:31,900
Whoa!

460
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,600
Thanks to St. Byron Werner for that

461
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,760
incredible piece of music.

462
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,840
Hoo!

463
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,480
Yeah, and thanks to Reverend Bleepo Abernathy

464
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,640
for recording

465
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,660
the, uh, the barrage

466
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,700
that we were hearing for a lot of the

467
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,400
stuff that we've heard tonight, actually.

468
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,800
Yeah.

469
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,680
Shut the

470
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,020
door!

471
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,880
To get you.

472
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,480
The different are being silenced

473
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,240
by a global conspiracy.

474
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,160
Weird men arise!

475
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,380
Find out who they

476
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,740
are and how to smash

477
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,300
them!

478
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,540
You probably already knew that the U.S.

479
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,900
government is a sham.

480
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,520
Something popped up there for you to blame.

481
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,400
But did you know that the real

482
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,480
powers that be are not even

483
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,540
people? That they are actually

484
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,440
shambling? Unbelievable,

485
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,860
unmentionable, unthinkable

486
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,540
things?

487
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,680
Yes!

488
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,240
Jehovah is an

489
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,460
alien and still threatens

490
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,460
this planet!

491
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,460
Defy the sinister star

492
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,280
forces which mocked you!

493
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,220
We must all be

494
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:40,220


495
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,680
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity

496
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,320
for thousands of years!

497
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,900
God has been misquoted

498
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,400
all this time!

499
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,640
His actual words may

500
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,540
disturb you, but

501
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,900
Bob Dobbs is a

502
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,080
bulwark against the unbearable

503
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,680
fear and anxiety

504
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,120
tormenting mankind.

505
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,400
There's no problem

506
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,960
with Bob.

507
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,700
I don't know who he's with

508
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,040
or what the deal is,

509
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,480
but I know that if I stay close to Bob,

510
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,980
I'll be safe in those

511
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,100
Gleegers in Arkansas.

512
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,800
I know those creatures can't get a hold of me

513
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,540
if I just hang around the foundation

514
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,400
and do what they say and, you know,

515
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,560
clean up after them a little bit.

516
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,020
I don't mind doing that kind of work

517
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,300
if it's for a good cause.

518
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,280
I know that Bob, I know that Bob,

519
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,700
is a good cause.

520
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,560
Bob took me inside his heart

521
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,560
and I accepted him into my life.

522
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,280
And I'm here to testify, friends,

523
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,880
what that man has done for me,

524
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,000
if you can really call him a man.

525
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,960
Many people say he's almost like a god.

526
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,080
I don't think so.

527
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,060
Of course, I don't know Bob, but

528
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,880
I do know Bob in certain ways.

529
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,540
And I think you understand what I'm talking about.

530
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,780
Yes, Bob, he filled me with a sort of a spirit

531
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,260
I never knew I had.

532
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,880
I knew it wasn't coming from him.

533
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,960
It was coming from inside me.

534
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,800
Bob was giving it to me.

535
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,480
He was laying hands on me from afar.

536
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,640
He might have been up in that great big jet plane,

537
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,200
or he might have been down on Skid Row

538
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,020
giving some bum a haircut.

539
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,080
But all I know is,

540
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,940
it was Bob.

541
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,620
It was Bob.

542
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,160
Bob.

543
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,060
Yeah, he's smiling.

544
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,380
You never see Bob frown.

545
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,200
You know that behind that amazing smile

546
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,280
there lies a mind like a steel trap.

547
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,780
I'm sure he makes mistakes like

548
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,580
what he did with those young women that time.

549
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,120
But I think the newspaper's exaggerated.

550
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,220
Bob.

551
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,900
Yeah, he's smiling.

552
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,200
You never see Bob frown.

553
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,980
You know that behind that amazing smile

554
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,020
there lies a mind like a steel trap.

555
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,540
I'm sure he makes mistakes like

556
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,340
what he did with those young women that time.

557
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,500
But I think the newspaper's exaggerated that.

558
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,000
But I think the newspaper's exaggerated that.

559
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,520
I know that Bob will do all of us fine in the long run.

560
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:54,520
In fact, I think I know that we really need Bob in our lives.

561
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,740
In our lives.

562
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,520
In our lives.

563
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,720
In our lives.

564
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:58,940
In our lives.

565
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:58,960
In 1981.

566
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,220
And in 1984.

567
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,360
Hi, little brother.

568
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,520
And in 1984.

569
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,740
And in 1991.

570
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,780
And in 1995.

571
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,420
When they bring the conspiracy to its heels.

572
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:24,480
And in that wondrous year that we know is gonna come all too soon upon us.

573
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,640
And we'll leave our earthly things behind.

574
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:35,200
And we'll go and join the exes from God only knows what strange planet they come from.

575
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,660
If they really even come from a planet at all.

576
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:42,280
And not some energy star beaming away in the darkness.

577
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,440
Lighting our lives with the technology.

578
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,040
And the spirituality.

579
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,220
And the mentality of Planet X.

580
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,920
Planet X coming down to take care of us subgeniuses.

581
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,700
And see that there's a place for us in the world.

582
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,020
And give us our rightful seat at the right hand of Bob.

583
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,320
Or the left hand of Bob.

584
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,580
Depending on whether we're rewardians or mediocrities.

585
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,420
But I don't want to get lost in the dogma.

586
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,480
I want to tell you something that blesses my heart.

587
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,480
And it's Bob.

588
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:16,820
Bob.

589
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,160
Bob.

590
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,980
Yeah, I can hear him.

591
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,300
I can hear him talking off there in the distance.

592
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,540
Saying, come to me, Tommy.

593
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,580
Come to me and lay down your material things.

594
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,800
Because you know they are gonna mean much to you.

595
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,420
After that divine year.

596
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,960
And after I lay my hand on you.

597
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,860
And lead you up the steps of that magnificent craft.

598
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,920
And we'll board it and go to the stars.

599
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,140
That's right, Tommy.

600
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,900
We'll go to the stars.

601
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,780
You and me.

602
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,220
That's what Bob said.

603
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,700
Bob said that to me.

604
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,120
Tighten these cranial sutures down.

605
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,880
See the patient suffered from a subdural hematoma.

606
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:20,160
Which had suffused the dura and pia matter of the brain.

607
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,280
You see now this is in a dark discolored elongate mass.

608
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,420
Which, uh, uh oh.

609
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,380
It's crumbling.

610
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,960
Send those body parts in from Oklahoma soon.

611
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,360
Gratitude.

612
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,900
Running out of fingers.

613
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:33,700
Gratitude.

614
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,400
Yes, well we tried to mail them.

615
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,520
But the mail was disgruntled that day.

616
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,400
Grunt.

617
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,360
Boing.

618
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,040
What a sickening operation this is.

619
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,000
It's strange.

620
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,420
This is what the Indians can do to a guy.

621
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:51,720
The Indians did this to puzzling evidence because he violated their sacred burial space.

622
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,340
It was thus reawakened to the...

623
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,360
You know, it's terrible what they do when they...

624
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,060
Look at this.

625
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,940
This is the body of someone.

626
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,680
Someone who's been out in the hot sun and...

627
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,220
Well, from these, uh, from this evidence you can imagine what's been done.

628
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,560
It's certainly not a pretty sight now.

629
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,180
Now we're gonna open.

630
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,960
Here we go.

631
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,180
Well let's...

632
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,340
Household...

633
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,140
Yes, alright, and look at the surface.

634
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,320
It's...

635
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,860
Uh, oh!

636
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,360
Splashed, splattered me in the face there.

637
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,000
Ah, what a joker.

638
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,880
No harm done.

639
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,400
Now we're going to, uh, break the vinyl rib at the...

640
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,000
At the top.

641
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,800
Ah, jeez.

642
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,300
Ah, he seemed to be...

643
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,600
He registered that a little bit.

644
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,300
Maybe he felt it.

645
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,600
Get the blood out of here!

646
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,120
Uh, nurse, can we have the, uh...

647
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,620
We have some...

648
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,300
Can we have someone please try to help us restore the breathing of this patient?

649
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,480
Suction, please.

650
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,300
Ah, thank you.

651
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,220
I didn't expect us to put this back together yet.

652
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,060
Uh, now, uh...

653
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,860
All right, now, let's remove the...

654
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,200
The book lungs, you see?

655
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,780
It's just like a book right here.

656
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,380
And, uh, if we can find a...

657
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:00,380


658
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:00,380


659
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:00,380


660
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:00,380


661
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:00,380


662
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:00,380


663
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:04,540
If we take the giggly saw and you'll stop, uh, laughing in that unseemly fashion, we

664
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:09,500
can, uh, penetrate through the inner bony carapace to the, uh, epigastral.

665
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,680
All right, here we are.

666
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,980
Note the whitish, viscous surface.

667
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,320
Face to face.

668
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,920
Notice that this passage appears to be blocked with some sort of mucilaginous roughage.

669
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,660
We call it the roughage of knowledge here on the show.

670
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,220
Now notice...

671
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,360
Oh, the sucking chest wound.

672
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,320
Oh.

673
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,680
Oh, the pneumos.

674
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,860
This is a repugnant sight, but...

675
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,400
Disgusting.

676
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,520
...one which those versed in medical knowledge are often familiar with.

677
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:54,120
Now I'm going to peel back the thin, fatty layer beneath the adipose tissue which connects

678
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,220
to the mesentery...

679
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:55,900
Oh, you're going too far.

680
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,780
...supporting these organs.

681
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,640
Oh, you're going too far.

682
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,320
And, uh...

683
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,840
Oh, notice what is revealed before us here, gentlemen.

684
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,940
You've got an alien in a...

685
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,860
Yeah, get that little alien out of there.

686
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,620
Can't see what I'm doing.

687
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,040
Look, it's just an infant.

688
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,340
Baby, go away.

689
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,600
Stinky monster.

690
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,880
Look what he did inside Wellman's thorax.

691
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,160
Well, let's, uh, penetrate a little further.

692
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,520
Uh, operation's over.

693
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,120
I'm sorry.

694
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,160
Next patient, please.

695
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,080
Mmm...

696
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,140
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

697
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,360
We gotta get this guy back together.

698
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,740
...this can and can't do.

699
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,080
That's increased...

700
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,760
Now, let's, uh, go through the diaphragm here, which is no longer a spongy tissue,

701
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,840
but rather a hard, uh, and rigid surface after the inception of rigor mortis.

702
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,840
Here we are.

703
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,320
...use as much jelly on his diaphragm.

704
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,200
I can't understand.

705
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,140
This is, uh, spermacidal ham jelly here.

706
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,040
It coats the exterior.

707
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,780
...activity to the suggestible...

708
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,820
Oh!

709
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,280
Watch out!

710
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,280


711
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,280


712
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:56,380
Oh!

713
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:56,920
Oh!

714
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,200
Watch out for those loose connections.

715
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,240
Boy, that can kill you.

716
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,320
...point of entry into the...

717
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,200
Now, what we need to do is, uh, saw through the, um...

718
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,000
...move...

719
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,880
...the...

720
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,100
Ah!

721
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,640
Whoa!

722
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,360
Whoa!

723
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:08,820
Whoa!

724
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,100
Whoa!

725
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:09,940
Whoa!

726
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,540
Whoa!

727
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:10,900
Whoa!

728
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,140
Whoa!

729
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,600
Whoa!

730
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:11,600


731
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:11,920
Whoa!

732
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,000
Whoa!

733
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,200
Whoa!

734
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,400
Whoa!

735
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:12,600
Whoa!

736
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:12,600


737
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:12,820
Whoa!

738
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,260
Whoa!

739
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:13,380
Whoa!

740
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:13,380


741
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:13,740
Whoa!

742
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,700
Whoa!

743
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,560
We almost made it!

744
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,140
Oh!

745
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,140


746
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,340
How did we do?

747
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:19,340


748
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,020
That was, uh...

749
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,960
weird...

750
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,380
Ah!

751
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:24,940


752
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:24,940


753
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,140
I'm from theantis!

754
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,760
As long as you're out here, I'll tell you...

755
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,900
crawl with me.

756
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,640
I mean, you know, I'm not scared of decay...

757
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:38,820
I'll tell you...

758
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:38,820


759
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:38,880
I'll tell you...

760
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,800
Jump over, jump over!

761
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:40,800


762
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,640
tout!!!

763
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:41,640


764
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:41,940
Jump on the.

765
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,840
The Final Squirt.

766
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,340
That's Ray Hay on lead,

767
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,840
Dr. Philo Drummond on bass,

768
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,700
Sphinx Drummond on the keyboard,

769
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:55,280
and I believe, I can't remember,

770
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,000
they trade out drummers.

771
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,960
They have mechanical drummers half the time.

772
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,880
Oh, dear friends, we had a caller who said,

773
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,820
Reverend Stang, I've listened to this show twice now.

774
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,040
It was a real nice lady.

775
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,080
She goes, but now, are you all involved in devil worship?

776
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,380
I said, no, ma'am, no, ma'am.

777
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,500
We have a special relationship with those devils,

778
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,560
but it ain't worship.

779
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,420
Nay, nay.

780
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,420
We lure the sinners away from the devils,

781
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,140
don't you see?

782
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,040
That's what we're doing,

783
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,140
is we take, this stuff appeals to sinners,

784
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,740
because Bob doesn't care about the sinning part.

785
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,240
He sends them on to more adept,

786
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,140
personal saviors than him.

787
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,260
It's like I told her, I said,

788
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,060
if she could just say,

789
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,600
see Bob's face, she'd understand everything.

790
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
It would all become clear,

791
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,160
and you can see Bob's face.

792
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,080
If you write to Bob and ask for a picture of Bob's face,

793
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,880
just say, send me Bob's face

794
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,120
at P.O. Box 140306,

795
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,520
Dallas, Texas, 75214,

796
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,620
but we deal with the sinners.

797
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,860
We went down to the drunk tank, dear friends.

798
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,320
We were gonna preach to the alcoholics

799
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,900
and the homosexuals.

800
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,740
Now, old Bob, he doesn't want them

801
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,580
to quit drinking and fornicating.

802
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,380
No, no, they know what's best for them.

803
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,520
They're men, but they say, they all say,

804
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,120
Bob, Bob, you're a great man.

805
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,600
You're a rich man.

806
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,360
How can you understand my problems?

807
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,880
I'm only a wayward sinner,

808
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,320
but old Bob Dobbs, friends,

809
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,500
Bob's been in every jail cell.

810
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,700
He knows the prisoner.

811
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,120
He's walked in the shoes of the alcoholic, dear friend.

812
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,740
He's walked in the shoes of the fornicator.

813
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,880
He's walked in the shoes of the convict.

814
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,360
He's walked in the shoes of the common thief.

815
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,580
And most important, friends,

816
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,520
he's walked in the shoes of the shoe salesman.

817
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,440
He's been on both sides of the law.

818
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,200
He's been through all them drugs, friend.

819
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,580
Oh, he's a sinner and he's a saint because he's Bob.

820
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,740
Oh, yes, I can feel the spirit of Bob moving in Dallas tonight

821
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,520
all across those radio waves.

822
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,300
The evil one is out there.

823
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,500
He's making those bad backwards miracles.

824
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,680
Oh, yeah, yeah.

825
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,360
He's a he-gaheen.

826
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,840
He's got them good, bad, bad, good,

827
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,860
backwards time streams running.

828
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,960
Running through all them drivers out on the Mixmaster.

829
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,900
I feel them out there because I'm in the vision.

830
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,360
I'm in discernment.

831
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,260
I'm in the spirit, friends.

832
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,080
I see a young man is listening out there,

833
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,660
but he's bound by habit, by bad habits.

834
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,840
He's frustrated in that traffic jam down there on I-30 right now.

835
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,740
They got him listening to them record albums.

836
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,960
You can hear the devil talking backwards on those,

837
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,820
that foreigner music, that rock and roll music with lyrics.

838
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,200
You can hear that devil talking backwards.

839
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,960
And he depends.

840
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,880
He depends on the satellite beamed in cable TV movies

841
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,260
with Burt Reynolds and car crashes and women.

842
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,300
Oh, aren't they lost, dear friends?

843
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:46,920
But they do.

844
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,060
These pinks out there do have that foot gland,

845
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,780
that one remnant of their soul,

846
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,640
that rectangular gland that's connected to their monies.

847
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,540
My friends, they can be freed by parting with that which hath enslaved them.

848
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:06,000
You hand them that pamphlet, oh, friends, the scales fall from their eyes.

849
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,600
But you know, when those pink boys discover Bob,

850
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,140
it's either truth or death.

851
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,180
For the love of Bob can kill normals, friends, yes.

852
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,280
Yes, but Bob's men are moving on this planet.

853
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,020
Oh, that planetary alignment that came up, the Jupiter effect,

854
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,900
oh, I'm now sure that may have caused earthquakes and volcanoes

855
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,280
and the Earth to tilt on its axis.

856
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,300
And men will, in the end times to come,

857
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,300
men will gnash their brains and think backwards.

858
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,900
Dead Christians will come up from their graves shambling and rotting

859
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,240
like not of the living dead.

860
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,240
But the only way to get through it all,

861
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,900
helping to profit from it all,

862
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,640
is that one mighty link between heaven and Earth, that Bob.

863
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,780
Oh, yeah, I can see it now.

864
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,820
The miracle of the Bob world is unfolding.

865
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,240
They're wading up to their knees in blood, dear friends,

866
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:56,340
but it's the blood of the baptism of the mighty fist face of Bob,

867
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,000
that face that can pile through eight-foot-thick

868
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,500
titanium steel conspiracy fort-knock stores with that mighty pipe.

869
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,540
Oh, he ain't from another planet.

870
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,580
He ain't something we have to bow down and kiss to.

871
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,220
He's a man.

872
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:16,680
Oh, well, you can pull Bob's leg and he'll laugh right along with you

873
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,620
because Bob, he's been a fool just like you and me.

874
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,180
Bob's been a pathetic fool, and I tell you what,

875
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,300
that J.R. Bob Dobbs will be a fool again.

876
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,360
He's a fool today, he's a fool tomorrow,

877
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,220
because he's the same Bob.

878
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,360
He's always the same Bob, and he's working for you and me.

879
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,480
But it's that foolishness that has kept man from living.

880
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,160
That foolishness that has kept man from being satisfied with his lot.

881
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,280
That has kept man building his great gas-powered automobile engines,

882
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,000
his nuclear reactors that made him want to master the Earth

883
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,080
no matter how nice it might have been before.

884
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,180
And it gives us, friends, it gives us that mighty hate,

885
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,560
the hate that makes us want to smite our brothers,

886
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,740
the hate that makes us get up in the morning and, friends,

887
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,920
without that foolishness and that mighty hate,

888
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,220
why, we'd be no different from those normals,

889
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,200
because we'd have nothing to gripe about.

890
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,940
We'd have the right power and the hate that gives us something for nothing.

891
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,000
Oh, in the long run, we may be poor and broke,

892
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,680
we may be drunk and neurotic,

893
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,820
but we've got Bob and the hate!

894
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,920
And for that, we can hate him!

895
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,920
Hate him! Hate him!

896
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,600
And that's the power that we have, and they don't have.

897
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,240
Oh, they got plenty of that diddly kind of hate.

898
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,920
Oh, I hate President Reagan.

899
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,940
Oh, I hate my job.

900
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,380
I hate myself.

901
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,720
That's the sick hate, friends.

902
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,120
That ain't no kind of hate at all.

903
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,360
We got that all-inclusive kind of hate, that hate essence,

904
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,380
and it's the love of the hate that allows us to put up with just about anything.

905
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,920
So we can do something about it,

906
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,580
because the Bob hate is indistinguishable from the Bob love.

907
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,020
It's what keeps him on his toes.

908
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,540
Bob is the aware man, the natural man.

909
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,160
He can be walking along, humming to himself, playing pocket pool,

910
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,920
but the inner Bob is aware.

911
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,660
He can hear a fly sniff on a mountain far away,

912
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,540
and he can go up to that fly and look that fly in the eye and say,

913
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,180
Son, I'd like to sell you a big old mound of waste byproducts from physical organisms,

914
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,980
and that fly will give his wings to Bob.

915
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,580
Bob is aware, and that's how he can sell to these inferior creatures.

916
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,600
And that fly, he's going to be a better fly for it.

917
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,940
All those other flies, they're flitting from pile to pile.

918
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:27,200
They see him just sitting there without any wings on that big old mound of Bob,

919
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:30,500
and they may laugh now, but winter goes by, summer goes by,

920
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,240
all those other flies starve, but that little Bob fly,

921
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,000
he's still sitting there on that pile, a munching away and a munching away,

922
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:41,980
and that pile does not change because Bob, my friend, does not change.

923
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,240
Oh, he changes his mind.

924
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,060
He might suddenly change all the doctrine in the whole church

925
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,220
right in the middle of a ritual to teach us all an important lesson,

926
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,080
but oh, my friend, Bob Dobbs does not change.

927
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,800
Hold that name on the tip of your tongue.

928
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,340
Bob. There's a B on either side, opposite poles.

929
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,460
That's the lesson right there.

930
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,940
Flip it over on your tongue.

931
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,740
Say it front way, say it backwards, say it upside down.

932
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,500
And what does it say?

933
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,920
It says Bob, because Bob does not change.

934
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,600
His promise rings true.

935
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,800
But if you ain't been sprinkled in the blood of the head,

936
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,080
if you ain't been washed in the waste byproducts of Bob,

937
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,880
how are you going to get saved?

938
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:20,420
You can go to that party Saturday night, but you've got to be wearing Bob's shadow.

939
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,620
You can drink beer.

940
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,620
You've just got to get Bob drunk too.

941
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,000
And what about Wanda?

942
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,180
Oh, you're just going to have to give Wanda over to Bob.

943
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,000
That shouldn't be any problem because Wanda,

944
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,480
she found out from Bob how to do it.

945
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,020
She found out how to get to heaven.

946
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:33,940
Sit down, boy.

947
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,860
Because friends, if you're wondering,

948
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,140
Bob can love.

949
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,860
Bob can love.

950
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,520
Radio job.

951
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,560
I didn't set foot in a church for three years.

952
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,520
I was just fed up to here with it.

953
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:02,040
After working as an announcer at stations in several cities,

954
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,540
I finally got to Hollywood.

955
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,460
I was offered four jobs, and I took one with a major network.

956
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,220
In 1947, I made a business trip to Cincinnati.

957
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:19,220
And it was just about then that the Kenneth Arnold sighting

958
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,840
of the so-called flying saucers hit the headlines.

959
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,120
And it caused a lot of conversation.

960
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,740
I notice you keep looking out the window.

961
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:33,640
You wouldn't be looking for these flying saucers, would you?

962
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,400
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.

963
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,400
You don't think it's just some kind of a publicity stunt then, huh?

964
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,020
No.

965
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:44,020
It's reasonable to suppose that there's life on other planets.

966
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,720
Maybe I ought to start looking for flying saucers, too.

967
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,460
If they do come from another planet, how will we know?

968
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,720
Listen, when the occupants condescend to tell us, that's when.

969
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,720
But if they do, how will we know?

970
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:13,720


971
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:13,720


972
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:13,720


973
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:13,720


974
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:13,720


975
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:13,720


976
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:13,720


977
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:13,720


978
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:13,720


979
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,300
Now, Bob, you're getting to be a pretty big fella.

980
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:16,540
Yes, sir.

981
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,060
Maybe this is a good idea, a chance for us to have a little talk.

982
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:20,860
Why, sure, Dad.

983
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:21,360
What's cooking?

984
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,520
Uh, remember the last time we talked about this old body of ours, Bob?

985
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,100
Yeah.

986
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:29,720
Yeah.

987
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,460
Yeah, I remember, Dad.

988
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:30,860
No.

989
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,900
Oh, here's a match.

990
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,900
Your pipe's gone out again.

991
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:34,740
Well, thanks.

992
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,340
But when a doctor speaks of the male organ, he, well, he calls it a...

993
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,160
When a man and a woman are married, Bob, they love each other very much.

994
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:55,560
And in, in showing their love, their instinct is to embrace each other as if, well, as if

995
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,980
to try to become the one person God intended them to be.

996
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,400
They're the, the sperm, as the doctors call it.

997
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:04,060
Oh, is that the seed that helps make a new baby?

998
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,340
No, no, Bob.

999
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:13,240
Well, what I'm talking about now is the fluid that contains the, formed in two little sacs

1000
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,220
beneath the penis, which we call the...

1001
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:19,860
Oh, but Dad, why do fellas get these, uh, these feelings before they get married?

1002
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,140
Now, that's a good question, Bob.

1003
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,700
Why do you ask, dear?

1004
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,800
Well, there were some drawings in Bob's textbook.

1005
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,440
I didn't mean to look at them honest and...

1006
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,280
Well, then some of the older girls, well...

1007
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,560
You mean they talk about things sometimes?

1008
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,580
Well, yes.

1009
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:37,740
Bob!

1010
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:39,920
Bob?

1011
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,440
Yes, Bob.

1012
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,260
Call Bob.

1013
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:44,860
Bob!

1014
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,280
I know Bob, Bob days.

1015
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,020
Bob, that's Bob, that's Bob.

1016
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,060
Solidly commemorate...

1017
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,260
Bob.

1018
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:02,260
...the martyrdom of the prophet herald of our faith, called Bob.

1019
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:11,640
And in today's program, we're going to deal with the story of the Bob's martyrdom and

1020
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,960
the events surrounding it.

1021
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:13,440
Wow!

1022
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:23,280
On that blistering July summer day, there were the barrels of 750 rifles awaiting the

1023
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,560
command to fire and take the Bob's life.

1024
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,760
But the

1025
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:28,760


1026
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:28,760


1027
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,460
He seemed so young to die, barely 30.

1028
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,500
He was a handsome, gentle, and confident man.

1029
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,720
Could I possibly be guilty of the shocking crime of which he was accused?

1030
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,180
Would you get off your knees?

1031
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,160
Somewhat unorthodox, wouldn't you say, Reverend Scott?

1032
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,160
But realistic.

1033
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,260
You deliver sermons like this, it's a wonder you're still an ordained minister.

1034
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,480
Or are you?

1035
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,160
The best kind.

1036
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,460
Angry, rebellious, critical, a renegade.

1037
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:56,540


1038
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,460
Strip to most of my so-called clerical powers.

1039
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,320
But I'm still in business.

1040
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,260
Well, you seem to be enjoying the punishment.

1041
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,000
Punishment?

1042
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:06,780
Ha-ha!

1043
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,040
The Church has blessed me.

1044
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:08,680
That's what it's done.

1045
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,120
Banished to some new country in Africa.

1046
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,740
Hell, I had to look it up on the map to find out where I was going.

1047
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:19,760
Oh, my bishop doesn't know it, but he's given me exactly what I wanted.

1048
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,620
Elbow room.

1049
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:22,820
Freedom.

1050
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,380
Real freedom.

1051
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:26,520
And I'm not going to be a slave to the Church.

1052
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:26,520


1053
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:26,520


1054
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:26,520


1055
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:26,520


1056
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:26,520


1057
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,040
Freedom to dump all the rules or all the trappings.

1058
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,420
Freedom to discover God in my own way.

1059
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,300
You call this an act?

1060
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,680
They say it was an act.

1061
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,160
I am an act, I'm not a priest.

1062
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:45,580
Come on!

1063
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:46,780
I saw a car.

1064
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:52,200
I saw an article in the reading in a recent Billy Graham column on religion.

1065
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:56,500
It said, Dear Dr. Graham, I recently converted to Christianity.

1066
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:56,500


1067
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,920
Yet I'm not presently killing Dr. Services by God.

1068
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,560
Is this, perhaps, a theological contradiction?

1069
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:13,400
You know, I'm медiormming in Christian without at this moment killing doctors for

1070
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,460
God that's the kind of forces we have against each other.

1071
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,780
Well, Father, somebody needs to have some sacrificial bread...

1072
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,080
by the next moment...

1073
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,300
I'm going to the треб...

1074
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:21,340
Everybody come here!

1075
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,420
That's mad.

1076
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:24,780
That's it!

1077
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,040
Mmm, that isèle.

1078
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:26,380
I want to touch somebody's feet!

1079
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:26,380


1080
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:26,460
And I came in, I sang just a little bit.

1081
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:26,460


1082
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:26,460


1083
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:26,460


1084
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:26,460


1085
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,120
that the hour for Christ's return was at hand.

1086
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:35,940
The years between 1843 and 1847 were generally accepted

1087
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,280
as the time for the return of Christ.

1088
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,380
A young man there declared that he was the one foretold

1089
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,820
in all the holy books of the past.

1090
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,280
He said he had come to usher in a new era,

1091
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,560
a new springtime in the hearts of men.

1092
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,320
He was called the Bob.

1093
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,220
Bob, his name means the door or the gate.

1094
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:02,720
And his teaching was to be the gateway to the new age of unity.

1095
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:08,240
The world is one country, and mankind its citizens.

1096
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,280
There is only one religion, and all the prophets have taught it.

1097
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,580
Hellfire, all right.

1098
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,480
Okay, there's something else too.

1099
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,780
I noticed last Sunday

1100
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,300
that we had a new religion.

1101
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,560
One of you put a corner in the offering plate, see?

1102
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,280
Yeah, Raymond Welch.

1103
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,540
You're the one.

1104
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,100
You put a corner in there.

1105
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,840
You tight son of a...

1106
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,060
I see all that, see?

1107
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,940
I'm up here where I can see it.

1108
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:45,720
Y'all don't even look or nothing.

1109
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,300
I can see it.

1110
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:50,780
I know whatever one of you is giving.

1111
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,000
All right.

1112
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,280
I'm going to...

1113
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,860
I'm going to maybe go to another church.

1114
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,720
I don't know.

1115
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,860
I don't give a...

1116
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:03,100
Because I just about come to the end of the road.

1117
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,440
Here, I've just about lost patience with you people.

1118
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:10,880
You know we need a Sunday school space out there.

1119
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:15,120
And as Jesus had spoken to Peter the fisherman,

1120
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:19,220
the Bob spoke to a Persian student named Mullah Hussein.

1121
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,980
Mullah Hussein described in his own words

1122
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,060
what...

1123
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,000
his experience was like.

1124
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,260
I sat spelled down by his utterance,

1125
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,180
oblivious of time.

1126
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:36,680
This revelation so suddenly and impetuously thrust upon me

1127
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,640
came as a thunderbolt,

1128
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,480
which for a time seemed to have benumbed my faculties.

1129
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,860
God is pretty busy.

1130
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,520
He's got a long-term plan for humanity

1131
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,760
that stretches far beyond our comprehension.

1132
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,280
God is busy.

1133
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:54,280


1134
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,880
So it's not reasonable to expect him to concern himself with the individual.

1135
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:04,020
The individual is important only to the extent of providing a creative link

1136
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,280
between the past and the future,

1137
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:07,980
in his children,

1138
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,640
or in his grandchildren,

1139
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,120
or in the contribution he makes to humanity.

1140
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,480
Therefore, don't pray to God to solve your problems.

1141
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,460
Pray to that part of God within you.

1142
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,280
Have the guts to fight for yourself.

1143
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,400
God wants brave souls.

1144
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,540
He wants winners, not quitters.

1145
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,740
If you can't win, at least try to win.

1146
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,440
God loves triers.

1147
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,800
Is that right, Robin?

1148
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:45,860
Right.

1149
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,620
You're dealing with something totally alien.

1150
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:53,440
What's the problem?

1151
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:53,440


1152
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:53,440


1153
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:53,440


1154
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,160
Those hypnotic eyes.

1155
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,340
Alien, totally alien.

1156
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:02,240
Something that must be incredibly, unbelievably, something totally alien.

1157
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,480
Looks like he's growing.

1158
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,460
It's like I told Hitler that time,

1159
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,740
back when we were just a couple of running buddies.

1160
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,140
One man's bummer, another man's a beautiful thing.

1161
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,440
And he always believed in that.

1162
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:30,820
I think these guys in this band are a bunch of stupid, loco, loony birds.

1163
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:38,080
Well, then, this is a pretty cool place to hope, even if I'm by my head.

1164
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,020
Robber.

1165
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:42,820
Robber.

1166
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,660
Robber.

1167
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,040
Robber.

1168
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,360
Gotta be robber.

1169
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:46,780
Robber.

1170
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,060
Robber.

1171
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,440
Gotta be robber.

1172
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,740
Been to singing this song.

1173
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:52,960
Drop and drop and drop.

1174
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,340
Yeah, you got to be матropin'.

1175
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:58,080
Drop and droping all night long.

1176
00:56:59,240 --> 00:56:59,980
You got to be a problem.

1177
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,740
Well, you got to be drop it.

1178
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:06,060
Drop and we need you to miss, all right.

1179
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:10,320
To be roses, New England

1180
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:10,620
training

1181
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,720
frove Окra

1182
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,020
I 00 Stretch

1183
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:17,380
Oh, I

1184
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:17,820
I

1185
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:17,880
W

1186
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,500
W

1187
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:32,580
Sifting a measured quantity of tanned flakes down into curved paper

1188
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:36,540
Spreading the flakes so that they lay equal at the ends

1189
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,820
With a slight depression in the middle

1190
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:43,520
Thumbs rolling the paper's inner edge down and up

1191
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,440
Under the outer edge as four fingers pressed it over

1192
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,800
Thumbs and fingers sliding to the paper's slender ends

1193
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,460
To hold it even while tongue licked the flap

1194
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:58,720
Left forefinger and thumb pinching their end

1195
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,760
While right forefinger and thumb smoothed the damp seam

1196
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,260
Right forefinger and thumb twisting their end

1197
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:13,180
Robin, you got to stop Robin

1198
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,020
Before you wreck your love

1199
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,700
You got to stop Robin

1200
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,020
Wreck your love

1201
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,800
If you don't stop Robin

1202
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,800
You won't be green Robin no more

1203
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,260
You got to stop Robin boy

1204
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,260
You got black lung or something there

1205
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:45,720
Well you guys been frontin' for about four or five hours in the room now

1206
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,220
And you're gonna lose me when I call

00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,220
I'm gonna stop you when I call

1208
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:49,960
You got to stop Robin

1209
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:54,880
You and Lug is something that can't take that type of torment, anguish, pain

1210
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,600
Or that long, stiggy period of time

1211
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,500
So do you stop frothin' now son or

1212
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,360

00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,960
Well that's just, that's it

00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,940
You got to stop Robin

1215
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:08,080
Huh

00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,380
You got to stop Robin

1217
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:12,440
You got to stop Robin

1218
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,340
But you know what happens when you stop Robin

1219
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,640
Well then pretty soon you're gonna come down son

1220
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,280
To your old home

1221
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:17,420
Well then pretty soon you're gonna come down son

1222
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:17,420

You know what's gonna happen then

1224
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,500
You got to stop Robin

00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,060
You know what's gonna happen when you come down

You got to stop Robin

00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:31,940
You got to stop Robin

1228
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,340
Oh friends, that's the swinging love corpses

1229
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,720
The uncharacteristic song

1230
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,020
Got to stop frothin'

1231
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:42,120
Say mama come back now

Huh

1234
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,300
Got to stop Robin

1235
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,840
Got to stop Robin

Robin, Robin

1238
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,400
Got to stop Robin

1239
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,500
Yes that's Dr. Philo Drummond singing

1240
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,080
The Bob's Right Brain Man

1241
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,360
The co-founder of the Church of the Subgenius

1242
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:03,000
Now an obscure garage band bass player

1243
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,840
If you ain't frothin'

1244
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,000
But

1245
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:10,180
You got me whackin' it, Philo

1246
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:13,600
And after that we come to Pastor Bob Nankin

1247
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,140
Taking us out to the end of the show with his mighty hit

1248
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,280
Drankin' Robin

1249
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,580
But wiser

1250
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,460
Watchin' Bob on TV

1251
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,660
Swallowing red men

1252
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,080
The day my coon dog died

1253
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:37,020
Reading the pamphlet

1254
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,220
Over and over again

1255
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:46,780
I was drinkin' but wiser

1256
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:50,460
And Bob was on TV

1257
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,680
But David, my coon

1258
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:00,060
Good kick by a mule

1259
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:04,780
I was with Cousin Junior

1260
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:09,380
The DNA backfired

1261
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:13,720
I was drunk

1262
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,100
I was lonely

1263
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,060
I was plastered

1264
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:23,680
I was drinkin' but wiser

1265
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,420
And Bob was on TV

1266
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,300
Drankin' but wiser

1267
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:36,980
Watchin' Bob on TV

1268
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,320
Swallowing red men

1269
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,720
The day my coon dog died

1270
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,040
The day my coon dog died

1271
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,600
I was reading the pamphlet

1272
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,640
Over and over again

1273
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:01,000
I was drinkin' but wiser

1274
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,640
And Bob was on TV

1275
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:09,560
I was drinkin' but wiser

1276
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,620
And Bob was on TV

1277
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,200
Drankin' but wiser

1278
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:23,800
And Bob was on TV

1279
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:28,060
Drankin' but wiser

1280
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,500
And Bob was on TV

1281
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:29,660
Drankin' but wiser

1282
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:29,980
And Bob was on TV

1283
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:30,600
The last time I've seen him

1284
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:30,700
I was drinkin' but wiser

1285
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:30,700


1286
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:30,700


1287
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:30,700


1288
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:30,680
