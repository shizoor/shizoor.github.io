And now, the ssssss of Genius Hour of Swag!
And this episode,
hour of slack number 1,852,
is a rerun of number 852.
The third rerun in a row that I've done that way,
reruns that are all exactly 1,000 shows
or roughly 20 years old.
I'm going to keep doing it
until my current physical therapy kicks in and pays off.
My back slid downhill again from arthritis
and 50 years.
I'm having to spend a certain amount of my time
doing these very careful exercises again.
They worked before, though, and I never should have stopped.
It's just so time-consuming.
But the dogs insist on walking me.
Forever.
And I have many jobs for Bob
not related to this.
Damn show.
Anyway, back to 2002
and a detailed look into the Devo subgenius connection.
Little Neepy is still in Devo land.
And now, dear friends,
after the Devo convention or the devotional in Cleveland,
now it can be told we're all Devo.
And we all trade our weird-ass jobs.
Devo cover tune copies.
The one just heard was a Bach cover
by Mark Mothersbaugh and yours truly.
We have Occupant coming up, friends,
which will follow this mix
by Reverend Greg Cheetham.
People had to amuse themselves or die.
You know, spiritually die.
So that's why the particular,
kind of music came out of there.
It's like an inward, imaginative music.
You know, it obviously isn't,
it wasn't based on mainstream currents
or big beat hard rock and roll.
It was more like little clicks and whirs
and brainwaves.
Inward, imaginative music.
Little clicks and whirs.
Brainwaves.
Polyrhythmic experimental sound.
Not even real drums.
Just a crude forerunner of electronic drums
built by one of Mark's brothers.
You know, within the realm of music,
there were obviously influences from Bowie and Eno.
And even just more pure electronic composers.
Well, Hey!
Look,

You nervous?
Well, I kind of feel sorry for Jimmy.
Yeah, but you don't know the whole story.
He wasn't a nice guy.
What do you mean?
Let me tell you.
Jimmy's in a wheelchair.
And I don't care.
Jimmy's in a wheel chair.
And I don't care.
Jimmy's in a wheel chair.
And I don't care.
Jimmy's in a wheel chair.
Sorry man, I advise you two not to be slack.
This dog didn't beat him good
Like his pretty wife
Now the rough man gone
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care
Jimmy's in a wheelchair
He was the president
Of a company
He kept his workers poor
He lied and cheated and sneered
But with justice strikes
Every once in a while
He makes a bullseye hit
Every once in a while
He used to yell and scream
Till his son would cry
He used to spank his dog
But he don't spank no more
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

He got big and fell
And he was rising high
Making lies again
Trashin' others' lives
But with justice strikes
Every once in a while
He makes a bullseye hit
And trying to many things
He left a haha
Nyar
Jimmy's in a wheelchair you're covered
by Occupant.
Friends, if you need to know more about
Occupant, and you do, check out

Occupant.
You know how to
spell it.
Okay, here's the story.
But aren't you going to molest me some more?
Dr. Piper
Pop?
That's right, that's a good boy. Climb right up here on my lap.
Now bend over. I'm going to have to
give you a... Oh, boy! Can I have my
spanking? Where are you going? Come on, boys.
Come on out of here. Now I'm getting it all.
The doctor's going to give you a good spanking and teach you about
Planet X. We're just cannibal
apes.
And so,
the poor little
children were abused
and abandoned by the
evil doctor.
Left to their own devices,
there wasn't much left to eat but
rat meat and sundaes for the week.
Some of the little
boys resorted to crying, but
they knew they had to be bigger
than that. They had to
stand tough and swallow back
their tears.
Speaking of Devo,
there is a, um,
the third of the Devo
conventions.
Or, the devotional
2002
is coming up August 10th
all day on Saturday
at the
Starwood Center, Cleveland, Ohio.
Um, yes.
The, uh,
and that's, again, that's all day
August 10th. I
think there's, I'm sure
there's some kind of a charge for it. It's great.
I was at the last two, and
they've never been able
to get any of the Devo's out.
Yeah, they're, except the first,
from the very first order,
the earliest evolution, the first ones
to crawl out of the water,
Jim, Jungle Jim Mothersbaugh,
the little-known first drummer,
is, is there, will be there,
was there last time,
was actually a real funny guy,
and General Boy!
Yes, the progenitor and sire,
a friend and a brother, a monkey,
and a robot.

Wait a second! Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?
Nay, like most of your followers I was maimed building the great brewery.
Mechanical Man was covered by Occupant. That's Reverend Onan Canobite and Reverend Mitch.
And now, Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo has a little fun
with the best of the best.
The pinkest creature known to Bob.
In this case, the Drive Time Rock Station DJ.
I'm Bob Waugh. Time for the 5.30 phone call.
And today, we have Mark Mothersbaugh from Devo on the phone.
Hi, Mark.
Hi, Mighty Waugh.
How's Devo these days?
Oh, busy, busy. We just finished an album.
I don't know if you've heard it yet or not.
Yeah, we're playing it.
Oh, you're playing it?
Yeah.
Oh, good.
Well, then I'm gonna have to buy a radio.
Yeah, it's, uh, Shout is the name of the new record.
That's right. Um, actually, it's, uh, for us, it's a real interesting album because
this is the first one where we gave up total control and let someone else, uh, direct it for the first time.
Um, I don't know if you're familiar with the Church of the Subgenius,
uh, but I made friends with them in the last three or four years, became a reverend in the Church of the Subgenius,
and, uh, now, um, all, uh, Devo Incorporated is totally controlled by, uh, the Church of the Subgenius,
and, uh, Bob Dobbs, who is our spiritual leader, makes all the decisions now.
Uh-huh.
Well, actually, with a little help from Jimi Hendrix.
I see. Yeah, in fact, uh, you guys did a cover version of Are You Experienced on the new record, huh?
Yeah, um, it wasn't by choice, either.
This was another, uh, this is, was a surprise to me, too.
We, we actually hadn't planned on putting that song on the record.
We had a couple other songs.
We were going to put on, and, and we were in the studio, and it was late at night, and, and, uh,
who should appear in the room in this big purple, uh, gas cloud?
It really, it didn't smell very good. It had that sickening sweet smell of, uh, LSD.
Mm-hmm.
And, you know, I didn't recognize him at first, but it was Jimi Hendrix, and he chased us around the room.
It was.
Uh, he, he told us we had to record Are You Experienced. It wasn't by choice.
Well, that's a pretty tough, uh, order to follow.
It was a little bit of a challenge to say no to, I guess.
Well, actually, um, we were pretty happy with the way it came out, so we, we did use it on the record.
Now, what about these, uh, neon green Chinese-American friendship suits?
Oh, well, um, that, that's easy to explain.
In the last couple years since, uh, we put out, uh, Oh No, It's Devoe, we, we did five world tours and five albums and 22 videos all in about four and a half years.
And, uh, so about the end of the 82, we said,
Forget it. Forget it.
And we, we, um, we dropped out. We went underground and we got jobs at a fast food restaurant.
No.
Well, they were the outfits and they let us keep them.
Mm-hmm. I see.
They matched.
What have you been doing besides, uh, recording the new record?
You making any more movies or?
Well, as I said, we dropped out. Uh, we've grown our hair. Um, although that's computer hair you see in the photo.
We, we all have long hair now and we've kind of...
We had never, to tell you the truth, we didn't have time for drugs, uh, back in the, uh, prior to 1982.
And, and, well, we decided we'd experiment in the last couple years and things are a lot groovier and far, more far out for us than they've ever been before.
You guys took some time out to do, uh, a Devoe endorsement for Honda, I know. How was, how was that? Is that fun making commercials?
Well, Church of the Subgenius, once again, they, they, um, made us do it. It wasn't by our own hands.
Ah, I see.
Uh, it was alright. They, um, they, uh, they fed us, uh, at once every day and, you know, let us out at night. So it was okay.
Mark Mothersbaugh from Devoe is on the telephone at WLIR.
They were the Hondas of wrecked already, the Hondas they gave us.
Really? Two of them?
I have to tell you that.
Oh, um.
So you're in Garden City, right?
Yeah. Yeah, uh, in, on Long Island.
Actually, I know that. I'm, uh, you, you think I'm talking to you from Los Angeles, but in reality I'm in that phone booth at the 7-Eleven.
Oh, yeah, I know that one.
Yeah.
Uh, listen, Mark, I...
I'm just putting static noise over, so...
What I really want to know is, since this is an election year, what's the candidate that, uh, Devoe is collectively, uh, endorsing?
Well, to tell you the truth, uh, we're awful disappointed that, uh, Larry Flint dropped out of the running.
He had our vote, and, uh...
Uh-huh.
Um, he, you know, I, I don't, I don't know. I think, you know, you have no other choice.

Uh, you know, you...
There's really no way to vote, because Republican and Democrat, it's all the same at this point in time.
Well, you could still put him in on the, uh, the write-in ballot, I guess, you know.
Yeah, well, I think General Boy may, uh, get a few votes out of us. Other than that...
Um...
I, I don't know what, what to suggest.
Ugh!
Gag onto me with a spoon!
Malachi! It's high time I laid down a few commandments.
You got a chisel? Take this down.
Well, that's what I say, because that's what the word of Bob says.
I tell you, friend, there's no slack, there's no slack, there's no slack.
I tell you, in this world, in this flesh, in this devil, there's no slack!
And if you can't whoop it, go ye down, my friend. That's what I said. Go ye down!
There's nothing that says you can't. The devil don't have a rule book.
That's right, the devil, the devil does not have a rule book.
He is not humanistic, he is not pacifistic, and he owes you money, my friend.
That's right, the devil owes you money, and so does Uncle Sam.
You have to recognize the devil, just like you recognize Uncle Sam.
Now, I'm going down there to pay taxes. As far as I'm concerned, I might as well be paying taxes to the devil.
I'm sorry, but that's just the way things are. It's a test of faith!
And that's why God put the devil down here, to see if you could tell the difference between the devil and Uncle Sam.
Let there be slack.
My lord, the infidels on your back no longer believe in you. They say their prayers go unheeded.
Of course they're unheeded. How am I supposed to hear prayers coming from you?
They talk of war against the faithful. I beseech thee, rise up against them.
Smite someone who deserves it for once.
Malachi, every time I interfere, I only make things worse. You're best off solving your own problems.
But, but, metal lord...
What part of nay dothn't thou understand?
Armageddon! Who says that? I didn't.
I'm a man of the law.


Now, join me, Screamy-Temp Horde!
Do it!
We interrupt this program to give you a bulletin just received from one of our naval units of speed.
A large object traveling at supersonic speed is headed over the North Atlantic, towards the east coast of the United States.
Armageddon!
It's what we call a global killer. The end of mankind.
Doesn't matter where it hits. Nothing would survive, not even bacteria.
Armageddon!
Team, CX-MS is recommend... might recommend alert one.
The more you make a big deal out of denying something, the more people think it must be true.
You're on the air, Laurie.
If you read the Bible, Mark, you'd know that there won't be another thousand years.
Right now, we're in the middle of the war.
Everything in the last days is foretold in the book of Revel...
The last days? You mean the coming of the apocalypse, right? The rapture?
You only have to look at the signs. There are wars and rumors of wars...
Now, just so the rest of us know how much time is left, when is the rapture supposed to hit?
Exactly. Is it midnight New Year's Eve?
That's right.
Now, is that midnight L.A. time or Eastern Standard Time or what? I mean, what time zone has God in, anyway?
I pray for you all.
These people are nuts!
Skybird, this is Dropkick with a Red Dash Alpha message in two parts. Break.
Stand by for mind control...
Prepare yourselves for destruction!
You speak crazily, little boy.
The best way to take our minds off the smell of burning flesh is to begin tonight's karaoke contest.
I gotta sing a Doom song now.
Doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom.
Doom, doom, doom!
As I was saying, the universe is just doing what it wants.

Doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed.
Guess what, guys?
It's time to embrace the horror.
Look, we got fun road tickets to the end of the earth.
There's a 68.71% chance you're right.
That's the fact, yeah!
Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.
I think something is happening.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil.
No, no, no!
It's seen him!
Thou anointest my head with oil,
my cup runneth over,
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Let him run!
Fire!

Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy!
Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy!
Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy!
Shut up, you mouth!
All I'm saying is that there are some things beyond the can of mortal man
that shouldn't be tampered with.
We don't know everything, Andy.
There's plenty going on right now in the Twilight Zone
that we don't know anything about,
and I think we ought to stay clear.
See that the humans remain entertained until the end.
And...
Armageddon!

And now in the patriotic spirit, to continue that spirit, the Rainmakers with Government Cheese.
The table and the bills ain't paid, cause he's spending on cigarettes and PGA.
They'll turn us all into beggars cause they're easier to please.
They're feeding our people that Government Cheese.
Give a man free food and he'll figure out a way to steal more than he can eat.
Cause he doesn't have to pay.
Give a man free food and he'll figure out a way to steal more than he can eat.

It's the man in the White House, the man under the steeple.
Passing out drugs to the American people.
I don't believe in anything, nothing is free.
They're feeding our people that Government Cheese.

On a dead-end ride
And you'll climb in the back

Too goddamn lazy

And I'm hovering like a fly
Waiting for the windshield
On the freeway
That's too nihilistic for me, guys.
Oh, that's cool the way he does it.
Yeah, but that's nihilistic.
You know what I mean?
That's anti-chromatic.
That's re-fistulating.
That's totally imbibed I think, if it's not drunk already.
You're gripping onto the waves of life and riding forward as fast as you can, right?
You don't want to sink down into that gray, neutral nothingness of squared-off, murky plainness and ordinariness.
You want to dive for the heights and float down to the lowest lows.
And that means waiting for the windshield with a fly-by on the freeway.
Manic depressive waiting for the bus in the middle of the road.
The ups and downs of the number seven. The ups and downs of the crosstown B.
The ups and downs of getting on without the change, right? Getting up and down.
They didn't tell me to take those pills, but I didn't take them anyway.
I love you. I love you.
Let there be light!
Yippee!
I got it! I got it!
Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle.
But when you've made it to the verses and made sure it's clear, you're ready to read your mind.

Finding God, that's important, yeah.
But you know what might be a treat for everyone?
If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend Bender.
I don't know what to say, other than...
Absolutely not. Your loss is a tragedy, but our work is...
Come on, you guys have forever to look for God.
All I'm asking is one measly lifetime to find my friend.
He speaks out of love for his friend.
Perhaps that love in his heart is God.
Oh, how convenient.
A theory about God that doesn't require looking through a telescope.
Get back to work.

Guest friends Gachetto, Will Black performed at the devotional and that song All of Us,
believe it or not, is a really ancient Devo song before any of their albums came out.
And as we sign off for this week, The King.
As I walk through this wicked world Searching for light in the darkness of insanity
I ask myself Is all hope lost Is there only pain and hatred and misery
And each time I feel like this inside There's one thing I wanna know
What's so funny about this love and understanding
What's so funny about this love and understanding
And as I walk on Through troubled times
My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
So where I've gone And who I've trusted
And where is the heart
And where is the harmony
Sweet harmony
Cause each time I feel it slip away
Just makes me wanna cry
What's so funny about this love and understanding
Oh, what's so funny about this love and understanding
Is it just me or the world
Oh, what's so funny about this love and understanding


Who's the one that I trust
Is it just me or the world
Who's the one that I aim for
Is it my partner
Who slays the iron
Is it my constant
Who wants to절
I slaughtered it
Whalsoě
Who I cannot
Understand her
They're dead
All dead
Who would have known
Playing God could have
Such terrible consequences
Elvis did
What's so funny about
Peace, love, and understanding
And we have another classic
Costello song coming up
After Mark Mothersbaugh
Once again encounters
The Pink Boy
We've had a lot of Devo fans
Calling the radio station
All day long, Mark
So I have to ask you
When is Devo coming
To the New York area
And
When is Devo coming

And do you have any plans
To come by and do some gigs
Around here?
Yeah, we'll be going
Between Texas and L.A. though
For the next three months
We'll be
Hopefully we're going to
Make a video album
That's our plans
We're working with the church
Of the subgenius
They're located in Dallas
So we'll be flying
Back and forth
And we'll do an
Are you experienced video first
I don't know if it'll be
Out for Halloween
I think it'll be a week or two
After that
But then we'll do a video album
Between now and then
At the end of the year
And hopefully by
The first of the year
We'll be able to make
Definite plans
For a world tour
And probably start
On the east coast
Well good, alright
Well listen
Mark Mothersbaugh
Thank you very much
And good luck with the
New Devo album
Which is called Shout
Oh thank you Mighty Wah
Sure, yeah
Mark, before you go
Do you know what the station is
That dares to be different?
I sure do
W-I-O-I
Thank you Mark
I watch children
In the shine
In the light
Night
I'll do it
Anything my radio advised
With every one
Of those late night stations
Playing songs
Bringing tears to my eyes
I was seriously thinking
About hiding the receiver
When the switch broke
Cause it's old
They're saying things
That I can hardly believe
They really think
We're getting out of control
Radio is the sound salvation
Radio is cleaning up the nation
I'm a radio fan
They say you better listen
To the vice of reason
But they don't give you any choice
Cause they think that it's treason
So you had better do
As you were told
You better listen to the radio
I wanna bite the hand
That feeds me
I wanna bite that hand
So badly
So badly

I wanna make them wish
They'd never see me
Some of my friends
Sit around every evening
And they worry about
The times ahead
But everybody else
Is overwhelmed
By indifference
And the promise
Of an early bed
You either shut up
Or get cut out
They don't wanna hear about it
So many inches
On the reel to reel
And the radio
Is in the hands
Of such a lot of fools
Trying to ignore me
And euthanize the way
That you can feel
Radio is the sound salvation
Radio is cleaning up the nation
They say you better listen
To the vice of reason
They say they don't give you any choice
Cause they think that it's treason
So you had better do
As you were told
You better listen to the radio
Radio is the sound salvation
Radio is the sound salvation
Radio is the drum Chile
And recognition

And there's the Devo convention coming up also.
And a Devo the next day.
Devo convention here.
It's in August, right?
Mass baptism.
You said there was going to be a mass baptism in the middle of August, like August 15th?
Reverend Ivan Stang.
Hellfire preaching by Reverend Ivan Stang.
Dr. Katatan, again.
And Dr. Onan Kanobai.
He's coming out from Portland?
Yep.
Wow.
Yes.
It'll be good to see Onan.
He's a fellow rocketeer.
Yes.
He's a rocket man.
And a full-grown cannibal.
He's the oldest, youngest of genius doctors.
And St. Ann and Helen Hambaskin.
She rocked.
I thought she was right on the mark singing her songs.
I thought for once.
That's going to be August 11th at the Lime Spider.
Some sort of stardom level.
In Akron.
In Akron.
August 11th in Akron.
It's two weeks.

August 11th, 2007.
South Main Street.
Yeah, you could know about that.
Where the rubber meets the toads.
And the day before that here in Cleveland is the devotional.
2002.
At the Starwood Center.
712 East 185th Street.
What time is that?
There's going to be a mass baptism, isn't it?
At that event?
That's all day.
That's like all day Saturday.
A general boy.
Just head down to the Starwood Center.
All day long.
Will be there.
The sire, the progenitor of all the devos.
Jim.
John.
August 10th.
Jim Mothersbaugh.
And if it's like last year, there'll be home videos that Mark Mothersbaugh sends.
Well, this is Sunday.
I hope all the subgeniuses come out on a Sunday night.
After all, don't they all go to church on Sunday?
Pass the show.
Akron, man.
And have a big fat old chicken dinner underneath.
Rubber City.
Eight miles high.
And when you touch down.
You'll find that it's stranger than known.
Science in the streets.
That say where you're going.
Are somewhere just being their own.
Nowhere is there a walk to be found.
Unknown.
But most afraid of losing their ground.
Way, way down.
Known for its sound.
In places.
Small places.
And I.
What should I do?
My heart almost Ababeth Hijl.


How was I?



John.

Oh, um.
Who?
guitar solo
Down the stairs
A little storm
Some laughing
Some just shameless
Boys
Sidewalks
And black
Menaces
Some living
Some standing
Alone
