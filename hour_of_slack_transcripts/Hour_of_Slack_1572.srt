1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,680
It's time for Bob.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,300
Say, Bob, why the big smile this afternoon?

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,800
What's so special about today?

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,700
Well, there's nothing special.

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,640
The Self-Genius Hour of Slacker.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,140
Now we're rolling, Bob.

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,340
You're normally such a slacker. It's the first time you've heard of him.

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,760
Are all four of you guys in here? Is Phil in there?

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,680
He just, yeah, yeah.

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,080
Can we?

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,320
Doing with four?

12
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:24,960
Yeah, all four.

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,520
Okay.

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,060
What are we doing?

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,600
How do we, this is, this is.

16
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,460
Oh, the hour of slacker.

17
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,520
How about this is Phil, Phil, Pete, and Dave of the Firesign Theater.

18
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,220
This is Phil.

19
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:35,880
Phil.

20
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,420
Let's take it again.

21
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,500
Oh, Pete and Dave. Okay, there we go, yeah.

22
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,660
All right, you over here?

23
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,680
You just shut up.

24
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,000
This is Phil.

25
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,260
Phil.

26
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,760
Pete.

27
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,060
And Dave of the Firesign Theater.

28
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,580
And we're listening to the Hour of Slack.

29
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,600
Hack, hack, hack, hack.

30
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,320
Because we're subgeniuses.

31
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,640
And we're slacking off.

32
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,140
From PR News in Washington,

33
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,440
I'm among the top ten.

34
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,260
After yesterday's 12-hour tour de France,

35
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,120
the violence has resumed.

36
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,560
Beat them with baseball poles.

37
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,380
Fighting in eastern Ukraine is interfering with forged passports and resident cards

38
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,540
for gaining entry into the U.S.

39
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,880
At least 12 have already been destroyed.

40
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,660
Italian cyclist Vincenzo Nibali is being inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
Meanwhile, in Cupermento, California,

42
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,160
this is PR News in Washington.

43
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,660
We'll see you tomorrow.

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,300
Take care.

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,440
Bye.

46
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,540
Bye.

47
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,260
Everybody

48
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,160
The sardine can't ask a passing fish

49
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,360
If he has seen any sardines

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Carrots out of sight

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,720
They don't bark and they don't bite

52
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,440
They keep things loose

53
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,140
They keep things alive

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,080
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,860
Dancing in the moonlight

56
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,880
Everybody's feeling warm and bright

57
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,000
It's such a fine and natural sight

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,900
Everybody was dancing in the moon

59
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,000
Steve has a special box

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,420
In which he keeps the poisonous things he uses

61
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,960
Everybody

62
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:55,960


63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,420
Everybody

64
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,420


65
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,440
You're here, spoonful!

66
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:19,440


67
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:19,540
Look gegenÃ¼ber at here

68
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:19,540


69
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:19,540


70
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:19,540


71
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:19,540


72
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:19,540


73
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:19,540


74
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:19,780
Now have all of them

75
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:19,780


76
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:19,780


77
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:19,780


78
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:19,920
And familiar

79
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


80
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


82
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


83
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


84
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,300
What's true?

85
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,160
Put on the best fashion

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,220
Bob was growing up too.

90
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,720
He knew about the reproductive organs and nocturnal emissions.

91
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,320
He also knew about masturbation.

92
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,340
But he read that the problem was more mental than physical.

93
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,540
I'd like me some of them cream peas.

94
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,520
The princess is a creature of antiquity.

95
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,360
Ten million years at least in age.

96
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,820
They have made unkind comments about her.

97
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,120
And said that she was a spoiled brat.

98
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,700
Oh, yes.

99
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,620
She was getting up all the bandwidth with her Cleopatra movie.

100
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,200
And it would have been a disaster.

101
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,040
Cleopatra?

102
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,680
Yeah, she wanted to make a movie.

103
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,680
I didn't know about that.

104
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,660
Her and Brad Pitt and all their kids in it.

105
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,700
They're talking about Angelina Jolie.

106
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,140
That sounds like a disaster they're waiting to happen.

107
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,180
Look, I knew Cleopatra.

108
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,240
She didn't look anything like Angelina Jolie.

109
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,480
She looked just like Cleopatra.

110
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,740
She looked like Elizabeth Taylor.

111
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,320
We know what Cleopatra looked like.

112
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,080
A little bit like Claudette Colbert.

113
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,400
She was actually a little bit fleshier even than Elizabeth Taylor.

114
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,160
She was a well-fed person.

115
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,600
She was the dynastic ruler of Egypt.

116
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,560
Yeah, if you were well-fed.

117
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,880
Once her brother was put out of the way.

118
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,540
I knew you were rich.

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,560
She was actually Cleopatra VI of her line.

120
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,160
And she was essentially, let's be honest about this, an Alexandrian Greek.

121
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,260
Let's just be honest.

122
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,980
She was not a Coptic Egyptian.

123
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,960
She was a Ptolemaic.

124
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,220
Nor were the royal.

125
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,100
The royal house of Egypt.

126
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,240
That's right.

127
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,260
Other than Coptics.

128
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:22,900
They weren't Egyptian.

129
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,300
They weren't.

130
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,260
They weren't.

131
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:25,540
Greek.

132
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,140
The southern Africans, as has been portrayed in Eddie Murphy videos and others, they were Coptics.

133
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:45,040
They were a specific caste of people that exist today in the region which once comprised upper and lower Egypt.

134
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,780
The Twin Kingdoms.

135
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,780
This is Wikipedia.

136
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,100
Wikipedia.

137
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,460
Wikipedia.

138
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,320
Quit asking me to donate all the time.

139
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,880
Why does it want your hard-earned money?

140
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,000
I gave them some money and they're still bugging me.

141
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:07,400
And, of course, according to tradition and the lore of history, Cleopatra first seduced Julius Caesar before...

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,540
Before Mark Antony.

143
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,560
You know, that is as if Caesar himself had nothing to do with it.

144
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,160
Oh, Cleopatra was so sexy that she...

145
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,380
Yeah.

146
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,040
Yeah.

147
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,540
Yeah.

148
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:18,560
Yeah.

149
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:18,640
Yeah.

150
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:18,760
Yeah.

151
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:18,760


152
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:18,760


153
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:18,760


154
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:18,760


155
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:18,760


156
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:18,760


157
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:18,760


158
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:18,760


159
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:18,760


160
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,000
Just wrap them around her little finger.

161
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,180
The whole idea of her as some sexy seducer...

162
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,920
A sexpot.

163
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,460
...is Roman propaganda.

164
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,320
That's right.

165
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,100
They didn't like her and they were afraid that she would have a bad influence.

166
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,140
And she certainly did on Caesar and Antony and so on.

167
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,800
So they, you know, she's all now this Theda Bara-like character.

168
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,660
But actually she was an intellectual.

169
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,220
She was fun to shoot the...

170
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,160
...with.

171
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,780
Sitting around in Alexandria.

172
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:48,760
Sitting around in Alexandria.

173
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:48,760


174
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:48,760

00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:48,760

00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:48,760

00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:48,760


178
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,960

From PR News in Washington, I'm Don Business Number, another of other names in 13 states.

180
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,520
Secretary of State John Kerry says he is not.

181
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,940
Kerry says he's convinced he is not.

182
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,780
I think, and I do think...

183
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,880
...hearing a land of water and carbon emissions.

184
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,760
On Wall Street, the 7th of December, Senator Patrick introduced a measure today that would prohibit phone records...

185
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,780
...and internet data.

00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,480
...

194
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,820
...

195
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,060
...

196
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,060


197
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,060


198
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,220
...

199
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:38,260
...

200
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,640
...

201
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:38,640


202
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:38,920
...

203
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,040
...

204
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,240
...

205
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,820
...

206
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:48,820


207
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:48,820


208
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:48,820


209
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,380
...

210
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:03,620
They put my eyes inside your head.

211
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,180
And now I can't see your world.

212
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,620
And now I can't see your world.

213
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:08,620


214
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,620
I'm on the west now, sick of abyss Let me tell you the problem is

215
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,660
My bones are cold, you can leave me alone Now I'm on my own

216
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:30,000
There's a ghost in the machine And it's got the good on doing everything

217
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,960
Something has changed, I feel rearranged, slightly deranged

218
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:48,240
I'm going under the knife, I'm going under the knife, I'm going under the knife, estas hecho

219
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,440
You are the star

220
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,680
And then you took things too far

221
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,000
And now you've been replaced by the one who stole your fate

222
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,040
Now I'm on the run, I'm fine as bright as the sun

223
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,800
Controlled by zeros and ones

224
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,440
I'm set free now, as high as can be

225
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,760
As you see what I see

226
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,620
There's a ghost in the machine

227
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,800
It's got my turn on, damn near

228
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,660
I could think something has changed

229
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,900
I've been rearranged, slightly deranged

230
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,600
I'm going under the knife, I'm going under the knife

231
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,940
I'm going under the knife for you

232
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,060
I'm going under the knife, I'm going under the knife

233
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,400
I'm going under the knife, it's true

234
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,540
Just like you

235
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,040
There's a ghost in the machine

236
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,180
It's got my turn on, damn near

237
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,080
I could think something has changed

238
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,340
I've been rearranged, slightly deranged

239
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,020
I'm going under the knife, I'm going under the knife

240
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,300
I'm going under the knife for you

241
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,380
I'm going under the knife, I'm going under the knife

242
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,900
I'm gonna look just like you

243
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,780
I'm going under the knife, going under the knife for you

244
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:42,100
I was seated in the office and a great big buxom lady came in with a black veil drawn over her hat

245
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:50,720
and she came into the office and she said, my name is Frances Murphy. I said, yes, what can I do for

246
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,740
you? She said, it's what I can do for you and she threw the veil up and here was a great big brush,

247
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:05,760
a big beard. She said, I am a bearded lady. I said, so I observe. She said, I'd like a position.

248
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:13,640
I said, be very happy to use you. Miss Murphy, is it? She said, yes, I'm not married.

249
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:22,080
I had a very nice voice, very pleasant, but very, very hefty, about five foot eleven and must have

250
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,560
weighed at least two hundred pounds. So I employed Miss Murphy.

251
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:34,020
The station was a nice attraction, the bearded lady. After about eight or ten weeks, Miss Murphy was

252
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:42,260
downtown at the interchange at 42nd Street and the subway going from one station to another

253
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:49,040
and became involved with a couple of sailors. It ended up that it was a fight and Miss Murphy

254
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,640
slugged one of these sailors from the Brooklyn Navy Yard and knocked this poor guy cold.

255
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,720
Well, along came the next one. Miss Murphy was a very nice person. She said, I'm not married.

256
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,220
The transit authority police, they wanted to arrest Miss Murphy and she said, this man insulted me.

257
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,120
So they arrested the sailor. They took the sailor to the police headquarters

258
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:17,320
and also took Miss Frances Murphy down for fighting. And they locked them both up. I was

259
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,020
called at the hotel and I said, I'll come down in the morning. Well, when I went down that morning,

260
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,660
there was a lawyer from the naval base over in Brooklyn.

261
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:35,480
And this provost lawyer, whatever he was, came down to defend the sailor, which was quite natural.

262
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,540
So Miss Murphy didn't want a lawyer because this man had insulted her and had grabbed her,

263
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:49,860
done something to her, and she slugged him with a huge pocketbook. Well, the lawyer for the sailor

264
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:56,440
demanded that the court get a doctor and have Miss Murphy examined to see if there was any damage done.

265
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:05,040
Lo and behold, they took Miss Murphy out and came back with the announcement that Miss Murphy was a man and what a man.

266
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,340
So I said, Okay. So until then, after that, I'm going to go.

267
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:44,980
Oh my God!

268
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:44,980


269
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,200
I don't know what you're trying to say.

270
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,980
Oh my, I saw that.

271
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,420
That guy knows how to do it.

272
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,760
So, before the coup was back, she went to this place and they I and my wife had been needing help.

273
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:50,760


274
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,620
The man, I'm so afraid to talk because I'm not going to fight for them.

275
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,480
Well, but so good.

276
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,040
guitar solo

277
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,160
guitar solo

278
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,000
guitar solo

279
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,420
guitar solo

280
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,260
guitar solo

281
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,340
guitar solo

282
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,700
guitar solo

283
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,180
guitar solo

284
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,800
guitar solo

285
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:16,800
Hello?

286
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,260
Hello?

287
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,540
Hello?

288
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,360
Hello?

289
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,420
Hello?

290
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:24,800
Hello?

291
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:25,860
Hello?

292
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,780
Hello?

293
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,320
Hello?

294
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,680
How are you?

295
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,880
We're rocking out, baby.

296
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,980
We're rocking down.

297
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,640
We're rocking in the way and zooming in.

298
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,120
We're rocking to...

299
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,180
We're rocking to...

300
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,540
Rocking Jimmy Ryan.

301
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,820
Reverend Rocking Jimmy Ryan in the background.

302
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
And before that, Dave,

303
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,740
we just heard this little song called Iodine 131

304
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,400
by a little tiny band called Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

305
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,440
A song written and sang by Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

306
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,060
our special guest.

307
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,640
Wonderful.

308
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,320
For tonight only.

309
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,640
And probably the next night.

310
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,400
And so on and so on.

311
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,980
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

312
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,080
Well, personally, I'm glad to hear that

313
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,900
because I was just pointing out to a friend of mine

314
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,520
the logistics on the map of incarcerating

315
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,300
too many cubanophilios or whatever they're called,

316
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,880
the people who import the cigars without permission

317
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,160
from the State Department.

318
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,620
I know nothing.

319
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,680
I know nothing of the cigar importation.

320
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,700
Hmm.

321
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,220
It's a tempting offer.

322
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,860
It is tempting.

323
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,400
He's attempting an offer.

324
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,160
A-T-T-E-M-P-I-N.

325
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,300
I have to attempt to give the credits real quick, though.

326
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,060
Oh, okay.

327
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,560
Before Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

328
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,520
we heard a Jimmy Ryan instrumental piece

329
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,580
called Wowitzer.

330
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,760
The fellow talking about Miss Murphy,

331
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,780
the bearded lady,

332
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,720
that was Nate Eagle

333
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,140
reminiscing about his days as a carny operator.

334
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,540
The song Under the Knife

335
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,960
was by the Fantastic Plastics,

336
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,620
which you can look up on the...

337
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:26,800
on the internet.

338
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,380
PR News on our titles

339
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,240
or by Lemur.

340
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,740
We heard Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrummond

341
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,980
on the puzzling evidence on Cleopatra.

342
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,600
That's right.

343
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,120
That was Howell and Philo on Cleopatra.

344
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,720
I missed that one.

345
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,380
And that cover of Dancing in the Moonlight

346
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,220
was, of course,

347
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,520
the Rudy Schwartz project.

348
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,620
Or at least a projection of Rudy Schwartz

349
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,800
on a holographic design.

350
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,900
Yeah, I wish.

351
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,520
I wish.

352
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,240
Yeah.

353
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,440
Yeah.

354
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:56,620
Yeah.

355
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:56,880
I wish.

356
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,740
I wish.

357
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,160
I wish.

358
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,160


359
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,160


360
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,160


361
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,160


362
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,160


363
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,160


364
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,160


365
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,160


366
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,160


367
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,160


368
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,160


369
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,160


370
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,160


371
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,160


372
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,160


373
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,360
I'd like to project my body

374
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,140
into, like, ladies' locker rooms

375
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,840
and stuff like,

376
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,760
or project my...

377
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,020
not my image,

378
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,220
um,

379
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,640
my essence...

380
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,860
my essential being.

381
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,260
But you would project your essence

382
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,720
into women's locker rooms, Dave?

383
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,440
Yeah.

384
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,980
For voyeuristic purposes?

385
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,020
For voyeuristic purposes, yeah.

386
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,800
Now, you're saying just your spirit,

387
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,160
not...

388
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,840
you wouldn't want to do

389
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,420
the invisible boy routine

390
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,780
where you're really invisible

391
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,720
or you think you're invisible until the steam from the showers

392
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,420
makes you appear as a bubble with a handle.

393
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,960
Yeah, until the handcuffs go click, click, and the leg cuffs go clack, clack.

394
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,420
Right.

395
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,960
It seems to me that he just wants to do the voyeuristic part.

396
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,420
I just want a little sniff, you know.

397
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,300
I'm not interested in a hold on the gagglish or penumbra.

398
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm not sure I like where this is going.

399
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,180
I don't know exactly what you're doing, but...

400
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,140
I'm worried about where this conversation is going.

401
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,320
It might go in a sexist direction,

402
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:09,760
and, you know, it's bad to be of a sex or a gender,

403
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,620
a specific gender or anything, apparently.

404
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,920
Why do they have to have names like that?

405
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,600
Everybody's making such a big deal about it, and...

406
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,440
Well...

407
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,660
Why do they name themselves?

408
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,060
They name themselves after various sandwiches.

409
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,620
That's what I was concerned about.

410
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,340
Because I think that is definitely a downward crowd

411
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,700
as far as our Republican core values.

412
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,940
When people start naming themselves after, like, BLT...

413
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,400
Lettuce. Yeah, bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwiches.

414
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,780
And beef on rye.

415
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,680
I think we had a little bit of a dust-up

416
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,100
concerning who could take which sandwich into which restroom.

417
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,560
Right. Restroom.

418
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,220
The bacon was okay for one stall,

419
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,260
and the ham was okay for another stall,

420
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,080
but the pulled pork, of course, is going on in the men's room,

421
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,400
and it's not supposed to be happening in the ladies' room.

422
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,440
And I admire the restaurants who got around all that

423
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,220
by just taking the men or women signs down

424
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,880
and just saying, here's a bathroom.

425
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,000
You worry about it. You figure it out, tough guy.

426
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,400
Well, I'd like to ask Gwee as a personal favorite.

427
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,700
She has never used a men's urinal.

428
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,180
And if so, if she found it,

429
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,260
difficult or easy or, you know...

430
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,580
If I have tried to use a men's urinal?

431
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,580
Yes, in one of your crazy moods in your early days.

432
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,820
Hmm. Well, I...

433
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,680
You'd think you'd remember something like that.

434
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,440
Yes. Well, I am one of those few women that can actually do that,

435
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,380
but there are not very many women that can do that.

436
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,120
Yes. I have the skills, the mad skills.

437
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,120
You're not saying you've been one of those

438
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,320
lettuce, bacon, and tomatoes all this time, because...

439
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:51,940
No, I mean...

440
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,080
I wouldn't have known.

441
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,640
I was gifted with the power of...

442
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,320
I told you I didn't like where this was going.

443
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,160
I know you don't like the direction of this.

444
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,200
I don't like the direction of this.

445
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,360
I don't like where it's spraying.

446
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:07,520
I don't like the way or the distance that it is spraying.

447
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,300
Yes, but you mentioned pulled pork as a viable solution.

448
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,540
You were the one. You, you, you were the one.

449
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,280
We were talking about meat sandwiches, and that's all I meant.

450
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,660
It wasn't metaphorical or meteoric or anything.

451
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:21,940
Why is that?

452
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,240
I remember...

453
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,240


454
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,240


455
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,700
Metamorphic. It wasn't any of those.

456
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,760
Talk about loose meat sandwiches, then you're okay.

457
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,980
It was meat-aphorical. That's right.

458
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,720
Uh-huh. Meat-aphorical, yes.

459
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,060
And you were meeting out the words, right?

460
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,240
Yeah. Now I'm thinking about tacos.

461
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,820
Why is that? Oh, well.

462
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,160
It's the radio, friends.

463
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,820
Go ahead and envision anything you want.

464
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,280
They can't put you in jail for that yet.

465
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,340
But believe you me, if they could, they would,

466
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,240
because putting you in jail makes a lot of money,

467
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,240
for somebody, off of the rest of us.

468
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,520
The owners of the prison, because all prisons are privatized right now.

469
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,440
This goes back to the days of Joseph McCarthy,

470
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,460
who was a famed insolent from the land of the badgers.

471
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,520
I think he was a Minnesota senator,

472
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,820
or one of those whale walkers,

473
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,060
who divined and designed a power,

474
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,400
and this at least was in his own mind,

475
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,500
to tell who was a communist,

476
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,460
who was a communist,

477
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,680
and who was a healthy,

478
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,600
a wealthy, whelpingling.

479
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,160
Well, yeah.

480
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,800
You can tell by close study of people's stool,

481
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,460
what their political treachery might be.

482
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,700
We explained that last week on the show.

483
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,460
Yeah, that was well worth explaining too,

484
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,460
because a lot of people cannot divine different parties,

485
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,360
political parties from stool.

486
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,640
They're all the same, man.

487
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,640
A two party system, it's just a rip off.

488
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,500
They're all exactly the same.

489
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:49,680
It's just a red tape.

490
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,760
Yeah, no.

491
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:52,740
.

492
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,100
There are more,

493
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,380
there are juicier,

494
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,420
and more intellectual topics we could do.

495
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,400
Mm hmm.

496
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,100
That really, juicy would hopin'.

497
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,720
Well, I'm looking at the news page

498
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,180
on the little web screen

499
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,420
in front of me at the studio,

500
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,360
and the headline caught my eye above all the

501
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,040
other ones was,

502
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,480
Crocodiles can kill a!

503
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,520
snatches woman night swimmer

504
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,560
34 minutes ago in Australia.

505
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,680
Well, that could happen.

506
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,260
Why would you go swimming at midnight

507
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,460
in Australia when you know

508
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,820
there were crocs about?

509
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,760
Well, you don't necessarily know

510
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,560
there's crocs about,

511
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,900
but what made me interested

512
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,680
was the fact that it was a monster story.

513
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,780
It's not a monster until a woman is snatched

514
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,920
or a human.

515
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,600
Right.

516
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,640
Then the plain ordinary animal

517
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,120
becomes a monster.

518
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,040
Right.

519
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,220
The same thing happens in Florida

520
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,480
when it becomes a new story.

521
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,840
Four-year-old boy becomes a six-year-old boy

522
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,000
at a barbecue and is eaten by an alligator

523
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,220
or at least asked out to dinner or something.

524
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,740
There was a, well, just this very day,

525
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,200
there was a very sad news story

526
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,200
about the Cincinnati Zoo

527
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,880
and an unlucky man

528
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,160
who was killed by a male gorilla.

529
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,900
That was a horrible story.

530
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,420
Why did they have to kill the gorilla?

531
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,660
Why didn't they just soften his tumors

532
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,780
with a rabid plug?

533
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,460
It didn't work that fast.

534
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,420
That's the thing.

535
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,880
Many people have asked that

536
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,340
because they didn't read the article,

537
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,920
but if they had read further down,

538
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,200
they would have seen that they couldn't.

539
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,720
Those tranquilizer guns

540
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,540
don't work that fast.

541
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,920
When you hit an animal with it,

542
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,460
all it does is make them mad

543
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,860
for a while.

544
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,500
Right.

545
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,200
Then they get sleepy.

546
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,180
But before the gorilla fell asleep

547
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,520
and fell on top of the scamp,

548
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,700
the little scamp,

549
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,480
it might have gotten a little irritated

550
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,440
and smashed the kid's head against the wall

551
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,760
or something like he would do

552
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,660
to an infant gorilla child

553
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,080
if he got upset.

554
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,240
A little perturbed.

555
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:10,620
Yeah.

556
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,900
And of course, needless to say,

557
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,920
the comments were all about

558
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,060
blame the parents,

559
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,180
the evil parents,

560
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,040
who let the kid do that.

561
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,120
But, you know,

562
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,820
I've been a parent of a four-year-old boy.

563
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,880
They're faster than you can imagine.

564
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,900
They're faster than a male gorilla.

565
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,680
They probably scared the daylights

566
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,420
out of that gorilla.

567
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,120
Yes.

568
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,740
And now the gorilla...

569
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,460
But somebody pointed out,

570
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,940
why'd they shoot the gorilla?

571
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,520
They could have made a million dollars,

572
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,120
you say, sponsoring a hunt.

573
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,260
Like, have a hunt.

574
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,420
People could, you know,

575
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,420
like a bid on hunting a gorilla.

576
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,040
People are really,

577
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,720
really stupid.

578
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,120
People are actually animals.

579
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,440
And they're very, very dangerous,

580
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,680
dangerous animals.

581
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,580
Even four-year-old boys are dangerous.

582
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,160
Gorillas are dangerous.

583
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,860
Moms and dads are dangerous.

584
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,280
The cars they drive are dangerous.

585
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,120
The diseases they get are dangerous.

586
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,320
And everyone is going to die.

587
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,100
And the most dangerous of them all,

588
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,000
from a recent news,

589
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,020
is the one that I'm going to tell you about.

590
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,580
It's a very, very tragic news story here

591
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,680
that was very tragic.

592
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,120
And I don't want to go into it

593
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,620
just because of the tragedy of it.

594
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,120
It involved a child.

595
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,560
The child was not officially with the law,

596
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,280
so to speak.

597
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,160
He was breaking the law a little teeny bit.

598
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,160
And he died as a consequence

599
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,580
of not being extra careful.

600
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,700
And there was an idiot on the news web,

601
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,360
on the page,

602
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,300
who kept on writing his opinions,

603
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,980
blaming it on the news,

604
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,520
and the child being godless.

605
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,040
And his parents weren't good Christians.

606
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,980
Well, no, I would just blame it flat on God.

607
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,840
God, that kid wouldn't die unless God wanted him dead.

608
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,240
That's the way it goes, kids.

609
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,780
Sorry, parents, moms, dads,

610
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,420
people afflicted with illness and horror and tragedy.

611
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,560
It must have been God's will, right?

612
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,520
God's will or won't, I don't know.

613
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,200
Oh, but except that when it's not God's will,

614
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,640
then it's free will and it's your fault.

615
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,280
And he is going, he's not gonna forget it,

616
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,660
because gods don't forget.

617
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,280
They're like elephants, only smarter.

618
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,500
Yeah, and there's many different kinds.

619
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,460
There's gods of air, wind, and fire.

620
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,820
No, there's only one, and he's got a beard.

621
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,740
I've seen a picture of him when I was a little boy.

622
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,600
Well, sometimes he does shave.

623
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,280
He has a necklace that he wears around his armpits

624
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,300
that has his room number

625
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,740
and a few violent documents that he carries.

626
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,760
Never mind, I'm sorry.

627
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,060
But you know what weirded me out

628
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,600
about the pictures of God that I would see as a child?

629
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,120
He was wearing, well, no, sometimes he's real jolly looking,

630
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,940
but he was wearing a dress.

631
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,080
He wasn't wearing pants.

632
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,980
No, long, cascading robe.

633
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,260
He was wearing a big, long bathrobe, like a robe,

634
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,340
you know, like a, and he had long hair like a girl.

635
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,420
It's like, that's what my grandson says to me.

636
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,020
D-Dawg, you have long hair like a girl.

637
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,220
And I go, yeah, it's like a beautiful girl,

638
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,300
a beautiful, beautiful girl.

639
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,320
And then I whip him with my ponytail.

640
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,200
Yes, he does.

641
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,000
It's true.

642
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,580
I witnessed this many times, folks.

643
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,340
Yeah, he loves it.

644
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,580
He does it just to get whipped with a ponytail.

645
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,280
Might I ask if I could just leave the disposition

646
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,920
for a very few seconds to close my windows?

647
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,620
Oh, please do.

648
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,500
Please, please.

649
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,160
So I won't have to, you know.

650
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,280
It must have started raining.

651
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,800
Oh, but of course, Dave.

652
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,820
Close your windows.

653
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,500
Okay, well, Dave goes to close his windows,

654
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,440
which are not here in the studios of WCSB Cleveland

655
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,940
from whence we broadcast the show.

656
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,400
I'm going now.

657
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,000
Although you may not be listening to it

658
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,020
on that station at this time.

659
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:52,460
No.

660
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,140
And all the news we say might be old.

661
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,020
In fact, it is for most people.

662
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,440
This is Time Control in Action.

663
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,380
And for that matter, I'm old.

664
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,940
It's Time Control in Action.

665
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,240
This radio show is Time Control in Action.

666
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,020
Oh, well, yeah, sure.

667
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:11,720
You see?

668
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,660
Well, you're playing music and stuff

669
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,480
that somebody recorded a long time ago.

670
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,980
Exactly.

671
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,940
And the particular show is even more time-controlly

672
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,580
because it's played back on other stations at another time.

673
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,520
And it's on the Internet, so you can download it

674
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,040
and like that for free.

675
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,960
It's still free.

676
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,140
Boy, I get so many people saying,

677
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,740
Reverend Sand, you ought to monetize Hour of Slack.

678
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,400
You know, have people pay a dollar to hear it on the Internet.

679
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,140
And I'm sure that I would still get about 20 bucks a month

680
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:42,980
from contributors.

681
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,400
But instead of having a thousand listeners,

682
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,840
per second, we'd have 20.

683
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,420
The same ones that pay now, voluntarily,

684
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,720
would be the same ones that would involuntarily do so.

685
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,880
So that's why I say don't do so, Robinson Crusoe.

686
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,920
Sounds like it would be six and a half dozen of the other.

687
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,760
Right, exactly.

688
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,460
So, Dave, you know, the reason I played Iodine 131

689
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,740
was when I called Dave earlier today,

690
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,160
or he called me and told me he wasn't dead anymore.

691
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,480
Thank goodness.

692
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,180
He mentioned that somebody wanted to put Iodine 131, Dave's song,

693
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,800
on YouTube, and Dave wondered if that would mean that YouTube owned his song.

694
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,000
And I would hope not, because that would mean YouTube owns all songs.

695
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,740
Right.

696
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,380
And I don't think that's the case.

697
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,480
I don't think that's the case either.

698
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,800
In case they've spanked my little...

699
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,640
They've whacked my little tiny hand

700
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,440
for...

701
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,360
I think they were using Kenny Loggins on Bob's Lunch Hour, our short subject.

702
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,160
Yes, they did.

703
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,460
They took it away from us.

704
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,260
They did that rudely.

705
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,820
They made it a silent movie.

706
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,160
It had been shot as a silent movie, actually.

707
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,700
That's Bob's Lunch Hour.

708
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,740
Type it in, kids.

709
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,860
Bob's Lunch Hour.

710
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:05,140
If you would like to see a movie starring Dr. Philo Drummond as J.R. Bob Dobbs

711
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,580
that was 30 years in the making.

712
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,740
We shot the first part of it in 1977, I think.

713
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,420
Mm-hmm.

714
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,420
Maybe even 77.

715
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,140
Maybe even 77.

716
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,600
And then we finished it in 2006.

717
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,880
30 years in the making.

718
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:20,880
How many years?

719
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,620
And Philo ages 30 years during the course of Bob's Lunch Hour.

720
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,460
33-oh.

721
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,440
And you can see it.

722
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:32,440
And it's also got two really good covers of that Kenny Loggins song just dropped in.

723
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,840
Yes.

724
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,100
To see what condition my condition was.

725
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,400
Yeah.

726
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,380
The heavy metal version is really good.

727
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:38,980
Oh, yeah.

728
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,440
That comes on when you first see the old Philo.

729
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,420
Oh, yeah.

730
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,580
I like it.

731
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:44,980
I like it.

732
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,740
It's heavy.

733
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,320
It's heavy.

734
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,000
You just have to check it out.

735
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,600
It really is.

736
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,040
It's cosmic.

737
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,460
That's on the YouTube channel known as RevStang.

738
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:54,940
One word.

739
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,840
RevStang.

740
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,080
Yeah.

741
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,660
YouTube slash user slash RevStang.

742
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,960
And you'll see bug porn.

743
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:07,680
I've got the biggest collection of bug porn on my YouTube channel, YouTube channel that

744
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,160
you'll ever see outside of RedTube or PinkTube.

745
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,460
But she is such a beautiful thing.

746
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:12,560
She's the bug porn.

747
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,380
Or ex hamster.

748
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,520
That is so true.

749
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,800
The mosquito, the larvae are lovely.

750
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:24,000
There are many, many times of the week when you cannot do anything but sit back and witness

751
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,340
the wonders.

752
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,900
And among the bug porn on the RevStang YouTube channel, there's also Dave porn, Lonesome

753
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:39,880
Cowboy Dave music videos with that political song, The President's On The Phone, which

754
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,380
Which wasn't about the current president, but a previous one.

755
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,480
And what else?

756
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,580
I don't think we made a music video.

757
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,100
The current president's mommy is non-existent.

758
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,280
Didn't the current president's mommy die?

759
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,780
Or is she alive?

760
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,300
I think they're all dead.

761
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:07,120
You know, this has been a cool bummer kind of a weekend, as Philo called it.

762
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:13,060
Because, I don't know if you knew this, but our fellow sub-genius minister, Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh,

763
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:20,420
who has made good, an Akron boy who made good, if you want to call fame and riches good,

764
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:30,780
he has a big art show that opened up this weekend at the Museum of Modern Art in Cleveland,

765
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,200
and also at a museum in Akron.

766
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,340
But his dad died a week ago.

767
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,260
Oh!

768
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,300
Yes.

769
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:45,460
And which makes it, it's like a cool, that's why, as Philo said, it's a bummer, but it's a cool bummer.

770
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,840
It's mostly a bummer.

771
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,360
Yeah.

772
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,080
Well, but the art show would be cool.

773
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:56,860
In fact, Princess, we and I would have gone to the opening party of that the other night,

774
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,320
except we were too tired, because we'd been in Akron all day long,

775
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,100
hiking the Gorge Trail at Gorge Metro Park,

776
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,580
which...

777
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,600
Looks like dinosaurs should be living in it.

778
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,300
Little skinny dinosaurs.

779
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,020
Sounded like this.

780
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:19,640
And I would recommend that to anybody who likes to walk on roots and rocks and clamber.

781
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,320
That's probably not most sub-geniuses.

782
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:33,440
It took me 20 years of X days to get a dozen sub-geniuses to get off their butts for 10 minutes,

783
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,240
leave the road and go into the woods.

784
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,100
The streets.

785
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,600
Scary woods.

786
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,320
For 10 minutes.

787
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,540
It took me 20 years to get them to do that.

788
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,100
That's true.

789
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,580
And they'll never do it again.

790
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,240
That is true.

791
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,040
It was too scary.

792
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,420
All true.

793
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,680
What's the dinosaur joke?

794
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,960
And Bob got away anyway.

795
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:51,620
Yep.

796
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,240
There's a dinosaur joke, isn't there, where the punchline is,

797
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,860
the T is silent.

798
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,920
Have you ever heard that?

799
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,440
The what?

800
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,560
The punchline.

801
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,140
The T is silent.

802
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,920
I think it was triceratops.

803
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,960
No, but it must have been pterodactyl, because isn't there a...

804
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,060
There's a P.

805
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,240
P.

806
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:09,980
The P is silent.

807
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,440
Pterodactyl.

808
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,280
Pterodactyl.

809
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,660
Pterodactyl.

810
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:11,920
Pterodactyl.

811
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,460
And then that's urinating.

812
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:12,820
Urinating.

813
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,440
That's right.

814
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,160
Why do pterodactyls urinate?

815
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,700
Because the P is silent.

816
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,160
Or something like that.

817
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,540
I don't know either, but I heard it's a real joke and I forget the punchline.

818
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,120
That's a tricky one.

819
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,720
I think you had to have been there, man.

820
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,540
I was there, I think.

821
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,180
But that wasn't the problem.

822
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,920
The problem was with Savoir.

823
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,560
Or with the bear.

824
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,080
Understanding.

825
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,260
Conditioning.

826
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,980
We're not allowed to mention bears in our religion anymore.

827
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,420
For as it says here...

828
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,680
By the way, the music in the background was rural war room Soviet life.

829
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,020
And now the music in the background is Einstein's Secret Orchestra Witch Disco.

830
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,500
Oh, wow.

831
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:04,720
But as Epictetus said, or Epictetus, or whatever that nose picker's name was,

832
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,500
he said,

833
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,480
He said,

834
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,040
He said,

835
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,700
He said,

836
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,600
He said,

837
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,340
He said,

838
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,700
He said,

839
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,040
He said,

840
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,760
He said,

841
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,640
He said,

842
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:37,860


843
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:43,880
He said,

844
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,940
He said,

845
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,700
And he was just,

846
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,260
All of a sudden,

847
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:53,260


848
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:53,460
He Pierre Plazaæ˜Ÿ North.

849
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,220
It would splenne seconds on the create

850
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,100
The spaceships that were looking

851
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,040
At this was all schooling,

852
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,180
Was it BÃ®koÅ¡?

853
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,900
Was it also people called BainÃ³s?

854
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:07,020


855
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,560
You guys are fluffing my squat dingles.

856
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:17,280
Okay, basically, Epictetus is saying, cease your desire and you will be free.

857
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:17,860
Stop.

858
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:18,740
Stop.

859
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:24,240
You must not allow yourself any inclination towards the attainments of others.

860
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,400
Quit some of them and for the present, postpone the rest.

861
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:34,400
And you will fail if you want to have that which is of others and is not of yours.

862
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:42,680
But things within your power are opinion, aim, desire, aversion, and whatever.

863
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,180
It still doesn't.

864
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:49,320
Yeah, it sounds like yogi aphorisms, the forms of Patanjali.

865
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,760
Well, life is...

866
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,300
All this lusting after stuff will cause you trouble.

867
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,480
Just forget about it.

868
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,900
Well, the Buddha said that life is suffering.

869
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,760
That's what, you know, that's all.

870
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,080
Now, Bob, on the other hand,

871
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:09,240
said life is slack, but that's easy for him to say because it was Bob talking.

872
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:09,840
Right.

873
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,860
Yeah, because he has slack.

874
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,260
Consider the source, man.

875
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:19,540
Yeah, so why am I reading quotes from Epictetus when I could be reading quotes from Bob, such as...

876
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:19,860
Why indeed?

877
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,600
Let's see.

878
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,680
What did Bob...

879
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,140
What's the latest thing Bob said?

880
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,340
What did Bob say?

881
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,800
Everything comes apart one way or another, and some ways are fun.

882
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:32,560
Fun.

883
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,920
Oh, no, here's what Bob said.

884
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,800
I quoted this on the show once before.

885
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,800
No more penis candling for me.

886
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:49,980
Ow.

887
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,360
And I don't even have one.

888
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,600
It's time to melt the wax.

889
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,420
No, no.

890
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,620
Bob also said all gods are overrated, but then that's what makes them gods in the first place.

891
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,680
Is overrating.

892
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,240
That's correct.

893
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,980
That is a beautiful truth.

894
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,580
That's our Bob.

895
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:09,760
He's beautiful.

896
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,000
Well, what are demi-urges?

897
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,260
If gods are just unreasonable quantum, then what are demi-urges?

898
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,280
Oh, what now?

899
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:18,940
Demi-urges?

900
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,380
They have medicine for that.

901
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:25,740
Is that like a glade or a demi-glass or a demi-cache?

902
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,360
Demi-urges.

903
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,440
That's a fancy...

904
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,660
Yeah, those aren't the same as gods, are they?

905
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:32,980
Not quite.

906
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,400
They're like sub-gods?

907
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,660
Yeah, they're like demonic.

908
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,920
They're just forces that have personified.

909
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,400
There are many me's of gods.

910
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,880
Uh, fuck.

911
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:49,880
Yes.

912
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,460
On the original Fantasy Island, the smaller character was known as Tatooie.

913
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:58,360
Tatooie?

914
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:59,400
Tatooie.

915
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:00,860
Tatooie.

916
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:00,940
Tatooie.

917
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:01,900
Tatooie.

918
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,340
Tatooie.

919
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:04,520
Tatooie.

920
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,100
Like when he goes...

921
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,020
That wasn't him.

922
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,380
That was one of his characteristics.

923
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,140
And an urgent.

924
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:14,860
I know nothing.

925
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,820
I know nothing.

926
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,520
Ah.

927
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,380
Ah.

928
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:22,960
Pull up job.

929
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,160
My land.

930
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,580
So I've got an uncontrollable demi-urge.

931
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:33,060
And the show is still continuing, right?

932
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:33,940
At this very moment?

933
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,060
Yeah.

934
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,380
The Mark Mothersbaugh art show.

935
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,320
The Mark Mothersbaugh art show goes on through August.

936
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:46,800
You know, I was reading some of the catalog descriptions in that.

937
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:57,100
I was thinking at one point there was a little art show of those Devo Power Dome hats.

938
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:58,560
Oh, yeah.

939
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:07,660
And in the catalog, it described it as Mothersbaugh-inspired dress wear or something like that.

940
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:14,640
And I thought to myself, is Jerry Casale going to just explode when he reads that?

941
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,880
Because, I don't know.

942
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,900
I don't know.

943
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,220
I don't know.

944
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:27,900
But I do know that both at the Mocha Art Gallery

945
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:28,540
and at the Mothersbaugh Art Gallery,

946
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:34,000
and at the Akron Art Museum, that Mothersbaugh show goes on through August 28th.

947
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,880
Yeah, a couple of months.

948
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:35,420
Yes.

949
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:41,660
And there's a giant $40 book out about how Mark Mothersbaugh is the god of art.

950
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,380
Yes.

951
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:46,800
And again, I'm just thinking, man, Casale and the other Devo guys,

952
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,140
it's just biting their tongues, I guess.

953
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,540
I'm not saying Mark hasn't done tons of great stuff.

954
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,380
I agree with you.

955
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,080
He has actually done tons.

956
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,560
Really, really cool art.

957
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,280
And by tons, I mean tons.

958
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,700
There's something like 30,000 little postcards that he drew.

959
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,660
There's one that's probably got a picture of me on it in there.

960
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,560
I'm serious.

961
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,820
Because he'd just whip them out.

962
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,340
That's what he did instead of drugs.

963
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,940
Can you believe what a screwed up person he must be?

964
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,960
Instead of everybody else is going, well, the show's over.

965
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,340
I'm going to go drink me a beer.

966
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,200
Smoke me one of them frappa zippa sticks.

967
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,740
But not Mark.

968
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:28,360
He would go hide in his hotel room and draw pictures and then do the groupies.

969
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,120
He'd draw pictures on the groupies and then on his postcards while the groupies slept.

970
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,540
What a loser.

971
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:35,580
No.

972
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:40,220
So now he's got this giant art show of all those postcards he drew for the last 40 years.

973
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,580
Not a loser.

974
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:42,460
Sorry.

975
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,700
Do I have a stack of 30 postcards?

976
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:44,900
No.

977
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,440
What do I have to show for my life?

978
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,120
1,572 hours of slack.

979
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:50,720
And that's it.

980
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,060
That's it.

981
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,520
A couple of little funny books.

982
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,360
Books, movies.

983
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,460
A couple of funny books.

984
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:56,820
Videos.

985
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,900
A couple of little underground.

986
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,680
You know, porno movies and things.

987
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,380
Very, very underground.

988
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,060
But, you know, I'm not jealous.

989
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:07,700
I tell you aren't.

990
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,020
You must yourself deprecate.

991
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,700
Actually, it's funny.

992
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:18,440
It's actually really funny because in, well, it's in funny, it's kind of tragic for me.

993
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,800
But around 1984, I was staying at Mark Butterspaugh's house.

994
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,120
Can you believe it?

995
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,180
I was working on a Devo video.

996
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,820
Working on the RU.

997
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,900
You experienced a censored Devo video.

998
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,760
Censored by the Hendrix estate.

999
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,540
Made Jamie Hendrix rot in somewhere.

1000
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:48,940
But, and at that time, the Church of the Subgenius, surprisingly, was considered to be an art project.

1001
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,200
Little did they know.

1002
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,420
But Mark said to me, and I quote,

1003
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,080
If you can help me get my art rep back, boy, that would be great.

1004
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,540
Because at the time, he was just a rock star.

1005
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,980
And we were like the artistes because we weren't famous.

1006
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,400
But obviously, let's face it, you know, now I could say to Mark,

1007
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,400
Man, it sure would be great if you get me my rock star status back.

1008
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:20,440
For you to help me get my, because I got, my art status is fine.

1009
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,660
I got that in 1984 and it doesn't taste good even with ketchup.

1010
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,000
As my old boss said about film.

1011
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:28,340
Film awards.

1012
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:34,600
And, but I would love to have that, that fame.

1013
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:42,200
On the other hand, I never did learn how to play musical instruments or draw or do anything useful like that.

1014
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,480
No, you were just a pest to large numbers of people.

1015
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,500
You'd fill an auditorium and bother them.

1016
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,300
You'd vex them.

1017
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,620
No, I didn't fill an auditorium.

1018
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,020
Well, you came close a few times.

1019
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,380
No, no, no.

1020
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,720
We came close to standing room only.

1021
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,320
Only at some bars that were about the size of your bedroom.

1022
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,400
But that's, you know, we never were.

1023
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:13,380
The biggest crowd that I ever had was outside the Republican National Convention in Dallas on August 21st, 1984.

1024
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,980
It's easy for me to remember because it was my birthday.

1025
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,580
And I was on the rock against Reagan State.

1026
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,380
I already bragged about this.

1027
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,180
That was the biggest crowd we ever had.

1028
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,140
It was about 800 people.

1029
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,060
That was all the protesters that came to protest.

1030
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:35,580
That could make it, that could survive the protesters encampment, which they had in the sun next to the jail.

1031
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,520
They didn't have like the dissidents factories like they do now.

1032
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:44,640
Oh, I can't wait for, I can't wait for the Republican National Convention here in Cleveland.

1033
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:54,020
I just read that it's, they just declared it illegal to carry fake guns around that convention.

1034
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,700
But it's, but you can carry your legal guns.

1035
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,460
You can't carry weapon.

1036
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,520
You're, you're, if you're legally allowed to carry a weapon, you can.

1037
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,160
But if you carry a fake weapon, they'll kill you.

1038
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,180
Yeah, they'll kill you.

1039
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:16,840
You know, people in Cleveland, they've made, yeah, they've made sure real good and sure people know what's going to happen if you, yeah.

1040
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:17,840
Oh, yeah.

1041
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,480
You don't mess with the.

1042
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,540
Very turny, turnabout.

1043
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:27,660
Well, you know, actually, I almost saw a guy get killed in San Francisco.

1044
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,320
And he wasn't a young black kid.

1045
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:40,280
He was a young white teenager walking around outside a subgenius show in San Francisco with a very authentic looking replica machine gun.

1046
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:52,380
And because a man had gone berserk with a real machine gun in San Francisco the week before, that young man almost died right there outside that Bob show.

1047
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:57,000
But luckily, the great subgenius G. Gordon Gordon, who's an older fellow.

1048
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,800
He calmed the cop down and talked him out of busting the kid.

1049
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,680
And everybody was calm.

1050
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,900
And the whole time G. Gordon Gordon was talking to that cop, he had a big loaded handgun in his pocket that was for real.

1051
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,660
He was Bob's bodyguard.

1052
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,780
You know what happened that night?

1053
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,120
Bob got shot.

1054
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:15,900
Yeah.

1055
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,120
But not by a stranger, by puzzling evidence.

1056
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,940
So there you go.

1057
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:20,420
Wow.

1058
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,380
What you gonna do?

1059
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:27,080
It's just irony laid on top of bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches.

1060
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:27,460
Imagine.

1061
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:36,480
It's just irony laying on top of Cleopatra in between Hal and Philo while they double team.

1062
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,380
And layers is more irony.

1063
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,180
Yeah.

1064
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:38,640
Well.

1065
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,120
Yeah.

1066
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:43,780
They're all clover leaf packed off bottom booties just to boot with.

1067
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:44,620
Yeah.

1068
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,300
Well, not really, I suppose.

1069
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:52,000
But, you know, behind the cloak door, behind the cloven hoof or whatever the shoe size is.

1070
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:57,280
You know, on the way over here, I was saying to Princess Wee, I worry sometimes that our show sounds like, you know,

1071
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,200
just some people having a phone conversation.

1072
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,980
And she said, no, no, it doesn't sound anything like that.

1073
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,560
It sounds like some guys talking who really talk crazy.

1074
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,160
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

1075
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:10,000
It sounds like a couple of psychotics in a welfare ward.

1076
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,680
A couple of people in Ward 5.

1077
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,740
Round up tightly.

1078
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,340
Long, long time ago.

1079
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,980
Yee-haw, yee-haw, yee-haw, yee-haw.

1080
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,920
I'm just trying on a brassiere.

1081
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,100
I just can't stop singing whenever I do that.

1082
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,060
I've seen that happen.

1083
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,560
You just warble.

1084
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:37,580
When you try to get that new bra, then you go to warbling and warbling.

1085
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1086
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,600
It's a happy day.

1087
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,720
Like a lumberjack in heat.

1088
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:45,520
Lumberjack in heat?

1089
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:54,660
You know, this is the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack, from the church of the subgenius.

1090
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:55,620
Something like that.

1091
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,520
Which is a slackful.

1092
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:57,240
Religion.

1093
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:02,660
I noticed that our incoming host isn't incoming, but there's someone else here.

1094
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,480
Maybe you should check that out, Princess.

1095
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:16,500
Those who are interested in the subgenius projects, which actually do include books and records and films.

1096
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:26,240
Not that the records are on records and the films aren't on film anymore, but you can find more about that at subgenius.com.

1097
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:26,900
And I know you're going to be there.

1098
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:34,780
I know that you want to hear one more Rudy Schwartz project cover song from his new All Sunshine Supers hits album.

1099
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:42,960
And this one is a French classic called Una Lacrima Sous le Viso or something.

1100
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:43,600
I don't know.

1101
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,700
How do you put it outside the French?

1102
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:45,900
It's a famous song.

1103
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,860
I don't know.

1104
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,520
You'll hear it.

1105
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,220
On Climbe du Sous-Vin.

1106
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:56,880
Well, Dave, we're glad you're out of the hospital, but we're going to have to go to the hospital or something.

1107
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,260
I'm really glad you're on the radio with us.

1108
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,220
That's the best part.

1109
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:01,780


1110
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,600
Well, at least I wanted to be, if I couldn't be on it, I wanted to be at least within a couple of feet of it.

1111
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,180
And you helped me with that.

1112
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,640
And I can only thank you just time and time again.

1113
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:16,360
Well, we'll try to get you a better wheelchair for the next episode.

1114
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,040
Please do.

1115
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,320
I'm out of my feet.

1116
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,160
That's all I have.

1117
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,140
Okay.

1118
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:25,460
Here comes the Rudy Schwartz project with that Frenchman song.

1119
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,100
Okay.

1120
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,100
Praise Dave.

1121
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1122
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,020
Yeah.

1123
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:47,460
Yeah.

1124
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:55,620


1125
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,060
Yeah.

1126
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:56,080
Yeah.

1127
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:56,080


1128
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:56,080


1129
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:56,080


1130
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:56,080


1131
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,420
What am I to you?

1132
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:04,300
A smile, a smile

1133
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,280
A monster, your secret

1134
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:15,960
That you are in love with me

1135
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,880
And I still don't know

1136
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:27,300
I never understood

1137
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:32,600
I never knew that

1138
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:38,340
That you, that you would love me

1139
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:43,600
But you would never find me

1140
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,500
And the crash, oh dear, I don't remember

1141
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,860
Where the crippled soul

1142
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:49,860


1143
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:49,860


1144
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:50,300
Was buried

1145
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:55,480
And a miracle of love

1146
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:01,960
That these wounds open for me

1147
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:05,660
That I love only you

1148
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:22,620
And I still don't know

1149
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:22,620


1150
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:31,160
A monster, your secret

1151
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:31,200
That you are in love with me

1152
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:31,200


1153
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,740
I never understood

1154
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:37,720
I never knew

1155
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:44,040
That you, that you would love me

1156
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,800
But you would never find me

1157
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,840
And I still don't know

1158
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,520
I never understood

1159
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,640
That you, that you would love me

1160
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,980
And I still don't know

1161
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,260
A smile, a smile

1162
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:03,680
A monster, your secret

1163
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,860
That you are in love with me

1164
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:07,760
And I still don't know

1165
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:19,840
That you, that you would love me

1166
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,400
And I still don't remember

1167
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,500
How to me

1168
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,960
But you would never understand

1169
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,060
How to me

1170
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:33,660
And I still don't know

1171
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:37,620
How to me

1172
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:37,620


1173
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,900
What is wrong with you people?
