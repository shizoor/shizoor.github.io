1
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,760
What makes Bob holler?

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,400
What makes Bob holler?

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,300
When I asked Bob, he explained this way

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,360
And he said, well, when a little sweetie pie

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,880
In a misker twirls by

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,680
And rolls those big blue eyes

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,140
Oh, I holler

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,960
And when some pretty chick

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,120
Says she loves my fiddle legs

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,640
Well, now then, that can do the trick

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,040
Oh, I holler

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,520
The Self-Genius Hour of Slack

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,420
Bob holler

14
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,360
Well, I went on down to my girlfriend's shack

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,120
To see how they did hang

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,700
When I got there, her cupboard was bare

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,420
I couldn't ignite a thing

18
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,100
There was no shard, no bone, no twig

19
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,060
I brought my comic book collection

20
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,040
Was about this big, yeah

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,780
Frop without slack is like slack without frop

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,280
But where the hell else am I?

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,340
Going to cop

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,460
I found my dog food collection

25
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,960
About five o'clock

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,880
But all that food was stale

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,500
Thought I'd call that rip-off schmuck

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,320
Forgot he was in jail

29
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,000
Ended up killing a porcupine

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,640
Just to see if I could smoke his rhyme

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,400
Oh, frop without slack is like slack without frop

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,020
But where the hell else am I?

33
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,340
Going to cop

34
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,300
To that I almost need if I'm

35
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,300


36
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,740
Frop without slack is like slack

37
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,380
Where the hell else am I going to cop?

38
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,160
Forgot toag waiting records

39
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,540
Go wherever

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,160
I want to go

41
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,080
Yeah, I've had enough

42
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,560
And no one mandatios

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,540
Impatient enhancing

44
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:25,560
That's not bank opening

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,000
Ã¤t

46
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,300
to cop. Yeah, a frop without

47
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,120
slack is like slack without

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
frop. Don't cop from that guy there.

49
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,220
Where the hell else am I going to cop?

50
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,160
Oh, stay away from that. Frop without slack

51
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,960
is like slack without frop.

52
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,380
Where the hell else am I

53
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,260
going to cop? No way.

54
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,180
No, no, no. No, don't bother.

55
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,900
That was Reverend

56
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,960
Bleepo Abernathy with a frop

57
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,040
without slack.

58
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,960
Thank you, Reverend Bleepo

59
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,500
Abernathy.

60
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,780
In digital sound now.

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,900
But it'll be slightly different for

62
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,560
those of you who'd like some change

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,660
for crying out loud. This Saturday, August

64
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,500
12th, Blind Lemon

65
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,720
Cleveland. Chaz, can I ask you

66
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,800
one question before we go live?

67
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,840
You've been bad, ain't you?

68
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,080
You've been bad? You've been bad,

69
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,920
little girl. I'll see you

70
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,200
there.

71
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,080
Bob will see you there, little girl.

72
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,520
What's the Heisenpecker

73
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,640
uncertainty principle?

74
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,340
I see you, young lady.

75
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Young college student. I'm in the vision.

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,920
I'm seeing her. She's been bad.

77
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,580
And she wants to, she doesn't

78
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,440
want to be good, but she does want to be punished.

79
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,460
Oh, honey.

80
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,420
I've got a tongue lashing for you.

81
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,260
Oh, I've got some punishment.

82
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,180
You like it

83
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,480
when you get what good.

84
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,400
We know what you're thinking.

85
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,400
The men

86
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,240
don't know, but the

87
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,300
little girls understand. Praise

88
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,720
Bob.

89
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
And the knees must be shaved.

90
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,300
Oh, yeah.

91
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,340
Hey, you, them

92
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,520
choir singers,

93
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,220
they know.

94
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,340
Brother,

95
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,720
you bring your wife to church

96
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,140
this Saturday night.

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,460
We don't make you.

98
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,260
This ain't the kind of church we have to get up

99
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,280
7 o'clock on Sunday morning. No, sir.

100
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,640
This ain't the kind of church where you come to our

101
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,800
church. You get drunk.

102
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,700
You drink beer. You drink wine.

103
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,140
You drink mixed drinks. You get,

104
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,160
drunk, buddy, at our church, and

105
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,520
you sleep late on Sunday

106
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,180
morning. You pick up

107
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,200
some creature and take it home

108
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,840
and have intense

109
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,300
physical love with that

110
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,220
thing, and then you wake up in the morning

111
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,140
and you just deal with it. But praise

112
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,280
Bob. At least his promise

113
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,520
rang true, Bob said.

114
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,260
Have intercourse with a beautiful

115
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,240
live girl or anything

116
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,100
else you want.

117
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,360
Does that go for that?

118
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,900
That's what he said.

119
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,880
Right over there by your neck muscle.

120
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,280
Ignore the

121
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,460
digital device.

122
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,100
How about that reel-to-reel

123
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,600
player over there?

124
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,420
The one we're going to give you

125
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,620
in the next few hours.

126
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,920
Maybe not.

127
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,500
Maybe longer. Maybe the next few years.

128
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,080
Do I have to say it again?

129
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,040
You can make love with appliances.

130
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,240
You can do

131
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,300
what you're called for.

132
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,480
Anything you want.

133
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,280
Anything you need to do.

134
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,280
You can have long-term

135
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,720
conversations with yourself.

136
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,820
And get lost on the bench.

137
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,680
And he wants to feel you up.

138
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,460
And he wants to feel you up.

139
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,680
Bob loves you. He wants to shake your hand,

140
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,540
mister. And he'd like to

141
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,580
shake your

142
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,940
money maker, honey.

143
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,880
Bob's out there.

144
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,040
Bob's real.

145
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,280
Don't you doubt that. And that stark fist

146
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,320
of removal, it's real. And it's going to remove us

147
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,900
from the air right about now.

148
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,080
Bob is not

149
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,040
the illegitimate son of Michael

150
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,420
Jackson. Take it from me.

151
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,540
...

152
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,800
...

153
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


154
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


155
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


156
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


157
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


158
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


159
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


160
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


161
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


162
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


163
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


164
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


165
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


166
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


167
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


168
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,800


169
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:56,080


170
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:26,080


171
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:56,080


172
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:26,080


173
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,600


174
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,780
Ooh, midnight's growing late

175
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,160
From morning mist I rise

176
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,020
To help them greet the day

177
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,520
With little silver sunbeams

178
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,580
And little infrareds

179
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,740
I paint the house, I paint the door

180
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,980
I paint the chicken coop

181
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,740
And when they come out to see the show

182
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,220
I turn and paint them too

183
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,860
On my ride there's many sides

184
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,360
Bandits on my tail

185
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,100
Another target in the eye

186
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,960
Ooh, midnight's growing late

187
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,000
Ooh, midnight's growing late

188
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,720
Ooh, midnight's growing late

189
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,040
Ooh, midnight's growing late

190
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,120
Ooh, midnight's growing late

191
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,740
They'll never know, they'll never see

192
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,360
Before the hit, I'm gone

193
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,800
Back into the dragon's breath

194
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,060
To sing the dragon's song

195
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,620
Back home folks think what I do

196
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,160
I do to keep them free

197
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,120
And no one knows my secret

198
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,140
No one knows I fly for me

199
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,620
On my ride there's many sides

200
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,160
Bandits on my tail

201
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,800
Another target in the eye

202
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,620
Ooh, midnight's growing late

203
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,660
Ooh, midnight's growing late

204
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,580
Ooh, midnight's growing late

205
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,960
Ooh, midnight's growing late

206
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,660
ooh

207
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,240
Ooh

208
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:54,620
Michigan resident

209
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,940
Ooh, midnight's growing

210
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,800
Ooh, midnight's growing

211
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,700
Ooh, midnight's growing

212
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,120
As far as I know, the devil and Bob are the only ones who will actually pay for souls.

213
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,080
I have seen the devil in my microscope.

214
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,380
We can, like, buy our way out of hell.

215
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,180
Does the devil know you can buy your way out of hell?

216
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,280
You can only see it...

217
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,600
That's why the devil hates Bob.

218
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,420
Because Bob gives you the money that Bob's getting.

219
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,860
Those are triple your money back guarantee.

220
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,160
I think it's a very long legal process you have to go through.

221
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,780
You have to go through an apostate court.

222
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,760
Sign and bride.

223
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,640
And then you have to stand naked in front of a large tribunal.

224
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,600
You know, it might scare you just the sheer size of it.

225
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,340
And so, you know, before you even get down to get your reparations and repayment

226
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,440
for being sent to hell and you could buy your way out,

227
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,380
you'd have to sue.

228
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,980
In other words, you'd have to sue the devil.

229
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,960
Or, you know, not the devil incarnate, but the concept of the devil.

230
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,540
Which I guess we all have to do on a daily basis.

231
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,560
That was actually the egg lady who...

232
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,420
Thank you so much for that.

233
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:51,640
Thank you.

234
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,680
I was actually contemplating that thing this very day.

235
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,260
Buying your way back out of hell.

236
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,060
Yes, exactly.

237
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,060
Well, that's what they go to staying for, you know.

238
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,520
You see, but that's not the only thing that you can do.

239
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,640
You see, what you also have to do, if you are going to sell your soul to the devil,

240
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,000
which you should have a lawyer present when you sign that contract.

241
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,620
But how are you going to sell your soul to the devil?

242
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,260
You have to find the devil.

243
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,580
You've got to look in your microscope.

244
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,260
Well, I don't know.

245
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,760
You've got to look at your DNA.

246
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,140
You don't want to give those entire...

247
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,480
Can you really say,

248
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,360
Hey, devil guy, now look, when I die...

249
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,860
You have to look at your DNA, and then you see the devil.

250
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,540
Oh, yeah.

251
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,320
And trace it back, right on back to your reptilian complex.

252
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,040
Horny little helixes.

253
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:31,580
Yeah.

254
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,020
Everywhere.

255
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,980
Little lizards.

256
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,560
Snapping the heads off of other little lizards.

257
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,740
Little red capes.

258
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,660
My intention is to root out the devil.

259
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,380
Evolution is the devil, Chaz.

260
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,060
You just said it in your most retarded, elucidated moment.

261
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:47,880
What?

262
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,040
Evolution is the devil?

263
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,680
Or wait a minute.

264
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,180
What?

265
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:51,640
Why?

266
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,520
Because it's survival of the fittest?

267
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,880
I mean, nature.

268
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,220
And that's nature.

269
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,640
Is that somehow devilish?

270
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,560
That's natural law.

271
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,980
I'm afraid that there's...

272
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,400
Is natural law evil?

273
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,820
There is no...

274
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,460
Whoever leaves more offspring survives?

275
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,300
Is that...

276
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:06,960
That's evil?

277
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,000
That's the devil?

278
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,400
There is no life without death.

279
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,280
There is no pleasure without pain.

280
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,380
How can that be?

281
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,960
There's no pickle spears without...

282
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,880
With mounds of potatoes out.

283
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,180
There's...

284
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,060
I can't see a world in such opposition.

285
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,620
I was wrong.

286
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,100
I'm sorry.

287
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,260
You're right.

288
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,300
It's a...

289
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,200
Well, no...

290
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,300
What is it, God?

291
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,980
Right hemisphere, wrong planet.

292
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,580
Susie the floozy said.

293
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,420
And that pretty much sums it up.

294
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,140
Let's play devil's advocate here.

295
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,960
No pun intended.

296
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,000
You'll see before you're an object to figure out, man.

297
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:42,180
But if the devil was DNA and evolution and natural selection,

298
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,760
what then would God be?

299
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah.

300
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,380
Some never-ending state of sameness

301
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,600
which somehow maybe reflected differentness

302
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,940
without moving or something.

303
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,440
Stasis.

304
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,680
Stasisism.

305
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,780
God would be...

306
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,300
Then we must all be Luciferians

307
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,900
because we worship the light and quick movement.

308
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,200
That's right.

309
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,160
Well, now, see, that's all right.

310
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,920
You can't go talking about...

311
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,700
You can't go saying,

312
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,540
well, I know about what God's gonna think about that.

313
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,720
I know about God...

314
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,780
Because I know God real well.

315
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,200
I know what he'd think about that.

316
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,040
And he'd agree with me, not you.

317
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,960
Well, maybe God was before...

318
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,920
Before the Big Bang.

319
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,760
The moment before the Big Bang

320
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,580
that infinitely eternal life...

321
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,020
The moment before the Big Bang.

322
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,580
Like, that was God.

323
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,860
And then the devil took over when the Big Bang...

324
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,620
So the Big Bang was the devil.

325
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,160
There's many who subscribe to that particular...

326
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,240
The Big Bang was the devil.

327
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:30,660
Really?

328
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,080
Okay, how many of our, like, prophets...

329
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,940
And the Big Bang was the beginning of Satan.

330
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,340
That's right.

331
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,320
And the beginning of all, you know, 15 billion years of...

332
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,760
We are the legacy...

333
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,100
Satan owns this world!

334
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,100
...of 15 billion years of evolution.

335
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:43,760
It's really Satan's...

336
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,440
Well, think of all those prophets

337
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,180
all the way from Genos down to Enoch...

338
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,100
So that means that we are the devil.

339
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,580
And atomic vibrations...

340
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,280
...and slower than light is satanic.

341
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,660
...if you want to talk about moral objectives

342
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,000
and where do we go in our classrooms

343
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,440
and how many times can we go there, you know?

344
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,060
But then what...

345
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,580
How do you think of, like, Moses being bent over a log

346
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,420
and being, you know, burned to death?

347
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,980
But then what is love, then?

348
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,680
What is love in the universe?

349
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,020
I think love is gravity.

350
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,000
It's a mild form of hatred.

351
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,680
I think love is just gravity.

352
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,800
You know, gravity makes the Earth go around the sun.

353
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,280
That means the Earth loves the sun.

354
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,420
Gravity is a mild form of hatred.

355
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:18,800
Yeah.

356
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,840
Well, I used to do art.

357
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,340
Lots of weird shit, but...

358
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,840
I gave it all up.

359
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,380
Because it was too much work.

360
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,020
And it didn't pay.

361
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,760
And it was really just a big pit in the ass.

362
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,760
Anyway.

363
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,220
Anyway.

364
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,540
Anyway, anyway.

365
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,040
Anyway.

366
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
What the fuck?

367
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,300
What the fuck?

368
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,840
What the fuck?

369
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,480
What the fuck?

370
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,200
What the fuck?

371
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,260
So now...

372
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,060
I ski and watch TV.

373
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,960
Because that's a lot more fun and relaxing.

374
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,580
And it's what I really want to do.

375
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,060
And with my time, art gets old.

376
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,440
When no one pays you.

377
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,940
Or even understands.

378
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,200
So, what's the point?

379
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,100
Unless...

380
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,660
I was going to do it just for me.

381
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,060
But, to tell you the truth, I'd really rather just ski and watch TV.

382
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,980
Because that's just a lot more fun for me.

383
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,620
And I might as well have fun.

384
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,160
Because that's what life's for.

385
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,960
You know, rap for all the gusto and all that.

386
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,400
And I'm alive now.

387
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,100
But...

388
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,500
Someday...

389
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
I'll have to die.

390
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,180
And then...

391
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,400
I'll be dead.

392
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,360
For a long time.

393
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,740
For a long, long time.

394
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,580
For a long, long, long, long time.

395
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,060
For a fucking forever, in fact.

396
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,740
So, I might as well ski and watch TV.

397
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,000
Now, while I have the chance, don't have time to waste on art.

398
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,460
And I'm sick of torturing myself.

399
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,980
And of wondering if it's done yet.

400
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,060
And I'm sick of...

401
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,600
hanging out with all those lazy flakes.

402
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,060
Who think they're so smart.

403
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,200
And now that I'm free of them.

404
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,820
I might as well just listen to the music that I grew up with.

405
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,360
That's the only music that ever really moved me.

406
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,480
That new stuff's just a trend.

407
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,440
It's not real.

408
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,040
And now...

409
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,120
I can get all those old great songs again.

410
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,380
On CD.

411
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,160
And then...

412
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,960
I can download them all again.

413
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,100
On MP3.

414
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,480
Because that's the ultimate technology.

415
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,940
Can you see?

416
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,640
Oh, I'm so glad to be alive.

417
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,520
In this modern age.

418
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,500
So much so that...

419
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,020
I...

420
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,900
Really...

421
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:58,540
Don't...

422
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,160
WANNA DIE!

423
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,820
But there's not a whole lot I can do about that now.

424
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,960
Except maybe...

425
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,700
Pay my thirty dollars to the Church of the Subgenius.

426
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,000
And eat more vegetables.

427
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,140
And...

428
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,460
I think I better marry my girlfriend because...

429
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,840
It's such a risk nowadays.

430
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,160
Even though...

431
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,920
I'm not one of those people.

432
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,480
So I'm probably safe.

433
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:17,900
But...

434
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,760
You can never be too sure.

435
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,880
And so...

436
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,700
We'll marry.

437
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,220
So we can ski.

438
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,440
And watch TV.

439
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,180
Together.

440
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,260
And feel free and happy.

441
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,960
Without having to worry about art.

442
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,320
What a pain.

443
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,720
Glad I'm through with all that shit.

444
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,800
God damn it.

445
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,500
But now...

446
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,220
I've got...

447
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,000
All...

448
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,800
That I could ever really reasonably expect...

449
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,940
To ever get out of life.

450
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,320
Anyway...

451
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,520
Anyway...

452
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:43,980
Anyway...

453
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,960
Anyway...

454
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,440
Anyway...

455
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:46,440


456
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,460
What the fuck?

457
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:47,460


458
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:47,760
What the fuck?

459
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,480
Fuck?

460
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,380
Fuck?

461
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:51,580
Fuck?

462
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:51,740
Fuck?

463
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,280
What the fuck?

464
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,660
What the fuck?

465
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:53,900
Fuck?

466
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,580
What the fuck?

467
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,060
Fuck?

468
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:57,540
Fuck?

469
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:57,900
Fuck?

470
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,160


471
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:58,760
What the fuck?

472
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:58,840


473
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:58,900
Think fuck.

474
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:58,900


475
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,280
Any way.

476
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,900
Any way?

477
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,220
At faÃ§on engineer.

478
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,580
Fossillander.

479
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,420
Pretty good.

480
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,200
Someone obsessed me with that.

481
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,280


482
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,260
What tries to carry me down this road.

483
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:17,460
Red abandonment.

484
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:17,460


485
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:17,460


486
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,500
to find the solution to my problems.

487
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,100
And my eyes

488
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,640
found the verse right there on the pages.

489
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,420
In all things,

490
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,460
slack must

491
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,800
come first.

492
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,220
So

493
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,060
why the fuck am I so

494
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,700
pissed off right now?

495
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,500
I'll tell you why.

496
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,440
Because I've been reading that

497
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,660
book for years.

498
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,360
And I've been reading and

499
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,480
not intentionally memorizing,

500
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,660
but absorbing the word of Bob.

501
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:48,840
And for

502
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,180
a decade and a half,

503
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,000
I had completely

504
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,680
ignored that one line

505
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,240
in all things.

506
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,980
Slack must

507
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,320
come first. And that is

508
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,720
why I am so

509
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,200
motherfucking pissed off right now.

510
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,060
I am pissed off

511
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,360
for ignoring the plain and obvious

512
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,300
truth that Bob has presented

513
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:11,860
to us.

514
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,680
But if

515
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,240
slack must come first,

516
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,460
then why am I still pissed off

517
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,500
about it? Well, it's very

518
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,140
simple, friends. Whenever

519
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,600
I find myself starting to get

520
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,940
pissed off, I ask myself,

521
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,500
is there slack to be had?

522
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,600
And there's slack to be had

523
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,560
in being pissed off. And dear friends,

524
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,380
brave fucking Bob, I am

525
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,440
pissed off!

526
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,820
Giveè¥¿ Teru

527
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,240
a

528
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,820
vibe

529
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:01,820


530
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,620
in fear.

531
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,340
Dad.

532
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,660
I want to love some

533
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,700
and love some.

534
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,660
Â¶Â¶

535
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,640
Â¶Â¶

536
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,640
Â¶Â¶

537
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,300
Â¶Â¶

538
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,560
Â¶Â¶

539
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,740
Â¶Â¶

540
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,000
Â¶Â¶

541
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,160
Brandy, Kenny fucking Rogers, Hobbity Britney Spears, noise pollution, off pitch Alanis,

542
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:56,400
crap ass cool mo DPP, insane fucking clown posse screeching, or backstreet bunghole ululations.

543
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,080
Boom!

544
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:04,760
No more Rosie O'Dyke, no more family splatters, hyper bullshit NWO fracassees, testaroni ballgames,

545
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,480
sinful commercials, or loser has-been colostomy hobbled stars doing TV salutes to anything.

546
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,080
Boom!

547
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,560
No more licorice.

548
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,520
I hate that crap.

549
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:13,860
Boom!

550
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,540
Boom!

551
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,200
No more goddamned God, Bob, Buddha, Jesus on a pogo stick, rabbis, Robertson, popes,

552
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,000
hell popes, dervishes, doom criers, fakirs, fakers, Falwells, imams, seers, soothsayers,

553
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:30,040
stangs, prophets, fucking door-to-door missionaries, medicine men, or airport Krishnas.

554
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,820
Hurry this you saffron fuck, I'll torch your topknot.

555
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,180
Boom!

556
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:33,920
Boom!

557
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,880
No more Frenchmen.

558
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,300
Boom!

559
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,020
Boom!

560
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,220
No more $40 gourmet Italian restaurant meals that taste like they were eaten once before

561
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,440
they ladled it onto your plate.

562
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:43,500


563
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:43,720
Boom!

564
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,580
Boom!

565
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,280
No more turd-gobbling, piss-spraying bosses who need to be knocked down and kicked in

566
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,640
the cossacks until all they can do is twitch and shit themselves.

567
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,200
Boom!

568
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:52,820
Boom!

569
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,140
And speaking of twitching and shitting yourself, no more craptastic current former or wannabe

570
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,640
sub-peÃ±as, dick-scordian, or fill-in-the-blank self-styled faux-intellectual lizard lickers

571
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,040
who don't know a round peg from a square hole from the pot most of them don't have the aim

572
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,880
to piss in properly.

573
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,400
Boom!

574
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,060
Boom!

575
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,300
Boom!

576
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,300


577
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,300


578
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,300


579
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,300


580
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,500
No more racist black radicals, rednecks, no-necks, feminist chicken chokers, termites,

581
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,240
f-marts, pollsters, butt-suckers, butt-kickers, techno-dweebs, tax-diddlers, former bouncers

582
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,060
who think they're platinum turds, finger-sniffers, or foaming hysterical pontificators with dingleberry

583
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,260
bedecked fruity pink hats riding shitty sputtering little PCs through the mental health of others.

584
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,640
Boom!

585
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,320
Boom!

586
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:33,720
Boom!

587
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,440
Boom!

588
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,560
Boom!

589
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:35,560


590
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:40,700
No more ball-twisting student loans, ovary-rotting junk mail, or triple goddamn fucking Ed McMahon.

591
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,040
Ho ho, may I have another?

592
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,440
Yes you may, you flatulent chimp rectum.

593
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,020
You can have one nuke after another until they can see your ass blowing from Pluto.

594
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,580
Boom!

595
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,520
Boom!

596
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,380
Boom!

597
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:50,620


598
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,080


599
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,140


600
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,320
Boom!

601
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,400
Boom!

602
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:51,620
Boom!

603
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:51,660
Boom!

604
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:51,940
Boom!

605
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:51,960
Boom!

606
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:51,960


607
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,320
Boom!

608
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,420
Boom!

609
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:52,420


610
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,260
And no more en-raging emails from commercial e-rapists telling me about how THEY'RE gonna

611
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,040
make me rich...fuck that...

612
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,100
Nuke em'!

613
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,020
And no more duke nuke em'.

614
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,980
In fact triple goddamn duke nuke em' because I paid six dollars for a plastic octafrine

615
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,140
and the goddamn fucking tentacles fell off within the first week, and I nuclear up de

616
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,760

617
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,600
Boom!

618
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:11,880
Boom!

619
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,380
Boom!

620
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:12,400
Boom!

621
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:12,640
Boom!

622
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:12,700
Boom!

623
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:12,700


624
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:12,700


625
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:12,700


626
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,580
Boom!

627
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,720
sicken me. You jest about killing

628
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,680
the normals, but I want to nuke the Super Bowl

629
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,840
and stack the skulls into a new Tower of Babel

630
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,560
so high I can climb to the top

631
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,580
and scream at God for his shitty handiwork.

632
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,680
How dare

633
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,840
he create us and then hinge us in the middle

634
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,800
so we have to go through life bent over just waiting

635
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,060
for the next big butt missile.

636
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,780
If it weren't

637
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,480
for that mole masturbator Jim Baker

638
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,800
getting a load of karma right up his duchess,

639
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,560
I'd want to shoot the almighty up his eternal

640
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,600
sphincter with a cobalt 40s impository.

641
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:42,840
Boom!

642
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,680
Now some

643
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,660
mewling skanks will probably blanch in

644
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,700
horror at my proposal.

645
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,520
These pathetic

646
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,560
pansies see life as a precious gift instead

647
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,500
of the planetary skin disease most of it

648
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,000
represents.

649
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,660
They think I'd like people better and

650
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,660
couldn't bear to shoot them in their drooling sucker rim

651
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,400
faces if I got a glimpse of a snapshot

652
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,380
featuring their wretched offspring and pooting

653
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,440
grannies. Bah! Guess what? Boom!

654
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:09,980
Yeah!

655
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,400
If I got to know them

656
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,200
personally, I'd have to fend off their nasty

657
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,320
breath, listen to their interminable droning

658
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,260
stories, and scratch the rashes that inevitably

659
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,100
develop when I'm exposed to their violently

660
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,280
offensive normalcy.

661
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,260
I don't care. I say

662
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,320
nuke them until even the goddamn roaches turn to

663
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:26,960
one another and say,

664
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:27,960
Boom!

665
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,060
Go nukes!

666
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,260
I'm not going to be happy until they're flying around like

667
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,400
goddamn gnats in a rainforest.

668
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,280
Never mind, fuck you. I say nuke you

669
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,080
and stop wasting your tick-picking time with mere

670
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,920
insults and guns.

671
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,380
I want to see nukes a-poppin' and numbers that rival

672
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,140
the number of times Richard Simmons has played

673
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,140
Rump Rangers of the old Wild West with every

674
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,140
bodybuilder in the tri-state area who fell asleep

675
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,960
on the bench. Boom! Boom! Boom!

676
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,720
Boom, boom, boom!

677
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,300
Go nukes! And go speed racer,

678
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,160
but don't go country. At least have a little reserve.

679
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,020
God damn you.

680
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,680
I'm just kidding. Oh, no, I'm not!

681
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,160
A goddamn cock ripping, blood dripping,

682
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,300
baby on a spit, gobble shit, tit splitting,

683
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,340
leech hurling, colon twirling,

684
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,180
eyeball puncturing, old church lady

685
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,140
punching, bone scattering, soul

686
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,260
splattering, cat sodomizing, poodle clubbing,

687
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:14,920
fuck to you all!

688
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,960
Except for

689
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,800
Friday, Susie, and Sister Decadence. Hi.

690
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,140
So how you doing?

691
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,460
Love you, baby!

692
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,980
Go nukes t-shirts available for me

693
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,900
so I can build a working prototype in the backyard

694
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,040
and use it to nuke all of your goddamn asses

695
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,620
and it won't be a dry heat either!

696
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,820
Praise Bob!

697
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,500
Praise Bob!

698
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,520
Thank you very kindly. Thank you very much.

699
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,120
Yeah!

700
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,480
Hell Bob!

701

Thank you.

Bemç§æ has lasted 6 years as a fast learning applications expert.

736
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:00,440
He is the third Northwest dyed hair of Vietnam based

737
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,120
non GaO scientist accompanying the research has continued it.

738
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,140
Type in your answer above.

739
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:17,800
We got there.

740
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,840
Come on to me

741
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,980
And I say

00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,020
Daps

743
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,620

Daps

745
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,340
Extend my cosmic role

746
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,980
Daps

747
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,380
Is the man who sold my soul

748
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,640
He talked to the space guys

749
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,800
And made a surreal good deal

750
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,720
For salvation of planet Earth

751
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,480
His plan for the normals

752
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,060
Will be keeping it surreal

753
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,220
While subgenies enjoy rebirth

754
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,940
Don't you know Bob

Bob

758
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,540
Daps

759
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,780
Got a grin that's good as gold

760
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,520
Bob

761
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,380
Daps

762
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,800
Is the man who sold my soul

763
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,220
Daps

764
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,960
Is the man who sold my soul

765
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,940
Bob daps

766
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,580
Bob daps

767
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,820
Bob daps

768
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,180
Bob daps

769
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,180
Bob daps

770
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,800
Bob daps

771
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:16,840
Bob daps

772
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,240
He is...

773
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,420
So...

774
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:26,840
So...

775
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:28,840
So...

776
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:35,620
Before the before life, he was my special friend.

777
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,560
Always watching out for me.

778
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,860
And he'll be there waiting.

779
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,240
After my living death.

780
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,780
So I get into eternity.

781
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,280
Believe it.

782
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,200
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

783
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,760
Into my heart he stole.

784
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,000
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

785
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,540
I'm no longer in control.

786
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,760
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

787
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,520
He's the man who sold my soul.

788
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,060
He's the one who made me whole.

789
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,440
He explained my cosmic role.

790
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,940
He's the man who sold my soul.

791
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,080
He's the man who sold my soul.

792
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,340
Yes, dear friends.

793
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,660
The man who sold my soul.

794
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,440
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

795
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,560
That song was done by...

796
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,540
St. Kenneth Huey and Reverend Bunny Boy.

797
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,520
Friends.

798
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:57,600
And before that, we heard some preaching from XXX Day with Einstein's Secret Orchestra in the background.

799
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:04,080
And that song about on your grave in the fog and the dew was Rudy Schwartz Project.

800
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,340
We heard Hell Pope Huey doing that boom rant.

801
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:15,760
And the November 22nd Kennedy assassination thing was by Pope S. Lilith, who also did that pissed off rant.

802
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,360
And...

803
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,220
Anyway.

804
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:27,840
A song that was Little Theodore and Midnight Growing Pale.

805
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,560
If you didn't figure that out, it was by Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

806
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:37,340
In the background, we are hearing Electro Slat Treatment by Lamprey Systems.

807
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:42,320
And we're about to hear some Jehovah Hates Fred and some more Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

808
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,580
So, hang on, friends.

809
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,240
In fact, I know you're going to hang on because you have to.

810
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,080
Because you love Bob.

811
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,440
Keep those mutilated cattle rolling.

812
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:07,460
Here comes 9,200,000,000,000 more Zarkons for the alien empire.

813
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,480
And why they call them doggies?

814
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,040
They're not doggies.

815
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:15,940
That's a cow.

816
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,060
Right up into that saucer rant.

817
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,120
Right up into that saucer.

818
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,260
That's not a slaughterhouse door.

819
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,440
It's a saucer rant.

820
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,620
Going in that saucer.

821
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,160
That's it.

822
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:26,980
Thanks for the money.

823
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:27,880
Praise Bob.

824
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,480
Praise Bob.

825
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,700
So you think you've discovered the final secret, do you?

826
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,740
I think you've got all the answers solved and all the questions well posed.

827
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:46,040
Now, by the time you pick yourself up from that basement floor and screw the light bulb back in your head,

828
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:46,760
you're going to be lying.

829
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:50,500
It won't be long before you understand you've been mistooken.

830
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:58,440
I'm kind of a rattlesnake picking, picking chaps, scratching, cactus wiping, old Brandon

831
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,820
Iron chuck wagon feller.

832
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,200
I'm kind of a Marlboro man.

833
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:09,780
I just say, and I like to boss them little weaklings and sissies and city boys around.

834
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,880
That's me.

835
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,300
I'm a subgenius minister.

836
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,220
And I've got a whole flock of dumb ass bosses.

837
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:16,220


838
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:16,220


839
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:16,220


840
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,000
They do anything I say.

841
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:18,660
And you know what?

842
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,260
You could do the same thing.

843
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,960
You're buddies with Bob.

844
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,380
And all it takes me buddies with Bob is just that membership.

845
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:29,460
There's friends to join up churches of Venus praise Bob.

846
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,020
It won't go.

847
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,060
Damn, this cow thing won't.

848
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,180
It won't go.

849
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:44,900
It won't go.

850
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:46,540
It won't.

851
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:46,540


852
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,780
So much for American made products.

853
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:54,520
There was an advertisement for moon pants that made the cow sound and when you press

854
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,500
it, it makes the appropriate sound.

855
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,860
It's ladies night here down at the farm.

856
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,860
Don't ask too many questions.

857
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,720
The moonlight is twanging over the post.

858
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:16,220
Tom and Marv, you're brilliant, and slim all the way.

859
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,220


860
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,980
rest of the people down at the Double Z Ranch, all taking a nap.

861
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:24,140
Chickens, cows, the beefalo, the mighty pig,

862
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,720
have all decided to throw a party for yours truly.

863
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,280
And nothing's truer than this.

864
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,300
Let me tell you a tale

865
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,220
of the old Spanish trail.

866
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,720
She and I used to ride side by side

867
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,540
down the old Spanish trail.

868
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,580
She wore red shoes.

869
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,260
Everybody said she would make very good jamÃ³n,

870
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,900
but I think maybe we're going to fall in love sometime.

871
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,500
So we talked of a June honeymoon

872
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,400
on the old Spanish trail.

873
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:03,700
Mmm, yeah.

874
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,680
But then I started getting a little bit hungrier.

875
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,180
And we're still about four hours from the beach.

876
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,180
Because that's where we got to go,

877
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,980
because that's the nearest place we can go.

878
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,800
Ah, yes, dear friends.

879
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,320
Einstein's Secret Orchestra on the radio.

880
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,400
ESO's Swamp Radio.

881
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,320
Broadcast originally from WCSB in Cleveland.

882
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,440
New home of the Hour of Slack.

883
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:38,040
Though not of the church of the subgenius,

884
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,540
which is still at Dallas, Texas,

885
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,580
where you can learn more about the bell.

886
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,780
If you will just write to the number

887
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,820
I'm about to give for free information,

888
00:46:50,020 --> 00:47:03,940
that's at post office box 1403066 Dallas, Texas 752114.

889
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:11,300
Once again, that's box 140306 Dallas, Texas 752114.

890
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:16,040
www.subgenius.com

891
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,840
Thank you.

892
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,200
Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Day

893
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,740
from Swamp Radio.

894
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,800
Radio.

895
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:36,260
Well, what kind of cheap psychedelic tricks are these?

896
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,840
Is this supposed to convert these poor innocent sheep

897
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,320
to the word of Bob?

898
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,220
Cheap tricks?

899
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:45,900
What if...

900
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,760
J.R.R. Ball dogs walk through that airlock right now?

901
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,160
What would he think?

902
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:54,240
These silly tricks display his image.

903
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,920
His graven image like some of that

904
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,440
volatilist statue with the worshippers

905
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,000
raining down the fort.

906
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,120
Bob would say,

907
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,180
hell no, what's wrong with you people?

908
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,200
You're acting like a bunch of religious nuts.

909
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,720
What are you doing in this little dog?

910
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,340
You should be out there running through that field

911
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,100
partying.

912
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,460
Lift it up.

913
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,780
Hell, this is Starwood.

914
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,580
Maybe the world ends tomorrow and you may die.

915
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,560
You should be doing whatever the hell you would be doing

916
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,040
if tomorrow was the last day on earth.

917
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:33,000
Or if you had all the time in the world.

918
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,420
That's what old Bobby likes you to do.

919
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,100
Either live life just as if this was the last day of it

920
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:42,120
or as if it was never ever going to end.

921
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,800
Because if you go to threaten, who was it?

922
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,700
It was the great...

923
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:50,000
or great forefather, Ken Kesey of the Mary Plank Church

924
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,480
who said,

925
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,500
the only sin is fretting.

926
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,120
Ah, yes.

927
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,580
The only sin is fretting.

928
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,400
And of course it's hard not to fret

929
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,840
when we're in this miserable world.

930
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,060
Well, it ain't so miserable actually

931
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,880
if you quit reading the newspaper.

932
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,320
That's what I did, friend.

933
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,620
It's as strange as it may seem.

934
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,000
There was a time, not even a year ago,

935
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:24,480
when I was a news junkie just like so many others.

936
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,600
I'd be up every morning and read every bit of the newspapers

937
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,660
from the back, even the obituaries

938
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,780
where I was starting to see my friends' names.

939
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,660
And friends, I quit.

940
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,500
I quit reading the news.

941
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,480
It's been a year since I've seen it.

942
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,580
Whenever you're in the old one,

943
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,180
there'll be some news on the TV

944
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,420
or some newspaper headline.

945
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:50,020
And by God, it's exactly the same as it was the month before.

946
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,320
And it's the same as it was a year before.

947
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,680
And it's always the same damn game.

948
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,740
Keeping you distracted from your own business.

949
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,800
God Almighty, just listen to my friends.

950
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,520
There's enough bad news to fill a whole life pot.

951
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:10,460
So I decided I can't do a goddamn thing

952
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,500
about all those poor, wretched people

953
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,100
in those countries starving.

954
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:15,900
Or fighting.

955
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,480
Or the poor, wretched people in my own country.

956
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,660
There's nothing I can do immediately

957
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,160
except to keep my own sanity

958
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,120
and keep my hand on some slack.

959
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,840
Because friends, if you don't have slack,

960
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,340
you sure as hell cannot share it.

961
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,700
And once you do have slack,

962
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,940
you've got enough to go around

963
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,320
because there's no end to real slack.

964
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,040
Real slack, friends.

965
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,980
But, once again,

966
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,240
this ain't the kind of religion that's gonna even give you

967
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:50,180
the slightest message of a hint as to what real slap might mean to you,

968
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,620
because it's up to you.

969
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,800
It's always going to be a deal between you and J.R. Bob Dobbs,

970
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,760
or Connie Dobbs, if that's who you talk to late at night.

971
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,160
You know, we all do it.

972
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,140
Either Bob or Connie, you've got to serve somebody.

973
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,280
Ah, yes. Ah, yes, dear friends.

974
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,840
Or your pet dog, Rover.

975
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:19,580
He had a taste of the life and the benefits of the universe,

976
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,860
and he was not offended by it.

977
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,680
For he knew he had to rise from the hall,

978
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,900
to dwell in his own shit.

979
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,040
That's an advertising call.

980
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,120
Bidding starts at a quarter.

981
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,100
Yeah, bidding starts at a quarter.

982
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,520
A mere quarter. Do I hear a quarter? Do I hear a quarter?

983
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,260
We got a song.

984
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,260
We got a quarter.

985
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,600
What's your song, sir?

986
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,600
What's my song?

987
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,800
What's your word? Give me a word. Give me a word.

988
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,000
Word.

989
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:12,860
Just a word?

990
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,020
Just a word. Any word.

991
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,020
The dingo's soft.

992
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,140
Sausage.

993
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:17,620
Sausage.

994
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,800
Lord, I love my sausage.

995
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,780
It's brown and fatty.

996
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:30,320
On some light, some light guy named Matty two years ago,

997
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,980
who we had the misfortune to meet.

998
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,200
Matty liked sausage, and Matty liked a lot of other things.

999
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,460
And he also liked to make trouble.

1000
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:45,020
He often talked about his sausage to anyone who'd give him a chance.

1001
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:45,360
Just listen.

1002
00:52:46,960 --> 00:53:00,800
And then Matty took out his sausage, started waving it around, got down with the ground.

1003
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,900
But he was a jerk.

1004
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,680
He just waved that thing.

1005
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,780
That nasty brown sausage.

1006
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,220
Had to be a jerk.

1007
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:15,220


1008
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:15,220


1009
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:15,220


1010
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,340
Put him in a swing.

1011
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,420
Didn't like the way that he acted.

1012
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,720
Always asking questions.

1013
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:31,340
Such as, you know, you guys aren't really all that abnormal.

1014
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,420
You some genius.

1015
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,540
Aw, you guys do nothing but sit around.

1016
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,540
Then he whipped out his sausage.

1017
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:44,980
Woo-hoo.

1018
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,100
And we pummeled him to the ground.

1019
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:55,180
But Matty, where have you gone?

1020
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,740
Have you gone?

1021
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,740
Far away.

1022
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,540
Now my song is gone.

1023
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,620
Thank you.

1024
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,620
That was sausage.

1025
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:15,820


1026
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:13,920
Suddenly a haze descended over the crowd.

1027
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:20,500
And they could feel the pee-pees between their knees, but they could not convert it to the

1028
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:25,200
necessary juices with which to transport themselves away.

1029
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:33,900
The day unfolds from lamplight steams.

1030
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,680
The asphalt shimmers like blackened streams.

1031
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,900
And all about the day.

1032
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:43,900


1033
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,240
I feel and smell and sense your presence near.

1034
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:53,280
The lines are drawn the wrong direction and I am aware.

1035
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,300
No words in books here.

1036
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:59,700
Have a look, there's something in the air.

1037
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:07,740
And measurements of time are crumble and climb for Jaguar, Knight and White Gear.

1038
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,200
Living in jungles of radio waves.

1039
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,680
Never now or ever or yesterday.

1040
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:36,860
And just now in the road, the grass becomes gold.

1041
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,600
For Jaguar, Knight and White Gear.

1042
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,240
Oh, Jaguar, Knight and White Gear.

1043
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:43,900
Oh, Jaguar, Knight and White Gear.

1044
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:43,900


1045
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,880
No words in books here.

1046
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,300
Have a look, there's something in the air.

1047
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:56,880
And measurements of time are crumble and climb for Jaguar, Knight and White Gear.

1048
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,760
He's a little tango.

1049
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,940
What kind of city do tango?

1050
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,400
Well, not yet.

1051
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,060
.

1052
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,580
Living

1053
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:37,000
in jungles of radio waves

1054
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,120
I never, now,

1055
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,360
no never, no yesterday

1056
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:47,980
And just now in the air

1057
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,180
Where black becomes clear

1058
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:55,940
For jaguar, knife and white deer

1059
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,320
The woods in books here

1060
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,760
Have a look there's something in the air

1061
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,540
And measurements of time are grumble and climb

1062
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,920
For jaguar, knife

1063
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:11,360
