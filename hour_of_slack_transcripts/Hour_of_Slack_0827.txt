This won't make too much sense, but it's not intended to.
In virtually every case of tracing the lube pictures to the point of production,
investigating officers were able to link the small-time peddlers to their distributor.
The Subgenius Hour of Swatch!
But let's leave things of this world behind
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang with the facts.
That's right, the facts.
But why are you so hung up on facts, my friend?
The Church of the Subgenius, unlike the conspiracy that you serve now,
does not confuse you with so-called, quote, facts, unquote.
There are no facts to the enlightened man.
To one trained in the church by Bob Dobbs,
ultimate truth can be found in a potato, in a comic book,
or at the bottom of a bottle of liquid slack.
Because, friends, slack is what comes first.
Yes, slack must come even before truth.
So why are you letting the experts pull the wool over your eyes?
Forget the facts, friends, and do like Bob.
Pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusions.
This is your only hope, my friend, if you wish to unravel the punchline to the joke.
Of life.
Let there be slack.

What's it at, Bob?

On the highway, on the people's meeting

Roadrunner, roadrunner, runs the road all day
Even the coyote can't make a change his ways
Roadrunner, the coyote's after you
Roadrunner, if he catches you
Roadrunner, the coyote's after you
Roadrunner, if he catches you
The coyote's really a crazy clown
When will he learn that he never can go in and out?
Roadrunner, who little roadrunner never bothers anyone
He's open and uncool to his idea having fun
Jidididoo, jididididididoo

Disgusting.
Sire, the situation is...
We're here at the International Festival for those who have gone too far.
The Lois, the band serenades the Fools as they dance on the empty glass sea of mischief.
Yes, it's an exciting day here at the Fool Symposium.
Ah, here comes the President's limousine.
Dumping the dirt.
On the freeway of success.
And there's his curly-headed wife playing the bass drum.
And the small but polite audience.
Of those who don't know any better.
Sire, the situation is...
We're here to see what science.
Sire, the situation is yeah!

Adam O'Gerer at the Fools.
A prêt-à-vis.


With smoke and burning smoke, I'm always awake, notice things my dreams.

Yes, dear friends. Well, it's not
the usual hour
of slack number 827,
is it?
But it
sure
is slack. All that
sure was slack to me. I have
steadfastly
maintained that the band
that covers TV themes
metal style will
rule this world.
Actually, instead,
that was several bands all collected
together by Pater
Nostril and
mixed in with the old subgenius
Media Barrage No. 5
and recent alt binaries
dot slack.
Contributions all
years.
Anyway, friends,
Hee Haw was done by
Butt Trumpet.
We heard a little bit of collage from
Fernanda Nandeli-Mur.
Roadrunner theme
was by Boris the Sprinkler.
That's disgusting
was the Byron
Gosh group. We heard
a little bit about the
International Festival of
Fools, so to speak. That was an
ancient, ancient puzzling
evidence recording.
Horton Heat did the theme
from Johnny Quest.
Hey Hey Were the Monkeys
was by Furious
George. Mission
Impossible was by The Meat
Men. Get Smart by
Agent Orange.
Hawaii Five-O by F.U.
And Bewitched
there was by
Brutal Juice. I know
those guys.
One of the
if you own a Bob
anti Bob T-shirt, the guitar
player of Brutal Juice probably
silk screened it and
no use for a name
did the Munsters.
Friends coming up, an LSD
song by
Jack Webb and a band
called Incliterati
and some
Einstein Secret Orchestra
Swamp Radio from WCSB
with Professor Chaz and Lonesome
Cowboy Dave and yours truly.

oh did you hear about
how our government is winning

we've won the war
we've won the war
the war on terrorism or the war on drugs
or the war on
intellectualism
well now
now I did hear that the
internet radio laws are going to
go into effect in about two weeks
which means
I'm only playing I will begin in two weeks time
when that starts, I will then start playing only my own music.
You know, that was what I was thinking.
That's what's happening on ESO radio.
It's like, well, okay, I wasn't playing very much conspiracy store bought.
I wasn't going to play my own music.
I was just playing this crap people would send in.
Send in.
Send in.
Oh, yeah.
I was here on the last tape.
This is where the little people come out and take your wallet.
Oh, well.
I didn't have much of my wallet that year anyway.
But I tried.
My family knows I tried.
They imported all of their insides to this side of the nation.
And you know what happened?
The bottom fell out on them.
Yep.
It was coming across the great divide.
The bottom fell right out on them.
It was like Death Valley in 81.
Clogged up.
Choked up.
They elected to stay in a burned out motel south of Icewater.
Well, it was flying over Armpit.
Yeah, that was that place.
And the bottom fell out again.
But this time, because they had that previous experience,
they were able to use their survival guide in such a way to as not to hurt anybody.
As you can see here.
Here in this slide.
As they arrived at the Kewater International Airport.
With the entire party intact.
Except for the dog who was eaten three days out.
Whoa.
And do you know what happened?
And do you know what happened?
Well, what I heard was they had a big fight over the little tiny wallets.
That was a very early tape.
Early 80s or late 70s.
By puzzling evidence.
Puzzling evidence.
Wrenched up.
From the old quarter inch tapes.
For a second life.
Shambling across the soon to be censored and strip mined internet.
And now the Ashcroft acid trance remix by Godrex.
Government officials, the Department of Defense, this secretary and the people that work with me.
To the extent anyone says anything that at any time proves to have been the truth.
They correct it at the earliest possible opportunity.
The Western land.
Guards see a freedom storm.
And the dudes that dance the watch fires.
Of a nation torn by war.
She's far too young to die.
You can see it in her eyes.
She's not yet begun to fly.
It's time to let the body eat.
The source of the power of the world.
The power of the world.
The power of the world.
The power of the world.
The power of the world.
Let the eagle soar.
Like she's never soared.
The power of the world.
War.
Let the mighty eagle soar.
He's here.
He's here.
He's here.
Amen.
The power of the world.
Is he.
And now live receivers and banishers of evil.
Not we sheرب will be on the military side.
Our dessevered all you.
Too many more chiefs.

Don't try, gotta go bye-bye
Gotta go bye-bye
Suddenly die, die
Cock, kill a creep, pow, pow, pow
Call us and talk about what you'd wish
Go ahead
I might point out that a lot of people worry about the one world government
That the conspiracy is trying to get across on us
And we suspect that the only thing that can fight a one world government
Is going to be a one world religion
And of course that's what the subgenius

The Rainmakers, dear friends.
A great old favorite band of mine from the day.
Uh...
They disbanded, unfortunately.
The subgenius-like person behind that band was named Bob Walkenhorst.
But you can still find, uh...
The Rainmakers here and there.
I'm gonna try to resurrect their great legend here
on the Hour of Slack.
Thank you.
Bobs.
Nay, bobs.
Na-na-na-nattering.
Na-na-na-nattering.
Na-na-na-nattering.
Na-na-na-nattering.
Nay, bobs.
Of negativism.
Nattering nay-bobs of negativism.
This pervasive policy of permissiveness has turned out to be a tragic mistake.
The relating of spiritual declension is never a pretty sight or a pretty picture.
Because as foolish as Bob gets, as foolish as Bob gets,
it's the wisdom of the ages.
It's the foolishness and the idiocy that has...
kept man from being, uh...
uh...
satisfied with his lot in life.
It is that stupidity which has caused man to build his great monuments,
his mighty, uh...
uh...
gas-powered engines and his nuclear reactors.
It is that which has given man his...
his...
his urge to master the entire Earth,
no matter how nice it was before.
And it is this mighty, uh...
sacred...
uh...
archetype of an urge of...
of...
that's...
that's in Bob and in all of us
that makes us want to smite our brothers.
And, friends, if it weren't for that,
where would us subgeniuses be?
We'd be like everybody else.
We'd be no different.
We'd have nothing to gripe about.
And without the mighty grunt power and the mighty hate,
the hate for the normal that we can feed,
the hate that can make us go out and earn something for nothing,
the hate that will make us, uh...
overcome every...
every last, uh...
conspiracy, uh...
attempt to...
to hold us down that there's ever been.
In the long run, we may stay poor and broke,
we may stay neurotic,
or whatever we started out as,
or whatever we may fall into,
but by God,
we've got Bob and the hate!
And for that, we can hate him!
Hate him!
Hate him!
The professional pessimist.
In the past, he's been called the prophet of gloom and doom,
the troubadour of trouble,
the disciple of despair.
With the help of information which the suspect had given us,
we were able to round up three wholesalers
and another distributor of obscene books and photographs.
Each one of them was questioned thoroughly.
We ran into the same old routine.
They denied knowing...
anything about the man who was masterminding the racket,
or where it was operating from.
I know nothing!
Nothing!
Stakeouts were set up at locations
where sales and deliveries of obscene material
were known to have been made.
Nothing happened.
Yeah, voices.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
In the 100-level courses, they teach you...
They don't teach you how to reach self-actualism,
they just teach you it's there.
A carrot you will never taste.
Chaz and I were...
At first, we began to morosely think about
the fact that on your list of the top ten priorities in life,
getting laid is no longer even in the top ten.
No.
But things like just being able to go into the bathroom
and have a drink,
good, long, productive extra meditation.
That becomes more important the older you get.
Those basic things,
the things you started out with.
You know, there's a circle around the sun,
and it all comes right back around.
You end up being more concerned with
just being able to eat and get it out of you again.
Yeah, and that it doesn't come back up as...
some other form.
And just, you know...
Some other way.
If somebody would just change your diapers,
your back wouldn't hurt.
They'd just roll you over.
You wouldn't be so out of balance.
No.
But, you know, when you're young,
you know that you're never going to get old,
and everything is...
It's just going to go on...
No, it's right.
Forever.
You don't have to worry about...
sleep or food.
Don't sleep.
Or crap.
I don't do that now.
Peeing is just like breathing.
It's the easiest thing in the world.
You're concerned with lofty things,
like getting laid,
or how you look,
getting a good haircut,
having a cool scene, you know?
Listening to the right music.
Hey, for winter style,
I've got to get a microphone on me
with a big reverb so I can play this.
Your priorities change.
You know?
Oh, yeah.
Nice cutscene.
Yeah.
Chaz is more concerned about his tools.
Yeah, I'm a mechanic.
I kind of like the mechanic.
You know, it's...
Well, at a certain age,
you realize what's important in your life,
keeping your tools in good shape.
Yeah, indeed.
I spend a...
Use it or lose it.
I spend several days a month
doing nothing but taking care of my...
I don't want to go.
Well, use it or lose it.
That's right.
I even do that crackpot thing
that they call exercise.
That's such a silly...
I mean, it's so pointless.
It just makes you hurt.
I mean, theoretically, exercise
is supposed to, like, make you healthy, right?
Yeah, right.
Well, then why does it hurt?
No pain, no gain.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, it was hurting already.
Now it hurts worse when I exercise.
What does that tell you?
No pain, no gain there.
Good.
It's a scam, dude.
Right.
No, you could get the same benefit
if you just...
If once a year,
once every three years,
you walked from the east coast
to the west coast and back,
you get the same benefit
as all those memberships
to all those clubs you belong to.
Yeah, just once a year.
Takes a little time out.
That's right.
You get the same benefit.
You don't need all that highfalutin equipment
and the Stairmasters and all that stuff.
Talk about a stupid thing.
Dang.
A Stairmaster?
You're just trying to...
You're going to spend a hundred of dollars
to walk up and down a damn stairs.
It's just trying to take care of your tools,
you know,
keeping the tools in good shape.
After a while,
you start realizing,
oh, this shell that I carry around
and wake up in every morning.
It is a tool
and it is requiring some upkeep and repair.
Oh, they don't...
You can't get a replacement for that?
Oh.
You mean that tooth is gone forever?
Yeah.
Oh, you mean that cheekbone is gone forever?
My nut is gone forever.
Hey, that's not funny, Chad.
One like Hitler.
My hair is gone forever.
Yeah, man.
Oh, I thank God for that.
Or my friend is gone forever.
That's true, too, right there.
My brother is gone forever.
You know, relatives.
My scene, my trendy...
My haircut is gone forever.
That's right.
My coolness is gone forever.
I lost my hair.
You're not Dave.
You're not me, Dave.
My Dave is gone.
Alerts and...
First, let us ask,
does zombie Dave have beliefs?
It seems to me he does.
If we ask him where his car is,
he'll tell us that it's in the driveway.
If we ask him whether he likes basketball,
he tells us that he does.
Even if one resists the idea
that zombie Dave has beliefs,
we can still use him
to show that slack cannot be
the primary mechanism
in the self-description of our mental state.
That's blasphemy.
Well, this is from a disposition
on the psychological zombie,
or P-zombie.
I'd be careful about some of that stuff.
As it's known in the literature.
I don't feel comfortable with that.
There's a whole philosophical literature
on what are called P-zombies.
P-zombies.
They look just like you or me,
but they have no consciousness to be.
Yeah, those are like the manger babies?
Not quite.
P-zombies...
Did you see that manger babies episode of Hank Hill?
The mangy babies?
Yes, that's right.
You know that she can put her toes behind her ears?
The Christian cousin-in-law there
was doing a cable TV show
of a Christian children's show.
That's amazing.
It was so fun.
She was ready to send them all off the cliff
in a burning wreckage.
I sometimes wonder why that's an animated cartoon.
Why do they draw them?
It's real.
I mean, the people are saying those words.
They keep coming from Garland.
Those people...
Now there's actors and actresses out of work
because they don't have jobs.
They stopped using it,
and they loosed it.
They're not working.
They're not working.
They're not working.

It's all out of balance, kids.
Everything is out of balance.
It can get so out of balance
that you become pea-shy.
That where the most,
the most simple,
most taken-for-granted aspects
of your whole life
become a real challenge.
Imagine the plight of the people.
Pea-shy.
Pea zombies, nothing, man.
At least then you know what the problem is.
Yeah.
The pea-shy.
Think about that.
Think about it.
It starts with not wanting that guy,
the urinal next to you,
looking the way he is.
And you can't just let loose
when that guy's standing there.
Daring at my pee-pee.
Yeah.
But then what happens when you're out in the woods?
It's all by...
What do you do, Canary?
What do you do, Canary?

You're out there with yourself
and you're still pea-shy.
What then?
Or has Bob left you then?
I wondered if Bob left me once.
Does Bob even see the pea-shy?
One time I was out in the woods
and I did wonder if Bob had left me.
Because I was out,
and we were camping far, far from the road.
We were backpacked in
at five miles from our vehicles.
And I walked off into the woods.
The dark,
the dark is not woods.
I was out in the woods to go take a leak.
And I walked far enough way.
I was like, how far do I have to walk
where I can't see the light of the campsite anymore?
So I get deep into the woods
and I can't see the light of the campsite anymore.
And I take my pee.
And I'm just standing there
after I take my pee and shaggle it out
and all that and put it back away.
And I'm standing there just sort of
digging on that moment
that I really kind of
almost didn't know what direction to go.
Next thing I know,
I had this feeling.
I swear to God
that I knew
if I'd have stood in that same spot
for one more fraction of a second,
a big bear paw would have
swiped out and taken my head off.
But I started running.
So I don't know what made me run.
But I run and I run.
I ran right back into camp.
And I'm laughing.
But I know that bear was ready to take me out.
I didn't see the bear.
Never saw the bear.
The bear saw you, though.
I know.
I've got you.
The bear had you.

I felt the bear.
The bear smelt fear.
That's right.
Smelt the pee.
And the fear.
The fear in the pee.
The sheer pee fear.
Concentrated pee fear.
There's bears out there, friends.
They didn't get them all.
And there's things worse than bears.
That's right.
Things on two legs that are far worse than bears.
That are waiting in the dark woods
for you to take up.
Things.









Things.
Scarier than the Blair Witch.
And a lot realer.
Sort of like that movie Deliverance.
Will you know the exact moment when to bolt?
Will you know the exact fraction of a second moment
when to make your feet move faster
than you've ever made your feet move before?
Will you know that moment?
You will know when you have done it
that you did the right thing
because you'll still be alive.
Sure, it might be silly.
But you know this.
You know you're alive.
You ran.
For no reason.
Perhaps from nothing.
But it must have been the right thing
because you ain't dead.
That's right.
Whatever it was that was about to get you
didn't get you.
You don't know, my friend.
You don't know.
Unless you're real depressed.
Then you know everything's going to be screwed up.
You know everything sucks.
But if you're not depressed,
you know that you don't...
No, take it from me, friends.
I'm not depressed.
And I know this.
You don't know.
And I don't know.
But that bear knows.
There's one thing we did.
The one thing that we know
is that we're all going to die.
That's the only thing you know.
So what is the hurry?
Yeah, that bear is what...
It is out in the woods.
It's not a question of if.
It's just a question of when.
It's like your computer crashed.
One day you are going to take that walk
out away from your campsite.
Might be today.
Might be 50 years from now.
Might be 100 years from now.
They might invent a cure for death.
And you'd be fine until that piece of space junk
falls out of the sky.
That's right.
But believe me,
that walk in the woods is waiting for you.
And you might sit there in your little chair,
in your little fancy little life,
and say,
I'm not afraid.
But I guarantee you one thing, brother.
You will be.
You will feel fear.
Or maybe not.
You know, there are those who just wander through life blithely.
You know, nothing bad ever happens to them.
It's always somebody else.
And one day they die in their sleep.
Yeah, right.
And they go to heaven.
Yeah.
Nobody ever hears from them again.
They never even had to go to church.
They just never...
They had slack.
Yeah.
And went to heaven.
And it was okay.
But most of those people, friends,
are not the ones who create your favorite songs.
Or your best jokes.
Or...
Your favorite movies.
They just live their life happily on the sideline,
watching everybody else do all that stuff.
And buying those movie tickets to watch the agony and conflict
of those who just seem to walk into trouble.
For Zombie Dave ascribes precisely the same mental states to himself as we do.
By some process or other,
he'll tell you that he thinks that Bob Dylan makes good music.
How can this ability be explained?
Clearly not by appealing to slack.
For Zombie Dave doesn't have any.
Zombie Dave does the job, presumably,
either by reasoning from non-slack evidence...
Is that a comic book character?
Or by simply being thrown into the appropriate state.
You're making a good one.
It seems likely that we do it the same way.
I can see a liking, Bob.
And the slack is a red herring.
Well, this is a guy named David Chalmers
who's discussing P-zombies, philosophical zombies,
and decided to consider his zombie twin,
who's like him in every way,
except he has no interior life.
And so he calls his zombie twin...
What station is this?
Zombie Dave.
Ah.
So for each subgenius,
there is a zombie version who is completely pink...
In another dimension?
Has no soul and cannot know slack.
Must be in another dimension.
So there's somewhere there's a...
The super strength there.
It's the other...
One of the other...
Yeah, there's a...
The six-dimensional world that exists in parallel
to our...
Our four-dimensional one.
And of course, they don't have time.
There's a...
There's no time.
There's six spatial dimensions.
Who's a banker, or...
And has six spatial dimensions.
And again, but to him, it's normal, and...
Yeah, right.
You're just like a wavering blue light.
He could...
Yeah, we're...
At the bank teller thing.
Window.
Well, friends.
Waiting for the bear.
The wavering blue light.
Out in the woods.
Waiting for the bear.
Quivering, shivering in the cold.
Well, and you never know how much your life may be influenced by another dimension.
A wave or a force from another dimension.
And you also...
You might mistake it for fate or God or devils.
The good thing about escaping from the bear is that you're more alive after that than you ever were before.
Yeah, so you become more of a predator.
Every time you run...
You become...
Yeah, you become...
You value what you have a little bit more.
Every time you start to lose it.
And every time you lose something good...
Yeah, if you start to lose it, but you save it and pull it out at the last second.
And you...
Or maybe you lose it, and the next time you have something like it, you...
You see it more clearly.
Well, that's why you're...
You value things more, you see.
You know, you got a test pilot.
You don't get no next time.
But he runs it right until the test pilot.
He said most people would say...
Well, I got four seconds to pull the cord on this here ejection seat.
Test pilot says, I got four seconds to save this thing.
I got four seconds to pull this thing out of the shitter.
He sees it as being half full.
As opposed to your cowardly Volkswagen driver who sees it as half empty and doesn't want to go.
Pull the cord.
Right.
Yeah.
They get down.
They get closer to 50 feet to the ground.
They're pulling their ejection seats.
Most of you.
Well, it's...
Do you hear me, sheeple?
Are you listening to what we're saying, sheeple?
Oh, think how much easier it must be to live in blissful ignorance of the slaughterhouse.
You don't have to deal with any of the problems that smart people do.
If Frank Zappa would say, look, you few tiny percentage of people out there who are smart,
quit trying to deny it.
Face the fact you're weird, you're smart.
Just deal with it.
Take advantage of it.
You actually will find eventually a way to succeed if you just hang in there long enough.
Unfortunately, the people Frank was talking to was not us.
Who is there to speak to those less than smart?
Those who cannot see the lofty heights?
Right.

But only the deep under things.
Who but the chocolate chip cookie?
Who can answer?
For those mole men lurking.
The Morlocks who lurk and build your little machines and make your little CDs and do your little comedy shows.
I'm eating out of your trash cans.
I slept under your bridge.
I bought a Velvet Elvis.
You see this scar?
You know what?
That's...
Trump.
You don't want to know.
That's ugly.
Put that away.
I seen you in your fancy restaurants and your fine houses.
Oh, I seen you.
I stood out in the cold and I watched you.
I saw your girls skipping home from their fancy private schools.
But I'm always out there.
I'm always watching and I'm wanting and I'm coveting.
I'm coveting.
I'm always out there.
I'm the covetor.
The have-not.
I'm the have-not and I'm...
He's coming for you.
All by being old too long.
What's he going to have?
He's coming for you.
I don't mean he's coming to get you.
I mean...
He's coming for you.
He's coming for you.
I said it twisted.
I said it twisted.
I said it twisted.
I said it twisted.
I said it twisted.
I said it twisted.
I say it twisted.




Sick and twisted
This world is a sick and twisted place
And the sooner you realize it
The sooner you'll get on board
And just become another cog in the machine
And die happy and ignorant
Is it me that's sick and twisted
Or is it this world that's diseased
The system
Is it the system that's sick and twisted
We're merely a reflection of the illness we see in society around us
It's an empowerment
Is the human race sick and twisted
Everything
Is mother nature sick and twisted
Been kind of a strange winter now hasn't it
Been unseasonably warm I'd say
Why even warmer than last year
And why they say it
It may get warmer yet
You know
Some of those cities
Amsterdam and New Orleans
They're
In Venice
You start to feel the rising tides
Find some adventure in your life
And start a company that salvages
Icebergs
Brings them back down to the states
Makes drinking water out of them
Start the company that salvages
Underwater
Water buildings
You know they're lying to you about that global warming
It's not a question of if
It's just a when thing
It's already too late
They've kicked the motor over
It's started up
There's no going back now
Only mysterious science can save us
It's what got us into this
Big science
Not big science
Mysterious science
The kind of science that says
Hey
Let's go dig up all the oil
Hey if it's a sufficiently advanced science
It will appear to be magic
And if it's really really advanced
It'll just seem like coincidence
Been having any coincidences lately in your life my friend?
Could that be how the aliens are trying to communicate
With you?
Singling you out
Because you are the chosen one
The smart one that Frank Zappa was talking to
Yes you, the listener
Not just the generic listener
But you, the one actually listening now
You
Is it you?
Who is now being singled out
And has been throughout your entire life
As if it were some sort of a movie
As if you were being pulled along by the strings of a puppet master
With a sick and twisted sense of humor?
Who somehow forced you into
Strange conflicting absurdities
Of paradoxical life situations
Or are you maybe just imagining things
And you know we're all just people
Right?
That neighbor next door
Couldn't possibly be from another world
You couldn't possibly be from another world
That can't really happen
Mars could not possibly ever have
Actually been closer to the sun
And Earth the frozen, polluted, destroyed shell
That would be crazy
The idea of swapping planets
Just because one had been ruined
Mars into Earth's orbit
And pushing Earth with all its messed up
Screwed up humanity on it
Out into the outer reaches of the solar system
Swapping planets?
It's nuts, crazy, crazy stuff
Crazy stuff
I think I'll just read the newspaper
Instead of this science fiction
That'll make a lot more sense
That'll be more believable, yeah
Yeah
Are we being controlled by secret forces?
Are aliens facing us?
Are we being controlled by space monsters?
Bringing a startling new world?
Do people think you're strange?
Do you?
There is an answer

Quit your job, slack off, and praise Bob
I'm not afraid
I like it out there
Would you go with me?
No
It is a time of frequent immorality
A time when the old standards of trouble
Were just a fight
All time champion of false promises and exaggerated claims
Religion
Fire, and smoke and burning and torture
And suffer and burn and choke and scream
And suffer and burn and choke and scream
Fire, and smoke and burning and torture
And guilt and perversion
And suffer and burn and choke and scream
And suffer and burn and choke and scream
And cry, and forget them all
ever and ever till the end of time.
Witchcraft and opportunism.
Oh, God.
Devil worship and necrophilia.
Naughty peasant.
Witchcraft and opportunism.
That's it. I'm out of here.
Devil worship and necrophilia.
Oh, sorry.
He loves you and he needs money.
All powerful, all perfect, all knowing and all wise.
All powerful, all perfect, all knowing and all wise.
All powerful, all perfect, all knowing and all wise.
You talk about a good bullshit story.
How would I go about it?
How would I go about creating a half-man, half-monkey type creature?
I'm sorry, that would be playing God.
God's smart. I want my monkey man.
Raw sex is peddled in every drugstore.
Religion takes in billions of dollars.
Raw sex is peddled in every drugstore.
Religion takes in billions of dollars.
Raw sex is peddled in every drugstore.
Religion takes in billions of dollars.
I want it.
I will force my loathsome self-assertion,

to accept Japan's

It's time to kick God's doors down.
The bizarre, the strange, and the occult.
Ministers, priests, and educators.
And they always need a little more.
And that was by the bishop, dear friends.
By our friend the bishop.
