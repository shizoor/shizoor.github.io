1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,920
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,620
The Self-Genius Power of Swatch.

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,080
Now, I want all privately owned radios to be immediately impounded.

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,060
After you've done that, report back to me.

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:38,000
Ah, dear friends, last episode was all new and pretty serious.

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,720
This one is pretty old and very cosmic.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,740
It's not, however, a rerun, but more like a long-lost classic recently unearthed.

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,420
I found the master recording of an ESO Swamp Radio and Brain Rot Theater show

9
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,980
that I had sat in on while visiting.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,880
I was visiting WCSB in Cleveland in July of 1994,

11
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,280
long before I'd moved there.

12
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,980
I didn't really know the host, the late Professor Chaz Smith,

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,600
or his regular guest, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, all that well then,

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,700
or even Princess Wee, who was just my buddy then.

15
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,220
But we were all young and in our prime with the fire in the belly,

16
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,680
and it really shows in shows like this.

17
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,980
I've used the P.S.

18
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,440
of it before on Ancient Hours of Slack,

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,540
numbers 455 through 457,

20
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,520
which were rerun again a few years back,

21
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,000
but it was all chopped up and besmirched and intercut with other tracks,

22
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,600
which was fine then,

23
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,120
but this recording actually stands alone just fine,

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,560
probably much better,

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,920
and this is certainly a superior reproduction of the original master recording.

26
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,540
It was, in fact,

27
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,720
two hours long,

28
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,040
and will probably run the second hour next week.

29
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,400
Here, then,

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,520
is a remarkable historic document,

31
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:15,140
the original master recording of the July 1994 ESO Swamp Radio Show

32
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,980
from WCSB,

33
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,540
which contains, among other epic things,

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,820
the uncut improv session later called Lonesome Cowboy Dave in Space,

35
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,520
not to be confused with Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

36
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,580
Cowboy Dave in Hell,

37
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,860
or Lonesome Cowboy Dave in Neighborworld.

38
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Praise Bob,

39
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,120
praise Chaz and Dave.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,960
Oh, and by the way,

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,080
I think all the music is being performed live at the station.

42
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:45,980
Yeah.

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,260
Yeah.

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:50,840


45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,040
Yeah.

46
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,900
Yeah.

47
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,800
Yeah.

48
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:56,620
Yeah.

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,420
Yeah.

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:57,680
Yeah.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,640
Yeah.

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,440
Yeah.

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,500


54
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,500


55
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,500


56
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,500


57
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,500


58
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,500


59
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,740
Yeah.

60
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,540
Yeah.

61
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,780
Yeah.

62
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,320
Yeah.

63
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,580
Yeah.

64
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,440
Yeah.

65
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,660
Yeah.

66
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,280
Yeah.

67
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:11,480
Men of Earth, seize all atomic testing.

68
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,760
90,000 TV channels will praise Bob.

69
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,520
Bob.

70
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,540
The day when they pass out sandwiches in little yellow trucks.

71
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,020
There'd be one smiling face standing out there.

72
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,740
It'd be the face of J.R. Bob Dodds handing out plasma bags to children in need.

73
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,160
All the children in Joker Town go to buy their plastic bags from Bob.

74
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,540
No wonder.

75
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,740
They don't have any sold.

76
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,180
on the shoes of their feet.

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,840
They walk around flapping around

78
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,800
like little clowns in a circus,

79
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,480
but they're happy all the time

80
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,760
because that ice cream truck has got the right stuff.

81
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,340
Them the best kind of frozen plastic bags.

82
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,500
Bob could sell plastic ice cream bags in Joker Town.

83
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,700
He could sell ice to Eskimos,

84
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,760
and he could sell hate even to a subgenius.

85
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,540
Bob Dobbs sold ice to Eskimos.

86
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,800
He sold the plans to the Brooklyn Bridge.

87
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,080
He sold the Brooklyn Bridge.

88
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,860
He'd been around the world a thousand times.

89
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,800
He'd sold more things than you'd ever seen,

90
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,800
but he was born to sell.

91
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,940
He was born to sell.

92
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,060
Yeah, he got to start selling lightning rods.

93
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,680
He'd sell a family of lightning rods

94
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,100
and then he'd pray down a lightning bolt to demonstrate it.

95
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,860
Usually worked.

96
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,040
These ain't the old ways.

97
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,580
You get them coming both ways.

98
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,220
You get them coming and going, see?

99
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,540
Now, that's the old school.

100
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,780
That's not a con job.

101
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,300
That's not a con job, see?

102
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,180
That's just giving people what they want.

103
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,200
What they want, see?

104
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,000
You gotta give them what they want.

105
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,260
It's just that they have to be told what they want,

106
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,640
and that's what we're here for.

107
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,180
Friends.

108
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,800
We just want to tell you what you want.

109
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,040
Of course, we're gonna hint around about it

110
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,520
because we can't just come out and say it.

111
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,580
It wouldn't do you any good to learn it that way.

112
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,300
No, you need instructions.

113
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,760
You must be carefully instructed.

114
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,160
You must listen.

115
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,520
You must pay attention.

116
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,660
You must close your mind to all extraneous thoughts.

117
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,580
Now listen.

118
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,380
Begin.

119
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,700
Now listen.

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,400
We just want to ease you into it, kids.

121
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,980
You know, it can backfire if you try to go too far too fast.

122
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,940
Too much too fast.

123
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,320
Look what happened to him.

124
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:08,080
Look at that pathetic excuse for a biped.

125
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,360
Sad, ain't it?

126
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,120
It could happen to you, too.

127
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,120
So that's why we...

128
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,780
You know, we don't want to hurt you.

129
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,040
And we don't want the lawsuits.

130
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,480
So you'll just have to be patient.

131
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,280
Understanding, or in this case, its opposite,

132
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,940
can only be imparted over a long period of time,

133
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,040
unless you're spending a lot on it.

134
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,100
We could probably turn you on to it real fast.

135
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,000
If you wanted to, you know, pay for the plane ticket to Malaysia.

136
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm in Asia.

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,980
This music reminds me of the lovely old folk songs that the natives there in Dobstown

138
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:12,260
and the jungles outside of Dobstown in Malaysia used to play while the bobbies work out in the fields.

139
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,940
They turn yak butter.

140
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,500
Some of them get around and start dancing and sing them Malaysian folk songs

141
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,840
while they're churning the butter and their feet would just get all sores.

142
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,660
Well, Bob and Gordon would sit up there with the hot buttered rum martini

143
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,400
being fanned by sycophants,

144
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:38,860
taking the occasional pot shot at anything that moved out in the jungle just for fun.

145
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,200
I'm in infamous potpourri.

146
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,280
I'm in an infamous potpourri.

147
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,360
A lavish land where everyone laid everything at everyone's feet at all times.

148
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,020
Where there was no room for any kind of incidents of pain or miscreant feeling.

149
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,120
Everything was according to plan.

150
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,800
What a super sumptuous planet it was.

151
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,400
It was a sumptuous planet.

152
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,180
We fed well on it.

153
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,920
Now it's used up.

154
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,280
We'll have to move on.

155
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,220
Edible!

156
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,040
Move on!

157
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,160
Yee-haw! New planet!

158
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,960
I can't breathe! I can't...

159
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,280
Yeah, I was gonna go on a planet diet, but I decided to put it off till tomorrow.

160
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,060
I thought I was gonna chew cosmic holes, big pieces of black debris

161
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,280
coming down my gutter every day, every minute, every hour.

162
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,020
I'd keep on eating until everything was gone.

163
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,600
I'd chew all the matter up.

164
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,000
I'd chew into empty space.

165
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,420
That's... It's God's will.

166
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,520
He said be fruitful and multiply and eat up everything and overpopulate

167
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,620
until you turn the planet over on its side from the weight of sheer humanity.

168
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,780
And then... start eating.

169
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,400
And just dig in, folks.

170
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:00,700
Mmm!

171
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,000
That's a pensive, mighty good planet.

172
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,360
Just dig right in.

173
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,340
I mean, look, I'm eating the lizard, too.

174
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,060
Ah!

175
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,500
Yep.

176
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,920
Now, what else is there around here?

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,640
Mars. No, that didn't taste that good.

178
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,320
Kind of dry.

179
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,680
No, there's a funny face.

180
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,940
Venus. No, that's bitter.

181
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,460
It's bitter.

182
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,760
It's kind of got a bad tang to it.

183
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,280
It needs like, send a woman to eat it.

184
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,400
Stop it!

185
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,180
Look, Jupiter!

186
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,300
No, yes.

187
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:27,680
Hey, let's...

188
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,420
Give me that salt.

189
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,480
All right!

190
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,300
Let's see how Jupiter tastes with some salt on it.

191
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,040
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

192
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,680
Ah!

193
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:37,880
Ah!

194
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,600
Oh, la, la.

195
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,340
Quel saveur.

196
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,640
Mmm, mmm!

197
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,920
Le saveur de Jupiter!

198
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,680
Le grand pleudard!

199
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,240
I want the red spot.

200
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,740
I'll get the red spot.

201
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,400
I feel a little bloated.

202
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,820
Aye, aye, aye.

203
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,140
The Planet Eaters.

204
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,300
Sometimes their brains were no bigger than the average peanut.

205
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,840
A few of them gathered around Greek concubines and argued theology.

206
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,740
They weren't made for the task at hand.

207
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,320
They weren't really a warrior clan.

208
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,040
They didn't enjoy eating planets, per se.

209
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,620
It was a hobby that had to be fulfilled in some traditional mission.

210
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,060
But they continued.

211
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,020
They persevered, begrudgingly.

212
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,340
They had to.

213
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:37,060
And even after their great bulk became so vast that their own bones could not support them

214
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:42,580
and they had to be fed planets by the Planet Delivery Angels.

215
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,440
Planet Delivery Angels.

216
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,020
Mount Olympus.

217
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,340
Yep.

218
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,560
Went downhill after Dobbs moved it to Malaysia.

219
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,640
Kidnapped.

220
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,540
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.

221
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:01,920
Huh?

222
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,440
This is ESO Radio.

223
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,240
And my name is Chaz.

224
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:14,780
And there are some people in the studio tonight that will be speaking.

225
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,520
And they are Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

226
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,040
That's me.

227
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,820
The Reverend Ivan Stang.

228
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,760
That's me.

229
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,700
And...

230
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,140
Oh, I'm the Princess Wiardo.

231
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:43,920
And the mighty princes Wiardo will be connecting their synapses and flying at an altitude of

232
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,420
50,000 feet above the surface of the moon, which is just high enough to be snagged up

233
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,180
by the Columbia if something should go wrong.

234
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,000
So don't fear.

235
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,400
Oh, the moon is just a condiment.

236
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,060
It's just the onion we put on the great bun of...

237
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,720
The great onion ring.

238
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,540
Just a little piece of chutney we put on the window loof.

239
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,480
Just a little tiny spicy taste to add to the rest.

240
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,780
The phone number is 6873515.

241
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,340
And maybe I will answer it.

242
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,080
And maybe I won't.

243
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,380
But I probably will.

244
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,980
And he is the finest chef.

245
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:31,140
He adds just the perfect species to each planet that will create the most toxic hell runoffs

246
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,940
from industrial pollution and so forth.

247
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:42,340
They're just the flavors we most enjoy in a fine, fine steaming hot bowl of planet.

248
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,680
This is not the perspiration they drop in the pan.

249
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,560
The perspiration from his nipples.

250
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:53,200
Now, this is a real, real toxic waste of every kind to add to the...

251
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,060
Ultimately, I suppose the dish is a nice soul.

252
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,960
It's cultivation of a nice human.

253
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,100
You don't want to say, but a human mostly soul, right?

254
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,000
Human soul.

255
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,400
Yes, with nipples.

256
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,520
As you say.

257
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,940
Oh, again, the word come up.

258
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,780
But I feel it.

259
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,460
Your transmission.

260
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,020
Be you.

261
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,640
We are flying over Mars.

262
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:24,280
And the mountain appears to be in the shape of a gigantic pipe.

263
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,120
We would call it a pipe shape.

264
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,040
You know, smoke a pipe.

265
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:29,860
Uh...

266
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,940
What's the white stuff on the pipe?

267
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,280
I think it might be creme de glace or something.

268
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,680
It's a volcanic pipe on the surface of Mars.

269
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,660
That's where the comet hits.

270
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,720
Is it evil?

271
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,820
And when it hits, it throws out those white...

272
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:50,240
That's the ash that builds up on the rim of the volcanic Martian pipe.

273
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,140
But, cool, can we go close now?

274
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,780
Because I'm getting very hungry.

275
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,900
I want to eat the babnose.

276
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,420
The other part.

277
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,000
Anyway, we go down there.

278
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,820
Uh, the whipped cream is, uh, spewing out of the volcano.

279
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,380
Oh, look at that.

280
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,540
Oh, my God.

281
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,240
It's all...

282
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,880
Oh, my God.

283
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,420
It is a fiery dottle of hot whipped cream.

284
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,300
I think that's more than a piece of...

285
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:22,920
Our computer shows the pipe-shaped volcano to be 50 times the height of Mount Everest,

286
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,200
the earthly Himalayas.

287
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,940
This is so exciting.

288
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,700
I can't remember.

289
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,220
Are you...

290
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:29,440
What?

291
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:29,600
What are you doing?

292
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,120
Oh, look.

293
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,940
Oh, look.

294
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,520
Oh, look.

295
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,380
I think the face, he look like he smiled or something.

296
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,960
There's some kind of stupid look on the face.

297
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,380
It has...

298
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:48,060
The entire plateau seems to coincidentally appear as if it were a gigantic sculpture

299
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,800
of a smiling human face.

300
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,000
See, that's what I told you, Congratul...

301
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,860
I told you.

302
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,020
I told you.

303
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,580
I told you.

304
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,580
You're right.

305
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,060
That's right.

306
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,420
Oh, wow.

307
00:15:59,420 --> 00:15:59,420


308
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:06,260
We consider this simply a geological, Martian geophysical anomaly similar to the so-called

309
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,460
Pee-wee Herman face on Mars and the alleged Elvis face.

310
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:17,600
Obviously, superstitious people will see these same things in clouds.

311
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,640
I myself saw Jimi Hendrix in the clouds just the other night.

312
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,960
Oh, I get that one.

313
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,360
All right.

314
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,980
I'm sorry.

315
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,280
I'm sorry.

316
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,400
That was back on a...

317
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,940
All right.

318
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,660
I had I had I had visited up here before…

319
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:44,960
This hospital in Calabasas has no liberals.

320
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,080


321
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,180
That's the living, you know what I'm saying?

322
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,180


323
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,180


324
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,180


325
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,460
Now jan CSV about 20 million years ago and the peace of the Jchluss himself needs to

326
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,740
have z matches here.

327
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:58,480
So Ful King, can I have a glass?

328
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:58,740
Obtained.

329
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:04,160
taking effect in about five minutes, so just sit back and relax and enjoy the rest of it.

330
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,960
Your body will feel just fine in a few minutes if you don't need to relax.

331
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:15,420
Take your three doses of Can-D at 1100.

332
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,280
Thank you.

333
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,280
The tuna fish cans marked Bob Tuna with the large pipe monogram on the outside

334
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,400
are not fit for consumption at this time because there's been some sort of mix-up with the commissary there,

335
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,360
so please just relax and enjoy one of the cakes or some pie.

336
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,320
Here's Planet Pizza. I'd like to order a Planet Pizza, if you please.

337
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,060
One Planet Pizza? Would you like anchovies on that?

338
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,320
Of course, I'd like a lot of continents and seas and oceans and all the usual, you know,

339
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,860
just make it one of those Planet Lovers special.

340
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,060
Uh.

341
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,860
Uh, let's see.

342
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,920
There's no object. I'd like to order three of them.

343
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,740
Three. Three Planet Pizzas.

344
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,640
Uh, you want those populated planets?

345
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,580
Of course.

346
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,580
Post-industrial or pre-industrial?

347
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,780
I mean, do you want a dinosaur-type planet or do you want a human-type planet?

348
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,520
And this is 759-6705-4321.

349
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,000
Uh.

350
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,520
Yes.

351
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,920
Oh, well.

352
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,840
Is that Visa or MasterCard?

353
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,940
I'm not quite sure which, but money is no object.

354
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,080
Let's get it rolling.

355
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,300
I'm terribly hungry.

356
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:38,240
Well, that Planet Pizza will be there in 30 minutes or it's free.

357
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,720
Well, that's an absolute record time. I would appreciate it. Thank you very much.

358
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,240
Thank you for your order.

359
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,160
And thank you for your organs.

360
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:54,820
We want you to remember when you order some of the new pie that we have going for us over here at Rex.

361
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,120
And with this pizza that is free delivery.

362
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:05,860
Not only you get a Planetary Pizza of your own choice, you also get, um, I think it was Macaroni Salad.

363
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,520
And also some, uh, egg, a soda. You get.

364
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:19,640
And, uh, we'll be sending that little, um, almond-eyed gray humanoid around to your door to collect those organs.

365
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,460
So...

366
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,080
Snappy.

367
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,740
He'll be in the cute little uniform.

368
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,760
So, don't be afraid.

369
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,440
They're your friends. They're here to help.

370
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,160
They're our brothers from the stars.

371
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,340
You should believe anything they whisper into your ear in the dead of night as you try to sleep.

372
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Whisper, whisper, whisper.

373
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,740
They're your friends.

374
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:49,760
They want to teach humanity and lead us into a new age of enlightenment under their gray jackboot.

375
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,160
Whisper, whisper. Now listen, now listen, now listen, now listen, now listen.

376
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:03,060
If you wake up in a vat of poison with little aliens standing around outside the vat,

377
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,520
wrapping, tying napkins around their necks, sharpening their knives and forks,

378
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,580
be glad because you've just fell into the hands of the good aliens.

379
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,440
The bad aliens are far, far worse.

380
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,320
Whoa!

381
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,580
Oh, they're not like...

382
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,600
The thing.

383
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,780
That was a cuddly little benji of an alien compared to what we're...

384
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,480
They aren't like aliens in that movie Aliens.

385
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:41,380
Those are silly little werewolves among monsters compared to what we're talking about.

386
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,700
That is in the box.

387
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,740
What we're talking about is more like what's growing in your refrigerator right now.

388
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,600
That's what it looks more like.

389
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,020
What is this?

390
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,420
What is this?

391
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,980
The effect is it turns you into the alien.

392
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,160
But man, take my word for it, it's worth it.

393
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,660
It's great, man.

394
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,140
It's cool, you'll love it.

395
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,380
I feel so much better now that I got into this program.

396
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,180
It's for your own good.

397
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,560
I feel so much better.

398
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,860
I feel so much better.

399
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,340
What's the matter, you afraid?

400
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,340
What's the matter, you chicken?

401
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,280
Come on, man, everybody's doing it.

402
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,300
Go ahead.

403
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:34,560
Stroke the alien and collect the dew that builds up on the side of its neck like a appendage.

404
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,520
Go ahead.

405
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,220
Now demagnetize your head.

406
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,240
Okay?

407
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,300
I think you know what to do next.

408
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,380
I don't think you're the kind of listener that I'd have to explain that to, now are you?

409
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:54,700
What?

410
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,480
Oh, you think I've grown up to be a snitch?

411
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:58,480


412
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:58,480


413
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:58,480


414
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,560
You know, I think they're the kind of listener that I'd have to explain how to do this.

415
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,200
No, I think you're the kind of listener that's a snitch.

416
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,200


417
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,200


418
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,200


419
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,460
Oh, they like it too.

420
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,760
Oh, they're first damn good.

421
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,320
Excuse, I don't know what to do next.

422
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,080
You stand up on the hillside with your bat call and blow into the bat call.

423
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,920
It's not like a moose call or a duck call.

424
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,300
You can't hear it.

425
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,320
Yeah, but it's super.

426
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,140
And just make sure you've got your antidote pudding ready for when that bat lands on your face.

427
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,580
You're going to have to use that pudding mighty quick.

428
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,240
But it's worth it.

429
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,680
You'll dig it.

430
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,700
Well, it's always scary the first time.

431
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,980
That's part of the kit, man.

432
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,100
Come on, everybody's doing it.

433
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,900
I ain't never going to do it.

434
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,140
I'm too old to do it.

435
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,280
Aren't you susceptible to peer group pressure?

436
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,660
I'm too old for it.

437
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,540
What are you, some kind of a weirdo?

438
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,100
Yes.

439
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,180
No, I'm not a weirdo.

440
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,160
I want to be like everyone else.

441
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,760
Good, then you'll take this little alien home.

442
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,860
I am a weirdo.

443
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,140
Stop rubbing your leg.

444
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,340
I'm confused again.

445
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,760
I don't think there's a reason for her.

446
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,560
Don't be confused.

447
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,240
It's something you find when you open the door.

448
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,120
You take these keys, and one of the keys says Bob on it.

449
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,500
You stick it in the lock, and you open up the door.

450
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,480
And if you're lucky, the green carpet rolls out.

451
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,520
And if you're not, the red carpet rolls out.

452
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,480
That was 1959, I think it was.

453
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,220
I was working in a basement in a church in Akron.

454
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,580
I was working at St. Helens.

455
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,540
I was a teen student.

456
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,660
Then I saw this pipe.

457
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,100
It was by the furnace.

458
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,120
I had to fix the furnaces.

459
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,360
It took me four and a half hours to fix this one damn furnace.

460
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,520
I blew my leg off.

461
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,800
And there was this pipe.

462
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,580
And this pipe was always lit.

463
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,660
I swear to God, I swear to Jesus, God has always stayed lit.

464
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,480
I could never put the thing out.

465
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,260
I put aluminum foil on top of it.

466
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,620
I stuck an apple in the top of the pipe, and it would always, always smoke.

467
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,960
What is the symbology of the...

468
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,160
...of the pipe?

469
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:26,060
It's surely there's something more than merely some juvenile adoration of tobacco or whatever.

470
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,260
Nay.

471
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,880
It is...

472
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,360
Is it...

473
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,660
Is it that...

474
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:38,900
That vortex of movement that goes into the bowl of the pipe, up through the stem, into Bob,

475
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:46,560
and then out his nose again to be inhaled yet again with that flamethrower-like effect?

476
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:52,660
Constantly happening between his left nostril and the bowl of the sacred pipe?

477
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,940
It's an ancient buffalo woman put the pipe in his mouth, and he can't get it out.

478
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,160
It's like the story of Trickster.

479
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,180
She was...

480
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,720
...beeping with his mind.

481
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,680
And so she made sure that it would never, ever come out.

482
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:16,540
And then she turned into a white buffalo and rolled over three times and scraped out...

483
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,880
...a message in the sand.

484
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,420
In kicking money, too.

485
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,840
For all the people to see.

486
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,900
And the message said, drink Coca-Cola.

487
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,900
It's a joke on your own, Farmit.

488
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:36,320
It said, roll up in a puddle of stink in some fleabag hotel, drink Coca-Cola indeed.

489
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,700
I was withering up.

490
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,740
I needed something different.

491
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,360
I...

492
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,680
I needed...

493
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,440
That's the way the aliens always do it.

494
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,540
You know, just when you're sick.

495
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:46,540


496
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,900
You're thinking they're gonna do the most cosmic thing.

497
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:54,620
They do a whole series of incredible crop circles, and suddenly, there it says...

498
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,220
Like a television commercial or like on the radio.

499
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,480
Pepsi.

500
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,880
You have got to be kidding.

501
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,220
I didn't know...

502
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,680
You have got to be kidding, okay?

503
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,860
We have a god to be kidding?

504
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,460
How...

505
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,680
Yes, you're not correct in that.

506
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,500
In that, uh...

507
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,700
Yes, you're right.

508
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,460
I don't see what's so funny about...

509
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,520
You have a god.

510
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,340
We do have a god to be kidding.

511
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,860
We have to.

512
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,580
We were called, we're called ministers, man.

513
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,460
We have to kid.

514
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,940
I mean, we...

515
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,920
I'm a minister.

516
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,540
Hey, hey, Rev, I'm a minister.

517
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,160
I'm a minister, I know what to do.

518
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,580
Say?

519
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,400
Can I be your Monsignor now?

520
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,760
Huh?

521
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,420
I wanna be your Monsignor now.

522
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,060
You can be anything this time around.

523
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,060
You can be...

524
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,440
You can be the moon swan you're...

525
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,240
You could be a turkey in the sky.

526
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,700
You could be Charlie Manson.

527
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,660
You could be a sidewalk.

528
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,660
You could be anything.

529
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,320
You're trapped being a human.

530
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,340
I could be anything.

531
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,520
Can I be the bishop of Hawaii?

532
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,420
If you'd let me out of these bars,

533
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,940
if you'd open this jail cell,

534
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,460
I could be anything.

535
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,680
If I had a gun, I'd start my own religion.

536
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,280
Every day is X day when you have a gun.

537
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,380
The gun.

538
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,340
The gun.

539
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,680
Because it has no sex.

540
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,040
The gun is the perfect teacher.

541
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,840
Hyperclesians 914.

542
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,440
I'll have you know.

543
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,640
Amen to the amen for that.

544
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,320
Hyperclesians, what was the...

545
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,400
What are the numbers again?

546
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,140
914.

547
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,380
914, which is also a drug made by the Hells Angels, I heard.

548
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,200
It was 914.

549
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,520
Wasn't that the drug that...

550
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,800
No, that's the French abortion pill.

551
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,560
Oh, that's right.

552
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,740
The French abortion pill.

553
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,780
Now, the...

554
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,140
We were talking...

555
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,640
Do you French, I think is the...

556
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,520
Do you French?

557
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,640
No, I don't...

558
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,420
I have no idea.

559
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,200
But I remember that you were talking to me previously.

560
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,680
You had mentioned...

561
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,580
You mentioned the...

562
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,120
The acronym from the crown or something about the crown.

563
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,040
You know, so that the...

564
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,080
When the upshot would be that when this...

565
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,860
When everyone got ruptured, so to speak,

566
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,020
that the crown would...

567
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,080
Some sort of crown or the...

568
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,860
What the...

569
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,540
The end of the...

570
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,500
Sephiroth.

571
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,380
Or the separation.

572
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,440
No, it was the crown.

573
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,200
It wasn't the crown.

574
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,840
I mean, it wasn't the crown.

575
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,000
Hey, what...

576
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,700
I'm getting...

577
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,740
I'm burning up.

578
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,480
Is anybody else hot in here?

579
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,640
Do you smell smoke?

580
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,640
You can't...

581
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,200
No.

582
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,400
Uh-uh.

583
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,480
God, it's burning the cornstarch off my mucklux.

584
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,300
Whoa, my feet are...

585
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,800
Pussy, no!

586
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,380
Hey, I thought you were gonna tell me

587
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,760
if my face was on fire.

588
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:40,760


589
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:40,760


590
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:40,760


591
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,420
Yeah!

592
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,360
You said you would tell me if my face was on fire.

593
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:46,880
Oh!

594
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,240
My...

595
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,180
My legs!

596
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,580
It's time for Reverend Stang to go to hell.

597
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,620
My legs.

598
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,640
My legs.

599
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,400
I'm sliding.

600
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,900
Preacher, I'm sliding over to the other side.

601
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,040
It's time for you to go to hell, Stang.

602
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,020
I can feel the fire.

603
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,540
As best as pants.

604
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,040
Great.

605
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,040
Step in front of the inquisitory box.

606
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,560
Damn you, Reverend Stang.

607
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,220
Listen to me.

608
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,520
Step in front of the inquisitory box.

609
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,680
You've been accused of...

610
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,460
What the hell is he accused of against me?

611
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,280
You are going to H-E-double hockey sticks, buddy.

612
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,140
I will have no fear.

613
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,000
Fear is the mind killer.

614
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,600
Fear is the little death which brings me...

615
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,480
Yeah, right.

616
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,620
Uh, Bridges, can you read off some charges against this guy, please?

617
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,560
Hey, I've got my asbestos suit on.

618
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,840
You can charge me all you want, Johnny.

619
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,540
That's the first one.

620
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,600
That's the first thing you stand accused of.

621
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,020
Hey!

622
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,820
You're getting bitter with this material world all the time calling yourself a centipede.

623
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,840
Uh...

624
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,740
Uh...

625
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,960
Was that a caller?

626
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,580
No, that was an accusation.

627
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,040
An accusation.

628
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,680
We need more caller souls.

629
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,520
The bucket isn't half full yet.

630
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,860
Bob won't be pleased.

631
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,720
Bob won't be pleased if we...

632
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,680
6-8-7-3-5-1-5.

633
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,420
Call and deposit your soul.

634
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,940
There was another one.

635
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,520
Oh, look.

636
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,760
Bob's bucket's held up.

637
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:10,760


638
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,120
It's full.

639
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,480
Look at that little old soul.

640
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,500
Oh, it's squiggling around.

641
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,020
Look at that.

642
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,400
Like a little tadpole.

643
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,060
I'm gonna wipe it on the end of the table and kill it.

644
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,140
Whoops, he hit.

645
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:18,440
Ow!

646
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,720
I'd like to donate my soul.

647
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,440
Oh, you're...

648
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:22,860
I...

649
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,700
She'd like to donate her soul.

650
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,960
Oh, it's...

651
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,620
Let me whiff it.

652
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,440
We need to chew the organs.

653
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,360
Oh, it's a ticklish one, isn't it?

654
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,540
You've got a ticklish soul now.

655
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:32,940
Admit it.

656
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,140
Never mind.

657
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,280
I've changed my mind.

658
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:35,540
Goodbye.

659
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:35,900
Bye.

660
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,940
Oh, that's a used soul.

661
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,400
We've already used that one.

662
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,500
It's too late now.

663
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,640
She can't change her mind, can she?

664
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,300
Change?

665
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,300
Change?

666
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,860
There is no change.

667
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,800
Changing your mind?

668
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,940
There is no...

669
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,780
Changing your mind?

670
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,480
Chump change in this media swamp.

671
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,900
We need...

672
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,200
We're talking big money, friends.

673
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,340
Big money.

674
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,000
You know what a human soul is worth?

675
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,500
About 5,000 bucks, man.

676
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:02,600
That's right.

677
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,100
It's about...

678
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,000
That's exactly...

679
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,920
You are very close.

680
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,720
It's $5,631.

681
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,920
This is going right...

682
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,740
I'm using it for...

683
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,400
But it's made up of...

684
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,740
A Japanese soul is slightly...

685
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,520
Slightly more valuable right now.

686
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:12,820
Inflatable.

687
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,240
But isn't it made up of 97% water?

688
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,560
You know, one of the reasons why I was calling is because I thought it would be a perfect tribute

689
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,660
because this being the 25th year anniversary of the first music and arts festival held on the moon,

690
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,200
that I thought we should take a few moments to think about.

691
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,280
To salute those freak flagging astronauts.

692
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,160
Well, that's what we've been doing all night.

693
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,480
We've been having a cultural planet on the moon.

694
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,720
Some of us even planted some fags.

695
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,580
We ate it.

696
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,280
We danced around the donuts and sang...

697
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,140
What was that song about?

698
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,060
Chrysler's and Plymouth?

699
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:43,960
It was...

700
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,660
You can't get the bonfire very high in that thin, rarefied atmosphere.

701
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,080
No, there's no O2.

702
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,000
And we laid in the craters.

703
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,200
You were singing that song about the big dipper.

704
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,680
Whose dipper?

705
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,540
The craters.

706
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,200
The sheep dipper.

707
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,400
The one that sang that song back then.

708
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,760
Oh, the sheep dipper.

709
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,260
Now, I didn't think...

710
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,420
Now, let's keep this clean, boys.

711
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,140
He didn't come there.

712
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,640
No.

713
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,240
He didn't.

714
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,660
Let's not be talking about big dippers and so forth.

715
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,320
And critters.

716
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,460
They said that...

717
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,440
No plastic bags, please.

718
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,560
Oh, well, we already have them.

719
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,520
We already did plastic bags.

720
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,920
What are you doing in celebration, though, of this, all these, the baseball thing and

721
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,640
the moon and everything?

722
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,840
There's so many anniversaries, I don't know which one to keep track of anymore.

723
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,300
No, I just came back from big X Day pilgrimage to Portland.

724
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,200
He had...

725
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,660
In Portland, Oregon, where heads were...

726
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,100
We launched heads and...

727
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,140
Heads were spinning up there.

728
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,520
Yeah, they actually...

729
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,100
He wore St. James's sandals, too, and he had a little prick on his back.

730
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,480
Now, I told you, Jack.

731
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:39,540
I told you.

732
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,100
I told you.

733
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,100


734
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,180
It's Penance.

735
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,460
It's Penance.

736
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,180
You told me.

737
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,140
It's all right.

738
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,880
Don't worry.

739
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,660
Everybody's like sub-G and I around here, even if they don't know it.

740
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,920
Even if they haven't paid yet.

741
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,720
Say, Wes, I got a tape from you called Radio Shorts.

742
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,160
Yes.

743
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,080
That's very true.

744
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,160
Which I haven't even opened yet.

745
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:01,840
Copy.

746
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,660
Yeah.

747
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,500
That's why you haven't, that's why you didn't hear back until now.

748
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,860
It's a lovely letter.

749
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,540
It starts off with, I'll tell you what.

750
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,780
with deer, in fact.

751
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,740
That's one of my favorite...

752
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,140
In a salutary manner.

753
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,640
I think it had to do with salads.

754
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,400
No, you were talking about the venison.

755
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,320
The tape smelled good, though.

756
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,760
I haven't listened to it yet,

757
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,000
but it did have an excellent whiff.

758
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,700
I'm afraid my cat got too close to the stamp.

759
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,720
Oh, I thought that was the pork and buckwheat.

760
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,600
No, no, no.

761
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,440
That definitely is the cat thing.

762
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:32,880
Oh.

763
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,500
I'd like to meet your cat someday.

764
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,780
You're growing whiskers here, thinking about it.

765
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,120
Yeah, I had...

766
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,400
Is there something weird like a...

767
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,760
Oh, Chaz doesn't like that because he's got ten of them.

768
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,080
Oh, no, I just wanted the M&Ms.

769
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,240
Yeah, there's a whole table full of M&Ms here.

770
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,760
This is the first radio studio I've been to

771
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:02,420
that had, like, about a square yard's worth of M&Ms

772
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,040
instead of turntables.

773
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,320
No, there's no M&Ms there.

774
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,600
You're not allowed to have M&Ms.

775
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,520
No, you're not allowed.

776
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,760
You can have M&Ms and make them like...

777
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:11,740
Sheminem.

778
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,920
The letters around.

779
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,380
You can make...

780
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,660
It's kind of like a candy Scrabble game.

781
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,720
We do that a lot up here when it gets really cold outside.

782
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,920
You're the M&Ms?

783
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,700
It's kind of like Scrabble.

784
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,140
You pick and poke, you know what I mean?

785
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,640
I don't know what you mean.

786
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,500
Get that food out of the studio now.

787
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,540
No M&Ms.

788
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,540
Well, I just thought I'd just call up and...

789
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,700
Wes, why do you...

790
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,640
Why don't you call and bring the M&Ms on the air?

791
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,780
Well, I can bring the M&Ms on the air.

792
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,460
That's a FCC ID regulator.

793
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,620
Part of the whole postage thing that I was trying to explain

794
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,420
as far as the cat thing goes.

795
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,200
Because we...

796
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,780
I don't know whether it is there,

797
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,460
but cat houses out here are fine.

798
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,220
They're legal and they're protected,

799
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,640
and we don't have to worry about it.

800
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,620
They do things with M&Ms at the cat houses in...

801
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,660
In Portland and St. Francis.

802
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,960
You can buy a map for like $2.

803
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,080
That's all.

804
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,160
And you can find...

805
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,380
You don't even have to...

806
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,200
You don't even have to worry.

807
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,380
Well, those are the visionary cities, you know.

808
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,640
Well, I don't know.

809
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,100
I was on the...

810
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,980
I spent...

811
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,900
A couple of weeks ago,

812
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,940
I was out on the West Coast.

813
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,680
Went to Portland, Olympia, and Seattle.

814
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,940
And every neighborhood I was in,

815
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,180
every shop sold espresso.

816
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,180
I mean, even auto repair places.

817
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,020
You know, entire shops sold espresso.

818
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,180
Jeez.

819
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,800
And all the boys had long hair,

820
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,660
and all the girls had short hair.

821
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,700
And everybody was a vegetarian.

822
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,020
And...

823
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,020
But they don't do that there?

824
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,080
Where?

825
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,900
Over there in the other area.

826
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,760
Well, it made me...

827
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,300
Well, no.

828
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,440
It's just the opposite.

829
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,120
Oh, right.

830
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,820
They'll kill you for doing that here.

831
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,620
Oh, they're microbi...

832
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,020
They're microbiotic.

833
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,000
Except a few small pockets.

834
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,980
There's a few small pockets.

835
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,920
They're called the beakers.

836
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,160
Yeah, where they have the...

837
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,460
They sell pocket pastries there, too.

838
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,740
I'm sorry, I mean, you know, the...

839
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,620
I don't know.

840
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,680
It was just so groovy.

841
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,460
I wanted...

842
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,180
I wanted...

843
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,880
I wanted to cut my hair.

844
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,680
I wanted to get a haircut

845
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,760
and end up looking like Dave here.

846
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,120
Where did you get a razor bank?

847
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,540
Well, see, if you cut your hair,

848
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,120
you end up looking like a woman out here.

849
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,460
Well, that...

850
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,220
Well, that was the idea, man.

851
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:19,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

852
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,200
Have you got something against that?

853
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,400
I mean, are you, you know...

854
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,640
Are you trying to dictate my gender identity?

855
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,440
Come on, please.

856
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,640
I thought...

857
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,580
I thought that out there it was okay.

858
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,740
Out there?

859
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,200
To want to look like a bald-headed woman.

860
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,200
And I don't...

861
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,800
And that was...

862
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,740
That was just a mistake.

863
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,420
That had something to do with the Merchant Marine,

864
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,040
and I didn't...

865
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,660
I didn't ever want to bring that up again.

866
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,040
I'm a bald-headed woman

867
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,020
in the body of a long-haired guy.

868
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,920
He was a long-haired demon,

869
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,960
and he was quite...

870
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,320
He was...

871
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,800
It was different then.

872
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,500
Yeah.

873
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,420
It was a different time.

874
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,380
That was a different uniform.

875
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:53,940
Yep.

876
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,820
And the Merchant Marine

877
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,940
were very, very hard on Reverend Stangs.

878
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:57,840
I...

879
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,540
He dressed...

880
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,740
Especially dressed like a woman

881
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,140
and preaching the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs

882
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,440
in the Merchant Marine at, what,

883
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,320
was 1923 or something like that?

884
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,100
Hazing was...

885
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:06,660
Yeah, that's...

886
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,460
1924.

887
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,300
1929.

888
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,920
1929 and Hazing.

889
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,420
There was a big, big article

890
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,500
in the Washington Post

891
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,180
that some courier of the...

892
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,060
I remember that...

893
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,480
It was worse on subgeniuses in the Navy.

894
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,760
They whacked them with little rulers

895
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,540
on the tushy,

896
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,520
and they made them run the gauntlet

897
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,620
back in the old days,

898
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,700
which is backwards.

899
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,200
Back before...

900
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,500
Even before Bob came along

901
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,920
to have something to blame it on.

902
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,900
And spiny critters.

903
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,280
We still wear gauntlets out here.

904
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:33,660
I don't...

905
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,940
Because when I was in Portland,

906
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,340
I was probably telling you earlier,

907
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,280
but up in Portland,

908
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:37,780
people would...

909
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,240
People wear gauntlets

910
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,900
wherever you go.

911
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,140
You go up there

912
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,700
and they drink

913
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,660
Javada pita bread,

914
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,840
and they wear gauntlet things.

915
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,740
Oh, no.

916
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,920
Where I come from,

917
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,660
you have to...

918
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,380
The gauntlets are the things

919
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,700
you run from.

920
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,480
They're not what you run in.

921
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,320
If you've been in enough gauntlets,

922
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,540
you want to run from them, too,

923
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,420
but it's still...

924
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,740
They're still tasty.

925
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,840
Yeah.

926
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,920
You can eat them,

927
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,500
but you don't want to hang around.

928
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,760
Have you noticed this...

929
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,440
That I understand.

930
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,540
The same thing here.

931
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,760
The average golfer would.

932
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,200
I don't know.

933
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,600
Have you noticed a fad

934
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,520
of teenagers dressed as vampires

935
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,020
where they're all dressed in black

936
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,380
and wear white pasty makeup

937
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,460
and dark eyeshadow?

938
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,720
What channel?

939
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,800
It's on every channel.

940
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,400
It's everywhere.

941
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,480
Yeah.

942
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,060
I mean, they were in Portland.

943
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,020
They were in Atlanta.

944
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
And maybe, for all I know,

945
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,360
they are vampires,

946
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,740
and it's just gotten to the point

947
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,620
where nobody even cares anymore

948
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,300
that living dead things,

949
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,160
supernatural monsters,

950
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:36,740
can...

951
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:37,900
Out.

952
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,020
...wander the streets

953
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,100
going in and out of rock clubs

954
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,780
and looking painfully, tragically hip.

955
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,040
I think the proliferation of vampires

956
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,320
has to do with the fact

957
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,440
that there's no really good

958
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,980
vegetarian cuisine out there.

959
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,500
And there's no good religion.

960
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,240
That's it.

961
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,240
That's it.

962
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,600
Yep.

963
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,080
That's it.

964
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:55,840
Yep, yep.

965
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,500
And, you know, what do you expect?

966
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,620
That is exactly why I called.

967
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,180
There's...

968
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,500
The religion's falling apart.

969
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,860
Werewolves and vampires

970
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,320
are going to start reappearing.

971
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,400
You know, it's the age of superstition

972
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,180
and what you believe.

973
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,140
It's going to come...

974
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,080
It's going to come true.

975
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,500
They're kids.

976
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,720
They've been watching

977
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,120
these Freddy Krueger movies and stuff.

978
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,020
But the next thing you know,

979
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,840
Freddy Krueger's...

980
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,280
Well, Freddy Krueger is real.

981
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,320
He appeared in my dreams.

982
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,440
He's got a shop up in Portland, by the way.

983
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,280
Freddy Krueger?

984
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,680
Of Nightmare on Elm Street fame?

985
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,840
So he's selling skateboards in Portland?

986
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,160
Yeah, and he's got that...

987
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,820
It's a decal thing underneath

988
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,120
that's been getting them...

989
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,400
Him and Richie Havens

990
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,020
are suing everybody.

991
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:36,440
Everybody now.

992
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,500
Yeah, and the kids think it's so cool

993
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,180
that now they're...

994
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,200
You know, it's like tattoos aren't enough.

995
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,600
Now they have to get Freddy Krueger faced.

996
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,180
They have to get burned,

997
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,460
third-degree burns

998
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,720
over their entire body

999
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,780
just to be cool.

1000
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Well, it's like the women have short hair

1001
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,500
and all the men have long hair

1002
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,200
and now it's the face thing.

1003
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,100
Oh, the face, the whole body.

1004
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,940
You know, it's the pose.

1005
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,680
If you only have your face

1006
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,280
burned down to the bone,

1007
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:05,660
that's...

1008
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:06,840
They just oppose you

1009
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,340
or you're not a real...

1010
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,460
You know, you're not a with-it raver

1011
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,600
or whatever they call it,

1012
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,240
vampire or whatever they are today.

1013
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,160
Huh?

1014
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,080
I think that's why...

1015
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,280
I know that's why I'm doing it.

1016
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,160
I know that's why I'm doing it.

1017
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:17,760
I know that's why I'm doing it.

1018
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,560
Because if you have your face

1019
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,760
burned down like Freddy Krueger,

1020
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,020
you don't even have to get

1021
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,600
your hand stamped.

1022
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,940
You can just, like, sail...

1023
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,180
Yeah, just walk in, man.

1024
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,500
You're the coolest thing there.

1025
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,760
Which I better go probably check...

1026
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,860
I got a loaf in the other...

1027
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,060
Your eye sockets?

1028
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,600
Oh, it does.

1029
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,160
Thank God when I was a kid, I had an eye socket.

1030
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,800
When I was a kid, it was only kneecapping.

1031
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,760
You know, you were cool.

1032
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,560
You got kneecapped, and then you were cool.

1033
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,260
Have you ever been eye socketed?

1034
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,320
Eye socketed?

1035
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,100
Eye socketed?

1036
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,500
I never had my knee capped.

1037
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,500
Well, you weren't in with the in crowd, see?

1038
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,460
All us cool people had to get kneecapped,

1039
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,480
and that's why we all do desk jobs now.

1040
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,200
We can't walk very good.

1041
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,680
That's the baby boomer generation.

1042
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,140
Now squat, now!

1043
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,160
Squat, now!

1044
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:00,900
Squat, now!

1045
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:01,680
Squat!

1046
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,860
We have to squat.

1047
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,600
Squat, squat, squat.

1048
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,340
Squat, squat.

1049
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,760
Squat, squat.

1050
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,380
Squat, squat.

1051
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,380
Well, I better run away.

1052
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,240
I better run away.

1053
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,120
I better run away.

1054
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:11,740
Away.

1055
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,760
Away.

1056
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,380
Away.

1057
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,500
Why don't you take that slimy dish with you, too?

1058
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,980
Slimy dish.

1059
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,840
Slimy dish.

1060
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,320
Whatever you carry around with you.

1061
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,620
Whatever you carry around with you.

1062
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,820
Whatever you carry around with you.

1063
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:32,480
I don't care if you're in Portland or Eureka.

1064
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,160
Eureka.

1065
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:33,460
Eureka.

1066
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,400
Eureka.

1067
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,440
Eureka.

1068
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:39,960
Eureka.

1069
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,720
Eureka.

1070
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,060
Eureka.

1071
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,060


1072
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,060


1073
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,060


1074
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,060


1075
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,200
Eureka.

1076
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,200


1077
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,200


1078
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,200


1079
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,200


1080
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,320
benida.

1081
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,020
benida.

1082
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,100
epida.

1083
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,140
Whale!

1084
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,700
It builds up.

1085
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,440
goes up.

1086
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,420
It builds up and your eye sockets mess.

1087
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,560
Eye sockets.

1088
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:51,940
eye sockets?

1089
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,440
It's always like mass.

1090
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,200
eye sockets.

1091
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,300
eye sockets.

1092
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,080
kryp.

1093
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,300
.

1094
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,560
Pat upstairs.

1095
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,540
Hey bud, get it ready.

1096
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,260
Right, eh.

1097
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,000
oh?

1098
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,740
don't go de d simplify right now bro.

1099
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:03,540
I.

1100
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,100
Right, I done settle in jay o.

1101
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,100


1102
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,140
I don't know what I was going for.

1103
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,580
You're supposed to be getting an attitude or something.

1104
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,220
You're behaving like this.

1105
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,560
Why do you think you're going to school?

1106
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,880
You're going and it's just disgusting.

1107
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,120
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1108
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,020
We are ashamed.

1109
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,520
Terribly, terribly, terribly, terribly.

1110
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,120
I'm ashamed of myself.

1111
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,380
I'll save that.

1112
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,140
I'll save that.

1113
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,660
Fast, fast.

1114
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,480
No, no, no.

1115
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,320
Fast, fast.

1116
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,260
Fast, fast.

1117
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,960
Fast, fast.

1118
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,580
Oh, yes.

1119
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,100
Dear friend.

1120
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:18,040
Oh, yes.

1121
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,720
The Harvest.

1122
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,380
That bucket's almost full now.

1123
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,140
It's been drinking.

1124
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:36,140


1125
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,620
He's been in for over half an hour.

1126
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,940
I wonder if the sores are going to heal up this rain.

1127
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,640
Them soles are running right over the edge of that bucket.

1128
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,220
We made a pretty good haul tonight, Dave.

1129
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,680
Burble, burble, burble.

1130
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,020
But what do we do with them now?

1131
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,500
You're a bunch of idiots, you know.

1132
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,580
Sell them to Bob.

1133
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,440
There's one of them.

1134
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,340
It's a call.

1135
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,260
Oh, no.

1136
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,240
We're idiots.

1137
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:58,620
Oh, wait.

1138
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,800
But that's what...

1139
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,560
We were getting paid to be idiots.

1140
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,500
I wasn't getting paid to be idiots.

1141
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,520
I was doing it for free.

1142
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,780
Well, he's a real idiot.

1143
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:06,400
Yeah.

1144
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,760
The rest of us are all getting paid real good for being idiots.

1145
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,260
I feel sorry for those smart people who have to pay instead.

1146
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,520
To...

1147
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,400
Just to hear the idiots.

1148
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,000
To hear a bunch of flesh-grabbing, cracking idiots?

1149
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,360
I feel sorry for those intelligent people.

1150
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,260
I really do.

1151
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:33,100
Think how disturbing it must be to go through life so painfully aware of...

1152
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:33,580
Whoa!

1153
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:35,780
Earthquake!

1154
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:36,560
Earthquake!

1155
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,660
Praise Bob!

1156
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,920
It's a sign!

1157
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:40,980
It's a sign!

1158
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:41,700
It's a sign!

1159
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,160
We're being punished!

1160
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,940
We must have done the right thing!

1161
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,700
He must be happy with us.

1162
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,920
He's never happy with anybody.

1163
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,440
What the hell are we talking about?

1164
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,180
You guys are a bunch of babies.

1165
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,300
You guys are juvenile.

1166
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,000
You're pre-juvenile.

1167
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,760
You're infantile.

1168
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,780
Uh-huh, you are!

1169
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,200
You're fetal.

1170
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,740
Uh-huh.

1171
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,020
No, you're pre-fetal.

1172
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,620
You're spermatozoic.

1173
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,200
Uh-huh.

1174
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,760
No, you're gleaming daddy-zayic.

1175
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:06,140
Uh-huh.

1176
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:06,140


1177
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:06,140


1178
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:06,140


1179
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:06,140


1180
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:06,140


1181
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:06,140


1182
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:06,140


1183
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,860
No, you're so infantile and juvenile, you're DNA-like!

1184
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,360
You're genetic entirely!

1185
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,080
I'm genetic waste?

1186
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,740
It was genetic humor, ma'am.

1187
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,700
Genetic humor's done him in, ma'am.

1188
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,380
It's not pornography, officer.

1189
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,160
It's empowerment.

1190
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,960
It's porno-genetics!

1191
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,420
It's porno-genetic empowerment!

1192
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,080
Once you get a hold of your genitalia...

1193
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,320
and you can feel that power surging backwards.

1194
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,780
Just hang on, man.

1195
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,180
Now, now, now, there's nothing to worry about.

1196
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,180
It's all just a part of the cosmic flow.

1197
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,500
Don't get me.

1198
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,680
It's that English woman again.

1199
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:50,660
It's the most famous.

1200
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,620
It's a transvestite.

1201
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,000
Fanny.

1202
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,560
Is that Fanny?

1203
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:58,900
It's a guy who dresses up and plays in white ostrich feathers at the bar.

1204
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,520
Now, those guys make good money, too.

1205
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,480
Yeah, it's good money if you try and spend it.

1206
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,560
Oh, I don't know which bar you've been to,

1207
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,560
but the ones I've seen don't make much of a living at it.

1208
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,920
It's more like a slow death.

1209
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,040
It is.

1210
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:18,600
No, man, they live for that moment when they're up there in front of all those people,

1211
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,020
and they're someone else.

1212
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,480
They've become transformed into a...

1213
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,780
Barbra Streisand.

1214
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:29,680
Barbra Streisand or Marilyn Monroe or Liza Minnelli.

1215
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,100
Liza.

1216
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,580
Yeah, or Bette Midler, you know.

1217
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,760
Oh, I love when they do bad.

1218
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,340
That's the best.

1219
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,700
That's, you know, that's what they live for.

1220
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,700
That's that one golden moment in their lives.

1221
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:49,020
The rest of it's just sidewalks and garbage cans and crappy hamburgers.

1222
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,700
It pales yellow with the golden showers.

1223
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,520
They've got to hook up with the later in the afternoon.

1224
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,920
You know, you've got to get slack any way you can.

1225
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,500
Well, some of them just figure they can suck it right out of you, I suppose.

1226
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,920
Of course, they may hang you for it.

1227
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,740
I want an air and eye pointing down.

1228
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,180
One.

1229
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,460
One pointing the other way.

1230
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,980
Yeah, you take that risk now, don't you?

1231
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,200
Yeah, you take a risk every day.

1232
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,140
You take that risk every day.

1233
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:10,760
That's right.

1234
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,680
I've got to remember you take a risk every day.

1235
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,880
You walk out, and you can get slack if you just...

1236
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,500
What are you...

1237
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,880
If you just...

1238
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,200
I don't know what I've got to do to get slack.

1239
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,340
I know I've got to get slack because everybody has to have plenty of slack.

1240
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,600
I've got to have at least enough to fill a whole closet or two,

1241
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,660
and I should probably start putting together some of those securities I've been thinking about and stuff

1242
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,120
because I could maybe get more.

1243
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,940
I could get more slack later if I saved up for more slack now.

1244
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,560
Okay, now do you understand?

1245
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:46,220
We started this whole thing off telling you that we were going to tell you what you really want.

1246
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:48,700
Well?

1247
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,540
You want the puzzle.

1248
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,740
I don't know any other way to do it.

1249
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,960
We stuck with the script.

1250
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,780
This is the same script we've used every time.

1251
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,060
If you haven't...

1252
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,660
What is this?

1253
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,020
What is this?

1254
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:04,160
What is this?

1255
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,160


1256
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,160


1257
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,160


1258
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,160


1259
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,160


1260
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,160


1261
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,160


1262
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,460
Dr. Demento stuff.

1263
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,380
You should...

1264
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,160
I got you, Dr. Demento.

1265
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:12,200
That was real funny in 1971 when I lived out in South Dakota, but...

1266
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,600
Yeah, when you used to...

1267
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,960
When you used to ride bareback over the plains and listen to...

1268
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,780
Who told you about that?

1269
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,960
The voice of the Black Hills.

1270
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,920
Hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya.

1271
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,560
I actually did end up riding across the plains on horseback

1272
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,640
with a fellow named Lorenzo Black Lance at 3 in the morning

1273
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,640
in the middle of the Rosebud Reservation,

1274
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:38,120
and we were looking for the UFO he had just seen,

1275
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,800
and he couldn't go to sleep unless he saw that UFO again,

1276
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,080
and he wanted me to go out and help him look for it.

1277
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:47,060
We rode all over the prairies all night long,

1278
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,360
and it never came back.

1279
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,580
And this here was a full-blooded Indian feller?

1280
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:51,640
Hmm.

1281
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,700
Well, he was a member of the Rosebud Sioux tribe.

1282
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:57,760
His dad was a medicine man.

1283
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,100
Why do them damn UFOs hang out in the reservations

1284
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,880
over across the state lines over there in New York State?

1285
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:08,260
They just had a big hubbub about over on Iroquois Reservation there.

1286
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,660
They spotted three cylindrical disks.

1287
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:16,860
Discs? Not disks, but like, it looked like a three-pronged article of some kind

1288
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,820
floating through space at high rates of speed

1289
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,500
with numbers of diminishing and growing rapid lights

1290
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,960
circling the bottom area.

1291
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,520
We know those Alaskan totem poles?

1292
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,060
They're actually UFOs?

1293
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:30,100
Those are the heads of the UFO pilots.

1294
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,580
Do you see the connection now?

1295
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,380
I thought it was the...

1296
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,860
The white buffalo woman that we were...

1297
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,960
talking about earlier came down in a UFO

1298
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,880
and gave the pipe to the Lakota people

1299
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,560
and then crushed all the bodies into the...

1300
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,840
made a giant pool of blood which hardened into pipestone,

1301
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,340
which they make modern pipes out of.

1302
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,600
It's a very soft rock made of human blood,

1303
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,680
according to legend.

1304
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,440
I got one of them things you were talking about

1305
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,660
filled with marijuana resin.

1306
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,020
And the Iroquois...

1307
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:00,860
Used to steal them.

1308
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,360
They'd go thousands of miles to steal the pipes from the buffalo.

1309
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,360
They invented the UFO originally.

1310
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,840
They had an anti-gravity thing and most of them took off.

1311
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,360
And they only left a couple of Iroquois around?

1312
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,120
You know they used to accuse the Erie Indians who lived around here of high sorcery,

1313
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,200
which is why the Iroquois wiped their cousins out.

1314
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,980
Well, you know, you gotta...

1315
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,720
Sometimes there's no...

1316
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,860
none of those particular bunches of Indians around to defend themselves

1317
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:30,280
and the only thing you know about them is what their enemies said.

1318
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:31,640
That's right.

1319
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,100
For instance...

1320
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:37,600
The word Sioux is actually what the Blackfeet used to call the Lakota

1321
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,100
and it meant snake in the grass, you know, nasty worm thing.

1322
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,720
Well, that's a bitching thing to wind up for the...

1323
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,580
a moniker for the rest of your life.

1324
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,960
For the whole rest of your ancestral days,

1325
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,780
all your people be called the snake in the thing.

1326
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,520
Right.

1327
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,580
Well, see, that's why Sioux isn't cool anymore.

1328
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:57,080
And it's in today's modern dances with wolves,

1329
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,160
now a go-go PC world,

1330
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,800
it is correct to say Lakota.

1331
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,080
But it's not correct... But it's not correct to say Lakota.

1332
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,560
...here on camera three.

1333
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,900
Oh, look, they're all lining up for the high-eye dance now.

1334
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,280
They're doing the corn ceremony.

1335
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,240
There's Russell Means, Dennis Banks,

1336
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,340
Claude Bellacourt...

1337
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,240
All dressed up in suits.

1338
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:14,740
Yup.

1339
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,280
Yup. Flannel suits. My God.

1340
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,920
Sitting on top of that general store.

1341
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,040
They're at Wounded Knee reading comic books,

1342
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:26,420
waiting for the FBI to burn them like they did Koresh.

1343
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,300
But it was in the past

1344
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,820
and the FBI didn't have the special flamethrower tanks then.

1345
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,540
And that's the hope of the future,

1346
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,580
is that the FBI was not in the past.

1347
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,500
And why we must all escape into the future

1348
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,460
so that we can rescue ourselves in the past.

1349
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,300
So that we can create... Yes, we have to go into the future

1350
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,640
and create a time machine... A time machine.

1351
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,260
...so we can go back into the past and correct everything.

1352
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,360
And correct everything. So it doesn't happen...

1353
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,340
But then if that happens, we won't be born

1354
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,160
to make the time machine in the future...

1355
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,520
Yeah, but what if... ...in order to go back in the past

1356
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,920
and change it, which would mean it would...

1357
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,840
Some... Every other past would be good...

1358
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,240
Each and every... ...and the other...

1359
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,380
And then every other one would be bad.

1360
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,800
Oh, there'd be four good ones, and then... Oh, there'd be four good ones, and then...

1361
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,740
...and three bad ones. You would have to...

1362
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,580
So we're in the bad one now that we didn't...

1363
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,720
We weren't able to go back and change the past this time.

1364
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,400
Okay. The last time, I should say.

1365
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,660
All right, let's... But this time we will,

1366
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,020
so the next time will be good.

1367
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,220
Well, that's this time, then now.

1368
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,120
Because if we were gonna go back,

1369
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,880
because we had already intended to go back,

1370
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,880
because we were in the bad one, we were going back to the good one,

1371
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,260
that would mean, kind of necessarily,

1372
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,040
we'd both be back in the bad one and the good one at the same time.

1373
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,600
Man, it's a paradox. It's like that cat in the box.

1374
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,760
You know, you can cut it in half, and Heidinger's still gonna...

1375
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,700
Schrodinger. Schrodinger...

1376
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,940
Yeah, that's right. Schrodinger's still gonna burn up

1377
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,260
as he... when he hits the atmosphere.

1378
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,780
Heidinger. I couldn't remember either.

1379
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,440
I was just trying to give him some doodar.

1380
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,620
Now, wait a minute.

1381
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,320
Heidegger was... Heidegger was the guy who played with clams.

1382
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,740
He was also the one that, when he'd walk into a furnace

1383
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,160
or a surfactory unit or some kind of laboratory,

1384
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,900
haven't you ever heard of Menzies effect,

1385
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,280
where you'd have a testicular or ovarian spite

1386
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,920
or something like that, or someone would try and arrest you?

1387
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,580
No, but I do... Someone told me the other day

1388
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,200
that Einstein...

1389
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:02,240
One-star.

1390
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,100
...was once sold an elevator.

1391
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:07,760
A man came to Einstein's house, a salesman...

1392
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,180
A Chicago...

1393
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:12,720
A salesman with a pipe, and sold Albert Einstein an elevator.

1394
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,660
Did he take...

1395
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,980
But Albert Einstein lived in a one-story house.

1396
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,500
Oh, my God. You know who that sounds like.

1397
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,380
Why do you think they call it subgenius, my friend?

1398
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,440
Only in this regard.

1399
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,740
Because an idiot would believe anything.

1400
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,900
No, that's backwards.

1401
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,600
Well, uh, uh...

1402
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,220
Well...

1403
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,780
Oh, I hate walking in a dark alley myself.

1404
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,820
I can't get out of it. I just got into one.

1405
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,920
But it was only a one-story house in this reality.

1406
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,260
Yeah, that's right. Einstein knew...

1407
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,000
In the other backwards time stream,

1408
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:46,220
it probably was a two-story house, and Einstein knew that.

1409
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,160
And he probably installed the elevator.

1410
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,620
And it probably worked for Einstein.

1411
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,120
That's what we... Here we are.

1412
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,160
We're sitting there making fun of that guy for being old smarty pants,

1413
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,960
and then it turns out he had the last laugh after all.

1414
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,040
Yeah, but if you ever watch those,

1415
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,680
instructional television prectums,

1416
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,340
the current pogrom has Einstein,

1417
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,240
or one stone as they used to call him,

1418
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,740
going back and forth in the elevator

1419
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,760
to prove the theory of relativity relative to quantum physics.

1420
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,520
Don't you remember, like, the fact when the elevator's on its way up there,

1421
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,120
and he's already down, but it's only one story?

1422
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,880
See, that's where the, uh...

1423
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,280
That's where the light starts to bend the...

1424
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,380
That's right.

1425
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:23,660
The continuum.

1426
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:24,860
The time continuum.

1427
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,920
Right, and he's only in the elevator for ten minutes,

1428
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,200
but when the door opens,

1429
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:28,620
That's right.

1430
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,280
it's four thousand years later,

1431
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,260
and apes have taken over the planet.

1432
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:32,560
That's right.

1433
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,740
And the Statue of Liberty's stuck up to, you know,

1434
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:36,800
puts neck in sand.

1435
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,560
And it's wearing, actually wearing an ape mask, too.

1436
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,340
And Einstein is very old.

1437
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,140
I...

1438
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:43,220
But I think they took that off for a while.

1439
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,440
I mean, at least some of the kids were getting scared.

1440
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,140
Remember?

1441
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:47,120
I...

1442
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,660
I don't know.

1443
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,740
I think, I don't know, it was Captain...

1444
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:50,300
I memorized it.

1445
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,180
Captain Duty, or it was, um,

1446
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,980
The Wildebeest, or...

1447
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,620
You get a goddamn job before sundown,

1448
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,060
I don't, I don't, I don't...

1449
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,480
We're shipping you off to military school

1450
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:04,700
with a goddamn Finkielstein shit kid!

1451
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,620
Son of a bitch!

1452
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,500
Well, now,

1453
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,960
if that don't beat all another hot recipe

1454
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,540
from down in Cajun country.

1455
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,920
You gotta get on the microphone a little bit.

1456
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,800
Yeah, but she's not saying anything.

1457
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,000
She's giving me dirty looks.

1458
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,060
All she's gotta do is grab my head and give it to me.

1459
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:27,660
Your proximity has to come closer to the microphone.

1460
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,600
Oh, I've never moved my posterior too much,

1461
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,620
because you could get also, uh,

1462
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:30,980
Proximity?

1463
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,400
some, one of those other devices stuck up there, too.

1464
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,780
Well, I didn't put it there.

1465
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,500
Well, you tried, I know, a few times.

1466
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,980
You know, I'm sick of you bringing that crap up, you know.

1467
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,660
Well, it's just, it was a psychic thing.

1468
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,160
It didn't really happen in this, in this part.

1469
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,300
Well, I didn't do it.

1470
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,000
Well, I'm saying it wasn't intentioned.

1471
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,100
It was just, uh, kind of a lackluster thought

1472
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,600
that came and went like a willow.

1473
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:52,920
Oh, wait.

1474
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,560
A Tibetan moment.

1475
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:01,100
Now, I heard that Bob sold the Dalai Lama

1476
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:04,400
a pair of spandex slippers that wouldn't bend

1477
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,260
when he had to do his obfuscations

1478
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:10,680
and had to carry his, uh, rotary, er, his, uh, rosaries.

1479
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,340
He, uh, supposedly told the Dalai Lama

1480
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:19,120
that that would lead to a better comprehension of nothingness.

1481
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,540
Geeze, see, he's gotta act for everybody.

1482
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,720
He said to the Dalai Lama, he said,

1483
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:27,380
Wear these and you will be in the silence.

1484
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,820
Of only the air conditioner noise.

1485
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,200
Oh, man.

1486
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,280
Now, see, he told my dad he'd be only in the silence of Onan.

1487
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:39,320
But he ain't got, uh, well, I think he's too old to spank him.

1488
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,940
The silence of Onan?

1489
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,040
Onan was a super-type.

1490
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,120
Onan got a spanking.

1491
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,400
He got him a spanking.

1492
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,000
That's the sound of your one hand clapping.

1493
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,460
That's, well, that's not Janet's.

1494
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,120
Same as his.

1495
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,660
Wasn't that Jaffe's brother?

1496
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,020
The white noise of Onan.

1497
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,680
The white noise of Onan.

1498
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,460
Onan, wasn't that Jaffe's brother?

1499
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:55,860
Jaffe Onan?

1500
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:56,320
Yeah.

1501
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,480
I don't know.

1502
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,580
I heard him talk about doctors for Watoomba,

1503
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,480
but I didn't know if Jaffe Onan was in there.

1504
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:04,020
I was running around with Onan last week in Portland.

1505
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:04,800
Yeah, right around.

1506
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,080
Onan lives in Portland now.

1507
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,460
Works in a bookstore.

1508
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,900
And he is a one-handed man.

1509
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,440
Uh, he's, I'm proud of it.

1510
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,300
Darned proud of it, I might add.

1511
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,720
From prehistoric Arkansas.

1512
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:16,640
Yep.

1513
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,120
Goes all the way back.

1514
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:18,740
Mm-hmm.

1515
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,220
Tennessee.

1516
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,420
Is that where the Australian monolith planted the Indians?

1517
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,440
Or that's, now that was when they-

1518
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,900
No one knows where.

1519
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:30,400
It was on the lost plateau of Leng, which is just a name.

1520
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,940
Nobody knows, you know, where it is.

1521
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,500
So nobody knows what Leng is, then?

1522
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:33,520
It's occulted knowledge.

1523
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,960
It's knowledge that is hidden from us.

1524
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,140
Probably for our own good.

1525
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:43,080
Because, you know, if we could get there, we could dig up the treasure.

1526
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,080
Bob told me he has the map in his closet.

1527
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,000
And he's gonna sell it.

1528
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,840
Under the bed.

1529
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:49,480
Oh.

1530
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,860
And he's gonna sell you Xerox copy.

1531
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,120
We could get that map, man.

1532
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:53,780
Yeah, right.

1533
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,880
You could get a map, and he's gonna sell it to you.

1534
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,700
We could break Charlie out.

1535
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,160
We could free Charlie.

1536
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,960
Well, I don't think we should-

1537
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,240
And we could-

1538
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,400
And Charlie, man, Charlie's got magic powers.

1539
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,100
You can't-

1540
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,500
We could get them panties.

1541
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,160
No, if you pop the-

1542
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,660
We could get into the forbidden plateau.

1543
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,840
No, he told me he was gonna kill me.

1544
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:15,060
He said he didn't like the idea of me reintroducing listening to Music Mind.

1545
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,720
It's 45 feet up.

1546
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,360
And he said it was cold.

1547
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,520
After-

1548
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,300
Oh, I say, that feels good.

1549
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:23,940
Oh.

1550
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,740
Hey, maybe we could use that machine I drove up behind the other day.

1551
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:36,440
There was a big, red machine on the back of this truck, and it said, Onan, on it.

1552
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:38,400
The Onan device.

1553
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,060
What?

1554
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,020
Oh, you're going to go get your prize?

1555
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:45,200
I'll take three of them Onan devices, and one Orgasmatron.

1556
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,760
And I'll take the old lady.

1557
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,740
And I'll take the prize.

1558
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:48,500
And a six-pack.

1559
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,240
And a six-pack to go.

1560
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,900
And also a bucket of chicken livers, too.

1561
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:54,380
Yeah.

1562
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:54,460
Yeah.

1563
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,820
That's coming over the phone lines.

1564
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,600
That was, what the hell was that?

1565
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,840
Now see when the...

1566
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,920
Is that the X thing again?

1567
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,200
Is that the X is trying to preach?

1568
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,460
That's the X's.

1569
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,120
That's, no, that's quoted, it's Finnegan's Wake.

1570
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,640
Finnegan's Wake, that's a tax.

1571
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,800
I think it was Phantom.

1572
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,340
I like Finnegan's Wake.

1573
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,640
I like Damien's Wake.

1574
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:42,940
He's trying to get...

1575
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,200
It's a latitude.

1576
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:49,520
It's a longitude latitude.

1577
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:50,840
He's giving us direction.

1578
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,040
I told you it was the X guys.

1579
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,500
How could you tell them apart from a piece of wood?

1580
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,940
Or like the console?

1581
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,980
He said you can't, they look like everything.

1582
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,980
Then he said they were sprouting beanies and ears

1583
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,700
and some of them were carried around like that super wax,

1584
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,740
turtle wax for cars and stuff

1585
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,520
and some of them were starting their own businesses.

1586
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,760
Well, geez, I'll just lose connection to it.

1587
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,920
What the hell am I doing?

1588
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,100
I'm going to clean them all out.

1589
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,400
I'm sorry, I just kind of drifted.

1590
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:20,940
I was in the other...

1591
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,800
One of them American Airlines...

1592
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,960
Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

1593
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,720
He's got his eye sockets pulled out.

1594
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:37,720
Friends, that was part one of an incredible two-hour recording

1595
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:42,880
from ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland in 1994.

1596
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,180
An uncut improv thing.

1597
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:50,360
We'll do part two next week, most likely.

1598
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,100
And...

1599
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,760
In the meantime, I might mention that

1600
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,020
I just made a bunch of playlist categories

1601
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,820
on my YouTube channel.

1602
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,580
I've had a YouTube channel forever.

1603
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,880
It's called RevStang.

1604
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,800
All lowercase, one word.

1605
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,140
RevStang.

1606
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,240
R-E-V-S-T-A-N-G

1607
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,460
on YouTube.

1608
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,380
And...

1609
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,980
I broke it up so that you can...

1610
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,180
The old subgenius devivals are one category

1611
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:29,460
and the ex-day videos are another category

1612
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:33,080
and the classics that are sort of instructional

1613
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:36,320
and inspirational subgenius things.

1614
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,460
That's a playlist.

1615
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:41,080
The animation is a playlist.

1616
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,780
The music videos are a playlist.

1617
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,420
My home movies with dogs and cats

1618
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,280
and my nature studies.

1619
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:51,000
Actually, I've done a whole lot of nature studies.

1620
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,040
Bugs.

1621
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,000
Micro...

1622
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:55,520
Organisms.

1623
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:57,580
Buzzards.

1624
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,400
Clouds.

1625
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,100
Time-lapse.

1626
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:02,640
Anyway, that's all at...

1627
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,300
It's easier to...

1628
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:10,340
to deal with at YouTube slash RevStang.

1629
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,280
But, friends, everything you really need to know

1630
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,260
is at subgenius.com.

1631
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:19,380
That's all you really need to know.

1632
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:21,100
And it is actually...

1633
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,280
It's actually fairly organized.

1634
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:23,740
It's ancient.

1635
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,720
It's old.

1636
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,980
But not obsolete.

1637
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,160
And it leads you to all the

1638
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,480
ever-new Facebook crap

1639
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,300
that I could not possibly

1640
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,120
ever try to keep up with anymore.

1641
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,980
It's out of control.

1642
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:42,820
Thank you,

1643
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:46,540
CyberChump,

1644
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,980
from their album

1645
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,100
Their Minds.

1646
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,840
A moment of perfect happiness.

1647
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,560
Praise CyberChump.

1648
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,460
Praise Bob.

1649
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:00,260
Praise our listeners.
