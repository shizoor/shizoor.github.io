1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
This here is a statue of Bob. Great Bob. Great Bob with a great pipe on his great white horse. Praise Bob.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,540
This here is the pipe of Dobbs. Stuck in the grunting grin of Dobbs. Praise Dobbs on his great white horse.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,640
If you can help us with a donation.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,620
This here is the frock what lies in the bowl of Dobbs.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,300
The great Dobbs. The great white Dobbs on his great white horse. Praise Bob and his great white horse.

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,980
This here is the smile of Dobbs.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:37,480
Not to be confused with the grunting grin that holds the pipe that bears the frock that flames to the heavens that fills the sky with the righteous stink of Bob in the nostrils of every man.

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,780
Praise Bob.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,680
This here is a statue of Bob on his great white horse. This is Bob on his horse. The great white horse Bob. Praise Bob.

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,280
This here is Bob. Mind your boots going through the door tip.

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,600
This here is the boots of Dobbs. What Bob uses to ride the great white horse.

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,840
Praise Bob.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,940
This here is the statue of Bob. The great Bob.

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,360
Stride his great white horse.

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,020
This here is the door to the room that bears the statue of Bob. Mind your boots going through.

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,360
Praise Bob.

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,040
This is the horrible room where in dwells the subgenius radio ministry.

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,740
Hour of Slack.

19
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,200
And I knew there had to be some sort of music in the background there.

20
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,960
And yes friends this show is a little bit of a mess.

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,760
But we're not sure what it's going to be.

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:43,220
We know that we're going to get down to some beloved tape recordings of an actual subgenius devival in New York City.

23
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:52,340
The Slack folks devival in New York City without yours truly preaching.

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,680
It was wonderful.

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,960
And they killed it.

26
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,260
They killed them.

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,880
And it was love.

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,200
And it was beautiful with Pope David N. Meyer preaching.

29
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,380
And kings of feedback.

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,900
And just all manner of crazy.

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,400
Dr. Legume evil preachers.

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,240
Friends.

33
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:18,960
Those live recordings of true real subgenius preachings and spankings will be coming up.

34
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,880
It's going to be a religious show.

35
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,200
And speaking of religious shows.

36
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:25,700
Well let's see.

37
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,360
I have to have some sort of background music here at all times ready to go.

38
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,560
This ought to work.

39
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,640
All right.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,520
See.

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,480
That one just went out.

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,220
That one just pooped out.

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,840
And we'll start.

44
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,560
We'll start this old lovely Doctors for Bob hymn in the background.

45
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,160
Friends because I wanted to.

46
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,400
Not so much a sermon at the beginning of this hour.

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:05,800
I'm just going to have to get my own little

48
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:05,800


49
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,020
Oh,

50
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,920
you know what?

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:21,840
Only in the city of this lovely city.

52
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,000
I.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,120
I.

54
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,680
I.

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:25,680


56
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,700
Yes.

57
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,680
Okay.

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,680
That's there.

59
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,880
That feels much better.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,160
Yep.

61
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,580
Friends.

62
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:39,340
What I was saying was I had a hankering to do not a sermon this time, but a review.

63
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,340
Yes.

64
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:40,920
I.

65
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,920
A high weirdness.

66
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,940
Any way you can get it review from.

67
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,120
I'm trying to get back in doing those.

68
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,940
You know.

69
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,660
Just bringing to you some helpful hints on where to find the weirdest and sickest.

70
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:55,660


71
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:03,900
of, you know what, I'm just gonna shut that music off. It's fighting me this time.

72
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:15,040
Friends, you know, the most hilariously stupid and deliciously bizarre crackpot materials can

73
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,480
sometimes be seemingly innocuous and found to have been lurking immediately under one's nose

74
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:29,680
for a long time while somehow going unsniffed. Their insane kook creators hide them right out

75
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,840
in the open where they are too often taken for normal and ignored by we connoisseurs of

76
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,620
bulldada. In consternation, we learn too late that they've been there all along just waiting

77
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:51,180
to be mined for their inadvertent hilarity potential. And I'd like to review today

78
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,460
a few of the most hilarious and most hilarious things that have happened to me in the past.

79
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:51,460


80
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,040
This, what I like to call it the prick teaser's digest.

81
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:05,460
Let me put it this way. Those who are not exactly in the walk will bray with laughter

82
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:13,360
upon close inspection of Brio magazine. A Christian magazine from Focus on the Family

83
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:21,320
suggested donation for gift subscriptions is only 15 bucks. Now what might pass

84
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:28,380
as any boring pink piece of fluff found in a dentist's waiting room or the living room of any

85
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:36,580
bland Christian family is actually a hilarious cesspool of repressed sexual terror.

86
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:46,480
And you know, there's a lot of kinds of Christian magazines, and this one's of an unusual variety.

87
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,320
It's not the sinisterly paranoid kind.

88
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:59,420
Not even the hilariously inept kind, but simply an example of the unfathomably lame.

89
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:09,660
What we worldlies and seculars would call almost Flandersian after Ned Flanders on The Simpsons.

90
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:21,240
Now, if you've got a sarcastic, atheist, teenage girl with an attitude in your family, a gift subscription to Brio is

91
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,300
a gift subscription to Brio.

92
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:27,360
It's just the thing for a birthday. Every month it will bring her many minutes of cynical mirth.

93
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,540
You know, this really just isn't the same without some sort of background music.

94
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,680
I've got to have it.

95
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,540
That's better.

96
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,580
I don't know if that's...

97
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,740
No, that's not appropriate.

98
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,880
Okay, I think I've found it. I think I know just what we need here, dear friends.

99
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,080
Thanks to Nenslo for...

100
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,960
coming through, delivering the greatest background music for this sort of thing.

101
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,140
I'm sure.

102
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,940
Okay, back to Brio magazine.

103
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,400
Brio looks like any other teen girls magazine.

104
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:16,180
It's got dating advice, diet articles, pictures of fresh-faced, well-scrubbed boys and girls with all their clothes on, looking happy.

105
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,080
The art looks as if it's done by real illustrators.

106
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,060
The artist is a real artist.

107
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,780
You see everywhere.

108
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,380
There's even a comic strip that looks just like Archie.

109
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,560
But it's all counterfeit normality.

110
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,620
Weird differences creep in.

111
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,520
The ads aren't normal ads.

112
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:45,300
Instead of perfume and blue jeans, it's the sterling silver, just-say-wait pendant with the inscription,

113
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,580
Worth Waiting For.

114
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,060
Regardless of what you buy,

115
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,220
or what you may have done in the past,

116
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,980
you can remain sexually pure until marriage, starting right now.

117
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,980
And notice how they're careful not to alienate potential customers,

118
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,500
you know, Pobucker girls who already made that mistake.

119
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:14,440
By the way, folks, I'm sorry if we're belittling those who happen to hold different beliefs from ours,

120
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,940
but we're right, and they're idiots.

121
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,280
Thank you.

122
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,980
Sample articles that you'll find in Brio magazine include,

123
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,880
they have titles like,

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,040
What Does God Sound Like?

125
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,480
Is Everybody Really Doing It?

126
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,420
Sexual Purity Defined.

127
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,680
It stops after light kissing, dear friends.

128
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:50,260
There's no sexual purity beyond the most chaste of lures.

129
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,000
Light kisses.

130
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,240
Ask Dr. Paul.

131
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,180
In this issue, the headline is,

132
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,340
My period is really, really, really heavy.

133
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,080
And there's hints for how to have the flagpole prayer at your school and so forth.

134
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,220
But you see, the Brio girl, as shown in their many fully clothed pinups,

135
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:19,280
is fresh-faced, lily-white, well-scrubbed, and squeaky clean.

136
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,080
Even the token dwarf, nice pinup girl.

137
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,600
The Brio girl is cool, but Christian.

138
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,180
She's...actually, she's every teenage boy's worst nightmare, friends.

139
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,740
But she has problems, too.

140
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:45,320
From sweaty hair after P.E. to agonizing over whether it's okay to pray about sports.

141
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,980
By the way, it is okay to pray about sports.

142
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,880
It says.

143
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,420
But you should ask God to help you play your best, not to win.

144
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,900
Because there might be Christian teens on the opposing team praying, too.

145
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,740
And you don't want to, you know, confuse God or nothing.

146
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,860
But there's this great letters section in Brio magazine.

147
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,460
And here are some examples of letters to Dear Susie, the editor.

148
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,480
Dear Susie, help.

149
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,840
I think I'm addicted to MTV.

150
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,940
My parents don't allow me to watch it.

151
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,660
But I do anyway.

152
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,180
Now I can't seem to stop.

153
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,800
I have a lousy attitude after watching it.

154
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,120
And I get songs with swear words stuck in my head all day.

155
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,680
What should I do?

156
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,960
Susie's solution.

157
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,840
By the way, this is not Reverend Susie the floozy we're talking about, but a Christian reverend.

158
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,200
She says simply quit watching MTV.

159
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,160
Which makes sense.

160
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,200
But if that doesn't work, get your parents to help you quit.

161
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,300
And she goes on to say.

162
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:05,460
I would hate to think that watching MTV affected where you will eventually spend eternity.

163
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:12,600
Ask God to forgive you and come clean with your folks.

164
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
Yes, friends.

165
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,180
It is a horrible thought to think that.

166
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,940
MTV affects where you will spend eternity.

167
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,580
Another kid is worried because she can't make herself stop cussing.

168
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,360
All her friends and everyone at school cuss.

169
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,980
And Susie says, well, then why not think about changing friends?

170
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,180
But Susie, this is a world of rampant, unrestrained cussing.

171
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,860
It is Satan's world.

172
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,460
And I'm afraid this child shall have.

173
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,840
No friends.

174
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,980
Unless she comes to the church of the subgenius friends where you can cuss.

175
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,040
In fact, if you don't, if you don't cuss in an original manner, why, we'll kick you out of the church.

176
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,760
Yes, we're fascists here, friends.

177
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,200
Dear Susie, I know that sex before marriage is a sin.

178
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,900
And I have sworn that I will remain a virgin until my wedding night.

179
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,280
But how much fooling around is acceptable?

180
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,860
By God.

181
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:28,060
And Aunt Bertha, I mean Susie says, anything beyond a light kiss is considered petting.

182
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:40,720
And when you're involved in petting, you're making it extremely difficult for the person you're with to keep a godly mindset.

183
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,520
In fact, each time you go a step further,

184
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,260
you find the devil.

185
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,000
And it takes more to fulfill your appetite.

186
00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:01,180
Dear Susie, the boys on the football team have repeatedly raped me and my 13-year-old friends.

187
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,800
Yet, they profess a deep faith in Christ.

188
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:11,980
No one believes us because these guys are such terrific leaders and enthusiastic Christians.

189
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,820
Does this happen in other churches as well?

190
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:23,080
But friends, and Susie went on to say, you should tell your parents and call the police.

191
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,580
But my favorite of all was this one, dear friends.

192
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,740
This poor Christian girl, obviously this girl is lost.

193
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,240
She needs the church of the subgenius in her life.

194
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:40,420
Because her question to dear Susie was, I have pledged to remain sexually pure until marriage.

195
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,580
But what if Jesus comes back before I get married?

196
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,920
I want to know how it feels to have sex.

197
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,180
Is this a horrible thing to want?

198
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:58,420
See what it is, this girl, she doesn't want to go off to heaven before she's, you know, had, got, got her some.

199
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,580
Is it such a horrible thing to want?

200
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,260
And Susie says, yes.

201
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,100
No one knows the time or date of Christ's return.

202
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,600
He may come back before you receive your next issue of Brio.

203
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,900
And if he does come back, sex won't be the only thing you'll miss out on.

204
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,860
What about college life and grad school and giving birth?

205
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,620
No.

206
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:42,140
No, I'm afraid, young lady, the promise of Jesus' return is no excuse to fornicate like a common wanton weasel in the grass behind the old church there during summer, church summer camp.

207
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,140
Ah, yes.

208
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:52,760
And here's one that makes me think that Susie, dear Susie, the actual editor of this pen-Christian magazine,

209
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,520
actually, I think that she writes all the dear Susie letters, because here's one from a guy.

210
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:06,600
In Guy Talk, Susie asked these cute, non-threatening lads, shown here, the question,

211
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,280
What really bugs you about girls?

212
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,520
And this lad said,

213
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,540
I'm really trying to be a good Christian.

214
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,380
Sometimes it's tough.

215
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,440
But you know what makes it really hard?

216
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,640
It's when girls wear stuff that's like, revealing.

217
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,760
It's distracting.

218
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,180
My mom always taught me that's not cool, so it bothers me.

219
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,080
I think I understand why they do it.

220
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,220
It's what the world, you know, like TV,

221
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,500
It's what the world, you know, like TV,

222
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,420
tells them they're supposed to be doing.

223
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,920
But it really bugs me.

224
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,520
But yet, see friends, yet even in a Christian magazine like this,

225
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,560
there's titillation in spades indeed.

226
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,940
Because what's not, they have a lot of first person accounts of rape, child abuse,

227
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:09,580
and plain ordinary dates, you know, where the boy goes too far, gets fresh, goes beyond like kissing.

228
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,700
It's what they don't say.

229
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,820
They build up to it and they don't say it.

230
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,140
But by the time it gets to,

231
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Before she knew it, his hand was underneath her blouse.

232
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,760
Man, you've gotten off.

233
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,460
You don't need it spelled out.

234
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,860
I like this, I like this new family values approach to pornography, friends.

235
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,020
And it is pornography for young Christian girls.

236
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,420
It's loaded with photos of non-threatening boys with captions.

237
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,740
Like, where does he stand with Christ?

238
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,040
And there's inspirational stories and there's music reviews

239
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,880
to tell you what's really Christian and what just sounds sort of Christian.

240
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,540
There was a review of Soundgarden, which I really like that band.

241
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,520
But their comment on Soundgarden was,

242
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,800
Why wallow in negativity?

243
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,920
There's no reason to settle for Soundgarden's weed-filled worldview.

244
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,260
Um...

245
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,000
And, you know, it warns you away from satanic card games.

246
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,800
You know, cause why hinder your walk with God

247
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,700
with exciting, original, imaginative, devilish games

248
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,300
when there's Christian ones like Redemption?

249
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,680
And it may be because, like the Christian rock and roll bands,

250
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,620
they're, well, boring, corny, predictable,

251
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,880
and blatant imitations of mainstream, secular hits.

252
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,460
And you always know how they're gonna end.

253
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,960
But, you know, I mean, the walk comes first.

254
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,400
But, um...

255
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,900
And to tell the truth, you could get the same thrill

256
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,480
just by browsing through a Christian bookstore.

257
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,320
When was the last time you did that, dear listener?

258
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,260
When was the last time you went to a Christian bookstore

259
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,720
and just wandered through looking at the titles

260
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,860
and seeing that lovely world?

261
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,580
Well, with a magazine like Brio,

262
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,880
you can smirk in superiority

263
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,320
without actually having to mess with any of those

264
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,800
tedious people in person.

265
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,940
Ah, yes, and this has been our review of the Christian walk

266
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,200
and, uh, why we're not in it.

267
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,660
And that's...

268
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,980
Let's get back to some serious subgenius preaching

269
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,860
here at the, uh, Slack Folks D Vival

270
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,840
in New York City.

271
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,700
Uh, dear friends, Price Bob.

272
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,280
Uh...type?

273
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,720
Here we go.

274
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,320
Praise Bob!

275
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,900
Praise Bob!

276
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,060
Hallelujah.

277
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,560
Welcome to the Slack Folks D Vival.

278
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,260
Whoo!

279
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,640
Louder!

280
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:00,940
Whoo!

281
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,800
Yes, yes!

282
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,400
You know why we're here.

283
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,420
To praise the almighty J.R. Bob Dogg.

284
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,760
Let's throw out the sacred golf ball.

285
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,820
The sacred golf ball for everyone.

286
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,440
The one that catches it is guaranteed slack.

287
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,860
But just...

288
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,080
Oh, that's...

289
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,580
Heads up!

290
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,560
So if I catch it, they'll have slack.

291
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,960
Get into my life-saving body of mine.

292
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,940
Anyway, I'm Rev. Bill T. Miller of Kings of Feedback,

293
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,620
and this is the legendary Kid Gimzu!

294
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,040
Yeah!

295
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,900
Doin' the line.

296
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:47,900


297
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:47,900


298
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:48,400


299
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:48,620
I told you!

300
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:57,420
You don't know that TERA was created.

301
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,560
After all, our spiritualpliners,

302
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,760
we're insignificant.

303
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,460
Wow!

304
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:03,560
Yeah, awesome!

305
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:03,940
Howdy.

306
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,560
to bring a few of us back from the dead from time to time.

307
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,180
Have you noticed that, especially around this time of year,

308
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,920
it seems anything goes?

309
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,220
No matter what you do, you just can't win?

310
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,700
Tired of the technobordom, the conspiracy of sales you're with?

311
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,300
Are we just not scary enough?

312
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,380
Are you looking for something that appeals both to your intelligence

313
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,460
and your nads?

314
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,480
You must have been to come out tonight, brothers and sisters.

315
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,160
Any old religion can offer you your own intellect back.

316
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,340
We're a bevy of beautiful men and women.

317
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,380
What the Church of the Subgenius offers you, friends, is eternal salvation

318
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,460
or triple your money back!

319
00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:01,360
Okay, I was gonna finish up the rest of this one.

320
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,520
I'm gonna have to do this rant right now, but it just dawns on me right now

321
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,520
that I forgot something very crucial about this evening.

322
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,080
We're actually not supposed to just leap right into the ranting willy-nilly.

323
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,780
There's kind of a tradition in the Church of the Subgenius.

324
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,500
Those of you who don't know about it are gonna be initiated into it tonight.

325
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,660
And so, you know, other religions start out with a prayer before the preachers,

326
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,700
but we don't really believe in much prayer of sorts.

327
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,700
And appropriate to the Kings of Feedback, who are a noisy band,

328
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,740
we like to start out with a moment of sacred, traditional noise!

329
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:40,540
Yay!

330
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,180
Praise God, hallelujah!

331
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,500
We have Kings of Feedback playing all the doctor music for you tonight.

332
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,100
We have Reverend Dr. Dr. Mr. M.D. David N. Meyer,

333
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,780
the Pope of New York City, Idaho, and the great Pacific Northwest,

334
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:06,340
the isness of the business, beloved of Bob, coming up right next.

335
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,140
But friends, before I...

336
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,100
David Meyer, friends.

337
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,760
We got the whole world in his hands.

338
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,260
We got the whole world in his hands.

339
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,580
We got the whole world in his hands.

340
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,440
We got the whole world in his hands.

341
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,280
Thank you, children! Thank you, children! Thank you, children!

342
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,660
I'm here tonight to preach to you the word of Bob.

343
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,180
But first, give me an S!

344
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:38,780
S!

345
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,720
Give me an L!

346
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,220
L!

347
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,040
Give me an A!

348
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,540
A!

349
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:41,980
Give me a C!

350
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:42,520
C!

351
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,140
Give me a K!

352
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:43,880
A!

353
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,560
What's that spell?

354
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,040
S!

355
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,820
What's that spell?

356
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,280
S!

357
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,020
What's that spell?

358
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,540
S!

359
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,940
What must a subtenuous have?

360
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,420
S!

361
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,380
Children, the subtenuous, he or she must have slack.

362
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,580
Now children, people come to me, people from all walks of life, they come to me and they say day.

363
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,640
They say to me, Riv Day!

364
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,500
Riv Day!

365
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,800
They say to me, Pokemon! New York City Day!

366
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,600
Pokemon! New York City Day!

367
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,000
Just what is this slack of which you speak?

368
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:19,140
And children, I say to them, I say slack is difficult to define, but it's easy to recognize.

369
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,100
And it's often most palpable in its absence, children.

370
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,400
In its absence.

371
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,640
And you know who takes away your slack?

372
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,560
That's actually the conspiracy takers.

373
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:29,560


374
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,580
The un-initiated, let me say unequivocally, that the conspiracy is no metaphor.

375
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
The conspiracy is no analogy.

376
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,500
The conspiracy is not the Trilateral Commission.

377
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,820
No, the conspiracy is the vast, inhuman succubus taking your soul, children.

378
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,680
But do you know who protects you from the conspiracy, children?

379
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,360
Do you know who stands in the way of the conspiracy?

380
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,740
It's Bob, children!

381
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,160
Gerald Bob Doe!

382
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:55,700
Bob!

383
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,560
Bob!

384
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:56,740


385
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,120
Bob!

386
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,220


387
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,240
Does Bob save everyone?

388
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,440
No!

389
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,160
No, no, no, no, no, no.

390
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,340
Pa get to, children.

391
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,300
Pa get to.

392
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,780
Bob only saves those who have taken him into their heart and into their mind.

393
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,360
But most importantly, children, Bob saves those who have taken him into their checkbook, children.

394
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:18,740
That's right.

395
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,000
Now, children, I got a little sermon I'm going to preach to you all tonight.

396
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,660
People, you know, they come to me, children, and they say to me, Dave.

397
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,340
They say to me, Rev. Dave.

398
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,740
They say to me, pop of all New York City, Dave.

399
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,460
I'm so confused.

400
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,680
I'm sore confused.

401
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,780
I'm baffled.

402
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,340
I'm baffled because I have no identity.

403
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,320
No matter what I spend my money on, there is an abyss, children.

404
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,700
There's a void.

405
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,160
There's a canyon.

406
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,400
That canyon between you and yourself, children.

407
00:24:59,460 --> 00:24:59,560
There's a valley.

408
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:05,840
The companion, the canyon that conspiracy invents so you go out and buy yourself an identity.

409
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:11,440
That abyss, children. That void. I've only got one thing to say to you about that void, children.

410
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,520
Why do you think they call it the gap?

411
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,860
They call it the gap, children. You go down there and buy something to get yourself an identity.

412
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,540
And no matter how much you buy, children, you'll never be satisfied. You know why?

413
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,420
Because you ain't got no slack, children. You ain't got no slack.

414
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,900
Because the conspiracy is on you, children.

415
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,660
But tonight, children, I've got something for you to buy that will give you that slack.

416
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,380
I have something to offer you tonight, children, that will never wear out.

417
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:51,480
That will never bore you. That will never turn away from you.

418
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,540
In which your interest will never slacken.

419
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,840
That's right, children. That's right.

420
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,640
And I have a product so fantastic you will play with it for the rest of your life.

421
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,580
And children, let me tell you.

422
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,340
My product is you.

423
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,700
That's right, children.

424
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:18,980
Does Bob care that from MTV and Nike ads and everything else, the world is so fragmented you can't finish a thought?

425
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,620
That any argument you hear sounds good?

426
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,120
Does Bob care that we have the attention span of gnats?

427
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,860
That's no, and I'll tell you why.

428
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,340
Come on.

429
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,440
Help me now because Bob is a short-duration, personal savior.

430
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,580
Hallelujah, children.

431
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,220
That's right, children.

432
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:42,060
As you know, as most of you know, Bob wants you to pull the wool over your own eyes.

433
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,340
Not the Gap's wool, children. Not MTV's wool, children.

434
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,100
Not the Wall Street Journal's wool, children. No.

435
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,340
Your own wool.

436
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,700
He wants you to pull your own wool over your eyes.

437
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,360
And relax in the safety of your own delusions.

438
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,160
Because children, when you do that, in five minutes you'll be so bored you'll start thinking for yourself.

439
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,480
And when you start thinking for yourself, children, you'll know there's only one path.

440
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,800
And that path is to Bob.

441
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,940
Now children, people come to me and they say, Dave.

442
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,160
Excuse me, I said they say to me, Dave.

443
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,140
They say to me, Ram Dan.

444
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,060
They say to me, Paul Pabon.

445
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,920
New York City Dave.

446
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,440
New York City Dave.

447
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,100
I don't feel that my worth is validated.

448
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,100
I don't feel that my boss regards me at my proper worth.

449
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,100
I don't feel that my girlfriend regards me at my proper worth.

450
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,200
I don't feel that my catamite regards me at my proper worth.

451
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,520
But children, I'll tell you something.

452
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,980
There is one person who'll always regard you at your proper worth.

453
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,660
That's Bob, children.

454
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,280
Come here and hold this mic.

455
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,080
Hold this damn thing.

456
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,420
Woo!

457
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,840
I'll show you something, children, right now about worth.

458
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,560
Let me demonstrate with a visual aid, children.

459
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,420
Children, this is a dollar bill.

460
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,040
Now, children, if you're one of those lame-ass whiz-bang one-dollar bill members,

461
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,180
well, Bob regards you at your worth.

462
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,820
Children, if you're one of those ass-kicking $30 members,

463
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,840
and wait, Will, if we just make him all, Will, what do the people get for $30, please?

464
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,520
Eternal salvation.

465
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,440
Yes, children, eternal salvation.

466
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,560
Eternal salvation is nice, children.

467
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,780
But in this day and age, we require something more tangible.

468
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,320
And I believe for a $30 membership, you get bumper stickers.

469
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,700
You get a pamphlet.

470
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,860
You get buttons.

471
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,080
You get the praise and envy and approbation of all your friends.

472
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,820
And then, children, you'll be regarded at your true worth.

473
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,180
Bob will regard you as having $30 worth.

474
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,440
Because you've got to remember, children, one of the geniuses of Bob

475
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,400
is that when all is said and done,

476
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,280
Bob doesn't really care that much about you.

477
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,740
Bob has bitter fish to fry, children.

478
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,160
Ask anyone who knows the Pope.

479
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,220
They'll tell you he's the most slackless member of the church.

480
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,540
Those who work the hardest always are, children.

481
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,540
We always are.

482
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,060
For instance, my mic stand has given me no slack tonight.

483
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,440
But, children, I want to say that when you tithe to Bob,

484
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,480
that which is Bob's,

485
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,640
the bit of your soul that smudges off on that $20 bill

486
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,500
and that $20 bill,

487
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,460
a cornucopia of slack will pour down upon you.

488
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,420
Unless, of course, you're one of these damn hip wimps or demibobs

489
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,060
that comes along and says,

490
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:35,980
where's my Bob?

491
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,420
How come I'm not getting any cooler?

492
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,860
Why spend $30 on the church and I'm not any cooler?

493
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,580
The answer is, children,

494
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,660
that your slack doesn't include cooler.

495
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,760
And that's just too bad.

496
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,420
But you know something?

497
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,880
Don't blame Bob, children.

498
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,460
Because Bob doesn't make human nature.

499
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,780
Bob just exploits it.

500
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,520
And now, children,

501
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,800
can you hear me, children?

502
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,360
Yes, yes, we hear you, Pope David N. Meyer,

503
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,900
the great Pope David Meyer,

504
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,260
back in the preaching circuit in New York City

505
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,000
at Bill T. Miller's amazing Slack Folks.

506
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,600
Oaks D. Bible.

507
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:27,880
And we'll be back with more of Pope Meyer's classic sermonizing

508
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,860
after these messages from someone else.

509
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,340
Now, children, when I go around to this great nation,

510
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,000
this great land,

511
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,560
and I preach the word of Bob,

512
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,480
people, they say to me,

513
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:37,640
Dave,

514
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,140
they say to me,

515
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,600
Bob, Dave,

516
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,040
they say to me,

517
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,180
Pope,

518
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,140
New York City, Dave.

519
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,380
What is the deal between pink and slack?

520
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:50,840
Ah!

521
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,120
So, children, it just takes a moment of explanation.

522
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,140
The pink boys and the pink girls,

523
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,540
they are the leading cutting edge of the conspiracy, children.

524
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,760
They are the people who want to take away your slack.

525
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,420
And I'm going to give you an example, a parable, a story

526
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,140
from the life of the Pope himself.

527
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,740
Last night, children, last night,

528
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,320
I walked 15 cross-town blocks in the rain

529
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,400
to keep a rendezvous at some upscale restaurant.

530
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,360
And I walked up in there,

531
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,080
and I was not, I was not clad

532
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,720
as I come before you tonight.

533
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,920
Because last night,

534
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,500
I was in the den of the conspiracy,

535
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,000
and tonight,

536
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,720
I'm in the cradling arms of slack!

537
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,460
I went upstairs, children,

538
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,160
to my normal Pope's guard.

539
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:32,880
Hi, Bob.

540
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,160
I went up there,

541
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,540
and there was this beautiful young lady.

542
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,700
She placed her hand on my arm,

543
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,780
and she restricted my entrance into this room, children.

544
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,720
And that's why I say the conspiracy is no metaphor.

545
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,080
There she was, children,

546
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,920
surrounded by the self-satisfaction conformity

547
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,560
of the conspiracy.

548
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,620
Gray suits and blue ties,

549
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,080
incarnate!

550
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,900
Oh, I love to be naked!

551
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,520
But, children, it was not so much that uniform that shone.

552
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,200
No, no, no, no, no, it was that

553
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,800
pink glow of conformity, children.

554
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,960
The way they looked around the room

555
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,220
to make sure they fit in.

556
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,160
The way they looked around the room

557
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,820
in pursuit of that scapegoat.

558
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,500
The way they looked around the room

559
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,220
to make sure that everyone looked just like them.

560
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,280
And that's why I say

561
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,540
they get that pink, wholesome glow, children.

562
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,120
Woo-hoo!

563
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:20,540
Woo-hoo!

564
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:20,860
Woo-hoo!

565
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:20,980


566
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:20,980


567
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:20,980


568
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:20,980


569
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:20,980


570
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:20,980


571
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:20,980


572
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:20,980


573
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:20,980


574
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,660
Because of pinkness have always been arrayed

575
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,020
against the forces of slack.

576
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,420
Ah!

577
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,960
Oh, children, it's a struggle.

578
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,940
There are times, children,

579
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,120
when those of you who claim to believe

580
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,420
do not tithe to Bob,

581
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,500
that which is Bob, namely your hard money.

582
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,060
And, oh, Brother Pink,

583
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,160
he starts to get old brother slack now.

584
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,160
Oh, yes, children, he gets on him

585
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,700
because he needs that money.

586
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,200
Oh, no, Brother Slack.

587
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,000
He's a fighting, children.

588
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,760
He's a gasping, children.

589
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,780
He's a choking, children.

590
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,660
But the final outcome of this great battle

591
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,880
is all up to you.

592
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,360
Woo-hoo!

593
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,460
Woo-hoo!

594
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,220
That's right, children.

595
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,140
It's all up to you, children.

596
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,440
Children, I know that in the privacy of your home,

597
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,400
in the horrible glare of that 2 a.m. bathroom mirror,

598
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,980
I know, the Pope knows in his heart of hearts,

599
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:18,280
Ah!

600
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,520
that you feel unclean.

601
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,320
You feel unworthy.

602
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,260
You wonder where that open-armed community is

603
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,140
awaiting to embrace you with the embraces

604
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,960
that you deserve, children.

605
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,940
Your Pope knows that, children.

606
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,580
He feels for you, children.

607
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,660
And, you know, there's certainly parameters

608
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,380
I feel for you.

609
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,000
I got a lot to do.

610
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,260
But basically, I do feel for you, children.

611
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,200
I know that feeling of wanting to be good,

612
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,100
of wanting to be clean,

613
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,820
of wanting to be right.

614
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,580
But, children, this is a revival.

615
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,340
We're here tonight to let that happen.

616
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,500
So, children, I'm gonna leave you now, children.

617
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,620
With one thought I want you to carry.

618
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,740
I want you to carry it in your mind.

619
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,180
I want you to carry it in your hearts, children.

620
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,320
I want you to carry it in checkbooks.

621
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,960
Yes, I do.

622
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,020
And that thought is this, children.

623
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,980
You are good enough.

624
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,860
You are clean enough.

625
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,720
You are right enough.

626
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,720
But if, if, and only if,

627
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,360
you get right,

628
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,660
we're found tonight.

629
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,220
Good night!

630
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,800
Good night!

631
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,340
Good night!

632
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,340


633
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,340


634
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,340


635
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,340


636
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,340


637
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,340


638
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:26,340


639
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,840
Good night, children!

640
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,040
Good night!

641
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,040


642
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,040


643
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,400
Couldn't get any slacker than that,

644
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,080
huh, dear friends?

645
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:30,520
Yes!

646
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,260
Let us hear it one more time

647
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:34,920
for Pope Meyer.

648
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,140
a bit of noise.

649
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,100
Well, to protect you from the anti-music,

650
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,480
we got some free Kings of Feedback

651
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,180
earplugs.

652
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,780
Here are Kings of Feedback.

653
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,380
Dear friends,

654
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,660
we're going to butcher up a couple of

655
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,000
Doctor classics from some of your favorite

656
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,600
Doctor bands, namely

657
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,700
Doctors for Bob,

658
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,220
Swingin' Love Corpses,

659
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,060
Brother Cleave,

660
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,120
and this long classic,

661
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,020
Box

662
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,000

663

673
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,260
I'm in the sex god

674
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,340
I'm in the sex god

675
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,200
They think Bob is a good man

676
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,940
I bet you think Bob is a just man

677
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,160
But you don't believe Bob is a good man

678
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,040
You're the one who forgot from the beginning

679
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,660
You're the one who forgot from the beginning

680
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,120
I'm in the sex god

681
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,760
I'm in the sex god

682
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,540
I'm in the sex god

683
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,180
I'm in the sex god

684
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,140
That's right

685
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,000
Bob is a sex god

686
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,700
Just look at him

687
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,460
Dr. Prude, Dr. Prude, Dr. Prude, Dr. Prude

688
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:18,740
Dr. Prude, Dr. Prude, Dr. Prude

689
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:18,740


690
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,900
Dr. Prude, Dr. Prude, Dr. Prude, Dr. Prude

691
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,220
Dr. Prude, Dr. Prude, Dr. Prude, Dr. Prude, Dr. Prude

692
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,220


693
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,220


694
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,220


695
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,060
This here's Bob

696
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,840
That there is Ivan Stang, the sacred scribe

697
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,860
cunningly wrought in epoxy resins

698
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,900
Observe the pinched and callow features

699
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,380
the nicotine-stained fingers

700
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,260
the miserable, shriveled soul

701
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,260
The sacred scribe

702
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,520
Don't touch

703
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,060
Over here you have the overman

704
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,520
This here is the great white-headed overman

705
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,580
pink-cheeked and round-nosed

706
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:18,740
Don't touch him

707
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,940
Hell Monkey chin. Notice the split diversions on the tip of the nose.

708
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,600
Notice he has five penises under each armpit and two more between his legs.

709
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,460
This is an anatomically faithful reproduction of the overman.

710
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,580
Don't touch, please. Mind your boots going through the door. Tip.

711
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,400
This here is a statue of the Gebrogfran, faithfully reproduced in carved cedar wood

712
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,540
from the cedars of Lebanon on the banks of the Tyre.

713
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,400
Or was it the iron?

714
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:55,780
Notice the Gebrogfran is always represented just before he falls into the tube

715
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,500
and is annihilated by the great wave of Negi.

716
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,480
This here is the void, the faceless emptiness, the great vastness,

717
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,160
the emptiness, the dark midnight of the soul.

718
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,640
This is the black hole of all emotions we call Negi.

719
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,940
Mind your boots going through. Don't touch her. It's your problem.

720
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,640
This here.

721
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,040
Is the statue of Connie.

722
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:26,340
Stella Maris, the Irma Ja, the Virgin Mary, the mother of all, their great goddess.

723
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,080
Mind your boots going through her door. You'll be in a lot of trouble.

724
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,380
This here is the Dobbs Museum.

725
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,300
This way, please. This concludes the end of this tour.

726
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,680
Mind your boots going out.

727
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,440
Watch out for the statue of Dobbs, the great Dobbs on his great white horse.

728
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,440
Thank you.

729
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,560
Thank you.

730
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:52,680
What, what, what, what, what, what, you're going to play now.

731
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,480
You're listening to the Puzzling Evidence Program,

732
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,780
and we are not talking about UFOs.

733
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,020
As the gentleman asked,

734
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,740
He's going to play now.

735
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:08,780
Whew.

736
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,920
What are they going to play now?

737
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,060
Now that they've played with the Earth long enough,

738
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,800
what do the aliens want now?

739
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,740
And isn't it somewhat, perhaps maybe true,

740
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,920
that what they found out there at Roswell

741
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,920
was actually alien pet poop?

742
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,880
Do you understand?

743
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:51,120
I can make you all go away anytime I want to.

744
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,660
Actually, Senator, I never said on the record

745
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,920
that I thought they were spacemen.

746
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,840
And the case is still open.

747
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,000
And I feel that when we make this apprehension,

748
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,040
the expense will be well justified.

749
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,180
Is what I feel.

750
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,640
You seen anything out here tonight, Eddie?

751
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,700
Like what?

752
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,640
Something unusual.

753
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,120
This here's the desert, girly girl.

754
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,280
What you call unusual don't mean much around here.

755
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,320
If you know what they mean.

756
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,000
I seen plenty.

757
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,500
I seen hailstones as big as your head.

758
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,920
I seen lightning shoot out the ground up into the clouds.

759
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,780
And I heard stuff, too.

760
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,880
When the wind gets tangled up in them power lines,

761
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,500
it makes the water sing like crazy.

762
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,440
I'm a woman in love.

763
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,720
30 years out here.

764
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,720
Ain't nothing unusual to me.

765
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,360
Thanks a lot, Eddie.

766
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,180
Don't mention it, Sheriff.

767
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,040
Don't mention what?

768
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,320
The crazy woman at night.

769
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,660
What do you figure she saw?

770
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,040
Well, it could have been some kid in a hot rod.

771
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,460
Once more on...

772
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,860
Time for America's favorite traveling series.

773
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,880
In the

774
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,660
It's the morning before the Senate subcommittee hearings on unusual behavior.

775
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:35,940
Senator McCarr Trouble and Senator Foghead Leggirs have summoned Bob.

776
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,280
Uh-oh.

777
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:37,920


778
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,100
La, la, la, la.

779
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,200
Bob, I still can't find your glow-in-the-dark boxer shorts

780
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,200
or hand-painted tie with the many glowing heads of Neeky.

781
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,840
Bob!

782
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:02,260
Damn, drunk or frapped again.

783
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,880
What's this?

784
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,320
The pages of Bob's Betty Page photo splash,

785
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,880
all dog-eared, all soggy and slimy,

786
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,820
like greasy fried chicken.

787
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,920
No, no, no, no.

788
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,700
Roman, I mean, Bob!

789
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,880
I think Little Ivan's been clicking your castanets,

790
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,420
and what have you done to its eyes?

791
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,360
Stop!

792
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,080
Kill me, bitch!

793
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,840
Kill me, bitch!

794
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,860
No, Bob!

795
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,680
Kill me, bitch!

796
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:37,980
No!

797
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:38,860
No!

798
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,580
Me kill me, bitch!

799
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:40,880
No!

800
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,220
Praise Bob!

801
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,400
Praise Bob!

802
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:50,840
Woo!

803
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,220
How much slacker than that can you get?

804
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,780
You butchered those classics.

805
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,520
You slacked for sale!

806
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,280
I'm the art of power, baby.

807
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,660
I know it's fact.

808
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,400
You are the power of my life.

809
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,660
God, forgive me for nothing!

810
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,280
Let it run, don't bring up.

811
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,100
Stop!

812
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,860
You're a man.

813
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:28,300
You're piercing another human reality now.

814
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,680
I'm gonna have my slacks.

815
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,940
I'm gonna have my slacks.

816
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,020
I'm gonna have my slacks.

817
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,520
You slacks.

818
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,760
Boy, here we have you.

819
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,500
Here we go!

820
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,020
All sorts of slacks.

821
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,220
Yo, every kind of slacks is like them all.

822
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,740
Like the other side of the world.

823
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,760
And if you're right upstairs,

824
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,740
here he is, your butchered old man.

825
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,300
And you butchered that shit right now.

826
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:57,720
Get out!

827
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,060
Huge fight.

828
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,620
We have huge fights.

829
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,740
Final number three.

830
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,520
Fight, fight, fight, fight, I want huge.

831
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,360
Huge fights.

832
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,860
One, two, three.

833
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,320
Swag him off!

834
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,580
You have the cash, you can have your flag.

835
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,960
The money is mine!

836
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,080
Nothing for nothing.

837
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,020
You're like a tree.

838
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,460
Swag.

839
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,040
Flag is totally controlled by your protection.

840
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,460
Hey, you can't take my stuff.

841
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,080
I can take it for everyone.

842
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,820
Yeah, baby.

843
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,020
Swag, swag.

844
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,740
Swag, only, only, only by prescription.

845
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,860
Swag can heal your soul.

846
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,180
Stand back, dear friend, stand back.

847
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,940
I can't be responsible.

848
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:02,700
Why did that happen?

849
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,540
Repent!

850
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,080
Quit your job!

851
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,180
You have been driven to the brink of insanity

852
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:10,700
by the conspiracy!

853
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:15,780
Fuck!

854
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,120
You're out of the house!

855
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,720
You're an asshole!

856
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,640
What did you even think?

857
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,880
All this away!

858
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,160
All this is a mess!

859
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:22,560
Release!

860
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,480
Watch out!

861
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,460
Oh no!

862
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,900
Not the anti-bomb!

863
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,800
Bomb is not the answer!

864
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,620
And these are the things they are!

865
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:36,220
Nobody thinks bombs are the answer!

866
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,360
That's right!

867
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,520
Bomb is a blast!

868
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,380
Blasphemy is meant to die by the anti-bomb!

869
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,760
You can keep it off right now!

870
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,980
You can call the equipment!

871
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,360
He is going for the bomb!

872
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,700
And here comes the bomb!

873
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,020
Kill him off!

874
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,120
Kill him off!

875
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,120
The middle block!

876
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,280
Kill him off!

877
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,540
Kill him off!

878
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,760
Bomb blast!

879
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,740
Here it seems, passion!

880
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,300
Bomb, make it known,

881
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:00,960
when the biggest wave

882
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,560
you've ever had in the record

883
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,980
can become your single savior!

884
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,560
Grab and make it up!

885
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,280
Now, dear friends,

886
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,100
there's no telling

887
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,640
what's going on in this stage.

888
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,460
I, as I understand it,

889
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,680
Dobbs walked out.

890
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,900
They killed him.

891
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,860
he killed them

892
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,920
and Bill Miller

893
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,380
the lead singer there with Kings of Feedback

894
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,340
is having some kind of a fit

895
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,540
some kind of terrible

896
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,700
he's been messed up

897
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,580
he's spazzing out

898
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:42,760
the Pokeball New York

899
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,860

900
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:51,160

00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,700
look at what's coming out of his mouth

902
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,700
it's disgusting

903
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,520
Miller seems to be speaking in tongues

904
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,160
no he's healed

905
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,780

Christ Bob another healing

908
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,680
it's the only way

909
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,540
the only way to

910
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:12,740
the only way to

911
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:12,740


912
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,660
survive friends

913
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,960
is to kill Bob

914
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,280
we must kill that which we love

915
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,620
the most

916
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,440
Kings of Feedback dear friends

917
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,660
another lovely

918
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,600
devival

919
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,400
well actually that's not the end of it

920
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,460
that's only the end of

921
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:42,740
Part 2

922
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,720
Part 1 of the New York Devival

923
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,520
but we're getting now down near to the end of

924
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,560
Part 2 of this show

925
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:55,180
Kings of Feedback heard howling in the background

926
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,620
alright I know that was a heap of noise

927
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,680
and it's a bloody mess up here

928
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,520
we're gonna have to cart our savior off

929
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,140
put him in his body bag full of prairie crit squid juice

930
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,300
and resurrect him in three days

931
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,400
and dear friends you can resurrect

932
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,000

00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,720
as to what's been going on here

958
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,840
this is Doctors4Bob in the background

959
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,080
we've been listening to of course

960
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,980
the New York Slack folks

961
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,700
the Bible

962
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,320
particularly Pope David N. Meyer

963
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,500
the Pope of all New York

964
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,140
preaching back in his

965
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,340
domain of New York again

966
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,260
and Boston's own

967
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,560
kings of feedback with Bill T. Miller

968
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,520
doing those wonderful old hits

969
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,660
used Slack and Kill Bob

970
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,440
and so forth and we also heard

971
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,380
some nice cuts out of

972
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,560
Puzzling Evidences

973
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,760
broadcast there on KPFA

974
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,320

00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,660
cuts in well actually he got

976
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:41,960
some stuff from all over the place

977
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,360
that was G. Gordon Gordon

978
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:45,720
talking about

979
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,320
really giving you a tour

980
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,700
through the Dobbs Museum

981
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,020
and the statues of the saints

982
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:53,000
and the gods and the demons

983
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,940
and we heard some of ESO radios

984
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,340
Brain Rot Theater

985
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:02,720
Brain Rot Radio Theater

986
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,080
with the Bob and Connie show

987
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,420
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave there

988
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,220
and Princess Weardo and uh

989
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:11,940
and uh... what's that?

990
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,080
what?

991
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,540
oh there's so many many many things

992
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,740
to flip on next

993
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:16,540
let's just

994
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,400
let's just try one

995
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,620
Sister Smegma

996
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,000
it comes by her name

997
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,400
for her own lust for smegma pie

998
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,640
that woman's trying to delude you child

999
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,720
that's why you don't go to church anymore

1000
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,040
Grandpa why is it that you tell me

1001
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,400
one thing that I should do

1002
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,560
and then there's another person

1003
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,900
tells me the total opposite

1004
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,500
and they say that's the right thing too

1005
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,940
I don't understand that Grandpa

1006
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,480
I told you son

1007
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,520
only listen to me

1008
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,300
and little voices in your head

1009
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,280
especially the

1010
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,120
grandpa

1011
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,720
the little voices in my head

1012
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,140
are telling me to kill you again

1013
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,900
I think that that's crazy Grandpa

1014
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,320
oh

1015
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:56,740
oh

1016
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:57,380
oh

1017
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,540
oh

1018
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,400
hey Dad Dad

1019
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,780
Dad look at the price

1020
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,640
that's been growing

1021
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,960
I'm glad I killed all those sea monkeys

1022
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,100
and got with something with some fighting

1023
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,600
and I'm glad I killed them

1024
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,300
Dad Dad

1025
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,700
you're drunk again

1026
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,800
And I'm all gagged up too

1027
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,400
It's not your dad

1028
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,840
Stop torturing me

1029
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,920
Stop torturing me

1030
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,320
stop torturing me Connie

1031
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,040
you like it

1032
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,340
you knew those high heels

1033
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,260
were two sizes too small

1034
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,920
oh gee mom and dad

1035
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,320
can't we ditch this slather

1036
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,380
and get to the part where I

1037
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,900
eat the whole can of Crisco

1038
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,720
How many times must we tell you

1039
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,280
we're not as smart

1040
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,120
Your parents.

1041
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,540
Your fictionalized radio character.

1042
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,140
The kid.

1043
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,080
The innocent, mischievous gargoyle, like the voiceover says.

1044
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,400
Your luggage.

1045
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,460
A suitcase.

1046
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,460
Get it?

1047
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,660
I hate you, Mommy.

1048
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,400
I hate you, Mommy.

1049
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,520
I hate you, Mommy.

1050
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,440
Welcome.

1051
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,560
Welcome.

1052
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,920
Get right up.

1053
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,360
Was it good for you, Seegers?

1054
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,340
Good night.

1055
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,320
Oh, wait, what about Bob?

1056
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,340
Oh, yes.

1057
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:40,040
In the grips of my torment, I forgot about the best plane of all.

1058
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:40,900
Wait a moment.

1059
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,780
You, J.R. Bob, dog.

1060
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,780
Who says we never mention Bob on this show?

1061
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,440
We try to cover all the glitches.

1062
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:59,300
This is Reverend Susie the Floozy in Atlanta, WREK, where we were just helping out.

1063
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,620
You can get free information.

1064
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,020
If you know what I mean.

1065
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:09,020
But let's go back and listen, tapping in occasionally from now to 5 a.m. on Susie the Floozy's show.

1084

00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:17,220


1090
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:17,220


1091
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:17,220

1096

1097
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:24,160


1098
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:24,160


1099
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:24,160


1100
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,400

1101
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:24,400

4.

1106
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,760
Eventually, the truth about history is so corrupted, it doesn't even bear the slightest

1107
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,460
resemblance to what really happened.

1108
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:55,020
Chief amongst the conspiracy lies is the revisionist claims that the normals seized control of

1109
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,800
the planet from the subgenies.

1110
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:04,020
Like most history, this is just another fabrication written by victors who, ashamed of the real

1111
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:09,880
facts, try to cover up their shortcomings by doing what they do best, deceive.

1112
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,160
Yes, my friends, the truth of the matter is that the normals did not fight for the

1113
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,080
power they now possess.

1114
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:18,820
We did.

1115
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:24,340
We were the ones who fought and ultimately gave them the very control they lord over

1116
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:24,820
us today.

1117
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:29,260
Oh, it's hard to believe now because things are so different, but back in the old days,

1118
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:32,780
we had it so good, we kind of felt guilty about it.

1119
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:37,980
We'd look out across the planet admiring the beautiful landscape and architecture, and

1120
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,520
we'd smile.

1121
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,200
Oh, my.

1122
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:44,100
That is, until the pink eyesore of humanity came into view.

1123
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:50,460
The squatters camps and shanty towns of humans always polluted the outskirts of our paradise.

1124
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:57,100
Call it misguided compassion or just outright pity, but we couldn't look at those pitiful

1125
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,280
pinks without feeling partially responsible.

1126
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,540
And that, dear friends, was the beginning of the end.

1127
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:09,380
For there were those among us who spoke out in behalf of the normals and said we should

1128
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:09,580
share.

1129
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:15,020
Our leaders and future prognosticators warned us of the consequences if we were to make

1130
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:15,620
such a mistake.

1131
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,060
Beware, they warned.

1132
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,020
Do not let the bumbling ways of the normals fool you.

1133
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,800
They may have inferior balls and brains, but they can still reproduce.

1134
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:29,180
Nay, their stupidity in matters as simple as birth control could create a population explosion

1135
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,740
that will drown us in a pink sea of mediocrity.

1136
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,240
But alas, we did not heed their warnings.

1137
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,860
In fact, we laughed at the threat.

1138
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,160
For humans were so few it seemed ridiculous.

1139
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,780
They were, after all, our own creations.

1140
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:49,780
Grotesque monstrosities developed in our labs to see if the subgenius gene could graph onto

1141
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:50,580
that of a chimp.

1142
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:55,140
Unfortunately, we succeeded, and in so doing, we failed.

1143
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,420
For the results were so hideous and condemned by all in the medical establishment that further

1144
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,180
research and experiments in this area were forever banned.

1145
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:08,800
Yet our compassion prevented us from destroying what few normals had already hatched.

1146
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:14,600
Eventually, this terrible, well-meaning mistake was followed by the ultimate blunder of our

1147
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:14,880
race.

1148
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,820
The one unpardonable sin that we pay for now more than ever before.

1149
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:24,180
We granted the normals the vote.

1150
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:29,700
Yes, we handed them the very weapon they've used on us ever since.

1151
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,340
And the decline came fast and furious.

1152
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:37,040
Now we have not only exchanged place with our inferiors as disenfranchised minorities,

1153
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,780
suffering the same indignation as we did in the past, but we have also been forced to

1154
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,800
suffer more.

1155
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,460
We have not only been forced to suffer more, but we have suffered more.

1156
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:42,460


1157
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:42,460


1158
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,560
For we know full well we are the victims of our own generosity.

1159
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:51,080
Convinced by a few short-sighted liberals, we not only freed our Frankenstein from its

1160
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,400
chains, but we allowed it to chain us.

1161
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:59,420
And yet, these same monsters won't even give us credit for creating them, let alone providing

1162
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,980
every accomplishment and privilege they now possess.

1163
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,260
No, sir, they deny the truth and offer lies instead.

1164
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,060
We took what we got, they scream.

1165
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:11,640
It was the courage of our forefathers that forced yours to submit.

1166
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,580
You didn't have the guts to fight us.

1167
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:13,960
Ha!

1168
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,420
What a joke.

1169
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:20,140
Some genies have more guts hanging out their hemorrhoids than pinks have tucked in their

1170
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,380
soft fat tummies.

1171
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:26,540
We had the power to wipe the normals off the face of the earth, but we felt pity for them

1172
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:26,900
instead.

1173
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,920
And see what it got us.

1174
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:29,440
Nothing.

1175
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:30,840
Nothing but grief.

1176
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,900
Well, we're not going to make that mistake again.

1177
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,900
Our compassion and patience have both worn thin.

1178
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:43,060
You and your uppity-milted pinko attitude are really beginning to irritate us.

1179
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:49,100
We deal with it every time we see you on TV, or wait your table, or listen to your customer

1180
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:49,620
complaints.

1181
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:54,340
We tolerate it every time you jab your finger in our chest and say, well, let me tell you

1182
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:57,040
something, or you don't know who you're talking to.

1183
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,240
But enough is enough.

1184
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,680
Now we're going to tell you something.

1185
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,620
We brought you into this world, and we can take you out of it.

1186
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,880
Only this time, we're not going to let you go.

1187
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:07,880


1188
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,820
We're going to make you feel sorry for you when you suffer.

1189
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,740
Because you had your chance, and you blew it.

1190
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:17,340
You proved to us that living amongst your kind is simply not feasible.

1191
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,840
The lowest common denominator is too low a standard to bear, and too high a price to

1192
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,080
pay.

1193
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:29,440
If you had just said once, just once, gee, thanks for sharing your civilization with

1194
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:29,660
us.

1195
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,160
You didn't have to, but we're glad you did.

1196
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,080
Then maybe, maybe we could have forgiven you.

1197
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,880
But instead, you resigned.

1198
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:43,480
You rounding back your Meanwhile moment.

1199
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,640
If you envy your history, you ideological tan ties, you

1200
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,020
black domineering form, you

1201
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,200
victim yourself for beingwide eliminated, you

1202
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:47,860
也是.

1203
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:52,040
He vaporizes/.

1204
00:59:52,040 --> 01:00:02,240
It mensuers against your creativity.

1205
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:02,240


1206
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:02,280
We are part of your civilization.

1207
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:02,320
You are, for us.

1208
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:07,860
Let go of our consciences.

1209
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:14,120
option except termination of the entire experiment. We must do today what we should have done long ago,

1210
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:22,140
start over at square one. If only we had put humanity out of its misery in the first place,

1211
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:27,140
we could have avoided a lot of unnecessary pain and suffering. But at least this way,

1212
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:34,260
we have one thing to show for it. A hundred years from now, when we're teaching our children the

1213
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:39,780
real history of the world, and they look up with their sad little faces and droopy eyes and say,

1214
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:46,480
gee, did you have to destroy them all? Was it really necessary? We'll be able to look them

1215
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,820
straight in the eye and respond without any hesitation, yes, we did, because the alternative

1216
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:58,200
was too unbearable. Hearing us, the word of Bob, please, Bob. Amen.

1217
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:04,380
you
