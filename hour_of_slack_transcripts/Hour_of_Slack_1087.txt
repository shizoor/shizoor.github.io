Philosophers have a category of traditional sin, basic sin.
Sin indeed presents us with an opportunity to more graphically, more vividly, more specifically, more distinctly sin in our culture, in our life, in our society, in the world.
But let me mention one other sin as well.
Well, it is, it is, it is, it is a sin.
It's the self-genius power of sin.
We love butt burial indeed.
If you are listening, please don't hesitate to call.
We would love to sin with you.
This will only take a moment.
What do you want to know?
Tell me when.
Last night.
When?
It was late.
That's when it was.
Tell me.
It was very dark.
I see.
The dead girl.
This one?
I don't want it anymore.
I still don't.
Did you dance?
Yes.
Yeah?
Why dance?
I was drunk.
And all I had was a hat full of dried leaves.
Staring at a headless dummy tasting the cigarettes.
She likes it when I do that, don't you?
Sure.
Sure, I like it.
Yes.
Bob and Connie really enjoy life.
You're right.
Scott.
Calling for oral 69.

Even violence.
Probing.
May it please the opening of oral institution for the profoundly retarded.
The Supreme Court.
Permanent brain damage.
Pregnant women find doctors who would perform a 69.
Become pregnant in the future.
It didn't happen.
We didn't do it.
Somebody else did it.
You're not hurt as bad as you say you were.
And besides, we weren't there.
They would take it.
So what?
Prepare for oral.
Yay.
Number six.

This is a, is the greatest mockery of justice.
Constitution.

Cox argued for the federal government.
There is a clear violation of a constitutional right.
Cox suggested raising.
What does that mean then?
Got him here.
Got him here.
What are you going to do about it?
What does that mean?
It means that the appellants.
Well, what is that?
That's coercion.
Violate the federal constitution.

Anyway, friends, praise the winter holidays, which have been lately renamed by our friend
Reverend Susie the floozy.
It's not Saturnalia anymore.
In honor of the late great Anna Nicole Smith, we now call it Slatternalia.
And I was actually real sorry to hear about the passing of Anna Nicole, my cousin, Anna
Nicole Smith.
It's a white female.
It's a white female.
One three.
Zero.
One three.
Repeating.
White female.

White female.
Blah, blah.
Woof, woof.
Ah, Connie.
Praise Connie, my friends.
Connie Dobbs, the wife of Bob Dobbs, our guru.
This episode of Hour of Slack number 1087 is loosely devoted to the fact that we are not

Connie Tite Matters.
Actually, I guess it's more addressed to the devotion to Connie
and Connie Tites by male subgeni.
Lemur's cut-ups and Norell Prefs helped usher in the subject matter.
But now, let's ask Dr. Howe
on the Puzzling Evidence Show with Dr. Philo Drummond.
Well, I hope you've been reading my series on Dr. Howe's horrible animal facts.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yeah, you have.
I've got a good one lined up next.
I've got these horrible worms with acid sperm.
They fertilize each other by squirting sperm on each other
that's actually acid that eats through their skin
because they don't have an aperture for sex.
So it has to eat through their skin.
An aperture that leads to the cloaca through which eggs are discharged.
But the sperm actually has to dissolve through their skin.
And I've got a horrible frog that looks like a turd
and gets up on its hind legs and screams like a woman in mortal agony.
That's at least as good as the poop-eating parrot or the jelly face.
That's better because it's like,
hey, we don't have an aperture, let's just throw acid at each other.
Well, certain octopuses...
Well, I've got a question for you, Dr. Howe.
The audience claims that you're a know-it-all
and you know what you're talking about.
Oh, they don't know what they're talking about.
Have you ever taken the alien knowledge test?
Who knows what they're talking about?
Have you ever taken it, Dr. Howe, the alien knowledge test?
Is that like the Jerry Lewis announcer's test?
No, it's an actual test that tests your knowledge
in terms of what's been reported over the years
of interesting and intriguing facts about extramarines.
Now, you can attest the testiness of this test.
Let's see how much you know about them.
Are you ready for me to ask you some of these questions, Dr. Howe?
Well, under these special circumstances,
I think I'd better answer all your questions about aliens
and other menaces to our civilization.
Now, you don't have to answer that.
This is an easy test because this test is a multiple-choice test.
I will give you the question...
That's a pretty good one.
It's just like Bug Girl said,
there's a plastic dinosaur right in the way,
but you got a better shot than she did.
I will give you the question.
I will give you the question,
and then I will give you the choice of answers.
Are you ready?
Well, you're all too kind.
Are you ready, Dr. Howe?
I am as ready as I possibly may be.
Over the centuries,
aliens have abducted many noted human writers.
Which of the following great artists was not abducted?
A. William Shakespeare,
B. Edgar Allan Poe,
C. Ernest Hemingway,
and D. Charles Dickens.
Which would you say was not abducted?
Well, that's a real head-scratcher, I gotta say.
A lot of the questions we get in our trade are melon-scratchers.
Yeah, he's right.
Emile Zola.
I guess I'm going to have to go for Paul Meunier.
Emile Zola.
I mean...
Did you mean Ernest Hemingway?
From another way.
It's like he can name almost anybody.
Was he ever...
No, he's...
He's the most likely to have been...
He's actually killed himself before the aliens got him,
and that is the correct answer to number one is C.
Ernest Hemingway.
I have not been on these sources.
Now, okay, well, let's move on to question two.
I think you'll find this one much, much easier.
Just a hand fuller in the book.
Well, we'll try it.
Which historical figure helped point out the home star of aliens
whose navigation system had failed?
If you complete...
A.
A.
A.
A.




Julius Caesar.
B.
A.
B.
Jesus Christ.
C.

In the five-tenured coat.
Albert Einstein.
Or D.
D.
D.
George Washington.
Now, think about it.
Which one would have pointed to the home star of aliens
whose navigation system had failed?
Think about it.
That would be the star series that the dog gone to Central Africa
have been claiming they intermarried with those sons of God.
and produce their current race.
But I'm just going to have to say...
What were those choices again?
Those choices were A, Julius Caesar, B, Jesus Christ.
I'll give it to Jesus this time.
You are correct, sir.
That is absolutely correct.
B is correct.
When he was first born, baby Jesus pointed out the star Betelgeuse.
The Lord Jesus.
Always give it to Jesus.
Yes, always choose Jesus.
That's the important thing.
When given a question and answer test,
where some of the answers involve Jesus,
always choose the Jesus answer.
That is the correct procedure there.
Number three.
We will move on through the test here with number three.
Aliens called trapezoids visited Earth to entertain humans.
What kind of entertainment was it?
A, approximately.
Parade.
B, a play.
C, alien baseball.
Or D, a circus.
Well, it looks like alien baseball has got to be the answer there.
I'm sorry, Dr. Howell.
In this case, D was the correct answer.
But what about the trapezoid on the field?
The circus took place in the spaceship in zero gravity.
And zero gravity.
Zero gravity.
Zero gravity.
It sounds like.
It is true.
Zero gravity.
That wasn't even a funny answer.
Well, look.
If aliens didn't put trapezoids down in baseball fields, who did?
The aliens were trapezoids.
And baseball fields don't have trapezoids.
They do when trapeze monks maintain the grounds.
Their diamonds are...
I guess a diamond is a trapezoid, isn't it?
Now you're coming around.
Now you're cooking with propane.
It's at least a...
structure.
We're going to both agree to that.
Whether the aliens do or not.
Truth is fiction.
And this is the Ornith Viva.
Judge Abraham Fuller of Newton, Massachusetts,
found his fee in the dead man's clenched fist.
The Ornith Viva.
In a moment, I'll tell you about an unusual railway,
which has been lightened by draining its water tank.
The Ornith Viva.
Ornith Viva.
Ornith Viva.

Murder!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Cock-a-doodle!
Cock-a-doodle!
There.
Trigger man.
The supernatural.
Unknown quantities in the human soul.
Complete credibility.
Sure.
It's funny how it all comes back to you in the end.
I stood there, the rod cold in my hand, waiting.
Chicken.
Tonight, tonight.
What do you mean?
You know it and I know it.
This is for you!
You belly rat!
Oh, Tom.
Yell.
Breathing hard all the time?
Well, I... from soup to nuts.
I packed a new gap and started to look for Riley.
Riley, the dick who'd set me up.
Yeah.
He was gonna be number one.
Chicken! Chicken!
You can do a lot with 500 bucks a week.
Sure I was hot. Plenty hot.
Hot!
Oh!
Yes, I'm in charge here. What can I do for you?
I should have been excited, but I wasn't.
You, you, you, you... chicken.
Yeah, yeah.
Chicken always. A chicken.
When you were brought back from the future,
they put all 4,400 of you into quarantine?
Uh, yes, pretty much.
And this was a totally sterile, completely controlled environment.
Yeah.
Wow. That sounds nice.
In a sexual justice system, justice-based defenses are considered especially...
Slacks of slack.
Oh my god.
Oh man.
No. No. I can't deal with this.
I...
Hey, what's that mean?
...tweak his ego a little bit.
I didn't do anything!
Then what happened?
How long did you stay?
No, it's Harry.
God, what did I do? What did I do?
I wanted to get my eats while they were still hot.
You think this is a joke?
No, no joke. Should use the condom, Harry.
Please, please, please.
Kind of put the old muzzle on Mr. Happy, if you know what I mean.
Anybody witness this fateful hurl?
You know, luckily I had a good buzz on it.
Look, man.
A lap dance sends a pretty strong signal.
Ooh!
Get you back where you belong.
Ugh.
It's a drug.
If anything turns up, I'll let you know.
Hell of a catch-22.
I offered to vomit on the floor.
Thank you, Norell Preff, for the offer.
Uh, now from Reverend Ed Fred up Detroit Way.
Uh, let's hear this love song.
Yes, friends, a love song.
They're going to be...
Connie of Love by Ed Fred from Anthems for Bob.
A-loops are like candy.
I'm a little bit of a





Her hair is gold.
As uberfamous as it can be.
Her scent is bold.
She's my Connie of Love.
She's my Connie of Love.
She's my Connie of Love.
She's my Connie of Love.
Now, of this planet.
She was sent from above.
Her pleasure ship I would man it.
She's my Connie of Love.
She's my Connie of Love.
She's my Connie of Love.
She's my Connie of Love.
She's my Connie of Love.
She's my Connie of Love.
She's a Wario Princess.
She's the Queen of Sex.
Under her spell and an instant.
So easy to resist.
Yes.
She's the semáis of sex.


She's theihi de lordенное.
Yeah.
she's the one,
Hey she's holding this,

a hot 부� Schwarzer someplace in here.

she's the Winter Exils.

Oh,
Why Z that complaining pieces of junk



My o Claro that Euros

Yeah,
I feel like eventually,
I'm not really a man with long hair.
Sgtista?
I agree.
Oh, yes, I say, yes, I say.
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, I don't know.
We believe in, well, in rationalizing everything.
You know, Bob won't die for your sins.
He says, I'm going to die for you.

He's not well-connected enough to do that.
He's not, his dad isn't famous like God or anything.
And he doesn't care about your sins.
He really doesn't give a hoot.
He does come to excuse and justify and rationalize your sin.
And that's why we believe in irrationalizing.
Did I say that right?
Irrationalizing?
Yeah.
And we all do it.
It's just that most people won't admit it.
I don't know.
Why is everybody staring at the pretty colors instead of me?
You know, if I had, we, the reason I do that is because normally at these events,
we have a big production with dancing boys and girls, top hats,
and this big light show and everything.
And winter starts just too cheap.
That's the only, so I thought I'd show that.
But what else we hear?
Okay, we believe in Bob and we believe in FROP.
And we wallow.
We wallow in the inaction of FROP.
FROP inaction is just sitting on your butt.
Okay, so I've explained the church.
You midnight ramblers.
When I say midnight ramblers, I don't mean just black knights.
I mean you black-hearted men and women.
And midnight ramblers.
All midnight ramblers' faces are not black.
What they're on is as black as midnight.
I'm talking to you.
Hold up, men.
And women.
And you bank robbers.
You say so.
Yes.
And you bank robbers.
And kidnap.
I'm talking to you.
And we got some people in the church.
Stay down just as late as a midnight rambler.
All right.
I don't know what time Brother...
...cut in last night.
Yeah, Brother Fowler's a day ahead and you know that, isn't he?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
It's the anointing that will break the yoke of Satan's bondage.
And I want you to know that I had just been experiencing an attack on all sides.
It seemed like on every front where we tried to advance,
the devil would just unleash literally hordes of demonic forces to stop us.
And...
...after a few weeks of this, I just began to feel a deep hurting in my belly, way deep down in my spirit.
And some people say, Brother Popov, what?
You mean you experience pain too?
Yes, I do.
I hurt just like you do.
I feel the pain of a satanic attack just like you do.
That's why I'm concerned about you.
That's why I feel for you.
I feel in the spiritual pain and your suffering and the sickness that Satan throws at you to try to overcome you.
But bless God, Satan is a defeated foe.
But while I felt this pain, it seemed almost as if a spontaneous thing happened.
As I...
Finally, I...
...no longer, but I really didn't even know how to pray because I didn't know exactly what the devil...
...what was coming at me.
Satan was bombarding me from so many sides.
Actually, I felt kind of numb.
I know how that is, Brother Popov.
Oh, do I know it.
Friends, before Peter popped off, we heard...
...Midnight Rambler by the great D.K. Jones.
That's from like 1980.
And some preaching by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang from Winter Star Symposium 2007.
But now, Glass Madness and...
...Me from 1982.
Big Bob.
I got a mighty big Bob.
I got a mighty big Bob.
I got a big Bob.
I got a mighty big Bob.
And he's gotta come out.
Well, he must have got in.
No room.
We gotta get out.
There ain't no room in my skin.
But there's a mighty big Bob.
Big Bob.
He's inside of me.
He's a mighty big Bob.
Oh, good Bob.
You know, it makes him a pig.
It makes him a pig.
He's a mighty big Bob.
He's too big.
He's a mighty big Bob.
And he's really too big.
He's a mighty big Bob.
And he's really too big.
He's a mighty big Bob.
And he's really too big.
Ironic.
Horny Toad recently made this astounding discovery and brought these soft morning after trousers to market.
Oh.
Horny Toad did that.
Really?
Uh, that sounds like something...
Kind of a three toad, tree toad.
What do you mean horny toad did this?
What are you talking about?
Says right there.
Horny Toad recently made this astounding discovery.
Says right here in our manual.
Oh, if you say so.
In our manual, our radio show manual here.
Oh, really?
When we walk in that that guy, that one guy gives us.
I don't know though.
You didn't get it?
No, I just don't think anybody's out there at all.
I don't think they are either.
We're going to fire the flares for the last time here as the show sinks and we hit the no listener iceberg.
Those flares have been unfashionable since the beginning of the 80s.
I know, but we had so many aboard it.
I bought a big box of them.
I still like those old flares in the horny toad collar hole.
But let's speed up, friends.
I like this background music from Bonobo's Convergence.
With some more Ed Fred.
And this tune is called Sex Hurt.
Sex Hurt.
Sex Hurt.

Sex Hurt.
Sex Hurt.
Sex Hurt.

Never Enough For You, friends, from the Gregory Morris Group,
a CD called Houses in the Sky.
If you want more information about the Gregory Morris Group,
you can look at gregorysmusic.com.
I saw that band at Winterstar playing at parties and on stage,
and it was great.
All right, and now, the President of the United States.
Mr. Prime Time,
in the long term, security in Iraq requires sectarian violence,
something the overwhelming majority of Iraqis want.
I agree.
And I look forward to face-to-face extremist violence.
Prime Minister and I agree that dominating Iraq
is aimed at strengthening the sectarian violence.
The government is still at a Ai.
That makes me sick...
ure fascinating, Mr. Prime.
Do you think that now that Dick, the real Dick Cheney
he has the Holy Grail, but he'll actually usurp the throne
and take over거야 King Sidney Wubeah's throne?
No.
I'm sure he is where he wants to be.
He likes to be in the subgenius that actually pulls
the strings of the puppet, right?
Sort of the Bob before the Bob move.
What the heck...

I hate the way this...
It's really gone downhill here on the show.
Yeah.
Because there's this sticky stuff on this place.
Now you know that you originated that.
That's really rude.
That's real show.
You got show all over you.
You got it on the desk.
You got it on your clothing.
Really, such an irrational example.
It has to be.
Well, you'll have to clean it up.
That's true.
It's a real sticky show.
Yes, it is.
It sticks to your ribs.
Especially if you are un...
careful enough.
Hey, was that the little pile of stickiness?
The little ball of sticky?
Keep the stickiness in that one area.
Okay, here are the little subgenius demigods
dancing with little fairy wings
in gossamer clothing
at the book signing after April 1st.
Yes, for listeners in Northern California, friends,
there will be a festive book signing
at City Lights Bookstore,
the famous City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco,
of the two new subgenius books,
the Bobliagraphon and Revelation X reprint.
I won't be there, but here's who will.
Dr. Howell, Dr. Philodrummon, Puzzling Evidence,
Phineas Narco, I don't know who else,
Michael Pepe, probably,
maybe even Saint.
I don't know.
Palmer Vredes, that's April 1st
at City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco.
But now, Lee Murr, and then back to Winterstar
for news about the subgenius child custody case.
And this, this, I guess...
Yeah, I mean, I mean, you know, when, uh,
when, when, you know, you know, you know,
you know, you know, uh, uh, uh, um...
Now, for those of you who already were subgeniuses,
I have some news.
Last year, I described the situation of Reverend Magdalene,
and I'm not bullshitting, this is a true story.
This nice, college-educated woman with two jobs
and a husband with two jobs
had her child taken away from her,
and the courts gave full custody of her child
to the biological dad
who is living in a trailer court on welfare.
The reason being,
Reverend Magdalene is a subgenius.
And this judge saw pictures on the internet
of what the subgeniuses do
at their X-Day celebration out at Brushwood.
They saw pictures of Reverend Magdalene's husband
dressed up as Jesus, but with a clown face
and carrying a cross,
only it was shaped like a giant dollar sign
made of pool noodles.
And he was being whipped and beaten
by naked women using dildos.
And that's true.
Those pictures are on there.
Reverend Jesus and his friend Mickey Death Chick
were raised as Catholics,
and they had heard about that movie,
The Passion of Christ.
And they're also splatter film,
slasher movie fans,
and they thought Mel Gibson hadn't been bloody enough.
So they decided to refilm Passion of the Christ
with more fake blood.
And so we had machine guns, squirt guns of blood.
Boy, I mean, he had blood.
Packs all over him.
Fake whip marks.
It was the bloodiest thing in the world.
But those pictures were enough to cause that judge to say,
this is a sickening, disgusting, satanic religion.
Besides, somebody was wearing a mask of a goat.
And you know that means devil worship.
You know, there's a goat anywhere around.
I need to tell my brother.
He raises goats for a living.
Why goats?
Well, the recent news is,
Reverend Magdalene, after, I mean,
because this,
the Christian father, biological father,
is jobless permanently on welfare,
he gets a free lawyer.
Because the Bevilacquas have four jobs between them,
they have to pay for a lawyer.
Well, the first lawyer they had,
it turned out, well, his dad was golfing buddies with the judge.
That's why he didn't really fight very hard.
So finally they got it, when this latest thing happened,
and they,
for 10 years they shared custody.
But suddenly this judge decided,
he suddenly got all religious on everybody,
and decided Church of the Subgenius was a bad religion.
Can't it be both?
Anyway, so they got a new lawyer.
It made the news big time,
and every time it did, I sold a lot of stuff.
That whole thing is actually done,
if they were trying to cause harm to the church,
it had just the opposite effect.
But anyway, they got it,
and the judge, after becoming famous on the internet,
as a complete idiot,
recused himself.
Next time you get fired from a job,
just tell people you recused yourself from that job.
And they got a new judge.
Well, the new judge,
after six months of deliberation,
during which time the vegetarian little boy
had to stay with his dad,
being forced to eat meat,
they decided that, you know,
soy products turn you effeminate.
That's a big right-wing thing now.
And so therefore,
the kid had to eat meat.
Couldn't be a vegetarian anymore,
because that's why he was so little.
Wasn't the fact that he was ten years older.
So, to make a long story short,
this new judge decided,
no, church and subgenius isn't a religion,
it's really art.
But it's bad art.
It's drivel.
It's harmful.
And so the mom could have the kid
a little bit more on the weekends,
but she could never have subgenius materials
around the house.
God bless her.
God forbid that some child be exposed
to a picture of a smiling man
representing a religion,
you know, because cool religions
are represented by pictures of dying men.
Right?
So, somehow I suppose it's okay
for a child to be raised in the church
of the flying spaghetti monster,
or the church of Jesus Christ,
or any of these other invented,
made-up, fictitious space monsters.
But for some reason,
just because,
there's a little bit of nakedness involved
with Bob's church.
And you Wiccans know how that is.
You guys have been dealing with it
for a lot longer than we have.
In fact, that's where a whole lot of our help came from,
was from, you know, pagans,
neo-pagans and stuff,
who kind of went,
yeah, we know how this is.
You know, they can take your kid away
because of the comic books that your parents read.
Well, I mean, I guess every stripper needs to have,
is an unfit mother, you know?
Anybody who's not in a mainstream religion
is a potential unfit parent
if you have to live in that small town in New York.
By the way, it wasn't Texas that this happened in,
it was New York.
I don't think that would,
well, it would happen in Texas too.
People are the assholes everywhere.
So the latest thing is,
they're taking it to an appellate court
and where five judges who aren't from the small town,
hopefully will go,
oh my God, we can't believe this has been going on.
We've been in this for so long.
And maybe the mom will get full custody.
We'll see.
That would be nice.
Um, uh, I, I, I, I, uh, I, uh, uh, and, uh, and,
just, look at the tennis,
just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just,
that's an excellent question because,
that's an excellent question because,
that's, uh, and, um,
Beth stood in the doorway,
sleepily rubbing her eyes.
In the glow from the partially open door of the stove,
she saw,
Oh, a kitty.
Oh, Santa Claus did come after her.
Look at him.
Grrr.
Eyes red with hatred,
he started toward the little girl.
Mommy's singing.
Look, he's licking my hand.
The murderous jaws slashed the air,
and this time he hit the stove as he landed.
And a moment later, the little puppy lay still.
Good work, boy.
When the sergeant returned to the living room,
Beth was crying quietly.
in her mother's arms.
The first
first night.
And the subgenius church,
um, we, we don't,
there, we don't have regular weekly meetings,
or, you know, like, we don't get together on Sundays.
If we did, it would be Saturday nights,
and it would be in bars.
And, in fact, some clenches do that, I think.
Uh, you know, because, uh,
religion should give you slack.
Some people think we don't take
ecstatic happiness seriously.
And I've always found it very hard to take
ecstatic laughing happiness,
all that fucking goddamn serious
for myself.
Pardon my language.
But, uh, we, we don't,
one reason we don't have, uh,
church buildings and, and, uh,
and tent show meetings,
I mean, this right here is about as close as it gets.
Aside from the shows in the bars.
It's because the subgeniuses,
by definition, they're real weirdos.
I mean, they're not just pretend,
the real ones are really weird.
And that means they don't always get along with each other.
For every subgenius, there's gonna be another one who's,
it's the exact opposite, and drives it crazy.
I seem to have quite a few of those.
And I seem to function as that for lots of people.
And also, you can, you can actually see this happen
on the subgenius internet.
Um, we, there's a whole lot of email lists and things,
but really, my favorite one is a,
a forum called alt.slack.
It's been on the, it's one of,
it was one of the first Usenet news groups,
believe it or not,
because we, computer geeks have always loved Bob.
They can read and stuff, you know.
And this, uh,
uh, on alt.slack, about it,
it seems like it's just the opposite of slack.
These people cannot get along.
They say the nastiest,
bluntest put-downs to each other.
I mean, you dare not get on there trying to be funny.
Because if you aren't, they'll let you know
in a blunt and mean way.
And people look at that and they think subgeniuses are mean.
And it's true that the sensitive wimps
don't really last very long in the public forum like that.
But, you know, if you're a little boy or girl from balloony land,
you really shouldn't be going to pincushion man parties.
People go,
well, now what do you guys believe in then?
If you believe in Bob,
who looks like a cartoon character to me,
or, or, or what?
Well, uh,
and that's up to each subgenius.
You know, some of them are very, uh,
well, swallowed damn near anything.
Proof of that is the fact that these books are still in print.
But,
and we have three in print,
and all are available at the sales table, by the way,
but, uh,
we don't believe in magic or science.
Science,
according to science,
breasts are nothing but, uh,
modified sweat glands.
So much for science.
Lost me right there, buddy.
We don't believe the crap they teach in schools
about creationism or evolution.
Uh, we call, in fact, the latest name for schools,
is coninfectionaries,
because all they do is spread their sugary lies.
It sounds so good.
They never talk about the descendants of the Yeti,
or how the exes came and
accidentally killed all the dinosaurs
and invented humans as lab rats, actually.
It was the original idea, but they escaped.
And then the Yetis started having sex with the humans.
And here we are, watered down,
looking just like humans ourselves, almost.
Most, some of us, anyway.
Oh!
No!
What year is that?
Oh my…
Hitler was a woman!
This is contemporary.

Hitler was a woman.
And that was a joke on the show, many years ago.
Hitler was a woman to me.
Hitler was a woman to me.
Hitler was a woman…
I'm faxing this to all my friends.
More than a woman to me,
Hitler was a woman to me.
Hitler was a woman!
Autopsy proves it it says.
Wow, a current…
… holy shit…








He wasn't no goody two-shoes, though.
He wasn't no namby-pamby hand-wringing do-gooder.
He was evil.
She was evil.
In 2006, nearly a year old, this publication makes the audacious suggestion that Adolf Hitler, former Chancellor of the Third Reich, was in fact a woman.
Another victim in the victim society.
Then there was a Hitler autopsy photo, extremely interesting, after that fake alien autopsy, because after all...
Have you ever thought about what would have happened if you could have gotten there and, like, talked Hitler out of being bad?
No.
If you could have just talked with him for a while, you probably could have convinced him.
Although, of course, that's what anybody from now at times would do.
Even Martin Landau.
Except Martin Landau.
What would Martin Landau do?
He tried to shoot him, and he...
I don't remember what it was.
Well, that was just...
That was only an act, though.
In the 22 minutes that would prevent him.
That was only an act.
I know, but it was as close as I ever saw it.
But when Martin Landau, when they asked Martin Landau about that, he kind of wished it was true.
Yeah.
Just like...
Like Barbara Bain.
I was just thinking, in an alternate universe, I was married to Barbara Bain, says Martin Landau.
And Hitler was a woman.
No.
Barbara Bain and Martin Landau were so underrated.
You think so?
Yeah.
I never could quite get Barbara Bain.
Really?
She was kind of out there.
She was very difficult to get.
I see you doing what I'm doing.
Oh, my eyes are not any good anymore.
You're peering off into the distance towards that round thing on the wall.
Yes, that analog fizz.
One that records the passage of occurrences and tiny little things.
Little increments of chronological progression.
Yeah.
Time's uncoiling stainless spring.
Time slowly breaks down as we prepare for the nice new show to happen.
And the big doughnuts.
And the big rolling doughnuts.
Major donors are at cost.
Time has endless varieties and shows of all varieties, which revealeth old things.
And heaven maketh new discoveries, and earth, and even earth itself, a discovery.
But you know, you can bring the kids to the show.
I mean, at least virtually.
I believe I'm there.
Virtually, you can bring the kids to the show.
We'll put them to work.
In your mind.
And we will put them to work on special projects from which you will benefit.
We can make your kids perform, but only after subgenius indoctrination.










Really?
That is essential.
Complete, steep, and subgenius doctrine is the only possibility.
We'll plant the seeds of compliance.
We'll nurture the grounds of agreement.
We'll make them into virtual meat puppets.
Puppets?
For which you are the puppet master.
That is so, because the puppets are an intermediate between the performer and the audience.
But we want puppets to assume a more exalted station than that.
Some people might say that it's the puppet that jerks the strings that moves the puppet master's fingers.
They might and do say it.
And the puppet master is the true puppet.
How about rod puppets?
When rod is there manipulating these puppets.
When rod's doing it?
Well.
That would prove nice.
Ah, yes.
Yes, it would.
I can remember it a little.
Bob.
Bob?
Why, that guy owes me $140.
He does?
Wow.
Well, you owe him a lot more.
You owe him your everlasting happiness and soul and the slack that you so willfully gave away without even knowing it.
You let the slack leak out of your pocket like...
What are you reading?
Like...
Like pennies from a pocket of a ripped out pair of pants that you just don't care about anymore.
You just can't keep up with them.
But then when you throw them away, you intensely care about them.
Then all of a sudden, yeah, you look around and say, what happened to my money?
Where's my blue pair of pants?
I always...
Oh, boy.
Really?
That's what you say?
I think so.
Or a simulacrum to that effect.
Okay.
Ferreting out your fellow subgeni in a crowd...
Can be difficult at times.
We give you the techniques it takes to whiff-read your local subgenius.
Stench aura.
As it permeates and exceeds from the crowd itself, you can penetrate to the inner depths simply by whiff-reading that aura stench.
That sigh stench.
See?
I can smell Dr. Howe right now.
Oh, I'm heavily sorry.
Are you sure?
That is amazing.
It's your sigh stench.
It smells like perfume.
Oh, for God's sake.
Thy rich perfume exalts the room.
Well, what are you going to do?
I mean, there are odors, miasmas.
Some of them are deliberately produced by the body to send subtle chemical signals to our fellow beings.
And is this not our birthright?
Yes.
Are we not apes?
Yes.
Those noble creatures.
Not monkeys.
Those horrible, nasty...
Yetensen.
Yetensen.
...throwing, biting...
No, we are great apes and are...
Yetis.
Yetis interbred with the human stock back in the day, as the great Zukalski pointed out.
Of course, he thought that this was...
He thought it was bad.
...to the depletion of the human animal.
And that yeti throwbacks were people like Benito Mussolini, who were generally dictators,
and people who exercised political and civil power.
But we, the subgeniuses, believe...
Or that 180 degrees away from Zukalski, that the yeti human interbreeding created our best and chiefly, among them, the subgeniuses.
Yes, it's difficult, but it happens when you discover your true yeti mate.
...eat a lot of fruit, swing from the trees, do all that you can to re-commonize your yetin-sin existence.
...and that the depletion of the human stock back in the day, as the great Zukalski pointed out.

So I've got to get back and make one more...
...that can help me to...
Yes, being skewered by an elder god is part of that process.
Symbolically, of course.
...to work out...
She liked that.
Can I be a Sasquatch too?
You already are.
You're my son, JB.
You're my son, JB.
Baby Sas.
Sasquatch is my daddy and he's going to protect me.
Half man, half machine.
On the cover of a magazine.
Bigfoot is my father and he's got to protect me.
These lyrics don't make sense.
Think I found the evidence.
That yeti is my papa and he wants to protect me.
Yeah!
Yeah, you have to be careful.
Because if you find your true yeti mate, you will be manipulated by the elder gods.
It's part of the process.
Sure is.
Swimming in this radio liquid slag supreme.
It's real good for the circulation.
It forces the blood through the limbs.
Yes, damn braces.
Bless, relax.
We'll relax you in a moment.
We will?
Yes, we will.
And we'll teach you how to...
I was just looking at the camera here.
420 guy.
Oh, don't look at the camera.
420 guy?
Yeah.
Is he still there?
Yeah, he's on the country roads lead to his palatial mansion.
Yeah, he's back there.
It's no Mick mansion, folks.
Trailing, driving.
But what is his, you know, national origin?
Where...
Where's he from?
That's exactly what I'm...
What's his make in modeling?
What's the 65 million year climax that he keeps talking about?
Well, that seems good and long.
Well, I...
Long enough to get the job done, I would think.
Yeah.
Hacking, you just keep hacking and whacking away and eventually you'll be finished.
You just think about it one gradient at a time.
There you go.
Take a...
Grasp this object.
Yeah, grasp this.
Whoo!
Here you go, Dr. Howe.
All right, now what?
I don't know.

I'll pinch off a big...
All right, enough of this.
...portion.
It's a blank food tube.
And the devil take the hindmost, eh?
Yes.
Now this is the special food, it's the all-purpose food and it's...
Well, as long as it's special.
You just call it food, that's all you have to call it.
You mean it's generic?
Because it's all... everything is all in one thing and it all tastes the same, but it tastes good.
Let me at it.
It doesn't have a real flavor.
It's just good.
I'll take two tubs.
What does it taste like?
I don't know, but it tastes good.
Aren't you going to be picking up pieces of ice off the deck and throwing it away or keeping it as a souvenir?
Right.
I will either throw it or keep it.
And in either case, it would be a souvenir.
One which I either reject or keep.
Are inspired.
Yes, that's it.
And if I keep it, I'll put it in my pocket where it will do me the most good.
Tie it in a ribbon.
Throw it in the deep woods.
Wrap it in a big rubber band.
Rocketing rickets.
With big red straps.
Ricketing rackets.
I'm going to swim over to the lifeboats.
Save those coupons.
Yes, I did clip and save all the coupons, but they went down with the ship.
Don't forget to take your vitamins.
I need them in this 28 degree water.
You'll need all the nutrition you can get, so take your food and go.












I'm going to go to the food tube.
Put it over your shoulder or tie it to your belt or something.
You'll need it.
Now, here hold this barnacle, this barnacle bag that you'll be sleeping in.
Inside the barnacle bag, there's a slot for your food tube.
Stick it right in there.
You see that slot?
He's out of it now.
He can't remember.
He's just...
Do you think he has...
I see the food tube.
It's strapped to his back.
I hate food.
I hate food.


He has the barnacle bag.
He's doing this every time.
He has the barnacle bag.
Knock him out every time we get him off the air.
Now, he'll be extracting the barnacles from the bag before he can actually sleep in the
bag.
Really?
And inside the barnacle covered bag, he will put his salt covered body into which he
will pull his food tube and extract the food substance therein.
Like a turkey.

A giant Skeeter.
In a sucking motion.
Just call me Skeeter Libby.
If it says Libby, it's on the label.
Skeeter Luby.
Skeeter Luby.
Then you'll love it, love it, love it on your table.
Some people call him Dr. Howl, but you'll love it, love it, love it and Levitts, right?
No, I hate Levitts.
But...
They hate you, too.
They do.
They told me.
They sent me an e-mail the other day and said we hate Dr. Howl.
Don't bring him back over here.
You know, I was speaking only figuratively because I, Dr. Howl, am the friend...

Wait, I just got an email from...
They were...
Just kidding.
I love humanity.
They didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
I love them, I do.
They really didn't.
They were just simply...
Just joking around.
Just joshing.
They were joshing in a jocular way.
Joy, thou glorious...
A joyously jocular and jovial way.
Their jocularity was one that was made manifest in a palpable...
Jock full of...
Pile of...
Yes.
Poking fun.
There it is.
See?
It smells.
It's leaky.
It's a stenchy smell.
It makes me uncomfortable, too.
Me, too.
I can't...
I don't know if I can keep up with it anymore.
I don't understand.
Why?
How?
All I can think about is that big, fat donut.
Oh.
All right.
That one I'm going to have in a little while.
Yeah, I think so.
But will it be having you in there?
I hope not.
Or if it does, I hope it enjoys me as much as I will enjoy it in my own personal...
I'd like to go in there.
Okay, don't leave yet.
I think it's time to go.
But it is a personal reality into which I will slide right in, much like Dr. Howell's
wants to be.
Eating his food tube filled with donut-like paste.
Just the donut paste.
You have me.
Donuts you got.
In the food tube.
You don't even eat it fried or cooked?
No, don't.
But it is fried.
It's fried and cooked and baked and...
And finished and batterized?
It's everything.
It's all in one thing.
It's all one flavor.
All flavor.
All one true food tube for Dr. Howell.
Wait, what about the rest of us?
Oh, and us too.
And so we bid farewell to the Puzzling Evidence Show and this hour of Slack Show.

It's unprecedented�уй but the ground cause is dying out one of the greatest Italians.
