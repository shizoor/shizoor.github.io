1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,100
And now, the subgenius hour of SWACK!

2
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,780
I, Stang, am in a big, bobbly hurry,

3
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,840
and so tonight's show is a re-re-re-run,

4
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,200
but not of an hour of SLACK,

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,200
not even of a minute of SLACK, nay,

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,460
but rather of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse

7
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,560
from WREK Atlanta.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,540
And not this time won by the good Reverend Susie the Floozy,

9
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,320
but a mental classic.

10
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:05,080
By her co-pod was the Lymph Node Institute.

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,780
You are listening to Bob's Slacktime Funhouse,

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,040
the Lymph Node Institute edition.

13
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,440
I'm Doc.

14
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:28,980
And...

15
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,580
I'm Bugsy.

16
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,460
We're going to discuss the brain this evening

17
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,900
in the interest of the magic dancing giants above us.

18
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,480
It's funny, because your brain will fill in gaps as needed,

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,100
especially when you're receiving everything through your earholes.

20
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,500
So if you hear any extra noises, it's just the...

21
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,720
it's the dancing giants.

22
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,440
The subliminal dancing giant.

23
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,540
We're not really, as far as you know,

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,540
hammering anything into your brain.

25
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,540
It's for your benefit, Atlanta and places beyond.

26
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,420
Your brain squishes.

27
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,500
little monkey man. Let's go.

28
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,380
Let's go.

29
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,660
Let's go.

30
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,580
Let's go.

31
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,880
Let's go.

32
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,400
Let's go.

33
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,600
Let's go.

34
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,160
Let's go.

35
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,580
Let's go.

36
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,140
Let's go.

37
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,500
Let's go.

38
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:35,500


39
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:35,500


40
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,700
Good evening, outpatients.

41
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,460
I know it has been some time since I've donned the blood-spattered lab coat of healing,

42
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:47,740
and it is possible that some of you listening have suffered mightily at the withdrawal of your coded programming.

43
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,160
Some of those not listening may be, in fact, deceased.

44
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,740
But let me make my position clear.

45
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,720
We don't need you anymore.

46
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,920
We're so deep in our endgame model that we don't have the time or resources to even look around,

47
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,980
much less worry about you.

48
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:11,360
We've got all the human pincushions we need since our rapture-has-passed recruiting drive.

49
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,740
I tell ya.

50
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,620
Global anxiety equals multiple international revenue streams.

51
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,380
But on to business.

52
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,580
One of the last remaining uneaten helper monkeys reminded me

53
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,400
of some damn thing.

54
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,440
I am funding technicality community outreach bullsh-

55
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,940
So, here we are, at or around the point.

56
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,580
Now, more than ever, your mind is a battleground.

57
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,980
The invading armies of normalcy have already dug in on the beachhead of your desire for acceptance,

58
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:51,140
which is, not coincidentally, perilously close to your slack reserves.

59
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
No, please.

60
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,180
I hear your protests.

61
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,580
I understand the reflex to automatically attest your rugged individualism.

62
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,340
But this is not a cigarette ad.

63
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,820
You damn well better take a passing interest in the opinions of others.

64
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:14,180
I should not have to remind you that our kind has a poor track record when it comes to frenzied pink mobs.

65
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:23,140
So, you desire that they accept you, at least to the point of keeping your guts off their pitchforks.

66
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,440
You know, all I have ever asked of you is one simple thing.

67
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:36,700
Make the simple decision that it is the world that is insane, not you.

68
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:52,740
Just acknowledge that somehow a system of techno-feudalism in which blind slaves squirm at the feet of sad, sadistic, repressed yetis clamoring for crumbs and passing up rumors on their farts

69
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,620
has somehow failed.

70
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,200
No problem, right?

71
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,340
Plain as the scabs on my nose, you say.

72
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:09,080
But, tomorrow, or the next day, you'll be back at the table, playing their comfortingly stupid shell game.

73
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,960
The world hovers on the edge of rebirth and I'll bet you still have a damn job,

74
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:21,860
still standing at the answer table in the back of their seedy opium den of lies.

75
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,160
Oh, don't get me wrong.

76
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,700
I'm not here to run the moneylenders out of the temple.

77
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:37,200
Just think of me as the guy in the next cell who won't stop whispering dangerous bull-dish through the cinderblocks.

78
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,320
But it's not because I'm trying to get you in trouble, although that would be funny.

79
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:47,200
I just don't want you to forget the present that history has bought for you.

80
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,220
See you in the Gulag.

81
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,320
Good night.

82
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,580
And now, the parts of the train, performed by...the train!

83
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,680
Yes.

84
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,660
Neocortex frontal lobe.

85
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,280
Brainstorm! Brainstorm!

86
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,500
Hippocampus neural node.

87
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,680
Right hemisphere.

88
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,060
Ponson cortex visual.

89
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,240
Brainstorm! Brainstorm!

90
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,340
Sylvian fissure pineal.

91
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,640
Left hemisphere.

92
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,920
Cerebellum left.

93
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,920
Cerebellum right.

94
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,540
Synapse hypothalamus.

95
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,860
Striatum dendrite.

96
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,800
Neocortex frontal lobe.

97
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:41,800


98
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,400
Axon fibers matter gray.

99
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,140
Brainstorm! Brainstorm!

100
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,200
Central tegmental pathway.

101
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,260
Temporal lobe.

102
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,460
White core matter.

103
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,220
Four brain cells.

104
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,260
Plexus! Plexus!

105
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,260
Central fissure chord spinal.

106
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,780
Parietal.

107
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,760
Piameter.

108
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,840
Meningeal vein.

109
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,460
Medulla longata and lobe limbic.

110
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,220
Microelectrodes.

111
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,300
Hormones.

112
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,020
The brain!

113
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,060
One is moral, one is not.

114
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,440
It's super ego and idbot.

115
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,680
Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to be a robot personification of the human id?

116
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,820
I never should have given you a penis.

117
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,660
That's what she said.

118
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,620
Oh idbot.

119
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,920
Well come on, let's sit down at this all you can eat buffet.

120
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,200
Oh boy, I want all of it. Now.

121
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,160
Now now idbot.

122
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,740
No, out of my way.

123
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,660
Only eat what you need.

124
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,240
Cuff you, you big queer.

125
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,760
Gluttony is a sin idbot.

126
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,680
And you're a pansy, get out of my way.

127
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,980
All things in moderation.

128
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,640
I gots to have it.

129
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,660
No you don't, you're a robot.

130
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,440
As a personification of the human id, I must have all of it.

131
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,420
I gots to have it, I gots to have it.

132
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,980
Gimme gimme, get out of my way.

133
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,720
You're incorrigible idbot.

134
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,440
That's it, I'm waiting in the car.

135
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,500
Get out of my way, other patrons.

136
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,120
Nom nom nom.

137
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,900
Nom nom nom nom.

138
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,300
Nom nom nom.

139
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,840
Nom nom nom.

140
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,940
One is moral, one is not.

141
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,300
It's super ego and idbot.

142
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,280
Did you read Brave New World by Aldous Huxley?

143
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,000
Laugh riot.

144
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,920
It's pretty funny for a book that's not supposed to be funny.

145
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,320
I mean, he was not a swift.

146
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,620
No, but orgy porgy until I started seeing a lot of rap videos.

147
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,920
Really struck me as comical.

148
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,820
Well they got the JC character in there and that wasn't so funny.

149
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,620
And the savage.

150
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,620
It's the same with 1984, there's always a heretic, a Satan figure.

151
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,060
Or Jesus, depending on which side you're looking at him from.

152
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,280
But me mum smoked when she was having me and I got okay with brackish amniocytic fluid.

153
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,600
But it wasn't quite poo poo.

154
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,560
No, in Brave New World they just deprived some of the oxygen of the fetus.

155
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:51,700
Yeah.

156
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,820
And it's amazing how that really stunts development.

157
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:54,920
Funny that.

158
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,920
Let's say things go Brave New World and they start doing all the alterations of fetuses to make sure they end up in certain positions in society.

159
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,480
Yes.

160
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,760
Because you know the society, the needs of the society are paramount to the society.

161
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,400
It really messes up the whole mother nature curve if you start dumbing down some and smartening up others.

162
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,900
I'm not the world's most intelligent guy.

163
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,460
Sometimes I just sit and wonder why.

164
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,700
It takes a lot of money and a telephone.

165
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,900
Rock me baby, rock me baby all night long.

166
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,620
On the mark I swear to get this thing done.

167
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:53,700
Rock me baby!

168
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,240
Someone save me!

169
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,400
Rock me baby!

170
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:55,700
Rock me baby!

171
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,600
Someone save me!

172
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:02,800
Rock me baby!

173
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,440
Tell me something that I'm still good at.

174
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:03,440


175
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:03,440


176
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:03,440


177
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,600
Thank you earths 아주 use you.

178
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:05,900
Oh thank you.

179
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:05,900


180
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,360
Rock me babe.

181
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,360


182
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,620
It's so free and easy.

183
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:06,640
Yeah.

184
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,300
Fuck you little prick.

185
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,180
Rock me babe.

186
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,840
I forgot to tell her anything about the타慵 периnylЦیx tsé Northern evaluated

187
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:16,840


188
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,020
En inches sounds like you don't belong there, no mine?

189
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,420
What are you haking for?

190
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,680
I'm not the world's most incredible man

191
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,880
But I just can't seem to understand

192
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,940
If it weren't for all the people I'd be all alone

193
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,800
Rock me baby, rock me baby all night long

194
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,800
Bring us and we will not fade

195
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,120
Kill us and we will return

196
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,040
Drink us and we will not shun

197
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,360
Shock us and we will die

198
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,620
They were doing what I was doing

199
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,360
When lightning hit the street

200
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,140
A bar of soap, a pint of scope

201
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,000
Was all they'd had to eat

202
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,960
Look at there, some macaroni

203
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,460
Had happened to his hair

204
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,300
He had a shirt, but it was hurt

205
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,120
And sadness filled the air

206
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,780
Rock me baby, rock me baby all night long

207
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,360
Now I'm not the world's most incredible man

208
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,780
I never can quite seem to understand

209
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,860
If it weren't for all the people I'd be all alone

210
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,280
Rock me baby, rock me baby all night long

211
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,720
It takes a lot of money

212
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,760
I let you down

213
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,240
Teach em how to talk

214
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,400
Come on pretty baby

215
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,420
Rock, rock, rock

216
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,460
Yeah

217
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,720
One is moral, one is not

218
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,040
It's super ego and it bot

219
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,680
Ah, now for some fine adult entertainment

220
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,140
Remember, no touching

221
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,900
Cuff that noise, I gots to have it

222
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,820
It bot, I can't take you anywhere

223
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,060
You're embarrassing me in front of the ladies

224
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,860
Cuff you pansy, give me a dollar

225
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,260
Well, all I've got are these sack of joeas

226
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,400
Look at the ladies, I gots to have it

227
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,240
It bot, no!

228
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,200
Ladies, I have attachments

229
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,140
I have special attachments

230
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,360
Please, you have to respect these people

231
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,580
They're just working a job like anyone else

232
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,520
Cuff you, give me a ten spot

233
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,160
I wish I had a lap

234
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,200
Oh, I need to have a lap dance

235
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,340
It bot, retract that tentacle

236
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,340
Bouncer, you better step off

237
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,020
Excuse my friend, sir

238
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,100
He's a little bit of a robot

239
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,740
I'll drink all the liquor and have all the fun

240
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:06,740


241
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,660
I'll have all the booty in this sh-hole

242
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,600
It bot, moderate, you're embarrassing me

243
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,780
People are looking at us, the Japanese businessmen

244
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,080
Moderation is for pussies

245
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,820
Seriously, it bot, I can't take you anywhere

246
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,160
Ah ha ha ha ha, nom nom nom

247
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,960
It bot, that's murder

248
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,600
One is moral, one is not

249
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,020
It's super ego and it bot

250
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,500
Oh, you heard the disclaimer, you know the deal

251
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,000
If you, if you take any of this seriously

252
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,620
Then you have a real problem

253
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,540
Well, you sure are talking serious, doc

254
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,340
About all his cognition processes

255
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,280
Well, hell, I don't know

256
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,160
The brain is funny, too

257
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,240
Actually, the appreciation of humor

258
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,560
Probably is just as important as having the gullies of depression

259
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,480
So all you people who are leveled out, mostly

260
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,740
From the pills you take

261
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,280
You're missing most of the ride

262
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,700
Your rollercoaster's pretty straight

263
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,340
Hunter S. Thompson said that the first sign of insanity

264
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,020
Is the loss of the sense of humor

265
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,860
But what about people who never had one?

266
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,960
Born crazy

267
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,060
The bland, Blanco

268
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:08,940
The bland

269
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,040
The bland

270
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,240
Deaf, dumb, and bland

271
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,240
Hey now, momma, let's go downtown

272
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,660
Flyin' high and gettin' down

273
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,720
Gonzo, hyper, sirenade

274
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,740
Jump in the air and levitate

275
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,300
You are blurred, I hold on tight

276
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,400
Old damn town for rockin' life

277
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,760
Rockin' life, rockin' life

278
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,000
Old damn town for rockin' life

279
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,900
Blast your booty, bust a move

280
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,180
Marsh your mind and ride the groove

281
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,320
Do your part to make a wish

282
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,580
Let's all do the boogal fit

283
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,800
You are blurred

284
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,880
You are blurred, I hold on tight

285
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,120
Old damn town for rockin' life

286
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,360
Rockin' life, rockin' life

287
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,560
Old damn town for rockin' life

288
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Rockin' life, rockin' life

289
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:05,840
One thing except that

290
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


291
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


292
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


293
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


294
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


295
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


296
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


297
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


298
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


299
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


300
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


301
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


302
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


303
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


304
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


305
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


306
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:05,840


307
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,020
overlap

308
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,220
Rollin'

309
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,620
Inside, outside, outside, in

310
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,660
Right brain, left brain, let us spin

311
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,960
Cyber-Zoo and Shimmy-Jimmy

312
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,300
Party on down with Dr. Timmy

313
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,440
You want love, hold on tight

314
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,440
Hold on tight, we're rockin' tonight

315
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,800
Rockin' tonight, rockin' tonight

316
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,900
Hold on tight, we're rockin' tonight

317
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:49,660
Rockin' tonight, rockin' tonight

318
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,600
Music is a strange function of the human mind.

319
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,900
It's not necessarily a function of the mind.

320
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,400
The mind does determine patterns,

321
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,240
but when the music's presented, those are predetermined patterns.

322
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,260
You may interpret them differently,

323
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,960
but it's not like you're making music out of randomness.

324
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,320
You're being presented with patterns already.

325
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,140
But if you go back, I mean way back, to the advent of music,

326
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,740
one can only assume that it was organic sounds.

327
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,220
A couple of stone cavemen sitting somewhere listening to bugs.

328
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,940
Probably hitting rocks and skulls and sticks.

329
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,500
Yeah.

330
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:35,840
On the sand.

331
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,920
Sixth day of God time, the mastodon went away.

332
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,140
From far beyond the galaxies, I've journeyed to this place

333
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,360
to study the behavior patterns of the human race.

334
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,000
And I find them highly illogical.

335
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,260
Girl meets boy.

336
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,820
They fall in love.

337
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,640
She says he's everything she's dreamed of.

338
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,720
But when they get married, before he's aware,

339
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,400
she changes his habits, the way he combs his hair.

340
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,460
She changes him to someone he's never been,

341
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,960
and then complains he's not like other men.

342
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,700
Now really, I find this most illogical.

343
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,080
Take the case of your automobiles.

344
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,720
Greatest invention.

345
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,700
Since man discovered wheels.

346
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,980
High dramatic overdrive.

347
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,920
Floor on the floor.

348
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,620
Push button windows.

349
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,300
Push button doors.

350
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,840
Double barrel carburetors rush you any place.

351
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,960
But you never can find a parking space.

352
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,600
Highly illogical.

353
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,660
Take the case of modern man.

354
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,920
He works all his life.

355
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,420
Gives it all he can.

356
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,280
Saves all his money.

357
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,520
Works overtime.

358
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,700
Picks up a new car.

359
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,660
Inches every penny.

360
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,180
Banks every dime.

361
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,880
All he can think about is money.

362
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,800
But you know that he can't take it with him where he's going to go.

363
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,600
Now I find that fascinatingly illogical.

364
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,060
Now is the time to journey home.

365
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,880
To tell of what I've learned.

366
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,780
My people, I believe, have every right to be concerned.

367
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,360
For in spite of computers and advanced psychology,

368
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,620
behavior patterns are still a mystery.

369
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,420
I predict the future of this earthly human race

370
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,520
is that having made a mess of Earth,

371
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,720
they'll move to outer space.

372
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,840
Well, there goes the neighborhood.

373
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,380
Totally.

374
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,700
Completely.

375
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,100
Absolutely.

376
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,160
Irrevocably.

377
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,340
Highly illogical.

378
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,740
One is moral, one is not.

379
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,160
It's superego and it bought.

380
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,580
Ah, it bought.

381
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,300
It's been such a long time since I couldn't take you anywhere.

382
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,560
Remember when we first used to go to the candy shack

383
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,080
when we were young boys?

384
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,360
Shut your wet human mouth.

385
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,740
You're making me hungry.

386
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,180
I want sweets and I need them.

387
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,820
Yesterday.

388
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,720
That's exactly what you used to say.

389
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,400
Searching that great bay.

390
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,620
Hey, can I help youse?

391
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,220
Yes, I'd like a modicum of moderately priced chocolate.

392
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,240
Give me everything in the counter.

393
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,780
Open up the counter.

394
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,780
Move out of the way, old fellow.

395
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,560
I will have you from behind.

396
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,420
It bought.

397
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,280
No, you're embarrassing me in front of the old man.

398
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,340
I don't even know who you are.

399
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
Don't touch me.

400
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,900
What the hell is he doing?

401
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,140
Never mind my friend, sir.

402
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,200
He's a little excitable for the sugar.

403
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,720
But don't worry, he's a robot.

404
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,880
Put candy in my orifice now.

405
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,000
Put it in.

406
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,660
Nom, nom, nom, nom.

407
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,160
It bought wants more candy.

408
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:00,680
It bought.

409
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,820
No, that's his head.

410
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,720
Ah, yes, those were the days.

411
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,960
One is moral, one is not.

412
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,360
It's super ego and it bought.

413
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,200
We'll have to wait until the terrorists kidnap Ronald Reagan to do that.

414
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:15,860
What terrorists?

415
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:16,840
The terrorists.

416
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:17,560
What?

417
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,760
The terrorists that...

418
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,400
Don't you remember any of this, man?

419
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,700
No.

420
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,400
The terrorists that escaped from Guantanamo Bay, invaded the country, just like that

421
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,880
Chuck Norris movie, and then freaking kidnapped Ronald...

422
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,660
That hadn't happened yet.

423
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,080
It hasn't.

424
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,060
Well, he's Alzheimer's boy, so we can't very well ask him.

425
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,480
He's so retold.

426
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,280
Oh, I believe it.

427
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,540
He was Alzheimer's boy when he was in office.

428
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,220
No, I have read the script as it is going to be executed.

429
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:42,820
Right.

430
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,300
The terrorists will escape from Guantanamo and they will kidnap Ronald Reagan and I think

431
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,220
they do something terrible to the state of Texas.

432
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,440
I think Negative Land pulled off the whole time trials better.

433
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,560
Hell yes.

434
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,200
Let's play a little Negative Land.

435
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,720
They've done everything better than we have.

436
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,200
Fine.

437
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,020
Okay, fine.

438
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,340
Let's play some Negative Land.

439
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,280
Yes, let's.

440
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,440
You're the Pepsi generation.

441
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,000
Open it!

442
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,720
Open it!

443
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,220
Pepsi, Pepsi today!

444
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,900
Pepsi, Pepsi today!

445
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,240
With a slurp, I can say Pepsi!

446
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,440
I don't know what else to say.

447
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,460
But I need a Pepsi, need a Pepsi, need a Pepsi today!

448
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,540
I need a Pepsi!

449
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,340
I need a Pepsi!

450
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,120
I need a Pepsi!

451
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,540
Right away!

452
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,680
Open it, I tell you!

453
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,040
I need a Pepsi!

454
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,580
Show my brand loyalty to feel good about me!

455
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,920
I don't know what else to say, but I need Pepsi!

456
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,860
Heads up, you need a Pepsi!

457
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,960
Heads up, you need a Pepsi today!

458
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:13,700
Heads up!

459
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,760
Heads up!

460
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,420
So I can play basketball!

461
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,520
I don't need Coca-Cola at all!

462
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,120
Show my brand loyalty to feel good about me!

463
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,480
I don't know what else to say!

464
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,000
Open it!

465
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,040
Pepsi, Pepsi, Pepsi, Pepsi today!

466
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,900
Pepsi, Pepsi today!

467
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,300
Pepsi, Pepsi, Pepsi today!

468
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,280
It's pretty good.

469
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:36,940
Easy!

470
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,320
Easy!

471
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,340
Easy!

472
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,720
I need Pepsi sometimes and I don't know why!

473
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,740
There's a voice inside my head that makes me go out and buy!

474
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,460
I need Pepsi!

475
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:55,280
I buy a Pepsi, buy a Pepsi, buy a Pepsi after drinking some beer!

476
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,260
Buy a Pepsi, buy a Pepsi, buy a Pepsi after eating a Pepsi!

477
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:16,860
Try me, I need Pepsi right away!

478
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,140
Pepsi now, I need a Pepsi, Pepsi now!

479
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,760
They might as well come right out with it!

480
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,400
All flavors have that Peppy potatoes and I don't know why!

481
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,160
Except Sarsaparilla.

482
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,180
There's a host inside my head that makes me go out and buy a allen that my mosque will

483
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,080
give me when I threatening to B boats, because I want to get it to the there and then get

484
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,080


485
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,240
Bushes on your trzeba!

486
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,340
There's a voice inside my head.

487
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,580
Now please don't misunderstand.

488
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,860
I need a Pepsi.

489
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,080
Our sarsaparilla is absolutely dependable.

490
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,320
I need a Pepsi today.

491
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,240
It's trustworthy.

492
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,220
It's loyal.

493
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:43,940
Right away.

494
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,320
And many fine, upstanding citizens love it.

495
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:46,720
Pepsi.

496
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,760
A really good mix.

497
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,720
I need a Pepsi.

498
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,500
But it just isn't what we call happy.

499
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,200
Pepsi.

500
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,600
Pepsi.

501
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,180
A really good mix.

502
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:55,640
Pepsi.

503
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,040
Pepsi.

504
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,380
Pepsi.

505
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:57,760


506
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,340
Pepsi today.

507
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,680
You take our orange.

508
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,960
It's absolutely rollicky.

509
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:00,960


510
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,360
Fountain Pepsi.

511
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,340
Our lemon is almost giggling.

512
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,560
Maybe a 12 ounce Pepsi.

513
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,720
Our black cherry and black raspberry are so bubbling with happiness, they dance in the

514
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:09,920
glass.

515
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,500
Maybe a 16 ounce Pepsi.

516
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,680
We're sorry about sarsaparilla.

517
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,340
Pepsi.

518
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:14,900
Pepsi.

519
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,440
We're really happy.

520
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,860
Why isn't it happy?

521
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,000
Pet opener.

522
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,280
See?

523
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,380
There are illusions inside my head.

524
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,340
Pet opener.

525
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:22,760
See?

526
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,460
There are illusions inside my head.

527
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,900
Pet opener, I tell you.

528
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,120
See?

529
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,280
Well, let me ask you.

530
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,120
I don't like Coke or RC.

531
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,600
I only like Pepsi.

532
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,300
Or Mountain Dew is better.

533
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,140
With the cool, smooth Mountain Dew.

534
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,160
Pepsi, which makes Mountain Dew.

535
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,860
Pepsi, which makes Mountain Dew.

536
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,240
Yeah.

537
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,740
I love negative playing.

538
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,200
That was great.

539
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:50,660
It was.

540
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,920
Everything they do.

541
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,760
You know what they call it when they're starting a marketing campaign and the first wave is

542
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,700
just to get you to be aware that the product is out there?

543
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,440
Foreplay?

544
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,320
Basically.

545
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,840
It's called establishing a mindset.

546
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,440
Mindshare.

547
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,860
Isn't that a Queensryche album?

548
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,720
Operation Mindshare?

549
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,640
Operation Mindslime.

550
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,120
Operation Daddy Did Me.

551
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,000
Showload.

552
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,340
It's like Showboat, but loady.

553
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,620
Well, Jack, it's great to see you again.

554
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,120
Hey, thanks.

555
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,800
You folks, have you been making remarkable progress?

556
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,420
Yeah.

557
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,860
I hope the antidepressants have helped.

558
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,480
Yeah.

559
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,300
Yeah?

560
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,300
You look good.

561
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:22,880
Thanks.

562
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,640
You look real good.

563
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,460
Well, thanks.

564
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,600
I think we should start today's session with a little word association.

565
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:27,940
You know.

566
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:28,980
Actually, you do.

567
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,460
You've been remanded to my care by the courts.

568
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:31,780
Whatever.

569
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,580
So, just clear your mind.

570
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,860
Shouldn't be that hard to do.

571
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,320
I'd say the first thing that comes to mind.

572
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,460
Chocolate.

573
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,720
Let us begin.

574
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,140
Razor wire.

575
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,080
No, see, I will say the word you will respond to, and that's the association by which I'll

576
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,520
make judgments on how normal you are.

577
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:47,920
Fava bean.

578
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,280
No.

579
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,000
Razor wire.

580
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,580
Are you ready?

581
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:52,960
Wealthy.

582
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:54,920
Poor.

583
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,320
Octogenarian.

584
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,320
Octopus.

585
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,340
Pheromones.

586
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,780
Pheromones.

587
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:02,800
Pheromones.

588
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,180
My friend's got some ferrets.

589
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:04,580
They're funny.

590
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,920
Family values.

591
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,700
Family.

592
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,580
Funny ferrets.

593
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,660
Subwoofer.

594
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,440
Subwoofer.

595
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:13,380
Pass.

596
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,780
Authority figures.

597
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,120
Mom.

598
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,480
Dad.

599
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,520
Teachers.

600
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,160
Cops.

601
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,080
Ass.

602
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,800
Cryptophane.

603
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,700
Samba resume.

604
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:43,760
That is…

605
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:43,760


606
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:43,760


607
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,500
And I also!

608
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:45,500


609
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,980
And I also feel sorry.

610
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,660
You won't get away this simple.

611
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:52,660


612
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,980
Now, don't you know how much money you can earn if you do that?

613
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:56,480
I do.

614
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,560
I share the money with John, and I tiene millones in my pocket.

615
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:58,560


616
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:05,700
And the plastic's all melted and so is the chrome

617
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,800
Who are the brain police?

618
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:34,200
What will you do when the label comes up?

619
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:43,280
And the plastic's all melted and the chrome is too soft

620
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:06,260
And the plastic's all melted and the chrome is too soft

621
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,520
And the plastic's all melted and the chrome is too soft

622
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,240
Who are the brain police?

623
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,300
What will you do if the people you knew

624
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:57,480
What will you do if the people you knew

625
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,400
Who are the brain police?

626
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,540
Who are the plastic that melted and the chromium too?

627
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,460
Who are the brain police?

628
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,540
Who are the brain police?

629
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:16,860
Who are the plastic that melted and the chromium too?

630
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:16,860


631
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:16,860


632
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,660
What will you do if the people you knew

633
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:27,360
Who are the brain police?

634
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,960
Hormones squeeze in through your various sense organs.

635
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,660
They run through something called the hypothalamus, which is a little squirting gland in your brain.

636
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,520
The hypothalamus is kind of in charge of deciding what is important and what is not.

637
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,780
So it's like Charlie for your brain.

638
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,000
Yes, basically it is your brain's secretary.

639
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:50,900
It operates basically under four prerogatives, which is fight, flight, feed, and puff.

640
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:56,840
And if something you see is important to one of those four poles, I guess,

641
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,900
then the hypothalamus kind of gives a little extra squirt,

642
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,000
which is why you might drive off the road looking at some chickies behind

643
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,600
because your hypothalamus is chanting, well, you know.

644
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,680
Get you some. Get you some.

645
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,680
Get it, get it, get it.

646
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:16,060
And then when you look back to the road and you're about three feet from the bumper of the car in front of you,

647
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,200
that's when your hypothalamus once again kicks in with your fight or flight.

648
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,040
And there's really nothing you can do.

649
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,280
At the three seconds from the truck collision, then you get the whole flash before your eyes,

650
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,720
read the whole of your existence, which has to do with, I guess, the memory.

651
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,900
All your face for me, you love me so

652
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,460
Hold my head, hold my head

653
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,580
You want all I can, but my head, all my head

654
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,800
Is permanent damage

655
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,420
Hey!

656
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,620
Hey!

657
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,180
Hey!

658
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,860
Hey!

659
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:12,640


660
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:12,640


661
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:12,640


662
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:12,640


663
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:12,680
Hey!

664
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:12,680


665
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:12,680


666
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:12,680


667
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,540
Hey!

668
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,600
Hey!

669
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,060
You got this for me, sweet and fair

670
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:28,600
You got this for me, shit to impale

671
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,360
My head on my head, you are all I got

672
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,540
All my head on my head, my mind's going down

673
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:45,460
Head, head, head, head, head

674
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,080
Did you breathe?

675
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,120
Did you breathe?

676
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,020
You got this for me, sweet and fair

677
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,680
You got this for me, shit to impale

678
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,720
My head on my head, your words are like arrows

679
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,520
My head on my head, my mind's going down

680
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,540
You got this for me, it hits me hard

681
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,520
Head, you got this for me, you love me so

682
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,780
All my head on my head, you are all I got

683
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,040
All my head on my head, my mind's going down

684
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:35,040
Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken

685
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,120
Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken

686
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,300
chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken

687
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:38,300


688
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:38,300


689
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:45,440
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, hey, hey. If you strike me it'll roll in целк

690
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:45,440


691
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:08,440
We're all the same

692
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,860
We're all the same

693
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,380
20 eyes in my head

694
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,740
20 eyes in my head

695
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,960
They're all the same

They're all the same

When you're feeling 20 things at a time

698
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,600
You just can't slow things down

00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:40,820


743
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:40,820


744
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:40,820


745
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:40,820


746
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:40,820


747
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:40,820


748
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:40,820


749
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,720
in my head

750
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,860
they're all the same

751
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,000
funny eyes

752
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,240
in my head

753
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,400
they're all

754
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,620
the same

755
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,660
we were going to talk about memory

756
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,440
well that's because your life flashed before your eyes

757
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,700
it seemed like an appropriate segue

758
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,180
yes

759
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,440
and memory is very important

760
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,480
because basically the memories of who you are

761
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,160
and what you've done

762
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,060
sort of make who you are

763
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,880
in the present

764
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,860
let's say you're reading a book that's like 5th in a series

765
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,720
I think you would enjoy the subtleties

766
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,700
of the main character you're supposed to relate to

767
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,280
much more if you'd already been with that character

768
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,340
on several other adventures

769
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,360
with different input

770
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,340
and if you're the character in your own story

771
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,720
which you really should be

772
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,260
then you're going to have a much more

773
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,860
rich existence one thinks

774
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,160
if you can relate everything that's currently happening

775
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,520
to what's happened in your past

776
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,660
but don't live in the past

777
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,320
because that's a Jethro Stoll song

778
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,680
that stangs job to play

779
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,040
Jethro Stoll

780
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,880
we don't do that

781
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,200
yeah so memory is important

782
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,280
when you lack memory

783
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,220
you start to lose your definition of who you are

784
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:45,580
I think

785
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,800
you look at these Alzheimer people

786
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,660
look at them

787
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,800
I don't want to

788
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,680
I know not a pretty sight

789
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,340
could happen to you

790
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,700
don't drink your cola out of cans kids

791
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,480
they say that

792
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,480
I guess you can't use deodorant either

793
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,200
with all that alum

794
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,300
that's what they say

795
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,060
that's what's said

796
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,240
you can't be what you were

797
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,040
so you're messed up being

798
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,460
just what you are

799
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,660
you can't be what you were

800
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,940
the time and now

801
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,380
is running out

802
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,620
is running out

803
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,200
is running running running out

804
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,400
you can't be what you were

805
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,540
so you better start living the life

806
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,640
that you're talking about

807
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,660
you can't be what you were

808
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,200
the normal man

809
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,620
the normal man

810
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,780
the normal man

811
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,240
and the new batman

812
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,080
is Patatge of Batman

813
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,840
the normal man

814
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,200
the normal man

815
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,500
the normal man

816
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,920
and the new batman

817
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,660
is Patatge of Batman

818
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,460
the normal man

819
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,860
the normal man

820
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:33,160
the normal man

821
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,220
is Patatge of Batman

822
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,040
the normal man

823
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,020
the normal man

824
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,820
The number man

825
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,020
Never ever

826
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,680
Take a bad

827
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,860
Mind

828
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,640
You're always talking, talking, talking, talking, talking this now

829
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,840
But you will talk yourself down

830
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,020
You're going down

831
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,100
One is moral, one is not

832
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:36,820
It's surreal

833
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,500
Super ego and idbot

834
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,520
Well idbot, here we are at yet another Woodstock

835
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,720
I smell cannabis

836
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,720
They are illegal and we wouldn't want to do anything wrong or get in trouble

837
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,700
Get out of my way, patrooli makes me crazy

838
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,740
I do what he says folks

839
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:57,360
I'm caught in the mud, help, I've got to get some of that sex, drugs and rock and roll

840
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,560
Well, maybe two out of three

841
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,720
If it's too loud then you are too old

842
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,120
Well it's not too loud, I've got my ear plugs in

843
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,160
You are such a pansy panty waste

844
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:06,820
You want me to do it?

845
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,660
I'm going to damage my hearing, that would make you happy

846
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,780
Why don't you hold that girl down while I set fire to this tower

847
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,620
No, we need that tower

848
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,240
For observation and filming

849
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,560
I like to watch, I like to watch

850
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,960
Give it to idbot

851
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,960
Idbot, no!

852
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,020
Let me at it, I gots to have it

853
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:27,220
Alright, you just retract those tentacles mister, we've got to get out of here, you've gotten us in trouble again

854
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,560
Woodstock, woo, party till you puke

855
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,640
That piece of paper I put in my mouth is making me feel awful funny

856
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,440
I love that J-Tab, I love that

857
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:40,760
Woah

858
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,760
One is moral, one is not, it's super ego and idbot

859
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:53,520
What's the difference between the mind and the brain? The brain is the organ and the mind is the part we like to think that we are

860
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,680
Is the mind the soul?

861
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,480
Probably, our consciousness and personality sure as hell don't live in the brain

862
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,940
If you want to test that, just give someone's brain a good whack and watch their personality change

863
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,620
You know, you wipe out one part of the brain and some other part of the brain

864
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,020
starts kicking in

865
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:11,980
I think the mind is like a modem, the brain itself is like the piece of equipment that we used to call a modem

866
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,880
A modulator demodulator

867
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,520
That's correct

868
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,140
It connects with the outside world

869
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:23,460
And not only does it connect with the outside world, but the whole part that makes it, I think, the seat of the soul is its connection to things that the rest of your senses can't really get at

870
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,620
And so you have to intuit

871
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:28,000
So what else does the mind really make you decide you need?

872
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:28,560
Clothes

873
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:35,400
Clothes, hey, actually, and again, if the mind is the seat of the soul, then all those big corporations trying to get you and get that mind share that we talked about

874
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,000
Are actually after your soul

875
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,200
Trying to redefine who you think you are so you give them money

876
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:46,080
It's amazing how people just sort of intuitively understand that companies are after their brains

877
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,760
Right

878
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,860
And that they don't seem to mind, but when you mention the soul, they pucker up

879
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,240
That's why we've got the invisible monster

880
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,840
He's the great Connie in the sky

881
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:57,300
One is moral, one is not, it's super ego and it bought

882
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,320
Well, it bought

883
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,920
Now that we're in Hawaii, I hope you don't choose to embarrass me here, too

884
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,840
Come on, get out of my way

885
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,380
I need to get out of here

886
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:05,540
I'm going to get laid

887
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,380
That wasn't funny at the airport either

888
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:12,120
Now, are you going to sit down and enjoy the luau or not?

889
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,440
You know very well that I can't sit

890
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,820
Are you making fun of me?

891
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,000
Don't put a chip on your shoulder there

892
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,960
Get it, chip robot

893
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,360
I think you are making fun of me

894
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,140
Of course I'm not, I'm just happy

895
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,880
I want the pig

896
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,600
The pig is for everyone, idbot

897
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,500
I will not share, the pig will be mine

898
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,680
I'm cutting you off, I'm sick of this, I can't take you anywhere

899
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,900
Move these damn foreigners out of my way

900
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,720
Move, move, move, move

901
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,760
Now idbot, this is a foreign country, we are all foreigners here

902
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,040
Now, now, now, now

903
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,920
That's it, this is the last time

904
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,260
You, me, edge of the volcano, now

905
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,720
Alright, super ego, have it your way

906
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,280
Just carry me safely to the left of the volcano

907
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:53,880
Meanwhile, at the top of the volcano

908
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,700
You have had this coming for years

909
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,680
Mom always liked you better, I'm sick of this

910
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,100
I'm a robot personification of your id

911
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,160
You made me vomit all over my prom date

912
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,340
You turned me into a cybernetic organism.

913
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,180
You made me gain 50 pounds when I broke my leg and started smoking pot!

914
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:10,660
Ahh!

915
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,240
Ah, you never lubricate me properly.

916
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,360
I built you!

917
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,300
You have a point.

918
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:15,980
I do.

919
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,240
Let's not fight.

920
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:17,920
No.

921
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,400
Ah, I tricked you!

922
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:19,760
Oh!

923
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:21,880
AHHHHHHHHH!

924
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,720
One is moral, one is not.

925
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,300
It's Super Ego and it's BOT!

926
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,420
Tonight the city is full of morgues

927
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,720
And all the toilets are overflowing

928
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,280
There's shopping malls coming out of the walls

929
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,800
As we walk out among the manure

930
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,780
And after a while

931
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,120
That's why

932
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,040
I pay no mind

933
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:09,000
I pay no mind

934
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,440
I pay no mind

935
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:23,840
Give the finger to the rock and roll singer

936
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,780
As you walk out among the morgues

937
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,620
He's dancing upon your paycheck

938
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,080
The sails climb high through the garbage pale sky

939
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,060
Like a giant dildo crushing the sun

940
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,960
That's why

941
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,780
I pay no mind

942
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,300
Sleep in slime

943
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:55,200
I just got signed

944
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:04,740
So get out your lead pipe pipe drains

945
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,080
Get out your ten foot flags

946
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:15,020
The insects are huge and the poison's all been used

947
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:19,300
And the drugs won't kill your day job honey

948
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:19,900
Honey

949
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,420
That's why

950
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,380
I pay no mind

951
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,400
I pay no mind

952
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,500
I pay no mind

953
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:57,720
I pay no mind

954
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,020
That's why

955
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,320
I

956
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:07,980
pay no

957
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,660

958
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,100
I

959
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:12,540
pay no

960
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:13,360

961
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,720
I

962
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:17,160
pay no

963
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,760
mind

964
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,040
I

965
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:21,840

971
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,880
pay no

972
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,480

1011

00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:30,140


1044
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,380
Let's open up the good house.

1045
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:46,920
Let me know if it's true.

1046
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,040

Open it up.

1050
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:47,740
Open it up.

00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,180
Open it all up.

1052
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,380
Open it up.

1053
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:54,820
Open it all up.

1054
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,340
Open it all up.

1055
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,140
Hey, hey, hey, you know everything

1056
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:20,220
Now there is to do

1057
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,940
Now here's my gun, oh

1058
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:24,420
Take it home, we've got a phone

1059
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,100
I'm gonna send someone over

1060
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,020
Who's gonna give you what you need

1061
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,820
You're a war man, death is easy

1062
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,680
You gotta make me a city man

1063
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,660
I don't know who you are, but you knew

1064
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,740
Why do you want to steal?

1065
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,760
So what is to do?

1066
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,880
We've got so much to do

1067
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,940
So take my number

1068
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,480
So you have to reach it

1069
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,620
My heart

1070
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,400
My heart

1071
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,900

Our world ain't just mine

1075
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,680
It's a time of week

1076
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,020
And a sister will cry

1077
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,460
The fear is gone

1078
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:11,520
Our world ain't just mine

1079
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,240
We're gonna walk

1080
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,480

1081
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,960
Love and time

1082
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,240
Our world ain't just mine

1083
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,760
You can probably see

1084
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,900
The back of the eye

1085
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,400
We're gonna walk

1086
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,580
If you don't care

1087
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:29,240
I've got a vision in my mind

1088
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,080
You gotta make yourself a little alive

1089
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,020
Let it sink to your mind

1090
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:38,000
I've got a vision in my mind

1091
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,240
It's a job for you

1092
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,140
The system you've got

1093
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,580
The thing

1094
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:52,360
You've got a finger sign

1095
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,380
You've got a finger sign

1096
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,380
You've got a fuerte

1097
00:57:59,380 --> 00:57:59,880
Get rid of all your fear

1098
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,040
Then make good use of it

1099
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:00,040


1100
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:04,020
La, la, la, la...

1101
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:04,940
Waiting, waiting on your...

1102
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,080
What are the fears in a life

1103
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,920
You gotta stop

1104
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,920
Don't get lost

1105
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,480
And you can have ausge

1106
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,420
And break free

1107
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:12,740
Screams

1108
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,300
