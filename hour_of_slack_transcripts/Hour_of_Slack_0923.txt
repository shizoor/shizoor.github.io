Ah, you see, you see, my ears didn't work, uh, because this fuse had blown and these wires had broken and so forth, but I was able to reach into my little tool kit here and find not only the tools and the special attachments that I needed to get my hearing going again, but also...
Ah, he's reading from a damn script.
The news!
No, it was...
I read the news. I went to the trouble of actually looking at the news before I came in to do the show, and they have discovered the largest known prime number.
Yes, the largest known prime number has been discovered over a godzillion.
Uh, it's so large that it took two hundred and eleven... two hundred and eleven thousand computers working together on the internet.
This one kid in Wisconsin or someplace was the... happened to be the one.
The one kid on the computer that got the answer that took so long to calculate since the last prime number.
A number 6.3 million digits long that would take, uh, fifteen hundred pages to write out.
That's a big number.
That is a big, big number.
That's a primal... that's the largest primal number, and it is the number of inches.
Of the primal member, of the primal epoped J.R. Bob Dobbs in length.
That is the size of his love for you, dear listener.
Uh, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is singing in the background this love song.
So sweet.
To the listener.
I'm singing it.
Oh, that's not Dave.
That's a record.
I'm sorry.
It sounded... it sounded... uh, look.
Poor Dave's ears are broken now.
Why, maybe it's something contagious.
Maybe it's something that just listening to this show...
A virus of pinkness.
A virus of pinkness.
Friends, we just came back weeks ago, actually, from numerous devivals.
The, uh, Detroit...
The D-Vival, or the D-Trovivital, I like to call it, uh, was a fantastic success with
Mann, uh, the Christ Punchers, uh, the Amino Acids, and, uh, and the Jollies.
It was most jolly, and we had the Beachland Ballroom Show, uh, with, uh, Einstein's Secret
Orchestra and Lonesome Cowboy Dave, with backup babe singers, uh, Princess Wee and Reverend
Cinzia, and, uh, also numerous...
numerous...
new ranters, uh, and some... in some cases, not exactly so new.
Uh, the young Reverend Pisces delivered a great rant about Connie, and, uh, the dynamic
Reverend Carter LeBlanc did, uh, a wonderful 15-minute stretch, and, uh, we'll be hearing
lots of live D-Vival show, uh, tonight, and, uh, plus little bits and pieces of, uh, Norrell
Preff, uh, and now...
Mann.
Mann.
Mann.
Mann.
Mann.
Mann.
Mann.
Um...
What the fuck am I...
supposed to be if I'm not supposed to do what I do
fuck am I supposed to say if I'm not supposed to say what I say
What the fuck am I supposed to fuck if I'm not supposed to fuck what I fuck?
And the only booze on Sunday is the blood of Christ
Goddamn the Christians
Goddamn the Christians
Goddamn the Christians
Goddamn the Christians
Goddamn the Christians
Goddamn the Christians
Goddamn the Christians
God damn the Christians
God damn the Christians
and fuck the fucker up
if you care to do so.
Thank y'all.
I need to speak to you about a few things
tonight.
I know the evening is winding down.
Those of you who care are drunk.
Those of you who don't are probably drunk too.
But, uh,
I have, uh,
I have just a few
points I want to touch on because right now
we are dwelling in
what, uh, what I, what seems
to me to be the hour of
strong delusions. It's a time
of delirium.
Time of
denial. It's a time of
blindness and self-deception. It's a time
where a lie is
being told to all of the
people all of the time.
And it starts when you're young.
You know? You try
to do things the way you're told.
You try to follow the rules, maybe.
Just to, just to figure out what the
hell is going on. You know, just to,
just to, just to try to
make sense of what all the grown-ups are telling
you. But the more you try to comprehend
what those grown-ups are telling
you, the more you start to see
the contradictions, the more frustrating
it gets. Because you start to
realize that all of these people
are lying. And they're not just lying
to you. They're lying to themselves
all the time.
And, and
and it, it, it starts to make you,
you know, angry. You know? You start to get
frustrated. You, you start to realize
the cards are stacked against you.
You feel violent urges.
You want to smash things.
You know? You want to maybe be a punk
rocker. Or you want to be an anarchist.
Or a thug. Or a gangbanger.
Or maybe you want to be a hooligan.
Or maybe you want to be a hacker.
Or a terrorist. Or whatever.
But, but, but you know that the
people that make you feel this way,
these people are outside of your reach.
And the things that they do, they're not just
things that they care about. Maybe those are the things
you can touch. So you try and throw a brick
through a bank window. Or maybe you try
to kick the shit out of a yuppie.
Or maybe you try to throw some pipe bombs
and some mailboxes out in the midwest.
But that's no good either.
Because they've been waiting for that.
They've been telling each other
for years that you're just the sort
of person that's bound to
do that sort of thing eventually.
That's why they keep files
on you is because they
want to see it coming before you do.
And they know how to handle violence.
They understand violence.
They have ways
of dealing with violence.
Because your violence
can only be retail.
And them, they've got the corner
on the wholesale market.
So maybe you try to play the game.
You go the other direction. You get a decent
job. You get married. You open a
bank account. You approve your credit rating.
You vote. You buy a house.
You go back to college. You
maybe even
work somewhere peaceful
like a community college
library.
Maybe you even get to
start your own business.
Or maybe you get to get paid to do
something you like like playing music
or write creatively. Or maybe
you get involved with a cause that you believe in
like environmentalism or drug
legalization or the peace movement.
But eventually one of two
things is going to happen to you.
You're either going to stop
feeling or you're
not going to stop feeling.
And you know when you stop feeling
well you got to do something.
You know something that will provoke a
reaction. You know maybe
you try psychedelic drugs.
Maybe you try pornography. Maybe you try
new age religions. Maybe you try
paganism, comic books, art,
philosophy, food,
casual sex, whatever.
Or maybe you're from
the other school. Maybe you're
from the other school. Maybe you
still feel too much.
Maybe you need to numb yourself
so you try drugs, pornography,
new age religions, paganism,
comic books, art,
philosophy, food, casual
sex, whatever. What is
it that you want all along?
You want one thing.
You want slack.
Where's your slack at tonight?
Because mine,
mine's right here.
And
you may not have slack right now
but you better know that you need
slack tonight.
The subgenius,
we all know the subgenius
must have
slack.
But it's the eternal
paradox because you can't get slack
just by slacking off.
Any goddamn
pink boy with a semi-functional
brain stem can sit on the couch
like a lump of dog shit.
If you're gonna
make the effort to pull the wool
over your own eyes
for the sake of
all those little subgenius
children that are trying to
figure out why adults lie
all the time,
be honest with yourself about it.
I'm gonna say that again. I mumble sometimes.
I want to make this clear. If you're
gonna lie to yourself, at
least be honest with yourself about
it. Because if you're
okay with where you're at,
with who you are, with what you're doing,
at least take the time to
tell yourself the things you
tell yourself to make yourself believe. At least
have the balls to say
give me false slack
or kill me.
Come on, say it!
Give me false slack or kill me!
Who's gonna say that?
Come on. You know, people are like,
oh, Reverend Carter, you gotta
admit, false slack
is better than no slack.
You're all bullshit!
False slack
is no slack
at all!
Slack!
Slack is like the square root of negative
one, and false slack
is zero! No
amount of false slack added
to or multiplied by
any other amount of false
slack can ever
equal anything but
nothing! Nothing at all!
You will never get enough
false slack, and that's what
we're after, right?
We're after
too much.
And you can't get enough false slack,
much less too much.
A friend of mine used
to say, nothing exceeds
like excess.
Well, you know, it's hard to know
when you've got enough, but
you can usually tell when you've got too
much. There's enough
ambiguity in the world
today, and
too much is
not an ambiguous concept.
We all know what too much is,
and I bet you a lot of people here
would, just to be safe, like
just a little bit more,
just to be sure, because
I mean,
slack
too much,
that's not when the vending machine
gives you an extra bag of
M&M's. That might be more than
you deserve, but
that's not
too much.
Too much is when the
things that life gives you
are so real,
they're so overwhelming,
so rich,
so full, so
amazing, and rewarding,
and funny as shit,
and maybe it knocks you down, or maybe it wakes
you up, maybe it blows your fucking mind,
but maybe,
maybe you even get to experience something
so intense,
and so startling,
that it suddenly makes you
see through all that
other bullshit, and get
one good look
at the face of your true desire,
and that is a pretty
clear sign that you're not
dealing with false slack
anymore.
And that's what I'm here to talk
about. What is your true desire?
What
do you want to the exclusion
of all else?
If you're tired
of getting by
with your weekly pat
on the back, your nine
lives, tuna casserole,
you're gonna need a bigger piece
of wool
to pull over your own eyes.
Once you decide
that you want that big old
juicy chunk of raw,
unadulterated slack,
once you know you want it,
well they're gonna have to kill you to
stop you, right?
Just give me slack,
or kill me!
And nobody here is gonna
get killed over some piece of crap
they bought at a mall, right?
We're all smarter than that, we're subgeniuses,
but we're not stupid.
It's like
collecting coins,
or antiques, or comic
books, or old ceramic
insulators from the
power lines.
These things are only worth
what you're willing to pay for them.
And you're selling yourself
short, if the
things that matter to you
are things that you can pay for.
Bob Dobbs,
Bob Dobbs makes a million dollars
every time he fucks up.
I fuck up every day.
Where's my million dollars?
Hell, if I could get one dollar,
one dollar for every time I
fucked up, I'd have something, wouldn't I?
Come on!
You can do that?
Stupid people make
money all the time.
It's not that hard.
What's your excuse?
Reverend, Reverend,
Reverend Carter LeBlanc, dear
friends, and now
man.
Are you late again?
Get back to work.
I want that on my desk right now.
Have you been drinking?
Give me those figures.
Read the memo.
Get back to your cubicles.
This will affect your performance review.
And you think you
deserve a raise?
You're fired!
You're fired!
We wanted someone
who's intelligent, highly motivated,
creative,
yet flaccid and gullible.
I share my profits,
pay your rent,
feed your kids,
put the fat on your ass and the gas in your car.
And you think you
deserve a raise?
You're fired!
And you think you deserve
a raise?
You're fired!
Fired!
And he feels so fine in his
brand new red suit.
He's ready to take his sleigh out for a ride now.
He's ready to join the new Iraqi
army. But he's going to be interrogating
those elves and dropping them off at high
altitudes if they don't give him the correct
coordinates.
He's that kind of guy.
They don't give him cream corn either.
He's Lambo.
Baby, where'd you get those coordinates?
I'll never tell.
I think it looks like 15 south
to west. Wow.
That's a number.
My compass is going wild!
Look at mine's pointing all the
way due north.
The magnetic poles have shifted.
Your compass is in control, young man.
We can't. The poles have changed.
Yes.
What was once right is wrong.
And what was once
good is now evil
and vice versa.
What was once frozen is now laid to waste.
What was once helium is now
toothpaste.
Once that was... Oh, never mind.
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute. Can you get some helium?
Oh yeah. I've
got the scores on helium.
That stuff that you rub on your teeth?
No, you don't necessarily have to rub it on your teeth.
You just open up the bottom of the balloon
and you just run your nostril
and you very gently puff on it.
And...
And then what happens?
I'm at a loss for words now.
I know that something inside your head
explodes and has to be replaced
there.
That doesn't really sound like fun.
It's not fun.
It's part of a learning experience we all
have to go through, starting with you.
Don't they give you some kind of medication for that?
Isn't the medication actually pretty fun?
Well, it's much worse, though, than the
actual helium nostrils.
Like, for days and days afterwards,
you can't defecate, you can't fornicate,
and you can't spatulate. You can't...
Oh, give me a break, Dave. You can't do any of those things
with the time anyway.
Yeah, but see, any words that end with 8 can't be done.
You can't confiscate,
you can't masturbate, you can't
do any of those words that end
with the letter 8. Or it's a number, I think.
Oh, there's not much
left to be confused about anymore.
Well, Dave, you should
count your blessings that you're not afflicted by
with that right this minute.
I'm counting my hairs, and I'm also counting
concepts that I'm throwing out the window for New Year's.
A concept, a
sentence! That is the goal!
Oh, damn, I just blew it.
Hey, look at your lips. They're all frozen.
Somebody...
What?
Now, when we talk about the exes, the men from Planet X,
we're not talking about them little UFO
piddly shits, you know.
We're not talking about these little guys
who crash saucers and rods
and stuff like that.
The masters will come back and
save us!
What the hell is wrong?
Now, see, the devil,
the devil gets into the equipment.
This is nothing but a simple...
Wait a minute.
Now, it could sit down, friends,
before we jump to conclusions, remember,
I am a subgenius.
Fuck Bill Gates!
Oh, really?
Now, what did Bill Gates ever do to
you to deserve such a wonderful
activity as fucking you?
He gave you a bar of
slack!
Actually, you know, you know the weird thing is
I sometimes wonder about Bill Gates.
I sometimes go, what if
that guy was somebody who sent me a
buck in 1981
and
I didn't, like,
address it right
and it didn't get to him. And he was
a subgenius. He could have been saved.
But, that one little
chance thing didn't happen.
Maybe I dropped the ball. Maybe the postman dropped the ball.
Maybe he never even sent in
that dollar. Maybe he ripped us
off and stole it. Maybe that's
where his fortune began. We just don't
know. You can't know
who is a pink and who is a subgenius.
Only Bob knows
that! So don't you go spiting
your fellow bipeds
thinking that somehow they... I actually heard
a person say to me
it's
he said
and he was a good liberal
he said, well, you know the thing about conservatives
is they're just not
quite as human as we
are. And I thought to
myself, well, my God,
I guess the end justifies the means.
I guess it's alright
if, I guess
one side of the conspiracy
is better than the other
side of the conspiracy. Jesus!
Well, I don't want to get into that, friends.
Fuck them if they
can't take a joke, friends.
The thing is, though,
I mean, those
exes, those men from Planet X,
to them,
the difference between
George Bush
and Al Gore is
they just don't see that they're
just all a bunch of monkeys to them. In fact,
it's like roaches. It's like looking
at a bunch of roaches. When the
exes get here, they're gonna look
around and go, well, hell, we thought there was
somebody going to be here, but there's nobody here
but bugs, just insects.
Shit! Oh, well,
I guess us space men,
us exes, we'll just take this water,
these icebergs, we'll just skim these oceans
off this useless ball of
rock, maybe suck off
some of the magma, the mineral
rich magma, oh yes,
and the gold, and the diamonds,
yes, and the rubies, and the emeralds,
and Princess Wee, and
Bob, the Bob, if they have
one, and then they'll
notice that one little pipe-smoking
roach down there,
oh, it's you, Bob. We thought
you were just one of those useless
fighting roaches down there.
Not Bob!
What? What's that you say, Bob?
You want us to leave the oceans?
And the magma?
What? Bob, you
want us to leave the diamonds too?
Well, what the hell are you
gonna give us in return, Mr. J.R.
Bob-Dot?
Your souls! Oh!
Souls!
You're gonna give us
some souls!
Well, okay then, souls!
It's a deal, because
souls are the
one commodity of true value
to the exes and
to us subgeniuses. Why? Because souls
are made of time, and time
is the only thing worth a shit!
Time, sales, and
souls! The whole idea
is to milk as much slack as you
can get from the limited, pathetic
time that you have. And
friends, it could be really pathetic
if you've decided to kill yourself.
And that might be a good idea,
but I suggest you
wait until
X day!
That is the one message of this stinking,
ridiculous, little pathetic
church. If nothing else
sinks in, don't kill yourself
until X day. Sure,
it's miserable, life is fucked, you're in
chronic pain, go ahead and plan to
kill yourself, but
what's the hurry? Bob's
gonna do it anyway for you.
Let him do it! Why
hurry the process along? Well, cause
you're miserable, yeah right, but
just wait until X day.
X day is what? July 5th.
Surely this year, we ain't gonna
let the Mormons or Jehovah's
Witnesses out kook us.
Huh!
Absolutely not.
While they're waiting,
we might as be working the
Rubenburger!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

You will fight for something holy, whatever that might be.
Well, I can't agree with Reverend Stang that the world is a monster club.
I can't agree with Reverend Stang that the world is a monster club.
I know I'm medicated, but I know things are gonna be all right.
I called 911, had some cereal, and I cried.
This world is a monster club, and it must be well.
There's plenty of crazy things, terror, love, or scare.
There's plenty of crazy things, terror, love, or scare.
Baby, I thought I saw a mummy crawling on my tummy and inside.
You're crazy.
It might be in my head, but baby, I don't want to wind up dead.
Baby.
I swear I saw the werewolf drinking from my toilet last night.
Crazy.
I know I saw it, baby.
Hold my head, I'm gonna be all right.
This world is a monster club, and it must be well.
There's plenty of crazy things, terror, love, or scare.
Baby.
I thought I saw a werewolf staring through my window last night.
Crazy.
I thought I saw a vampire.
I know I saw a werewolf staring through my window last night.
I drank it from my toilet last night.
Baby.
I know I'm medicated, I'll come back one morning and feel all right.
Crazy.
I know I might seem crazy.
I'm not.
This world's a monster club.
Thank you for watching this video.
Best kids and men in high school.
I'm out.
Bye.




















I'll see you next time.
Bye.
Bye.

Bye.
Bye.

You crazy.
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
And now...
What is this, March?
It is March, yes.
Is this coming up on the Ides?
This would be the Ides.
Wow.
Wow, indeed.
Well, just past the Ides.
Hey, it's the Ides of March.
It is.
Yo.
How could that have relevance to war?
Well, let's see.
They stabbed Caesar in the back.
That was the Senate.
They did?
After banning partial birth abortions.
Right.
Then Colin Powell coerced the Senate to...
Spank him on public TV.
And then Rome fell because of all the sodomy that ensued.
And there was war when that happened.
Rome fell, Rumsfeld.
That's right, Rumsfeld.
And then there was the Dark Ages,
where basically...
It was just sodomy all the time.
So tonight we're going to be discussing sodomy.
And all it...
Oh, no.
Tonight we're talking about war.
What's it good for?
Sodomy in the trenches.
So anyway,
the Ides of March and these topsy-turvy times
compel me to ramble about something
I've been reluctant to mention
for fear of...
Well...
A jinx.
I speak, of course, of the Curse of Tecumseh.
You see, President Harrison, elected in 1840,
like many of our early presidents,
was a big Indian killer,
which, long story short,
led to a curse being placed upon him by Tecumseh.
President Harrison was the first president to die in office,
contracting pneumonia secondary to the Indian Curse.
A fluke took a step towards becoming a trend
with Abraham Lincoln,
who was elected in 1860
and then re-elected in 1864.
But not for long.
A Catholic cabal struck him down on April 14th of 1865.
In 1880,
it officially became a trend
when General James Garfield won the presidency
by a scant 10,000 votes.
He proceeded to piss off...
big business and the New York political machine.
And, less than four months into his term,
on July 2nd, 1881,
he was shot by an angry lawyer,
Charles Giteau.
He died on September 19th,
after months of tasty torture at the hands of quacks,
which may have been some sort of Masonic ritual.
It basically just gets spooky in 1900,
when President William McKinley is re-elected to his second term,
and he was standing in a receiving line
at the Buffalo Pan-American Exposition,
when an anarchist with an unpronounceable name
that, on first inspection,
looks like some kind of joke,
Leon...
Sholgaz, possibly,
C-Z-O-L-G-O-S-Z,
shot him twice in the chest.
You know,
for anarchy.
President McKinley had the decency to linger,
for a mere eight days,
and died on September 14th, 1901.
Again, medical incompetence played its role,
giving him a touch of the gangrene before he died.
Mr. Sholgaz's trial started a week later,
and lasted a day.
He was executed less than two months after the act.
Like a good hashishin,
he signed a confession,
and was unapologetic.
By now, you may be noticing,
that all the presidents elected in a zero year,
eventually,
died in office.
And this trend continued in 1920,
with Warren Harding,
who was perhaps the worst president ever.
The Federal Vampire and Zombie Agency
indicates that he was bitten by a vampire
planted by Al Capone.
Officially,
the return to normalcy candidate,
embattled by multiple scandals,
fled to Alaska,
and died of food poisoning on August 2nd, 1923.
His wife died the next year,
on November 21st,
1924.
FDR, like Lincoln,
survived his zero year presidency,
but finally stroked out on April 12th, 1945,
in his fourth term as president.
In 1960, JFK was elected,
and we all know who killed him on November 21st, 1963.
Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980,
and after just a few months in office,
was shot by a son of George Bush's friend.
He died.
He died and was replaced by a CIA robot on March 30th, 1981.
Which brings us to the much contested 2000 election.
Wasn't that exciting?
Who knew what was at stake?
A virtual free pass?
Of course, the superstitious will insist that the Reagan bot broke the curse.
But, time will tell.
Time will tell.

Но вот,
In the end,
of Brutus and the rest? For Brutus is an honorable man, so are they all, all honorable men. Come I to
speak at Caesar's funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, but Brutus says he was
ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome. Did this in
Caesar seem ambitious? When but the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept. Ambition should be made
of sterner stuff, yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. What cause withholds
you then to mourn for him? O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, and men have lost their
reason. Bear with me, my heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, and I must pause till it come
back to me. But yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world. Now lies he here,
and none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir your hearts and minds
to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, who, you all know, are honorable
men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose to be a man of honor, and not of the world.
I choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you.
In a world gone mad.
Now how many people must get killed for oil families' pockets to get filled?
How many oil families get killed? Not a damn one, so what's the deal?
Ah, that's better.
Well, you look different now, though.
It's like having a vice.
Now it looks like your head has actually been slightly protruded in a vice, just enough
to give you a painful headache.
Are those headphones? I thought that was a sea clam.
I thought those were growing out of the side of your neck.
It's a sea clam.
The things we don't see when we don't open our eyes to the world.
It's my new girlfriend, the sea clam.
Sea clam what?
I had one a couple years ago, but it just sort of started smelling really bad after
a while.
It stopped coming out of its little clamshell.
Oh.
Well, you probably had it out of the water too much.
That's why you need to stick with the land stuff.
Well, he didn't have high-maintenance girlfriends.
Really?
You have to wash them three or four times a day.
You've got to keep a tub of salt water.
Prairie squids.
They don't lick themselves.
Well, they don't lick.
They don't have to.
Well, they don't have to.
They clean themselves.
They use that beak.
Yeah, and you don't have to sweet-talk them or anything.
You just have to tickle them a bit and de-beak them.
Yeah, well, of course, you have to de-beak them after they do the dirty work, but beforehand.
No, no.
Yeah, you go ahead and do it afterwards.
Have you ever had one clamped onto your neck going for your jugular vein?
Just trying to suck the top of the tumors out of your skull?
No.
You've never had that?
Prairie squid?
No.
You have never had a prairie squid go for your neck?
Oh, man, you are missing all the sport and fun.
I thought you were...
I knew you were a secret follower of Christ.
I could tell.
You are always talking that...
You know, Jesus, you are a secret follower of the...
We just do it different in Texas.
The pale Nazarene, aren't you?
You really are.
You don't know what real fun is, man.
That's like Satanoplus, baby.
How do you know?
How can you stand in judgment?
You don't know what real fun is.
I'm not judging.
I'm just saying once...
You don't know what a Lucifer high is until you've had one of those things.
Take that little beak and stick it right in there in the tender meat part and start ripping
your flesh apart.
Dave, you make me feel so normal.
I don't make you feel...
No.
I make you feel like you are missing things.
And you are.
You should expand your horizons or at least, you know, try and open your left eye once
in a while.
I know it's very painful, you know, and the pus and everything, but...
Mm-hmm.
It just...
Yeah, I feel like...
I love having conversations with you because in the end, I feel like I'm not the only one.
In the end, I walk away feeling like the sanest man who ever lived.
See, that's more...
It's just all relative.
Cardboard delusion, they call that right there.
Maybe.
Oh, I talked to old so-and-so and now I feel better because he's way whacked out.
Stang, you're more whacked out than all of us.
Yeah, how elitist.
How elitist?
I mean, you know, it's not a joke or anything.
That sounds elitist to me, man.
Yeah, yeah.
You want...
Bourgeois.
Right, right.
You want one person to be in charge of being the weird person that is...
How bourgeois.
Yeah, how bourgeois, man.
I'm actually here to warn you.
I'm here to warn you of what is coming.
Some of us here know what is coming.
That's nothing compared to what is coming.
You think that was fucked up.
Wait till the fucking you're gonna get from Connie.
Connie has come to some of us, Connie-ites.
And what you have to understand is that the Connie that you boys have been learning about
is not the true Connie.
Connie's the kind of chick who may have been the band whore, okay?
Connie is the woman who will come up to you even though you haven't got laid since, say, 1991.
Connie will fuck.
Connie will fuck you.
Connie likes fucking losers like your asses.
Connie likes fucking your bobby, wimpy, non-slack-havin' bastard motherfuckers.
Connie likes doing this because Connie gets power from this.
And that's what you bobbies just don't understand.
Because every time you look at that Connie-ite walking across the field at X-Day or at one of these Devivals
and you're sitting there looking at it and going,
Man, she's got a nice ass.
Man, she has got a nice set of tits.
And you go home after the Devival or after X-Day and you're sitting there in your bed all alone
and I know you're doing it.
You're sitting there and you haven't gotten laid in a couple of months, maybe six months,
maybe a couple of years.
And you sit there and think about that blonde brunette.
And you sit there and think about that redhead and that beautiful Connie-ite you saw.
And you pull out your penis and start pulling the pud.
You know what?
While you're jacking off, thinking about that Connie-ite, you're giving Connie even more power.
Because every time you sit there and gawk at a Connie-ite or jack off about a Connie-ite
or maybe.
If you are the truly luckiest son of a bitch and you actually get to fuck a Connie-ite,
you are giving Connie more power.
And as you give Connie more and more power, it sort of tilts the balance.
So I want to say to you, go ahead, look at my ass.
Go ahead and admire this nice set of natural non-silicone tits that I possess.
Go ahead and look at all the Connie-ites.
Go ahead and stare.
Because every single time you look at a Connie-ite,
you look at a Connie-ite.
Bob loses a little.
He's a little bit more slack.
And Connie gains more and more power.
So boys, keep it up.
Keep bringing your friends to the church and tell them about the free sex that we always brag about.
Just keep getting your little hard-ons following around Connie-ites at X-Day.
Hang around the pool and watch for the Connie-ites to get naked.
Go ahead.
Keep it up.
Because what you don't understand is and what staying over here doesn't understand
and what all the rest of you boys.
don't seem to quite comprehend is that the balance of power is changing, fellas.
And those Wiccans thought that the goddess power was something.
Just wait until Connie gets a hold of the reins.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Can you do that?
I'm going to blow your fucking head off.
You have the authority.
Tell me what you're going to do with it.
Let's go.
There's some kind of super secret police from hell or something.
Holy bloody pretense.
There may be a history of a mental disorder.
There may be a history of a mental disorder.

They programmed them here.
That's invasion of privacy, girly.
Yes, sir.
They programmed them here.
That's invasion of privacy, girly.
Yes, sir.

That's invasion of privacy, girly.
Yes, sir.

You know what I think?
I think you're all paranoid.
Are we in any danger?
