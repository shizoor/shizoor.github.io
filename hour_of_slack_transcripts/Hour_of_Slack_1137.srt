1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,520
I've never had the love of a woman.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,880
They think I'm pretty ugly.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,300
Ugly?

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,780
I feel ugly right now.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,300
Say it again.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,580
I'm pretty ugly.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,620
Okay, whatever you say.

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:20,660
Ready?

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,900
Praise Bob!

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,940
Praise Bob!

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,220
Praise Bob!

12
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,400
Praise Bob!

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,760
Praise Bob!

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,480
Praise Bob!

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,660
I just don't know how to...

16
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,120
I don't...

17
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,340
And I feel like I've lost it.

18
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,680
Because I feel like by doing this, I've lost my relationship with...

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,400
The subgenius.

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,740
Our own subgenius.

21
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,040
But I just don't know what to do.

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:50,920
Mm-hmm.

23
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,420
We are As Nation.

24
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,180
Destroy or disable our people.

25
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,380
We...

26
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,380
We can be attacked in spite of our excellent defenses.

27
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,980
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack with bombs or with logical weapons.

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,560
There's a new poison.

29
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,100
One ounce can kill all the people in the United States.

30
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,560
Logical warfare?

31
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,640
What do they expect me to do about it?

32
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,420
It's not my headache.

33
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,240
You are wrong.

34
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,120
You are wrong.

35
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,240
You had better find out the facts about logical warfare.

36
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,320
It can be aimed at you and your home.

37
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,260
Or...

38
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,840
Or at work.

39
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,940
Germs.

40
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,700
Sins.

41
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,800
And...

42
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,600
Germs.

43
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,220
Killer.

44
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,480
We can destroy...

45
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,100
Can destroy...

46
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,680
Experts.

47
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:36,960
Experts.

48
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,940
Experts.

49
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,300
Experts.

50
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,060
Biological warfare attack may have taken place.

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,940
Probably some of the people in your neighborhood would become sick.

52
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,040
Cooperate.

53
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,680
Cooperate.

54
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,920
If we are attacked with logical warfare, health and medical authorities will tell you what to do.

55
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,180
Above all, don't listen to scare talk, rumors, or myths.

56
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,180
Rumors or myths.

57
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,160
Rumors or myths.

58
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,080
Rumors or myths.

59
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,180
Rumors or myths.

60
00:01:59,260 --> 00:01:59,560
Rumors or myths.

61
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,860
Look to robots for protection.

62
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,140
What if the public knew?

63
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,260
Just imagine the mass recalls.

64
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,700
All because of an irrational paranoia.

65
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,660
And prejudice.

66
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,460
Hey, let's just be clear.

67
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,020
There is no conspiracy.

68
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,480
It's a good thing, too.

69
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,740
The show is just starting now.

70
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,200
Yes, uh...

71
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,800
Q-tip sweat.

72
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,420
You might have thought...

73
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,940
Is that right?

74
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,680
...we had been in full flight, but we faked it as we do most things.

75
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,200
The show is just starting?

76
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,840
That means we have to do this for another two hours?

77
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,500
Overmodulating.

78
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,100
Oh, we're overmodulating.

79
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,240
Tell me about it.

80
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,880
Modulate your adulation, Bobbies.

81
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,940
You gotta turn the radio station down, Pozzolino.

82
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,100
The entire station.

83
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,940
Turn the whole station down.

84
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,260
It'll be sad if you turn it down.

85
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,400
You said we're overmodulating.

86
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,260
I accept the station.

87
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,380
I love the station.

88
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,600
I just say no to turning down the station.

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,880
You can't take it anymore.

90
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,260
I heard every word you said.

91
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,920
They're still there.

92
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,940
I saw behind the curtain.

93
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,260
Really?

94
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,640
I saw between the headphones.

95
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,480
Well, that's just a prop.

96
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,940
The demon headphones?

97
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,520
Yeah.

98
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,220
Smells sulfurous in there.

99
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,260
I heard what goes on, too.

100
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,500
It's like the show.

101
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,000
The statue of Anubis, lord of the dead.

102
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,420
Anubis?

103
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,860
And it's the sign that says, do not disturb.

104
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,460
Yeah, and it's not a video game.

105
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,060
The show is 25 years old now, so it can drink and vote.

106
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,360
Yeah, it can do all of its high taxes.

107
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,780
And it drives around with its mullet flying in the wind.

108
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,120
Yeah.

109
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,140
25 years, $1.04.

110
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,300
Hey, don't make fun of mullets!

111
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,600
It has a mullet.

112
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,540
It drives a Camaro.

113
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,100
Yeah.

114
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,220
Sergeant O'Malley.

115
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,180
With real rock radio.

116
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,460
Sergeant O'Malley.

117
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,440
With the left arm sticking out of the window and a giant joint.

118
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,260
You've got to have real rock radio blaring.

119
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,820
Oh, a giant joint.

120
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,900
That reminds me.

121
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,960
Pedro gave me a provision for futurity.

122
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,940
You got some of that blue brain damage?

123
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,900
I think I do.

124
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,040
Some of that grandpa Fappies diesel?

125
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,640
It leaked out of the occupant of a swollen-headed arrogant theologist.

126
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:50,780
Grandpa Diesel.

127
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,320
Well, here, I'll watch it for you, just to keep it safe.

128
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,640
Well, you can watch it as it combusts.

129
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,120
Just to keep it safe.

130
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:58,540
It is safe.

131
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,220
Well, we can take a break at 9, I think, can't we?

132
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,040
Yeah, how about some disenfranchised anal fissure tissue in that pipe?

133
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,880
That's far too many breaks.

134
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,460
Just one would do.

135
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,160
Right?

136
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,080
Well, here, put your fingers out.

137
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,760
What pipe?

138
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,720
No, I don't want to be punished again.

139
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,180
Are you talking about that religious thing again?

140
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,720
I just had a pity.

141
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,380
Anal fissure tissue.

142
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,340
Put that steel ruler down.

143
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,780
The disenfranchised anal fissure tissue.

144
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,220
We are on a different plane.

145
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,780
Bishop Joey knows about that.

146
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,680
I think we're flying to Anchorage, Alaska.

147
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,240
Oh, man, I've got a trunk full of it.

148
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,200
If you've got a bucket.

149
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,560
Really?

150
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:25,660
Yeah.

151
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,760
If you get a bucket.

152
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,140
You can get that stuff?

153
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,300
I can get it.

154
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,000
I can get it.

155
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,980
I can send it to you, man.

156
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,860
We'll put it in a bucket.

157
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,040
Oh, man.

158
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,000
Or you can take some with you on the plane.

159
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,040
Don't make any promises that you can't keep.

160
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,500
Let's take a bucket.

161
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,600
Well, you have to ingest it.

162
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,420
You've got a bucket.

163
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:37,900
Well, you have to kind of like.

164
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,640
A bucket.

165
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,220
Did you say you'll kick the bucket?

166
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, we'll put the anal fissure tissue in.

167
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,640
Did you mean the buck buck bucket?

168
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,100
Yes, I mean the buck buck bucket.

169
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,180
Put that money in the bucket.

170
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,680
Here.

171
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,060
This is free radio, but we do pass the hat.

172
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,260
Now, take this pipe.

173
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,440
This pipe will make wasps disappear.

174
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,100
It will make

175
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,100


176
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,100
Whoa, that's what I want.

177
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,440
Oh, such ót mil vulnerabilis.

178
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,680
LS ول positivis.

179
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,260
I could.

180
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:14,020
Not my thing, man, my...

181
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:25,240

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
What?

184
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,180
Adopt!

185
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,440
Sweet Yeti of the Serengeti!

186
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,300
She's gone crazy eddy in the heady!

187
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:15,060
He's gone crazy!

188
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,640

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,000
so Mister Roboto

190
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,280
Your name Lunatic?

191
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,720
I know that there's no one else but me

192
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,960
I see the mystery of the world

193
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,640
You're wondering who I am

194
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,020
My seat, I'm mannequin

195
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,920
With thoughts made into pen

196
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,780
I see the mystery of the world

197
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,720
Why does the mind trade me?

198
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,500
I've got a secret

199
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,280
I've been hiding

200
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,040
Under my skin

201
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,940
My heart is human

202
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,660
My blood is boiling

203
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,380
My brain at the end

204
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,500
So if you see me

205
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,900
Laughing strangely

206
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,740
Don't be surprised

207
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,940
I'm just a man who

208
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,360
Needed someone

209
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,140
And somewhere to hide

210
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,680
To keep me alive

211
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,860
Keep me alive

212
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,580
Somewhere to hide

213
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,280
To keep me alive

214
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,960
I'm not a robot

215
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,580
Without emotion

216
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,400
I'm not what you see

217
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,600
I've come to help you

218
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,080
With your problems

219
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,740
So we can be free

220
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,780
I'm not a hero

221
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,460
I'm not a savior

222
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,100
Forget what you know

223
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,380
I'm just a man whose

224
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,820
Circumstances

225
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,420
Were beyond his control

226
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,520
Beyond my control

227
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,500
We all need control

228
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,820
I need control

229
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,940
We all need control

230
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,520
I am divine

231
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,400
I'm a man

232
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,580
Secret, secret

233
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,660
I've got a secret

234
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,940
Who hides

235
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,400
Behind the mask

236
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,300
Secret, secret

237
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,440
I've got a secret

238
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,260
So no one else can see

239
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,220
Secret, secret

240
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,280
I've got a secret

241
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,620
My true identity

242
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,620
Don't worry, I don't miss the world

243
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,760
Don't go

244
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,620
Don't go

245
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,560
Don't go

246
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:44,560


247
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,500
Don't worry, I don't miss the world

248
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,360
Don't worry, I don't miss the world

249
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,600
Thank you very much, Mister Roboto

250
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,880
Doing the job

251
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,960
What he wants to

252
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,040
Thank you very much, Mister Roboto

253
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,260
For helping me escape

254
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,220
Just what I needed to

255
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,620
Thank you, thank you, thank you

256
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:26,880
I wanna thank you, please thank you

257
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,780
The ground is clean

258
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,780
Too much technology

259
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,500
Machines the same

260
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,980
Machines the same

261
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,240
Machines the same

262
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,880
The time has come at last

263
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,140
To throw away the space

264
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,340
So everyone can see

265
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,500
My true identity

266
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,200
I'm a cowboy

267
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,840
Cowboy

268
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,420
Cowboy

269
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,020
Cowboy

270
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,200
Cowboy

271
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,540
Cowboy

272
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:42,600
Cowboy

273
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,400
Cowboy

274
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,940
Cowboy

275
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:45,960
Cowboy

276
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,140
Cowboy

277
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,020
Cowboy

278
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,020


279
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,020


280
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,040
Cool.

281
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,360
Friends, that was, uh,

282
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,260
Mos Giganticus is the name of the band.

283
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,380
Thanks to Reverend Brainerd,

284
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,220
who turned us on

285
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,820
to that.

286
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,420
He actually just gave me their CD

287
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,780
months ago, and I finally listened to it.

288
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,180
And you'll be hearing more from that,

289
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,040
because there's, uh, that was their cover

290
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,780
song, Mr. Roboto.

291
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,160
The rest of it is all original.

292
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,060
And you can learn more of Mos Giganticus

293
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,660
from mosgiganticus.com.

294
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,060
That's spelled M-O-S-E

295
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,720
Giganticus.

296
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,220
And Giganticus does not have a name.

297
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,340
It does have an O in it.

298
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,500
Mosgiganticus.com

299
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,080
or valiantdeath.com

300
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,740
is the distributor.

301
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,260
And, uh, someone called Ruinai

302
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,680
is playing in the background.

303
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,280
And it's cold outside

304
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,580
here in DNA Level C.

305
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,160
Princess Wee is here.

306
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,420
Well, she was here.

307
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,160
She's flipping.

308
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:35,720
She's playing And in serene fynd and

309
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,500
I love her.

310
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:37,980
She was singing about

311
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:37,980


312
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:37,980


313
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:37,980


314
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:37,980


315
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:37,980


316
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,980
R longing

317
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,160
love

318
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,400
I never before

319
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,140
They didn't let it off

320
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,140


321
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,140


322
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:49,120
reruns. And Hour of Slack is the religious radio show dedicated to the word of Bob.

323
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:57,480
We've been getting a lot of orders from our old home state of Texas. Our new home state is Ohio.

324
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,780
But lately there's been a lot of Texas people joining up and also prisoners.

325
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:12,620
And we have some devivals coming up, which I can describe to ye, because I'm not going to be there

326
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:18,160
and I won't make any money out of them. There's sensitive issues about that with public stations.

327
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:26,540
Let's see what is on our list here. On February 1st, if you live around Chesapeake, Virginia,

328
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,800
there's the Exist summoning ritual. But really you'd have to look at alt.slack for information

329
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,500
about that.

330
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:45,540
Email Floyd at gmail. Floyd is spelled P-H-L-O-I-G-H-D at gmail.com.

331
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,240
For those of you with tape recorders, that's February 1st. It's just a camp out.

332
00:13:52,440 --> 00:14:02,360
Then there's the subgenius, the Michigan Stupor Bowl on February 3rd at Ipsy, Michigan.

333
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,660
Ipsilanti.

334
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,960
Ipsilanti, I guess, is, I don't know, at some place called the Elbow Room. That's for the

335
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:16,340
Stupor Bowl. Now, if you're in Los Angeles, there's a great art show at Mary Karnowski

336
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:23,060
Gallery featuring the great St. Byron Werner with a whole bunch, he wants to blow away

337
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:29,320
everybody else who's in this art show. And I believe that he can. I've known Byron's art

338
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,680
biblically, practically.

339
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,480
I believe that it can, too.

340
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,900
I just paused that one. But I'm going to, what happens if I bring up this other one?

341
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,940
There, see, we can do it again.

342
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,140
Soft pause.

343
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:52,020
Yeah, at the Mary Karnowski Gallery, all the way from February 9th through March 8th, art

344
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:57,340
by St. Byron Werner. That'll be the most psychedelic. But also, St. Robert Williams,

345
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,740
my painter hero. Todd Shore, another painter hero. Gary Panter.

346
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,180
I'm dois talk about Mark and Mom.

347
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,420
I just thought he's a great singer.

348
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,100
It's been a long time.

349
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,540
I'm never gonna get too greedy.

350
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:16,540


351
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:16,620
His picture is absolutely appalling.

352
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,080
And I believe that he is famous now for promos and bamboos like the Walmart %.

353
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,440
I don't have to pay balls, I just don't want to be an old shit.

354
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,400
Mark was a great born puppy.

355
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:24,500
Alright.

356
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:33,480
So then we have marine food.

357
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,740
through March 8th. I don't see Dave calling in yet. So I'll tell you also about the 10th

358
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:49,040
anniversary final subgenius devival in Seattle on April 19th, Saturday, April 19th. Actually,

359
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,480
yeah, I think that's right. At the Transcendent Church of Base,

360
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,660
and you'll have to look at subgenius.com for more details.

361
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,720
All your base are belong to us.

362
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:12,200
Or chickenhead.us. Chickenhead does not have an A in it. And this devival features Chickenhead,

363
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:20,860
Dr. Hal Robbins, Pope Sternodox is on the list, Pope S. Lilith von Fraumannsch, who is the hostess,

364
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:27,740
and assassinated Nen Master Nenslow, king of all anarchists, with, oh my God, I didn't realize this,

365
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,640
Hemeroy Rogers will be playing at that.

366
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,240
Wow.

367
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,520
That show. And I think I see Dave calling in.

368
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,200
Oh, but Reverend Stang, I have something to announce too.

369
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,380
Yeah, you keep talking and I'm going to talk to Dave here.

370
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:46,700
I wanted to tell folks about the 25th anniversary Winter Star Symposium that's taking place at

371
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:54,280
Atwood Lake Lodge in Delroy, Ohio, from February 28th, right at the end of the month of February,

372
00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:00,600
February 28th through March 2nd. And there's a theme of healing bodies.

373
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:08,540
Healing spirits. And it's going to be a really fun, long weekend, a wonderful getaway in the middle of the winter.

374
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:15,940
You can read or learn more about that if you're interested in it by going to Rosencomet.com.

375
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:21,400
That's R-O-S-E-N-C-O-M-E-T dot com.

376
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,820
It's going to be a lot of fun. Reverend Stang will be appearing there.

377
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,640
And it's really going to be quite fun.

378
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:36,520
Quite a good getaway. A fun thing to do midwinter, in my opinion.

379
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:44,980
Just expressing my personal opinion here. That's Princess Wiardo, queen of all UFOs, as you well know.

380
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:54,020
So I think Reverend Stang is trying to maneuver a conversation with Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

381
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,940
No, no, it was not the Dave.

382
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,220
Oh, it was not to be.

383
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,200
No.

384
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,640
And I wasn't paying any attention to what you were talking about.

385
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,640
Oh, I just told everyone about the 25th anniversary Winter Star Symposium.

386
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,420
Oh, that's right.

387
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,860
In Delroy, Ohio, at the Atwood Lake Lodge.

388
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,460
Right.

389
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,260
That's at the end of the month of February.

390
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,780
Right, right, right. Okay, we're covered. Bob will not punish us.

391
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,860
Dave is broken.

392
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,980
The Dave is simply broken.

393
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:30,980
No.

394
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:40,580
Yeah, he is. He told me that he was out walking on the ice like an old man, like all of us old guys like to do.

395
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,600
And suddenly he found his legs were horizontal in the air.

396
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:54,160
In fact, his whole body was briefly at a horizontal angle, floating in the air, but then had him falling straight down.

397
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:54,580
Oh.

398
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,560
And when he hit elbow first.

399
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:00,460
Ow.

400
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,140
His side then followed upon the elbow, the lonesome elbow.

401
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,460
Full body tore.

402
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,080
And he thinks he broke his rib.

403
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,620
Ow, ow, ow.

404
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:23,200
And, you know, so we can send our healing vibration waves to Ashtabula, the city of the Daves.

405
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,320
Dave.

406
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,600
That beautiful, beautiful city on the lake, Ashtabula.

407
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,380
Dave.

408
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,640
Dave is too hurt to be on the lake.

409
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,060
Is he on the radio?

410
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,080
No, he should call in.

411
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,500
Oh.

412
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:45,000
But if he doesn't, you know, we have much of what we have been playing already in the way of cut-ups by Norrell Preff,

413
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:51,060
who did the logical weapons business there at the beginning, at norrellpreff.com.

414
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,080
And, of course, the great Fernando Nande-Lee Murr.

415
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,360
And people ask, how do I get my stuff on our slack?

416
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,600
Well, you bribe us.

417
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,780
And you send us the material at the box number that I always give at the end of the broadcast,

418
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,080
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118, and subgenius.com.

419
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,260
Or if it's small enough, you can email it to stang at subgenius.com.

420
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:23,020
In fact, a little ways into here, you'll hear somebody bitterly complaining about how I didn't play their show yet.

421
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:28,880
So let's just go ahead and go back into that world.

422
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,580
Let's go.

423
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:29,580


424
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:29,580


425
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:29,580


426
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:29,580


427
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:29,920
Tape.

428
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,600
You know.

429
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:33,980
That world.

430
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,560
This is Moe's Giganticus.

431
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,700
Giganticus.

432
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,060
Yes.

433
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,600
Uh.

434
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,260
Sorug.

435
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,520
Listen.

436
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,400
Uh.

437
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:04,820
Ass.

438
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,100
Uh.

439
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:05,700
Uh.

440
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,520
Is.

441
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,360
Now.

442
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:10,760


443
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,120
The Soul Genius PhD.

444
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,080
Things are different.

445
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,600
Things are different.

446
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,080
Things are different.

447
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,520
Things are different.

448
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:24,740
Friday.

449
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,660
Things are different.

450
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,240
Things are different.

451
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,680
Things are different.

452
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,420
Mitt Huckabee.

453
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,300
Mike Romney.

454
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:28,860
Hillary McCain.

455
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,380
Clinton.

456
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:29,580
Clinton.

457
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:29,580


458
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,260
McCain and Romney.

459
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,920
John Huckabee.

460
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,260
John.

461
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,880
I obviously want your vote.

462
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,940
I am confident.

463
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,800
Huckabee.

464
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,040
McCain.

465
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:36,600
Huckabee.

466
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:36,960
Huckabee.

467
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,260
Huckabee.

468
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:37,640
Huckabee.

469
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,040
Huckabee.

470
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,200
I'm not sure they care.

471
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,480
Fred.

472
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:39,840
Donnie.

473
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,100
Paul.

474
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,620
Fading.

475
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:40,980
Ron.

476
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,420
Thompson.

477
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:41,720
Fred.

478
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,040
Fading.

479
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,400
There have been a number of interesting stories in the news this year concerning people whose

480
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,040
religious convictions cause problems.

481
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:47,840
Cheeky.

482
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,160
Cheeky.

483
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,440
Cheeky.

484
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:48,720
Cheeky.

485
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,320
Alcoholics.

486
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,620
And I would say it's something very positive.

487
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,260
Businesses.

488
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,420
Money.

489
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,680
Find me behind the bar.

490
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,040
We have to divorce.

491
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:55,880
Abraham.

492
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,680
I mean, Abraham.

493
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,700
Financial dealings.

494
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,620
The source of what my values really are.

495
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,400
Create a cult.

496
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,080
Create a cult.

497
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,360
That is just not relevant.

498
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:07,820
They said.

499
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,440
Then they said.

500
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,120
Then they said.

501
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,840
Then they said.

502
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,440
Give me an illustration.

503
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,120
Proceed.

504
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,380
Proceed.

505
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,640
Read.

506
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,340
On a regular basis, literally every day, I think it was a lot to do with ignorance pulling

507
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,220
the wool over our eyes.

508
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,180
That was sad.

509
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,740
Scientologists don't feel they have to have a dual personality.

510
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,360
In the whole of my career.

511
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,160
For profit.

512
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,640
Too filthy.

513
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,180
Too filthy.

514
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,420
No.

515
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:25,740
I mean.

516
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,120
No.

517
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,500
I mean.

518
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,080
Good move.

519
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,500
Good move.

520
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,580
Head, I think, is irrelevant.

521
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,300
I mean.

522
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:29,480
I mean.

523
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,540
It's irrelevant.

524
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,280
An elephant.

525
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,060
And I think.

526
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,640
Be elephant.

527
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,320
Oh, there.

528
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,040
I once shot another elephant in my pants.

529
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,300
And how I got there, I was quite certain of.

530
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,000
How did you get an elephant in your pants?

531
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,440
An elephant in your pants?

532
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:56,780
The thing I like about the Church of the Subgenius is that if you were to go to an election party

533
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,760
or something like that, you need your hair done.

534
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,040
You could go to a beauty salon and get your whole head done.

535
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,940
Not just your hair, you know.

536
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,580
You could have your scalp reshaped and your skull and so forth.

537
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,760
I mean, you could get certain parts of the brain done separately.

538
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,760
Yes.

539
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,500
From other parts.

540
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,320
So, do they actually remove those parts of your brain or do they add brain matter?

541
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,900
Well, usually they remove stuff because people want to get rid of the ugly memories.

542
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,020
And we have a million ways to do that, as you well.

543
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,300
Well, maybe you don't know.

544
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,120
You probably don't remember.

545
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,720
No, I don't remember all the different...

546
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,400
But those are...

547
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,480
It's easy to get rid of...

548
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:33,500
19, right?

549
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,960
It's hard to implant new memories that didn't happen.

550
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,320
That...

551
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,900
People think that the government's doing that to them all the time, but it's actually a

552
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,740
lot trickier and it's too expensive.

553
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,700
I mean, they don't do that to just everyday citizens.

554
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,840
So do they plant old memories?

555
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,280
Seemingly old, you know what I mean?

556
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,780
They might be a new memory, but...

557
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,760
Well, yeah, they try to, but like I say, it's expensive.

558
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,280
It's difficult.

559
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:58,980
But...

560
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,260
You know, it's easier to just remove things than to add things.

561
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Because if you're adding a memory, say, it's got to come from somewhere, right?

562
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,800
So, either you put the person through the experience or you copy it from somebody else.

563
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,540
But that's the...

564
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,000
And copying it isn't...

565
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,900
It's the playback that's tricky.

566
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,760
They get scrambled.

567
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,320
Well, there's also a lot of deferent noise, they call it.

568
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,240
It's like this interference from everywhere because it's so unnatural.

569
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,920
It kicks up a lot of zygotes and all those other different gamma waves and those noises.

570
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:34,900
And once you've done that, I guess both the ovum and the sterile sac are contaminated.

571
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:35,660
Wow.

572
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,440
So you have to get the children at least all in the same area before they're eaten by these

573
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,360
huge ravens.

574
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,500
Yeah, that makes sense.

575
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,260
Yeah.

576
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,940
I don't know how they came up with these birds.

577
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,580
They're just so big and now they're on the roof.

578
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,920
They're just sitting there like...

579
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,460
Remember that movie by Alfred Hitchcock?

580
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,020
Yeah.

581
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:55,840
The birds...

582
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,320
Let's not talk dirty, Dave.

583
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,160
Okay.

584
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,280
Remember that movie?

585
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,980
What should I say instead of the B-I-R-D word?

586
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,860
The flip...

587
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,340
Although you can say the birds.

588
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,260
It was just the director's name.

589
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,080
Oh, flippy?

590
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:12,780
Yeah.

591
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,080
Hitch, whatever, you know.

592
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,420
But yeah, the birds.

593
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,540
What about the birds?

594
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,540
What's happening here?

595
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,840
Well, I just...

596
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,340
They've been as an afferent memory, you might want to call it.

597
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,000
I keep on seeing parts of the birds movie that weren't really there.

598
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,260
And then I see like, looks like an actual head from one of the beauty salons rolling

599
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,340
around in one of those dry cleaner, or not, you know, but one of those big...

600
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,800
What do they call them?

601
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,840
The dryers to clothes?

602
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,720
A mental institution?

603
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,360
Drum dryers?

604
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,920
The drum dryer.

605
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:47,920
Yeah.

606
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,300
Dave, have you been having a lot of bad dreams?

607
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:52,580
Well...

608
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,740
I guess you could call them dreams, but if you wake up in a different place...

609
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,040
Or implanted.

610
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,520
Is that why you were asking about the replacement memories?

611
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,000
Yeah, I feel like Arnold Schwarzenegger in that movie, man.

612
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,520
Whatever that movie was.

613
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,940
Well, there was about 10 of them where he had that problem.

614
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,920
Well, he was going to Mars and he had different goals.

615
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,540
The sixth day, the seventh day, total recall, partial recall.

616
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,000
Yeah.

617
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,640
There was a whole string of them.

618
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,980
They were all, by the way, they were all stolen from my original subgenius movie script idea.

619
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,560
Well, I've heard that numerous times.

620
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,100
You've never been able to prove it on silk.

621
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,600
No.

622
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,300
Why would you?

623
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:24,560
I don't know.

624
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:30,100
I say it here to ensure disbelief.

625
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:36,340
And also to confuse children once again, which is why you should be raped and arrested by the standard authority.

626
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,400
For confusing?

627
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:46,240
I thought that that was what all those political shows were for, was to confuse the children and make them think they had a choice in how they were being screwed.

628
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,200
No, that's...

629
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
Some ways being fun, in theory.

630
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,440
Well, it's supposed to be fun.

631
00:26:51,440 --> 00:27:00,000
But when you've got new characters like Mr. Rogaine instead of Mr. Rogers and Benny the whelp smacker instead of Benny the dog boy.

632
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:00,700
I know.

633
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,300
I don't know who to vote for in the primaries between them.

634
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,320
I was leaning towards Benny the dog boy because I like dogs.

635
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,020
Yeah, me too.

636
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,260
And it is a beauty contest.

637
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,180
It is.

638
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,620
Between those ones, you know.

639
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,140
Yeah.

640
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,720
If we were to see their real faces, then we'd be crying all night.

641
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,480
Right.

642
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,420
I liked it when you reminded me that, you know, I was a little bit older.

643
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:21,420


644
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:27,640
You know, I was so depressed about those people not looking exactly human and you telling me that that's the problem.

645
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,860
Well, like if you look at Hillary, sometimes her mask slides a little.

646
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,560
You know, the glue comes loose at the end of a long day and parts of it starts to sag.

647
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,840
And in the morning she looks pretty good for a thing pretending to be a human.

648
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,660
Please don't be so mean to Hillary.

649
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,560
We're equally mean to all of them.

650
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,720
We're equally mean to everybody.

651
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,320
Didn't you...

652
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,740
Weren't you listening to the earlier part of the show with all the...

653
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,100
No.

654
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,560
Well, see.

655
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,900
We get the bush bashing just is so...

656
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,340
That's like wallpaper on any college radio show.

657
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,300
Yeah.

658
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,840
So, and on top of that, it's obvious.

659
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,680
Why be labor the obvious?

660
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,220
This is the hour of slack.

661
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,020
Yeah.

662
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:18,900
Not the hour of whining and weeping about a bunch of problems a world away that we can't do anything about.

663
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,300
That's what Bob said.

664
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,160
What's there for, man?

665
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:21,700
Right.

666
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,500
I'd call it more odd-vious than odd-obvious.

667
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,880
Let Bob handle all that complicated stuff.

668
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,820
He's got the business mind and the acumen to do it, man.

669
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:35,100
He can make the simple complex by accident.

670
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,340
Hmm.

671
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,040
Yes, yes, yes.

672
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:45,320
Someday our train, our ship will come in and our train will leave this station.

673
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,720
Boy, I've been dreaming of it so much lately.

674
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,220
I just...

675
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,580
I've been fervently on my hands and feet praying to not...

676
00:28:53,580 --> 00:29:01,080
Dobbs, I know that you said that Dobbs may have an interpersonal or intrapersonal, would it be in this case?

677
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,720
I don't know.

678
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,960
Maybe he's talking to himself.

679
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,300
Suprapersonal.

680
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,320
Suprapersonal.

681
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:05,500
Yeah.

682
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,340
That's more than super.

683
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,080
Relationship with God.

684
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,060
If that's the word you want to use.

685
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,840
And is it sexual or is it just a fling?

686
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,660
It's suprasexual.

687
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,100
Or is it just a roll in the hay?

688
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,840
It's suprasexual.

689
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,560
See, Princess Wee, it turns her on when I say that word.

690
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,440
Suprasexual?

691
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,000
Yeah.

692
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,640
Supra.

693
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,940
I think we stole that from Jables and Cage.

694
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:35,040
So I can see you prancing around chasing Wee in a little nightie that has Supraman on it or something.

695
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Not till we get home.

696
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,640
And you know, Dave, I knew this was going to be the worst hour of Slack ever because when we got here...

697
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,200
It's cursed.

698
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,480
It's been cursed.

699
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,340
The coffee machine in the lobby isn't working.

700
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,300
The curse of Caffeina, Goddess Caffeina has given out on us.

701
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,920
They're pointing you in the wrong direction, Sting.

702
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,440
It's out of service.

703
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,200
And you know how I am about the coffee.

704
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,940
That's the only reason I come in here and do these shows live.

705
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,920
To get that wonderful coffee downstairs.

706
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,080
It is beautiful.

707
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,080
He dreams of it.

708
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:05,540
He longs for it.

709
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,460
Well, Princess Wee will only let me have the coffee once a month.

710
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,820
So we come in and do the show once a month.

711
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:16,460
But if I'd known the damn machine was going to be broken, I'd have stayed home and let him just play his music.

712
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:22,620
It's another one of those run-rees that has never been played before, but it's things that happened before.

713
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,280
It stinks to high heaven is what it does is what it is.

714
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,520
Not the show.

715
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,560
Not the shows.

716
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,220
But, I mean, what's going on right now and why the X's are...

717
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,680
Oh, man.

718
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,340
I'm just...

719
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,140
Are you worried about the aliens not picking you up in time?

720
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,540
Exactly.

721
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,780
As if you read my mind with what's left of it.

722
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,840
Well, that's all anybody, any subgenius worries about.

723
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,300
When are the aliens going to get here and save our bug?

724
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,440
Oh, when, oh, when.

725
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:58,980
Don't you think the lesson of X-Day not happening when it was predicted might be that we can't wait for gods and aliens and monsters to save us?

726
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,260
We have to destroy those cities ourselves.

727
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,940
That's not what you said after X-

728
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,140
We have to cripple those children and heal them.

729
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,260
We have to send those floods and tsunamis, my friend.

730
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,840
Don't lean on God.

731
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,660
Let God lean on you.

732
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,260
Let Bob use you for a crutch, we say.

733
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,440
Over and over again.

734
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:21,840
We could put it in the words of J.F. Fitzgerald Kennedy in saying...

735
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,100
I am a jelly roll.

736
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:23,980
Ask not what...

737
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,760
Where's your dobser, God?

738
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,320
I...

739
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,540
Ask, ask not what God can do for you.

740
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,680
Ask instead you what God can do for you.

741
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,600
Something like that.

742
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,760
Slack will get you through times of no slack.

743
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,200
That was one of Bob's most recent quotes.

744
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,380
That was your friend Palmer's favorite.

745
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:49,840
And by...

746
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:58,920
No, actually it was channeled through a bot, an artificial intelligence by the name of Zeppo on the subgenius IRC.

747
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,820
The brilliance of Zeppo.

748
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,460
Yeah.

749
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,600
Well, no, Zeppo's pretty repetitious most of the time.

750
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:04,740
Zen brilliance of Zeppo.

751
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,800
But he's like Zippy every now and then.

752
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,660
And, or like those hundred thousand monkeys and their typewriters.

753
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,720
Suddenly, what?

754
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,920
What will pop out but Hamlet, the gravedigger seen from Hamlet.

755
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,580
You never know.

756
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,120
Indeed, indeed.

757
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,420
You never can tell.

758
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,180
The last poor Yorick, I knew him well.

759
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,940
I used to carry him around and throw him in holes and stuff.

760
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:23,720
Yep.

761
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,800
And now, just think, all has come to nosed.

762
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,320
Or one of those other big words they used to have back in the Beowulf days and stuff.

763
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,000
Yorick was the jester of the king.

764
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,480
He was Hamlet's daddy's professional subgenius.

765
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,560
Yeah.

766
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,860
And ended up like so many, like everyone, he ended up on his head.

767
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,220
They all end up on their heads.

768
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,900
And his head ended up in Hamlet's hand.

769
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,140
And speaking of subgenius strangeness, his girlfriend, what was her name again?

770
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,480
Ophelia Rump.

771
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,960
Ophelia, what a subgenius name.

772
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,520
Right.

773
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,280
Jumped into the water and was rejected by the water.

774
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,020
Got spat right back out, but she died anyway.

775
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,060
That adds drama, see.

776
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,840
That's conflict.

777
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:18,320
Conflict is the key to the, you know, as we say in Shakespeare, the recording's the thing.

778
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,860
Not the play, but the recording.

779
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,560
Carries the actual drama.

780
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,560
Some people have a different attitude about that.

781
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:38,440
But to me, it's like, it's not real until you're holding a recording in your hand and a safety copy off premises somewhere.

782
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,800
Then it's real.

783
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,000
Well, it could also be unreal until you can feel yourself pee.

784
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,740
Not a letter.

785
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,860
See, to me, it's not like everybody gets 15 minutes of fame.

786
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,800
To me, it's like everybody gets 15 minutes of life.

787
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,160
Unless you do a college radio station, then you get a whole hour of life every week.

788
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,820
Ophelia, you're breaking my heart.

789
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,300
You get much of scorn, is what you get.

790
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,640
You're taking my confidence daily.

791
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,420
These you're about.

792
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:05,920
Ophelia.

793
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,420
Just think of this swollen vapid heart.

794
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:08,420


795
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:21,480
What do you think of it?

796
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,080
It's kind of like you quote music, but a little этого.

797
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,460
Oh that's a Nirvana with F��고 and Michael Jackson in it?

798
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:31,920
Tobi de Mar.

799
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:32,380
This is awful.

800
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:32,420
That's wild.

801
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,420
Ann countercor pela tua.

802
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,020
Well, it's –

803
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,760
How easy is that to translate this into real life?

804
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:37,800


805
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,400
So Interesting.

806
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:38,600
Yes.

807
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:39,760
Yes.

808
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,420
You've got it, Dave.

809
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,080
Affirmative.

810
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,360
You've nailed it right on the head.

811
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,000
That's it.

812
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,640
And the nail that sticks up shall be beaten down.

813
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,080
And that nail is you, Dave.

814
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,760
You're not sticking up?

815
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,740
Come on, man.

816
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,100
Stick up for yourself.

817
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,660
Don't be a wuss.

818
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,660
I'm just a hammerhead.

819
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,620
Don't be a wuss genius.

820
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,060
Now, there's another church, see?

821
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,600
Church of the Wuss Genius?

822
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,000
Yeah.

823
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,460
The wimpy, nerdy guys that really are geniuses.

824
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:18,200
They would be for geniuses, but not the geniuses that are athletic and adventuresome.

825
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,260
Billionaires.

826
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:26,160
But the wussy geniuses that can beat a computer at checkers but don't know how to change a tire.

827
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,740
But they're very cold-hearted, too.

828
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,260
Yeah.

829
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,880
Now, see, some people think that's the subgeniuses, but we aren't the ones that beat the computer at chess.

830
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,140
We're the ones who get the cheat sheet.

831
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,560
Yes, certainly.

832
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,580
And our...

833
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:39,780
Oh.

834
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,280
Yeah.

835
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,840
Here's that cheat sheet now.

836
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,160
Flying in on a wing and a prayer.

837
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,960
Oh, it looks like Pegasus.

838
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,400
It looks like a pig with wings on it.

839
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,940
Yes, the little winged, the blessed winged pig.

840
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,440
Oh, it's so beautiful for a...

841
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:51,900
Dobstown.

842
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,100
...a miscreant thing like that.

843
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,680
There's Dobstown below.

844
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
I can see it down below.

845
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,860
All the little houses and streets, the little concrete canyons in the...

846
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:05,060
Notice there's no pollution because there's no heating in Dobstown.

847
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,800
It looks like there might not be any real air down there.

848
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,060
But...

849
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,660
We'll get...

850
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,860
I guess you've got to get closer and...

851
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,700
Well, we get closer and we come to the palace.

852
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,120
Yeah.

853
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:20,780
Which is like a big gambling hall and throne office and strip joint.

854
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,580
Notice the guards there aren't wearing any underwear and don't carry weapons.

855
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,060
Unless...

856
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,040
Well, but you can see.

857
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:27,640
But every...

858
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,160
Right.

859
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,600
As you'll notice, everyone has that special thing around their neck.

860
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,220
And, you know, if they misbehave, that wire will...

861
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,260
Tighten.

862
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:46,140
But the nice thing about it is that you can get any size, any color, practically any style you could imagine.

863
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:46,820
Right.

864
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,400
Of Joe Collin.

865
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,320
Yeah, and everybody has one.

866
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,940
I mean, everybody who's anybody.

867
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,180
Except, I've noticed Bob and some of the other hierarchy.

868
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,260
I have to wear one, but Philo doesn't.

869
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,580
Philo didn't have to wear that neck brace.

870
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,560
Well, Bob's is symbolic and invisible.

871
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,300
Some people say the neck brace is the exest.

872
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,960
But I think it's just...

873
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,300
It's a machine.

874
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,460
I think it's just a security device like Bob says it is.

875
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:11,880
Yeah.

876
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,900
Well, a psychic neck brace...

877
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,580
Bob wouldn't lie.

878
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,280
Yeah.

879
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,660
Would he?

880
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,480
No.

881
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:22,160
But a psychic neck brace is a necessity in a place like Dobson, especially around El Palacio.

882
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:27,820
Bob wouldn't lie about a psychic neck brace that could decapitate you used as a method of control.

883
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,460
Would he?

884
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,640
Well, he might do his best to tell you the truth and leave out the important parts.

885
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,200
If it was a little white lie.

886
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,040
You know, it's like a lie that...

887
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,940
It does you some good.

888
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,960
Because, you know, sometimes Bob has to trick you into helping yourself.

889
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,880
That's what religion's all about with some of the...

890
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,080
Well, with the lower hierarchy.

891
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,340
You have to trick them into helping themselves.

892
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,300
We don't really need the money from them.

893
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,640
But when they give us the money, that tricks them into thinking that something good's going to happen.

894
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,180
Right.

895
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,900
Because you don't give your money away for nothing.

896
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,800
Obviously, you're going to get something for it, they think.

897
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,720
They think.

898
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,740
So, no, right.

899
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,040
So, I mean, that's how...

900
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,040


901
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,040


902
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,040


903
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,240
No, not at all.

904
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,740
It's a bunch of witch doctor mumbo jumbo, and by golly, it works.

905
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,540
Mm-hmm.

906
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,200
It's like homeopathy.

907
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,020
There's no...

908
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,320
It's faith healing, but that's all you need.

909
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,040
Now?

910
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:24,360
The only problem, you have to watch out when the white lies start to resemble little white maggots.

911
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,860
Then you know the treatment has to either be repeated or discontinued.

912
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,640
Either way, you're on the better side of Bob.

913
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,860
Or that's when you switch from the vodka to the Everclear, my friend.

914
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,960
And you quit mixing.

915
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,780
You just go for the gusto.

916
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,940
Now, you're talking about...

917
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,440
You only go around once in life.

918
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,380
You're talking about a band, or you're talking about drinking washing fluid?

919
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:52,160
I'm talking about drinking Everclear, 100% alcohol, and killing yourself not that slowly.

920
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,900
That's a cleaning fluid, Stan.

921
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,140
You're not supposed to ingest that.

922
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,300
Hey, man, it's what my computer said was the most logical thing for all human beings to do.

923
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,840
I asked my computer, I said, what should the human race do?

924
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:08,040
And the computer said, basically, it doesn't...

925
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,220
It doesn't talk.

926
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,520
On the screen, it said, drink yourselves to death.

927
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,700
It said.

928
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,600
Yeah, it grunted it in cyborg language.

929
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,800
Well, no, it just printed it out on the screen.

930
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,160
I could have it talk to me if I wanted to, but I'm not that kind of a...

931
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,280
I'm not a wuss genius.

932
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,800
I'm a sub-gen.

933
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,980
I just, you know...

934
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,280
Computers are heartless.

935
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,480
You're not a narcissist.

936
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,860
You're a computer narcissist.

937
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,540
They may be heartless, but they aren't organless.

938
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,040
They aren't...

939
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,040


940
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,040


941
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,040


942
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,040


943
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,040


944
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,040


945
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,020
They have a way of, shall we say, screwing you.

946
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,840
Your computer, yes, can screw you.

947
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,880
Might mess you up.

948
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:45,760
Right?

949
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,500
Right.

950
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:52,460
It's your servant, ostensibly, and yet, you find yourself opening up its head and shoveling

951
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,180
money into it every few months.

952
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:01,120
And slavishly worshiping at its little keyboard feet.

953
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,400
Oh, it's a known fact.

954
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,520
In fact, half the people that are listening to us now are in that very same situation.

955
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,020
Yeah.

956
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,400
A recent Pew, which stands for the way it smells, a Research Institute study claimed

957
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,480
that 80%...

958
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,200
No, no, it was more like 30% of Americans interviewed felt that they were having some sort of godlike

959
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,900
relationship or spiritual relationship with their computer.

960
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,720
Oh, I know how that is.

961
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,260
I am.

962
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:25,980
I'm definitely...

963
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,240
I know you know how it is.

964
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,540
And it's not...

965
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,780
I'm not even imagining it.

966
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:33,520
In my case, it's real because I've got a direct connection to Bob.

967
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,960
Because I'm working for Bob.

968
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,300
I've got broad...

969
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,420
It's broadband, baby.

970
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,620
It's wide.

971
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,440
It's the widest bandwidth.

972
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,940
It's so wide you can't get around it.

973
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,100
And you can't deny...

974
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,820
It's so big you can't denial of service attack it.

975
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,680
So low you can't get under.

976
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,340
It's spam filter is so, so fine that you cannot...

977
00:40:59,340 --> 00:40:59,980
You can't get...

978
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,660
It's like getting through to Bob's head.

979
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,700
It's like getting through his thick skull to him.

980
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,920
You can't do it.

981
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,680
But your prayers can't make it through Bob's thick skull and your spam can't make it through

982
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,900
his junk filter.

983
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,940
And just think if you ever...

984
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:21,260
And yet his spam, that's all you ever really see is the spam of Bob.

985
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,780
It's in God between the two of them, one or the other.

986
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,220
God knows everything worth knowing and Bob knows everything else, my pappy used to say.

987
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,160
Yep.

988
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,120
True words were never spoke, boy, on that one.

989
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:33,840
Yep.

990
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:38,860
I was just thinking that one of the reasons why Bob won't have one of those computers

991
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,660
put in his head is just because his skull is so thick.

992
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:46,500
And we've all had some problems with trephination once in a while, the drills...

993
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,560
Bob's a natural man.

994
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,840
He don't need a box in his head like you and me do.

995
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,340
Right.

996
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,740
He doesn't need the chip implant.

997
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,960
He's a chipless bastard, you might say.

998
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,300
He's just thrown that implant...

999
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,620
He pulled that implant out from behind his ear and threw it away.

1000
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,160
And then he kicked over that...

1001
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,820
He kicked over that...

1002
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:03,820


1003
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,180
He kicked over that...

1004
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,180


1005
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,180


1006
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,180


1007
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,180


1008
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,180


1009
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,180


1010
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,180


1011
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,460
And then he put it in his head and he said, so it's a chemical toilet.

1012
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,940
And he said, we don't need these artificial things.

1013
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,980
Chemical toilets aren't artificial things.

1014
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,960
Fertilize the earth, man.

1015
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,340
Fertilize your mind.

1016
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,600
Yeah.

1017
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,880
With all the dung that's going around, it should be easy.

1018
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,320
And are you talking about politics again?

1019
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,920
No, I just slipped right into it.

1020
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,660
I couldn't help it.

1021
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,560
And I'll stop.

1022
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,160
It's just so there, you can hardly help it.

1023
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,560
Well, now, see, you can call people here in a...

1024
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:33,820
In a...

1025
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:33,820


1026
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:39,520
In a Cleveland area, listening by actual broadcast radio as we're doing it live, can

1027
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:48,100
call the subsequent show and talk about how evil the Repugnican is and how wonderful and

1028
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,380
groovy the Democrat is and...

1029
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,940
Or vice versa.

1030
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:59,520
People can call in and say ethnic slurs that Dr. Sinister can then cut out so it never

1031
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,800
gets on the air to prove how cool y'all are.

1032
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:03,800


1033
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,620
But not on this show, see.

1034
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,020
We don't take calls on this show.

1035
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,160
In fact, Dave, what the hell do you think you're doing, calling this show?

1036
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,700
Well, you said it was a sub-genie show.

1037
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:14,580
No.

1038
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,860
And I got confused and thought it was a subsequent show.

1039
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,800
It was the broken Dave theme special.

1040
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,660
I told you.

1041
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,640
And yet here you are, limping...

1042
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,580
He's the guest of honor, Reverend Stank.

1043
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,960
With his brain in a cast.

1044
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:29,700
Call.

1045
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,780
Dave is the only caller allowed to call.

1046
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,780
He calls by influence.

1047
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,720
He's not the only caller we'd like.

1048
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,960
He's just the only one that will allow to call.

1049
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,140
And I get to wear a wig when I stay home.

1050
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,060
And nobody can laugh on me.

1051
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,340
Right.

1052
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,740
Now, see, I had to shave because I had to come into the station.

1053
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,880
Brush your teats.

1054
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,800
And put my wig on in there, my mullet wig.

1055
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,540
Adjust your mask.

1056
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,900
Put on that mullet.

1057
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:53,500
Yep.

1058
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,860
Which in many parts of the world is a fish.

1059
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,320
You didn't have to because you're calling in.

1060
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,300
See, that's why that's the easy part of it.

1061
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,440
Now, what if you were one of these countries...

1062
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,780
I know this is a really stupid question.

1063
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,680
I ask right after I telegraph the stupidity of it.

1064
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,400
But what if you asked for a mullet, you know, like a breastplate mullet, and it was the

1065
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,780
actual fish, a mullet, the mullet fish.

1066
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,040
Would you have to wear it or would you just quit the Church of the Subsequent Geniuses

1067
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,960
and start your own religion?

1068
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:26,680
Well, it depends on what would Bob do or what wouldn't Bob do, actually, is the question.

1069
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,680
Is it doctrinal?

1070
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,220
You have to look it up in the back of the Book of the Subgenius.

1071
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,880
If it ain't there, look it up.

1072
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,700
Look in the index.

1073
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,840
Look in the index of Revelation X.

1074
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,580
If there's no index there, look in the index of Bob Leografon.

1075
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,120
If it ain't there, you go to alt.slack on Google Groups and do a little search for it.

1076
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,640
And by golly, if we don't have it, you don't need it.

1077
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,240
Wow, man, I don't know how you keep up with all that stuff.

1078
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,380
You have to have such a huge brain or something.

1079
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,220
I have a very large skull.

1080
00:44:53,360 --> 00:45:00,180
Princess Wee and I and several subgeniuses are famous for our giant skulls relative to

1081
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,560
our small statuary.

1082
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,600
My statuary...

1083
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:03,680
Oh, my God.

1084
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,940
My statuary is little.

1085
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:06,900
They call us the big heads.

1086
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,380
But my head is big.

1087
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:08,960
Oh.

1088
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,980
So we will call him Little Big Head.

1089
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,320
Right.

1090
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,040
And he will join the human beings.

1091
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,640
Reference, Stang likes to call himself Stumpy Big Head.

1092
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,360
Stumpy Big Head.

1093
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:22,760
That's me.

1094
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,680
Stumpy doesn't mind being stumpy.

1095
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,600
Stumpy can fit into small places and big people can't get in there.

1096
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,640
Stumpy doesn't mind.

1097
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,440
Stumpy likes people to make funny jokes about him.

1098
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,260
Yeah.

1099
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:33,940
Stumpy doesn't mind.

1100
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,360
What kind of places can you get into with that big head of yours?

1101
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,100
Stumpy Big Head can hide.

1102
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,080
I can't see nothing but his head.

1103
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:45,460
Are you one of those guys when they're working underneath your car and they say, come over

1104
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,480
here and take a look and you go, no, no, that's all right.

1105
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,900
You can just tell me about it because your head is too large to go under the car.

1106
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,400
You can make fun of Stumpy.

1107
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,260
Stumpy doesn't mind.

1108
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,620
All right.

1109
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,120
I won't.

1110
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,520
Actually, Dave, since you're broken and I did promise.

1111
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,680
I did.

1112
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,000
I hit your head against a bonnet.

1113
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,860
I think it's dangerous probably.

1114
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:18,860


1115
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,660
You know what?

1116
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,560
There's my death wish.

1117
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,260
And I hope you do aft love, love you, love.

1118
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:25,260


1119
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,560
Well, that's pretty uncomfortable.

1120
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:26,560


1121
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:26,560


1122
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:26,560


1123
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,220
All right Minbra.

1124
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:29,300


1125
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,240
I'm sorry for the creep.

1126
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:31,700
I think gold associated.

1127
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,020
Cory.

1128
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,640
and wiping away mosquitoes or flies.

1129
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,440
Well, this guy did a song called In the Belly of the Thunderbird.

1130
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,760
But in order to get to it, I'm going to have to get you out of here.

1131
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,000
We're going to all have to leave.

1132
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,800
Okay, well, I'll go, but you have to promise that all the wonderful people in Cleveland out there

1133
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,500
who hope that I'm not broke anymore will try and fix me somehow.

1134
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,600
Friends, Dave is broke, and if you want to contribute to Dave's health,

1135
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,480
Ralph, you know what to do at subgenius.com.

1136
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,640
Yeah, don't send me, like, weird dead katinas like in them Tony Hillerman books and stuff.

1137
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,920
Right. What he said.

1138
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,440
No, just positivity. That's what you can send.

1139
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,360
Or dirty pictures if you're a young lady between the ages of 45 and 78.

1140
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,520
Something like that. Okay.

1141
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:23,880
Okay, man.

1142
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,360
Okay, man, it was real improper talking to you.

1143
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,460
I know.

1144
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,800
Hope to talk to you sometime.

1145
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,280
I'm sorry.

1146
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:30,940
I'm sorry.

1147
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:31,480
I'm sorry.

1148
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,200
I'm sorry.

1149
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,680
I'm sorry.

1150
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,500
Long long loads, all in one waterhole

1151
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,380
All in one waterhole

1152
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,760
Destroying the government, we're destroying time

1153
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,520
When there are more problems on the way

1154
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,580
Flying through a doctor, we don't need your time

1155
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,860
We are the ones, ugly ones, stupid boys from one time

1156
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,960
Long long loads, so are we all

1157
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,960
We're all in one, all in one waterhole

1158
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,760
All in one waterhole

1159
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,760
Students having problems, let's just take two and call it a day

1160
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,560
We'll have to put them on the shelf

1161
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,740
All day long we hear them crying so

1162
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,920
Wow, I just wanna be myself

1163
00:48:53,920 --> 00:49:02,620
I'm a clone, I know I'm fine

1164
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,380
I'm one of more on the way

1165
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,620
Flying through a doctor, three's on the line

1166
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,740
It'll take incubation, another day

1167
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,780
Flying long long loads, so are we all

1168
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,720
We're all in one, all in one waterhole

1169
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:21,720


1170
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,820
All in one waterhole

1171
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,740
All in one waterhole

1172
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,540
Flying long long loads, so are we all

1173
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,040
We're all in one

1174
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,540
All in one waterhole

1175
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,500
All in one waterhole

1176
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,280
Flying long long loads, so are we all

1177
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,260
Mo's Giganticus, dear friends.

1178
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:51,720
Mo's Giganticus, dear friends.

1179
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:52,860
Giganticus.com

1180
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:01,900
Mo's Giganticus.com

1181
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,640
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack at subgenius.com

1182
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,800
That clawed me in his clutch

1183
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,140
Whose grave's this, sirrah?

1184
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,560
Mine, sir.

1185
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,260
I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in it.

1186
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,780
You lie out on't, sir, therefore it is not yours.

1187
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,740
For my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.

1188
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,960
Thou dost lie in't to be in't, and say it is thine.

1189
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,980
It is the dead, not the quick, therefore thou liest.

1190
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,860
It is a quick lie, sir, till away again from me to you.

1191
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,000
What man dost thou dig it for?

1192
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,380
For no man, sir.

1193
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,060
For what woman, then?

1194
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,100
For none neither.

1195
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,060
Who is to be buried in it?

1196
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,660
One that was a woman, sir, but rest her soul, she's dead.

1197
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,500
How absolute the knave is!

1198
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,060
We must speak but a card, or equivocation will undo us.

1199
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,940
How long hast thou been grave-maker?

1200
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:05,460
Of all the days in the year, I came to it that day that our last king Hamlet o'ercame fought in brass.

1201
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,200
How long is that since?

1202
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,360
Cannot you tell that?

1203
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,780
Every fool can tell that.

1204
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,040
It was the very day that young Hamlet was born.

1205
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,220
He that is mad, and sent it to England.

1206
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,100
I am mad.

1207
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,640
Why was he mad?

1208
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:17,640


1209
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:17,640


1210
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,560
Why was he sent into England?

1211
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,740
Why? Because he was mad.

1212
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,340
He shall recover his wits there.

1213
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,340
Or if he do not, tis no great matter there.

1214
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:26,760
Why?

1215
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,260
To not be seen in him there.

1216
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,440
There the men are as mad as he.

1217
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,960
How came he mad?

1218
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,080
Very strangely, they say.

1219
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,440
How strangely?

1220
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,140
Faith, e'en by losing his wits.

1221
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,160
Upon what ground?

1222
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,680
Why, here in Denmark.

1223
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,980
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?

1224
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:53,980
If he be not rotten before he die, he will last some eight year, nine year.

1225
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,060
A tenner will last you nine year.

1226
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,340
Why he more than another?

1227
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:04,440
Why, sir, his hide is so ten with his trade, he will keep out water a great while.

1228
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,020
And your water's a sordid care of your awesome dead body.

1229
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:08,980
Here.

1230
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,680
Here's a skull now.

1231
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,660
This culleth then in the earth three and twenty years.

1232
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:14,800
And here.

1233
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,860
Whose was it?

1234
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,580
Awesome mad fellows it was.

1235
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,600
Who do you think it was?

1236
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,480
Nay, I know not.

1237
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,640
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue.

1238
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:29,340
He poured a flagon of rhenish on me eight months.

1239
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,260
Alas, poor Yorick.

1240
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,060
I knew him, Horatio.

1241
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,780
A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.

1242
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:46,280
He hath borne me on his back a thousand times.

1243
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:53,340
But now, how abhorred in my imagination it is, my gorge rises it.

1244
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:59,020
Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft.

1245
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,560
Where be your jibes now?

1246
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:09,780
Your songs, your gambols, your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar?

1247
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:11,760
I know not.

1248
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,980
Not one now to mock your own grinning.

1249
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,640
Quite chop-fallen.

1250
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,600
Help, help, help, help, help, help, help, trip, trip, seventeen, seventeen, trip.

1251
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,920
I feel like you have erection.

1252
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:29,360
You don't feel like what you do is really not only not working but you don't even feel,

1253
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,540
you just feel kind of crummy about how your life is going.

1254
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,080
See, here's how life works.

1255
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:38,960
I see my husband in totally different, altogether different kind of, uh, values.

1256
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,540
Follow me now.

1257
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,220
You know, surprise.

1258
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,320
Be frustrated and feel chaotic and confused.

1259
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,060
So, driven, driven.

1260
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,560
Trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip.

1261
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:47,980
Hi there.

1262
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:48,620
Hi.

1263
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:49,280
How are you?

1264
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:49,740
Hi.

1265
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:50,460
How are you?

1266
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:50,920
Hi.

1267
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:51,640
How are you?

1268
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:51,920
Hi.

1269
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:52,500
How are you?

1270
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,000
Um.

1271
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,740
Resentful at best.

1272
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,560
Yeah, but, excuse me?

1273
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,620
Hang a work.

1274
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,100
See.

1275
00:53:59,240 --> 00:53:59,540
Right.

1276
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,000
I absolutely agree.

1277
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,120
Yeah.

1278
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,500
You know, you've got a problem.

1279
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,880
Get drunk on wine.

1280
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,000
Help, help, so you can have a life.

1281
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,500
Trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip.

1282
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,760
And you're standing there and you're getting frustrated.

1283
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,120
Right.

1284
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,460
And I.

1285
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:13,840
And you're standing there and you're getting frustrated.

1286
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,120
Right.

1287
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:15,560
And I.

1288
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,500
It's okay to fool around.

1289
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,640
Flip our thinking.

1290
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,920
How much do you think?

1291
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:25,220
Super scientific, super science from some alien super race.

1292
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:38,240
They tell me it's the flying saucer.

1293
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,480
What flying saucer?

1294
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:39,480


1295
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:39,480


1296
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,080
What flying saucer, I ask?

1297
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,900
And then they says.

1298
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,900
What is this, miss?

1299
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:52,600
A gag?

1300
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:53,540
Yes.

1301
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,280
No.

1302
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,760
I can't tell you.

1303
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,100
Do you speak any other languages?

1304
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,200
I don't know.

1305
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,560
Could I have a look at the saucer?

1306
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,940
I don't care what you do.

1307
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:03,740
All right, boys.

1308
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,300
Bring it in.

1309
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:04,820
All right.

1310
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,060
All right.

1311
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:08,920
All right.

1312
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,080
All right.

1313
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:09,780
All right.

1314
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:09,780


1315
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:09,780


1316
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:09,780


1317
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,900
It's talking to you now, isn't it?

1318
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,020
Yes.

1319
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:12,760
What is it saying?

1320
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,900
You understand?

1321
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:16,940
Yes.

1322
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:23,060
You know, I spent a lot of time.

1323
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:28,400
Well, me and my friend Andy spent a lot of time working on a few songs and stuff.

1324
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:39,060
And we sent them to you and you have failed to put them on the hour of the plane.

1325
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:39,060


1326
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:43,160
Slack for two episodes, and we're wondering why.

1327
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:53,400
We are devoted subgenii, and we have paid our $30, praise Bob, and we're wondering why

1328
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:59,340
you haven't put us on the hour of Slack.

1329
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:08,280
And, you know, I'm sure you got a lot of things to do and press.

1330
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:32,040
Thank you.

1331
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,200
Thank you.

1332
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,260
Thank you.

1333
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:54,000
In the belly of the Thunderbird, by Ivan Gomez.

1334
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:59,320
And you're listening to the Subgenie.

1335
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,720
The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, as it ends.

1336
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:07,120
And if you want more information about the Church of the Subgenius, or anything you've

1337
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:15,780
heard here, you may go on the internet to subgenius.com, S-U-B-G-E-N-I-U-S dot com.

1338
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:29,060
Yes, or write to Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 440.

1339
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,520
Hey, here's something.

1340
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:36,740
Listen to this.

1341
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:41,620
Staring out with fixed hypnotic eyes was a coiled cobra.

1342
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,220
Oh, my.

1343
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,420
Only this one was solid gleaming gold.

1344
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:44,980
Oh, my.

1345
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:49,440
I started, but I stopped again because there was a gun in my back.

1346
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,440
That's quite far enough, Marlowe.

1347
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,100
So it was you who killed Zip, huh?

1348
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,080
I hated him.

1349
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,320
As soon as I was sure you'd picked up the gold cobra, I came back here.

1350
00:58:59,340 --> 00:58:59,480
Yeah.

1351
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,040
And I killed him.

1352
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,800
I don't think that's a bit funny, Floyd.

1353
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:06,640
Yes, my dear.

1354
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,480
Holy smoke, there's a live cobra behind you.

1355
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,880
Oh, say, that's good.

1356
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,360
I want you to stop this nonsense, Floyd.

1357
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,620
But, get back in the car.

1358
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,300
Why, I don't...

1359
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,020
I expected a much less bizarre ending to all this.

1360
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:22,820
Bye.

1361
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,140
Bye.

1362
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:29,940
The grave...

1363
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:30,040
The grave...

1364
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:30,680
The grave...

1365
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:30,960
The grave...

1366
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,060
The grave...

1367
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:31,100
The grave...

1368
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,100


1369
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,100


1370
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,100


1371
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,100


1372
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,100


1373
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,100


1374
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,100


1375
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,100


1376
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,100


1377
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,100


1378
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,100


1379
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,100


1380
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,100
