1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,960
I hate So

2
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,420
In this scene, the mother herself leads into the subject of Bob

3
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,600
with her daughter, who might be 10 or 11, perhaps older.

4
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,380
The obvious reason is to make sure that a girl knows

5
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,120
both the natural and the spiritual significance of Bob.

6
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,480
Parents are the best judges of the proper time and place for such instruction,

7
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,980
but a good rule to follow here is

8
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,520
better a year too early than one week too late.

9
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,000
At Global Consolidated we care about you, not those other people.

10
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,200
We like you because you are special.

11
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,840
But you should have seen the crap those other customers were doing.

12
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,980
We doused them with chemicals and charged them late fees.

13
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,400
But they kept coming.

14
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,580
They came, and they still came.

15
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,440
Visit us in one of our 20,000 convenient locations.

16
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,480
Global Consolidated.

17
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,540
We're not like before.

18
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,620
We'll see you next time.

19
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,460
JASMINE

20
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:27,460


21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:19,800
cel

22
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,060
ne

23
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,680
You're a lapdog, yeah, boot to the lapdog

24
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,380
Kind of sending, oh you're the pick of the litter

25
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,260
Peer breeding, it's made you insane

26
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,040
Mutation, oh you're puppy like charm

27
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,720
Devolving to a superficial niche

28
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,700
Consuming all your frivolous products

29
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,300
Your life in the hand that feeds

30
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,260
Your conscience is a pet on the head

31
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,980
Yep, yep, yep, now you're gnawing my leg

32
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,060
You're a lapdog, lapdog, you're a lapdog

33
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,940
Yeah, boot to the lapdog

34
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,500
Yep, yep, yep, yeah, boot to the lapdog

35
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,720
Yep, yep, yep, yeah, boot to the lapdog

36
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,180
Yep, yep, yep, yeah, boot to the lapdog

37
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,100
Yep, yep, yep, yeah, boot to the lapdog

38
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,000
Thank you.

39
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,200
That one, uh, it's not really about kicking puppies.

40
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,700
I'm just kidding.

41
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,820
I wouldn't be so cruel.

42
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,700
It's about kicking people.

43
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:57,780
It's about kicking people.

44
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,960
People, people.

45
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,220
People, people.

46
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,060
Kind of sister.

47
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,980
Check out my new class.

48
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,760
Puppy got no leash.

49
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,480
Hey bro, you got a quarter?

50
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,560
One punch.

51
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,600
Hit me down.

52
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,580
Hit me down.

53
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,680
Hit me down.

54
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:27,680


55
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:27,680


56
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:27,680


57
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,040
Pippy down!

58
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:30,740
Pippy down!

59
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,220
Yeah, I wrote that one when I lived in Colorado

60
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,360
for a little while.

61
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,920
Man, the subgenius, Steve Ivor.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,100
Friends at Beachland Ballroom, May 22nd, the year 2004.

63
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,860
You can learn more on Man at beer4men.com.

64
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,140
That's www.beer4man.com.

65
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:07,340
And this radio show, Hour of Slack, number 945,

66
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,420
features not only a new, incredible, really, song,

67
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,640
an operatic song, almost, from the El Queso All-Stars,

68
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,500
but also recordings, really good recordings,

69
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,360
from the most recent devival at the Beachland Ballroom

70
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,840
here in Colorado.

71
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,660
Cleveland, including some great preaching

72
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,180
by a young Reverend Carter LeBlanc,

73
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,620
and you will love it.

74
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,340
Friends, the background music also is by the Amino Acids

75
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,620
and was likewise recorded at that devival.

76
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,660
Collages that we've already heard

77
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:54,260
were by Fernanda Nande-Lemur, Artemia Salina, and Paul Carr.

78
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,660
Now, the collage,

79
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,540
as you're about to hear,

80
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,020
is by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

81
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,880
with Dr. Howell narrating.

82
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,440
From the subgenius video, Arise.

83
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,640
The bovinity and temerity of the human mind itself

84
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,660
does all the work.

85
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,400
The evil ones may just lean back

86
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,200
and watch the little humans march gladly,

87
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,980
even proudly, to their doom.

88
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,880
But we, too, must be vigilant.

89
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,480
For, thanks to the false slack bombarding us,

90
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,300
daily, it is terrifyingly easy

91
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,480
for even a subgenius to slip back into normality.

92
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,060
We live in a dangerous world.

93
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,320
The powers of pinkness

94
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,120
are always fighting the powers of slack.

95
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,040
Yes, children, they're locked in a death struggle.

96
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,780
Sometimes, oh, brother pink

97
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,100
gets all the slack down.

98
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,940
And he's a gasping.

99
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,440
And he's a choking.

100
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,020
And he's a straining.

101
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,500
But then, finally,

102
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,200
there we go.

103
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,820
Come on, then.

104
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,500
Fight good money!

105
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,100
Fight it!

106
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,160
And the powers of slack fight back.

107
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,400
Fight back!

108
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,800
Yes, yes, yes!

109
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,700
The powers of pink are found!

110
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,320
Fight it with slack!

111
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,780
But, children,

112
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,380
the final outcome is up for you!

113
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,180
Slack!

114
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,040
We can't give you all the answers.

115
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,080
But we can help you flesh out your fantasy

116
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
that there are some.

117
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,500
And that's why we're here.

118
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,020
At our labs, we use only the finest homemade ingredients.

119
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:40,100
Love, children, God, and the purest blend of money

120
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,520
your needs can buy.

121
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,160
Grown right here by our special process.

122
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,860
A process in use since our first mom and pop operation.

123
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,600
Who are we?

124
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,800
We're the normal people.

125
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,240
Normal people.

126
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,740
The most normal people in the world.

127
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,580
Normal people.

128
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,160
Normal people.

129
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,760
We are normal people.

130
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,440
But not quite as normal as you.

131
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,860
Children, look around you.

132
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,460
Testify.

133
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,240
Look at what they've done to the things that you love.

134
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,380
They took Elvis Presley.

135
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,580
They turned him pink.

136
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,480
They made him into a fat monster!

137
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,500
Tell us.

138
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,860
People say to us,

139
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,480
people worry that the church of the subgenius,

140
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,700
is an anti-American church.

141
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,180
No!

142
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,700
No!

143
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,140
A subversive church!

144
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:30,940
No!

145
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:31,520
No!

146
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,120
Children, we are the first real Americans!

147
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:35,780
No!

148
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,540
No!

149
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,040


150
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,700
No!

151
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,760
We know what America is

152
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,640
before they took it away from us

153
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,140
and tried to sell it back to us for a profit.

154
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:44,900
No!

155
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,340
No!

156
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,600
No!

157
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:45,920
No!

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000


159
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:46,640


160
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,140


161
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,220


162
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,220


163
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,140
No!

164
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,680
No!

165
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:52,760


166
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,960
No!

167
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,280
No!

168
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,600
No!

169
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,340
No!

170
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,280
No!

171
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,200
No!

172
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,280
Noみんな,

173
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,080
Aysha!

174
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,120


175
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,120


176
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,820
to the balls of your feet.

177
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,860
You're a pink and you know it.

178
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,740
Your eyes clearly show it.

179
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,300
Your lies are the dick of a demon

180
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,900
you happily blow.

181
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,800
And you know from the smell

182
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,700
that your slack has been sold.

183
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,620
And there'll be no time to tell you

184
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,200
when your asshole will explode.

185
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,020
You watch TV. You go to work.

186
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,860
You watch TV. You go to sleep.

187
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,660
You watch TV. You go to church.

188
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,520
You watch TV. You go to eat.

189
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,320
You watch TV. You go to work.

190
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,140
You watch TV. You go to sleep.

191
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,960
You watch TV. You go to church.

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,820
You watch TV. You are a pink.

193
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,420
You are a pink.

194
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,980
Now your pinkness has come

195
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,940
at such a drastic a level

196
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,580
that we know that you sucked

197
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,640
on the dick of the devil.

198
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,180
But alas, the spell you cast out on the sheep

199
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,040
could prevent us from breaking the grip

200
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,880
of your evil until Bob took the wheel.

201
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,580
And sacked the deck in our favor.

202
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,400
Now we get to savor

203
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,100
every moment.

204
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,820
Of your torment as you stumble about.

205
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,940
Testicle feet swirling.

206
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,600
Chicken scream in your mouth.

207
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,100
Pink boy fear in your eyes.

208
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,760
Now you know it was Bob.

209
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,700
Now you feel all your lies.

210
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,580
Now you know it's our job.

211
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,080
Making you realize that your reality is a joke.

212
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,800
We despise and hope

213
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,660
we can see through the smoke

214
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,500
and the mirrors that you've lived in for years.

215
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,260
We would just kill you now

216
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,060
but you're wrong.

217
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,640
It's my fault

218
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,220
the only joke

219
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,020
was fierce.

220
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,760
You watch Tv and you go to work.

221
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,760
You watch Tv and

222
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,560
you go to sleep.

223
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,420
You watch Tv

224
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,420
and you go to irregular.

225
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,160
You watch TV

226
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,180
and you go to church.

227
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,940
And you go to work.

228
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,960
You watch Tv

229
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,840
and you go to sleep.

230
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,680
You watch Tv

231
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,660
and you go to irregular.

232
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,520
You watch Tv

233
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:04,960
and you go to sleep.

234
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,460
You are a pink.

235
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,740
I am not crude

236
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,580
or unrefined.

237
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,060
I study every latest trend

238
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,520
My abs are oh so well defined

239
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,440
My skin is permanently tanned

240
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,940
My teeth are capped in pearly white

241
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,820
My bank account is my best friend

242
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:39,900
And I assign people value based on what they have to spend

243
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,480
I wear the best designer clothes

244
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,200
I go to trendy clubs to dance

245
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,460
I have a fancy car that makes up for the absence in my pants

246
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,480
I have a thing for insincerity

247
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,660
A fetish for the lines

248
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,880
Cause every time I swallow bullshit I feel my ego swell in size

249
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,640
I walk when the sign says walk

250
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,200
I poop when it's time to poop

251
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,120
I poop when it's time to poop

252
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,120


253
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,740
I read what I'm told to read

254
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,640
And unless I'm told to I simply won't believe

255
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,620
Cause I don't need to think about it

256
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,280
I don't need to think at all

257
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,820
Cause my head's already crowded with the things that keep me small

258
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,060
I am a pink boy

259
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,800
These aren't my times

260
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,220
And if you ask me very nice

261
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,120
I'll introduce you to my crimes

262
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,040
I am a pink

263
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,640
I am a pink

264
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:43,980
Pink

265
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,260
Pink

266
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,400
I pay my taxes

267
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,800
Pink

268
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,880
And I knowingly serve the blue mold from space

269
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,220
Just another angel, a blue mold from space

270
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,280
Just another angel, a blue mold from space

271
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,620
Just another spreader of light, a blue mold from space

272
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:13,620


273
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,080
I am here to pay your 있고

274
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,960
Just a contribution to this dangerous world

275
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:18,960


276
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,700
Just a contribution to the state of disgrace

277
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,120
I am a pink woman

278
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,120


279
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,120


280
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,120


281
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,600
And a fuck revolution of the whole human race

282
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,260
Just a B sí

283
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:25,800
Now, they make you forget

284
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,980
They make your eyes bleed

285
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,400
Now, they make you remember things you haven't seen

286
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,200
You're entitled to a new pain

287
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,760
Now, I look down you as your forebrain

288
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,440
So novel once with a television sc Felix

289
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,480
I live

290
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:38,780


291
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,780
It's ten times easier than beginning that

292
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,600
Simple review

293
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,900
Follow the craze that enslaves the billions!

294
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,300
It's the world's oldest, hip, new thing!

295
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,160
The blue moon from space needs an agent

296
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,700
To spread love, to pay our name

297
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,780
The brutal chokehold on our nation

298
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,320
Of spitting dead zombies' names

299
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,080
I am the blue moon from space

300
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,160
And those who have sought to slay me

301
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,940
Now serve me in high heels and an apron

302
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,860
Isn't that right, Mr. Kissinger?

303
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,260
I am fortunate to have many slaves

304
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,460
And those who obey without question

305
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,300
Feed me love and hate

306
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,640
In life-sustaining ways

307
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,860
I feed on those who don't think

308
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,300
I follow beasts on the crimes of the pink

309
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,820
The blue moon from space holds a station

310
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,380
To build up the human race

311
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,240
A hunger so patiently aged

312
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,020
It feeds on the people's laze

313
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,660
To the crimes of the pink

314
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,120
And I live by their lies

315
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,140
I am hidden everywhere

316
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,680
But I am never in disguise

317
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,420
And I despise the thought of freedom

318
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,700
In fact, anything that's free

319
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,100
And I suppress the will of beings

320
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,460
Who are thinking unlike me

321
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,900
I am the slime from your TV

322
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,360
The centerfold in Tiger Beach

323
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,280
I am the system that supports the cops

324
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,940
That beat you on the street

325
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,340
I am the mouths of politicians

326
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,620
Speaking anything but truth

327
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,300
I am the products cheaply purchased

328
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,760
By a disenfranchised youth

329
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,260
I am the drugs that keep you stupid

330
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,400
I keep fucking with your head

331
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,100
So don't forget to pay your bills

332
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,400
The day I finally make you dead

333
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,900
I am the reason everything you ever loved

334
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,980
Got shut down

335
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,840
Mine is the treason that's in season

336
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,860
On TV all year round

337
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,180
My camp's clear

338
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,460
You hear my voice and never know

339
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,080
I hate you fear

340
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,540
You're nearly all in my control

341
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,240
The blue mold from space needs an agent

342
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,580
To spread the two-panel name

343
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,920
The brutal chose hold on the nation

344
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,560
Of living dead zombies slain

345
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,900
I am alive

346
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,320
And I am thriving

347
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,700
On your streets and in your schools

348
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,380
I rep the fools and leave them writhing

349
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,400
In a lifetime made of stools

350
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,900
I am the fangor of the anti-slack

351
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,660
The ancient color of the black

352
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,120
The arm that holds the yeti back

353
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,660
A mindless force with no ball sack

354
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,560
I germ the people into sheep

355
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,660
All programmed to bleat and sleep

356
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,900
Robotic slaves who have to pay their way

357
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,520
To feel their own meat

358
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,480
I am crime with no mind so sublime

359
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,120
Mine is the time that destroys the divine

360
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,900
Just another agent of the blue mold from space

361
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,260
It's okay to be smart, and it's okay to do things intellectually, and it's also okay

362
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,940
to do things with a gut reaction, and it's also okay to combine the two.

363
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,620
And usually the way the media plays on the fears of the public, especially during the

364
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:59,160
50s and 60s, that anybody who had an IQ over 28, let's say, was probably a threat to the

365
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,480
community because, you know, a person who can think for himself is just liable to realize

366
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,760
that commercials don't mean anything and what they write in the newspaper is wrong,

367
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,780
you know, and it's fashionable to disparage people who are smart.

368
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:20,500
And the bad part about that is a lot of people who were born smart pretend to be dumb so

369
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,880
they can have friends, and that's a tragedy, you know.

370
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,960
I try and encourage people, if they are intelligent, to not be ashamed of it and go out and do

371
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,460
what you're going to do and forget about having friends and acting dumb in order to have friends.

372
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,080
Because those friends aren't going to do you any good anyway.

373
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,080
And if you know deep down in your heart that you are a dumb kind of a person, don't be

374
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,020
ashamed of it, you know.

375
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,080
That's the way you are.

376
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,840
Have a good time.

377
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,300
You're dumb.

378
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,340
You can sit in front of a television, drink beer and watch hockey and love it.

379
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,900
You have none of the problems of people who know more than you do because the more you

380
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,040
know the less you'll like it.

381
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,060
So everybody should be happy with what they got.

382
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,420
Frank Zappa, dear friends.

383
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,880
And before that...

384
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,440
That incredible...

385
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:09,200
That incredible song about the blue mold from space was, of course, the El Queso All

386
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,560
Stars.

387
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,760
And here is where...

388
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,740
Get that pencil ready.

389
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:20,080
Here is where you can get the information on the El Queso All Stars from www.soundclick.com.

390
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:27,580
And look for the band named Crotchless Leather Wheelchair.

391
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,780
Soundclick.com.

392
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,340
Crotchless Leather Wheelchair.

393
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,680
And now, friends, I'm going to let somebody else explain the church of the subgenius for

394
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,080
a change.

395
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,540
I'm going to let Jesus do it.

396
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:42,960
Jesus.

397
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:43,880
Jesus.

398
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,740
Yes, that Jesus was a guest.

399
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,640
Thank you, amino acids.

400
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:56,560
Jesus Christ, yeah, the one you're thinking of, was a guest on Baron Dave Rohn's Shockwave

401
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,980
Radio Theatre on KFAI in Minneapolis.

402
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,320
Tonight we have a very special guest.

403
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:03,320


404
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:03,320


405
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,280
Very special show for you.

406
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,400
Tonight we have Jesus.

407
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,280
Right.

408
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,960
Is that your cognomen?

409
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,140
Yeah, Reverend Jesus Christ of the Church of the Subgenius.

410
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:14,900
Okay.

411
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:15,940
And...

412
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,520
You can just call me Jesus or the Lord, Teacher, Messiah, King of Kings, JC.

413
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,060
JC, one of those.

414
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,960
And the Subgenius is an organization, the Subgenius Foundation, is it?

415
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,460
Right.

416
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,600
The Subgenius Foundation is more of the...

417
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,300
I'm the CFO of the Subgenius Foundation.

418
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,300


419
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,580
I'm the CFO of the Subgenius Foundation, which is sort of the capitalistic branch of the

420
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,840
Church of the Subgenius.

421
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:43,260
The Church of the Subgenius is actually the religion around it.

422
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,780
I mostly just run sort of the t-shirt and book selling side of it.

423
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:53,780
I brought the money, the tax collectors and change collectors back into the church, actually,

424
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,140
I feel.

425
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:54,800
I see.

426
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,240
So you righted the table.

427
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:56,860
Exactly.

428
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,140
Okay, well there, that works.

429
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:58,640
That works.

430
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,140
And you can perform marriages.

431
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,320
That's true.

432
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,320


433
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,900
Well, anyone who's ordained in our church, we have a much like, different than many other

434
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,860
religions, we have a $2 fee.

435
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,140
We have a triple year money back.

436
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,680
That's been our role in the years.

437
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:23,320
Anyone who's ordained in our self-referred church, which you can...

438
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,760
Okay, no money.

439
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,780
You can't say money, but you can say the website.

440
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,360
www.subgenius.com.

441
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,100
But all of our reverends.

442
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:32,840
I've had one that's on board.

443
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,040
We're all on board.

444
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,940
feelings, we'll marry you to anyone or anything.

445
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,160
We don't really have any laws.

446
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,920
I could marry to your wallet, to your Dr. Demento hat.

447
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,940
Well, there you go.

448
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,120
Okay.

449
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,660
Has that been auctioned off?

450
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,380
That's been auctioned off.

451
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,840
The Dr. Demento top hat that's on my website, Rome.org, R-O-M-M.

452
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
That was auctioned off at MarsCon.

453
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,740
I got to wear it briefly and it was special.

454
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,600
I could marry to your radio station.

455
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,560
In fact, I could marry everyone to everyone.

456
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,300
How did you happen to become an organist?

457
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


458
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


459
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:08,940
a messiah. Was that just a calling? Yeah, it was more of a calling. It was sort of an accident. I

460
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,760
sort of fell into it. I was mowing the lawn of Reverend Ivan Stang, who is kind of given the

461
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,060
credit of founding the Church of the Subgenius. Actually, J.R. Bob Dobbs is the founder, but

462
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:28,520
Reverend Stang sort of has picked up the word. And one day, almost like a miracle, I received a

463
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,480
call from J.R. Bob Dobbs, and he said to come work for the church in Dallas, Texas. We now,

464
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:39,980
of course, are located in Austin, Texas. You know, a lot of moving. The church tends to stay

465
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:47,940
on its feet, you know, just to avoid FBI, CIA, and such. But yeah, it was sort of a revelation

466
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:53,660
one day when we realized that, you know, my personal divinity and my calling to save the

467
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,380
Church of the Subgenius from financial ruin. I see. So did you have to get

468
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:58,500
the call from J.R. Bob Dobbs? Yeah, I did. I got the call from J.R. Bob Dobbs. I got the call from

469
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:58,680
J.R. Bob Dobbs. I got the call from J.R. Bob Dobbs. I got the call from J.R. Bob Dobbs. I got the call from

470
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,680
dunked or shaken or whatever branch that is. We have, well, within the church, we have what we

471
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:10,220
call Bob-tisms, which are usually done nude with a lot of people present during our X-Day

472
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:17,980
festival. But personally, no, there's no light, no blinding light from Bob. There was just simply

473
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,580
a phone call, and he said, hey, you're Jesus, and by the way, I'd like you to come work for me.

474
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,000
That's pretty much how it all started, yeah. How many disciples do you have?

475
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,880
Well, not many.

476
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,180
You see, the strange thing is once I realized that I was the Lord and my own divinity,

477
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,040
I kind of looked back at history and what had happened before.

478
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,100
I said, where?

479
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,160
This is perfect.

480
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,720
If I just stay within the Church of the Subgenius amongst the disbelievers and the blasphemers of the world,

481
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,440
no one will ever find me and perhaps I could sort of sneak out.

482
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,060
And this is my 33rd year of life and this is the year it's supposed to happen.

483
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:57,580
And I'm hoping that because I'm around the disbelievers that I won't get nailed to the stick this time.

484
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,500
So I have very few disciples because really no one does truly believe that I am the Lord.

485
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,680
And as long as I can keep that low profile, I think I'll be okay.

486
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:10,160
Well, do you want to go through the same experience that the other one is going through?

487
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,180
No, absolutely not.

488
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,340
Absolutely not.

489
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,540
I've been promised by Bob.

490
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,480
Now, I know you don't know a lot about our philosophy.

491
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,180
Not a lot.

492
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,040
We believe that on July 5th, this year, the world will come to us.

493
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:27,040
And all the saved subgeniuses, that is those of the non-human race, those of the subgenius race,

494
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,000
will be taken up aboard the space vessels of the sex goddesses.

495
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,600
And I, too, am supposed to have a front seat ticket on that space vessel.

496
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,280
And hopefully then I won't have to go through the whipping and the bleeding.

497
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,600
And, you know, you've seen The Passion.

498
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,640
Well, I've heard about it.

499
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,160
Yeah, me too.

500
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,440
It's a relatively well-known story.

501
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,220
Yeah.

502
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,860
Been around for a while.

503
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,800
Been around for a while.

504
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,980
So what is your philosophy?

505
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,180
I mean, how do you, do you, what are some of your major holidays?

506
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,100
Well, our main holiday is X-Day.

507
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,800
That would be the end of the world.

508
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,080
That is July 5th at 7 a.m.

509
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,680
And this is, I believe, the sixth time that we've predicted the end of the world.

510
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,860
And it hasn't happened.

511
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,220
So that puts us right up with some of the greatest.

512
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,660
That's true.

513
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,640
We're up with the Millerites, yes.

514
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:09,940
Yeah.

515
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,400
So we're hoping this time, you know, maybe after we get seven or eight, you know,

516
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,720
we can get even better than, like, let's say the Jehovah Witnesses or, you know, the Seventh-day Adventists, you know.

517
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,740
But X-Day is our main holiday that we have.

518
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,980
There are some other ones in there, St. Janer's Day and such.

519
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:33,300
I've always advocated that a subgenius holiday should happen exactly five days after the conspiracy holiday,

520
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,900
so you can hit all the good sales.

521
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,100
But, you know, that's not necessarily caught on yet.

522
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,780
And is there any sort of dietary restrictions?

523
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,440
No, no.

524
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,900
Subgenius will eat just about near anything, I'll tell you.

525
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,700
Well, our group...

526
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,800
Our group is very eclectic.

527
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:58,580
It is a group of people who seriously believe almost nothing or those who will believe just about anything.

528
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:06,680
The philosophy itself is based on the shifty, sandy beaches of hypocrisy.

529
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,700
We're one of the few churches, and this is what lacks in religion today, Barron,

530
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,520
is we're one of the few religions that not only lie, but we tell you the truth about it.

531
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,500
The rest of them are going to lie to you.

532
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,880
We're the only ones that are going to honestly tell you right now we're lying to you.

533
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,960
So, kind of make the philosophy up as you go.

534
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,960
That's pretty unique. It's true.

535
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,800
Most of them just sort of say, well, this is the truth in various forms,

536
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,300
and whether they're lying or not, they'll just claim it's the truth.

537
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:34,860
Correct.

538
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:42,500
One of the things that Bob has always told us is that pretty much if you say it, it is the law.

539
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,380
You know, whatever it is that you truly want to believe.

540
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,600
Um...

541
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:46,960
It...

542
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,520
Well...

543
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,580
Bob once said to us, you'll pay to know what you really think.

544
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,060
And really, that's where it's based in.

545
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,920
We also have the fundamental belief in slack.

546
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:57,740
Slack.

547
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:05,520
And that is, yes, the non-ending chase for fulfillment of your own personal dreams, whatever that may be.

548
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,780
Which they should cut you.

549
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,500
Yes.

550
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,360
And you should get...

551
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,300
Everyone should cut you some slack, right?

552
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:10,860
That's right.

553
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,700
But in the meantime, here is an apropos song.

554
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,840
This is Jesus Jr.

555
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,460
Jesus Jr.

556
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,720
His grandpa is the Lord.

557
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,740
Jesus Jr.

558
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,040
He drives a big white Ford.

559
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,940
Jesus Jr.

560
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,100
He takes his dad's advice.

561
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,100
Jesus Jr.

562
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,460
The country of Western Christ.

563
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,960
Well, he was born in Tennessee, not somewhere out in Galilee.

564
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,780
His dad got his at Calvary, and his mom works at the grocery.

565
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,740
Jesus Jr.

566
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,440
His grandpa is...

567
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:47,800
The Lord.

568
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,860
Jesus Jr.

569
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,260
He drives a big white Ford.

570
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,020
Jesus Jr.

571
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,060
His grandma marries Joy.

572
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,440
Father, son, and a holy good old boy.

573
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,560
Well, Jr.

574
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,240
Takes his name in vain when folks abuse the passing lane.

575
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,480
And at his favorite bar main, the only thing he'll raise is cane.

576
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,040
Jesus Jr.

577
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,280
His grandpa is the Lord.

578
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,220
Jesus Jr.

579
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,560
He drives a big white Ford.

580
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,380
Jesus Jr.

581
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,580
At least he's not a Jew.

582
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,760
Ten for Satan, his rig's passing you.

583
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,640
Now if his wheels get stuck in mud, he'll part that shoulder like the flood.

584
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,860
And when he drives on, he stir but his left hand signals dripping blood.

585
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,600
Jesus Jr.

586
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,640
His grandpa is the Lord.

587
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,260
Jesus Jr.

588
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,260


589
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,320
Got mudguards on his big white Ford.

590
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,860
Jesus Jr.

591
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,880
He takes his dad's advice.

592
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,020
Jesus Jr.

593
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,420
The country-western Christ.

594
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,460
Jesus Jr.

595
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,580
The country-western Christ.

596
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,900
Oh yes dear friends, Jesus Jr.

597
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,400
By the Cab City Combo.

598
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,600
there with Jesus on Baron Dave Rohn's show,

599
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,800
Shockwave Radio Theater,

600
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,180
Praise KFAI in Minneapolis where we got that tape,

601
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,500
and now also relating to X Day, friends,

602
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,440
some live revival recordings

603
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,460
from the Beachland Ballroom Cathedral

604
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,160
in Cleveland, Ohio.

605
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,100
Yes, dear friends.

606
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,320
Friends, well, I sure hope to see y'all at X Day this year

607
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,140
because the world will end.

608
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,240
We've let the pinks get off real easy.

609
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,460
We let them think it was gonna be that easy.

610
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,840
We let them think we were just a bunch of kooks.

611
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,100
We let the Jehovah's Witnesses out kook us

612
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,020
for a minute there, friends.

613
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,540
But I know that you are true subgeniuses

614
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,920
and you know that the world ends tomorrow.

615
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,400
Tomorrow!

616
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,900
And you may die.

617
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,540
Are you living your life as if the world ends tomorrow?

618
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,100
That's what I have to ask you.

619
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,060
Are you ready for X Day?

620
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,140
What if we don't know what year this is?

621
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:26,620
Obviously.

622
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,860
Bob Dobbs predicted the world would end July 5th, 1998.

623
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,380
Obviously.

624
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
It ain't 1998 yet.

625
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,420
Tomorrow might be July 5th, 1998.

626
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,720
Are you ready?

627
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,720
Have you gotten right with Bob?

628
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,240
But, friends, let's get practical.

629
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,700
This X Day, we're gonna be out there at Brushwood

630
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,920
partying like usual, waiting for the world to end.

631
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,400
On Monday!

632
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,440
July 5th happens to land on a Monday this year.

633
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,060
This puts some of us, you would think,

634
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,560
in some sort of a predicament.

635
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,000
Well, I mean, people go,

636
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,380
well, I'll celebrate this cataclysmic judgment

637
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,020
of all.

638
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,220
And I'll celebrate this cataclysmic judgment

639
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:14,220


640
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,620
But then I've got to get up and go to work in the morning.

641
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Oh, yeah.

642
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,240
You gotta, just, just in case

643
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,600
the Xs fail to arrive at 7 a.m.,

644
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
like last time,

645
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,940
I better make sure and be at my job on Monday.

646
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:31,660
Backsliders!

647
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,640
Backsliders, all friends,

648
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,960
sometimes I feel alone.

649
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,060
When you go to work on July 5th,

650
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,480
it's like you stabbed Bob in the back

651
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,780
and twist that knife.

652
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,860
It hurts Bob as much as jacking off

653
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,840
hurts the baby Jesus, friends.

654
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,600
Because you know as well as I do

655
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,060
that the subgenius cannot be ruptured

656
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,780
up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

657
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,000
while he's clocked in working for the conspiracy.

658
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,040
You can't be ruptured if you're clocked in.

659
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,520
Are you going to let your stinking earth job

660
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,800
come before eternal salvation?

661
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,180
Why should you?

662
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,740
Do you really think that that job is still going to be there?

663
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,680
Friends, look,

664
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,360
it's not like we have that many religious holidays.

665
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,740
We only have the one, X day, July 5th.

666
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,360
That's our main religious holiday.

667
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,760
So get off work and get paid!

668
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,100
Claim July 5th as your religious holiday.

669
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,960
Go out to Brushwood and spend the whole day

670
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,700
fropping, drinking, lazing around,

671
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,460
listening to music,

672
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:41,460


673
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:41,460


674
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,460
and trying to get laid somehow.

675
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,360
You should insist on this

676
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
or else you are pink,

677
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,440
dead to Bob, friends.

678
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,340
You're dead to Bob.

679
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,320
If you can't get off earth,

680
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,760
at least get off work.

00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,820
No, no, no, the Don

725
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,120
You mean the Department of the Navy?

726
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,920
No, Donnie, I'm looking for those shots I promised

727
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,060
Abu Ghraib is gonna be your final grave

728
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,300
Better get inside before curfew

729
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,920
Better not chain your neck

730
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,900
Better not do the best old heck

731
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,780
Abu Ghraib is gonna be your final resting place

732
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,740
Your final resting place

733
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,600
Your final resting place

734
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,540
Your final resting place

735
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,940
We don't even practice

736
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,880
We don't even talk fancifully

737
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,040
And because abi...

738
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,360
See that man side of us

739
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:35,360


740
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:35,360


741
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,140
A little bit better than mine.

742
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,040
This damn, real bad.

743
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:46,460
As far as you're concerned,

744
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,320
you bet he wasn't awesome though.

745
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,700
And today's theход squirrel you're going to see

746
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,160
on the Mainwan ув Corfu Now.

747
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,720
Stop quitin', that hoot.

748
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:59,520
Stop cutin'. Up, down, down.

749
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,620
right here. Everybody's got a dollar bill. There's a very simple thing. There's an eye. We've all

750
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:09,320
looked at the goddamn eye in the pyramid. Everybody says, oh, there's an eye in the pyramid. Oh, it's

751
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:14,400
an Illuminati conspiracy. No, it just means one thing. It means that eye, every time you do anything

752
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,160
with money, that eye gets to watch. That eye gets to see what you do. So what we're doing right here

753
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:26,560
is very, very simple. And don't tell people about this unless you think they're going to do it.

754
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:35,120
Very simple. You take it. You blot out the eye. Okay. This goes back to the fucking emerald

755
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:41,860
tablets of Hermes Trimestigus. As above, so below. Jesus himself said, he said, what is bound on

756
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:47,060
earth is bound in heaven. When you blot out that eye, you're removing this dollar bill from the

757
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:54,240
watchful eye of Jehovah one. This dollar bill is no longer in his service. It's not defacing the

758
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,540
dollar bill because there's no face attached to that. It's not defacing the dollar bill because

759
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:02,540
it's not in that eye. That is a faceless eye. So all we are doing is eliminating something that has

760
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:08,580
been watching you since you figured out what money was for. There's an old Italian saying, money is

761
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:12,700
the devil's shit. Anybody that's got a dollar bill, I want you to come right up here, take this

762
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:18,300
Sharpie and blot out the eye. And I want you to hold that dollar bill because I'm going to talk

763
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:23,380
to you about this dollar bill in just a couple of minutes. I want you to blot out the eye. This man

764
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,520
right here has the Sharpie. Come up to him when he's done with it. He's going to come up to you

765
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,620
and he's going to say, I want you to take that Sharpie and you blot out the eye because I got to

766
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:34,240
talk to you. But I'm going to get to that in just a minute because I have a few other things I have

767
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,800
to talk to you about. Just a few other things. Well, I have just actually really one thing, one

768
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:48,800
simple basic message to share with you this evening. I can actually cut it down to three

769
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,700
words. Three words. And maybe some people don't want to hear those three words, but those three

770
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,280
words right now they are, fuck you.

771
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:08,360
Bob. Fuck you, Bob. I can extend it to four words. Fuck you, Bob Dobbs. But that's really

772
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:16,820
belaboring the point. The thing is, is Bob Dobbs is not a representative of a representative

773
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:26,440
sample of the subgeniusality. We, we are not the peers of Bob Dobbs. We are not

774
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:35,140
even his pupils. We are nothing like Bob Dobbs. Everybody look at Bob Dobbs tonight. That's one

775
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:41,660
of the things you may or may not have realized in the course of staring because you're supposed to

776
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,160
do this. I don't know if you people know this, but if you're in the church of the subgenius,

777
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,100
you've got to look at the Dobbs head once in a while. But when you look at the Dobbs head,

778
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,040
eventually it's going to occur to you. That is not me.

779
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:11,240
Bob Dobbs is nothing like the subgenius and the subgenius is nothing like Bob. The subgenius is not

780
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:19,280
lucky like Bob Dobbs is lucky. Bob Dobbs makes a million dollars every time he fucks up. I fuck up

781
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,280
all the time and I still haven't gotten my million dollars.

782
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:56,520
The subgenius is not good looking like Bob Dobbs. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that. The subgenius is not good looking like Bob Dobbs. The subgenius is not rich like Bob Dobbs. Bob Dobbs has so much money that he doesn't need things like money. Bob Dobbs has true wealth. He also has infinite slack. So things like money, he doesn't really even understand. That doesn't prevent him from making money.

783
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:25,760
He doesn't understand the tremendous quantities of money. But Bob Dobbs doesn't understand money. So we're not rich like Bob. We're not popular like Bob. We're not lucky like Bob. We're not good looking like Bob. We don't party with the rich and the famous like Bob Dobbs does. Bob Dobbs lives a very, very different life than you and I.

784
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:56,120
Frankly, Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs is kind of boring. Bob Dobbs wears a tie and I don't mean to detract from man in any way when I say that because man does wear a tie. But Bob Dobbs wears a tie all the time. Have you ever seen Bob Dobbs without a tie on? And do you know what a tie is? A tie is a noose. A tie means you are tied.

785
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:24,820
A tie means you are tied.

786
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:47,080
A tie means you are tied.

787
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:14,420
The subgenius don't care about you. The grays don't care about you. The conspiracy. Well, the conspiracy at least knows you exist, but I wouldn't exactly say they have your best interests in mind.

788
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:23,700
And what about the church of the subgenius? Does the church of the subgenius care about you?

789
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,480
I can't.

790
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:44,000
I can't actually answer that question unless you've paid your $30. And maybe you have paid your $30. Maybe you have renounced the works of the conspiracy. Maybe you do fuck them that cannot take the jokes.

791
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:56,500
Maybe you have pulled the wool over your own eyes. Maybe you do not settle. You do not settle for not understanding.

792
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,040
Maybe you have pulled the wool over your own eyes. Maybe you do not settle for not understanding.

793
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,520
You say, I want too much because I am a subgenius and too much is better than not enough.

794
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:14,160
Well, let me tell you, there's an old lesson and the Buddha taught this lesson and I hate to bring other religions into it because I hate them just as much as I hate Bob Dobbs, but I'm going to bring it in.

795
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:26,500
The Buddha, he said, do not mistake. Do not mistake the Buddha's finger for the moon at which it is. Do not mistake the Buddha's finger for the moon at which it is. Do not mistake the Buddha's finger for the moon at which it is.

796
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:49,300
Do not mistake the Buddha's finger for the moon at which it is. Do not mistake the Buddha's finger for the moon at which it is.

797
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:07,320
These are tools. We take them. We use them. We set them aside and then we sell them to other people for more than we paid, right?

798
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,920
We sell them to what? Suckers, right?

799
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,420
We're suckers too though, right?

800
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:26,300
I mean, I hate to be the one to point this out, but the deal didn't go through.

801
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:43,040
The exists, they didn't show, or if they did show, they sure as hell didn't take me because I'm right here and no offense to most of the people in this room, but this doesn't exactly look like a pleasure saucer to me.

802
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,520
Thank you.

803
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:57,720
Thank you.

804
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,540
And now, a lesson from Paul Carr.

805
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:12,960
Language lesson number 14. Please listen quietly so that you may repeat.

806
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:18,380
I'm going to school to learn to dispense bathroom products for a major corporation.

807
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,820
I would like some of that chicken. Give it here.

808
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,360
I'm willing to pay with Federal Reserve notes.

809
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,880
from a friendly western nation nearest you.

810
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,840
Dear General Vasquez,

811
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,060
I have decided to become your special friend.

812
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,140
It will be different this time, not like before.

813
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,220
Granny never had nothing on Joey Two Fingers,

814
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,420
so the law caught up with us in Tupelo.

815
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,260
We finally scored enough PCP to break out of jail.

816
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,520
We ate beans and cornbread while we were on the lam.

817
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,640
Grandpa had a head full of methamphetamines

818
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,840
when he broke into the paint store in Jackson.

819
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,260
My corporation is one of the largest in the country,

820
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,300
and I have one of the biggest houses in town.

821
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,000
Do I look good in my new church choir robe?

822
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,960
It makes me feel special.

823
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,080
I purchased it at a leading retail outlet in your local community,

824
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,040
but I stole the shoes in Florida.

825
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,700
I support the religion of my choice

826
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,800
and encourage you to do the same.

827
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,620
Just make sure you can still use it.

828
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,740
You'll meet me in the clock tower with your deer rifle.

829
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,900
Arbeit macht frei.

830
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,280
Scheiß Kopf, mein Kampf.

831
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,920
Diesel ist mein Kopf.

832
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,240
Meine Buttsplitter ist eine Buttsplitter.

833
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,480
Das Sudetthandland ist mein.

834
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:39,340
Nein.

835
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,120
Ich habe das Sudetthandland.

836
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:41,840
Nein.

837
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,840
Gehen Sie aus.

838
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,660
Dieser Land ist mein Land.

839
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,480
Gehen Sie aus.

840
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,980
Ist Treblinka oder Auschwitz vor Sie?

841
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,900
Das ist ausgezeich.

842
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,140
In 1861,

843
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,320
Johnny Everett fought in the Civil War,

844
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,900
which he started himself in his own garage.

845
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,520
Johnny was twice decorated and eventually remodeled.

846
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,560
My next-door neighbor likes to run his lawnmower early in the morning.

847
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,420
Soon, this will cost him his life.

848
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,860
Hello Zippy.

849
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,180
Don't be afraid.

850
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,800
Just get out of the car.

851
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,600
Do you know General Vasquez?

852
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,440
He's excited to meet you.

853
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,820
Mr. Weinstein was calling us about the rent.

854
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,000
When we drove off the side of the bridge outside of Tunica.

855
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:31,120
I was the only survivor of that gruesome crash, but we got the rent paid on time.

856
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:34,880
Although when we got home, my son-in-law had burned the place down on purpose.

857
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:41,280
I recently purchased a giant motorcycle and all the latest bike apparel.

858
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:47,340
It is very loud, but I enjoy showing off on Sunday when people want to relax in the quiet.

859
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,540
I hope no one drops me with some piano wire.

860
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,120
I love getting my welfare check.

861
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:55,400
It's great.

862
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,860
On the first of the month, I go down to the Pier 1 and just go crazy.

863
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,420
I want to visit the South sometime.

864
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,560
They say the blues music is great down there.

865
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,520
I love blues music.

866
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,560
I also like the sound of my washing machine.

867
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,180
A very good class today.

868
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:16,500
You are much better than that other bunch of retards.

869
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,520
That amazing little guy is a great guy.

870
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:20,520


871
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:20,520


872
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:20,520


873
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:20,520


874
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:20,520


875
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:20,520


876
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,020
The last little piece there was by Paul Carr.

877
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:28,600
You can get more of that at www.groovehandle.com.

878
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:41,600
And now, Philo, Howell, and Don Joyce taking over the Puzzling Evidence show on KPFA at Berkeley.

879
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,880
That's a stubby index finger now, right?

880
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,720
It comes from stubby K.

881
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,280
Hollywood vet.

882
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,340
Tapping out a code.

883
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:57,180
That stubby index finger looking like a toad.

884
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,240
You don't need to make explicit what should be implicit.

885
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:05,580
We may be sending out coded signals, but we should not actually refer to it.

886
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,680
Remember that movie, Evil Roy Slade with John Astin?

887
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,860
Yes, Evil Roy Slade.

888
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,920
Another role model for today's disaffected youth.

889
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:19,200
Today's tormented teens need to look to an authority figure of some kind.

890
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,720
Evil Judge Roy Slade.

891
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:26,600
You do remember the song Stubby Index Finger as sung by Artie Johnson and Mickey Rooney?

892
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:36,040
Well, I remember the ad for Six Finger, an artificial finger which infants could use to confound their peers and superiors.

893
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:40,380
Mickey Rooney, a character in Evil Roy Slade, had worn his finger.

894
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:44,740
I even remember the theme song associated with licensing and sales of that particular product.

895
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,820
Well, they call them telegraph operators.

896
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:53,060
And he had tapped out a code to such a degree that he had worn his finger down to the second knuckle.

897
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:59,880
A pale shadow of his former self with worn fingers eliciting stares of pity from anonymous passers-by.

898
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,460
They called it the Stubby Index Finger.

899
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:06,860
But I call it a damn shame, a waste of good premium talent.

900
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:15,020
And another subgenius, a possible god upon this earth, goes down into garbage-strewn ignominy.

901
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:15,820
Ignominy.

902
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:16,620
Ignominy.

903
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,400
Yep.

904
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,180
I've been in ignominy before.

905
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,640
And ignomaxi, too.

906
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,620
Have you been to ignominy? That's in Oklahoma, isn't it?

907
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:27,160
Well, I went to ignominy falls, you know, where they have the mounds.

908
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,720
The Indian mounds, right?

909
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,780
Yeah, it was an Indian mound. I went up on it and I fell off.

910
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,920
And you did it while you were up on it, right?

911
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:41,600
Oh, that's why I went up on it, but I dood it after I fell off.

912
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,840
And she was with you that one time.

913
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,240
I say, leave her out of it.

914
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:52,400
Well, that's what she said, too. Leave me out of it. You couldn't stop.

915
00:54:52,580 --> 00:55:07,460
It seems I hear the voices of disembodied phantoms whispering sinful secrets in my ears, calling me, and tempting me to leave the safe confines of this brightly lit warm room and advance after them into outer darkness.

916
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,520
In other news, a suitcase was stomped on.

917
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:11,100
By an ape I saw on TV.

918
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,240
A hideous ape.

919
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,620
The hideous ape that's within all of us.

920
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,160
With its fur bristling and its moist fur.

921
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,660
And its nostrils palpitating.

922
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:21,700
Reverend Howe, you have a hideous ape within you, just as I do.

923
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:39,620
Yes, as Dr. Henry Jekyll proved, the inward primitive, the enactment of the libido in the phenotype is always waiting to burst forth in an absurdly rapid morphogenesis or lycanthropic transformation.

924
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:45,660
I feel like once a day, libido, rapidly executing the libido is a good thing to do.

925
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:56,940
For many years, alchemists have asked themselves where the enormous source of energy needed to force the lycanthropic transformation may be located.

926
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:03,200
And where is that spot, that physical location within the human body?

927
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:13,360
Modern double-domed scientists point with pride to the peen gland, latest discovery and source of this mysterious transformative energy.

928
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,240
The mysterious peen gland.

929
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:15,640
Ah.

930
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,900
Sometimes the peen gland goes, well, a little haywire.

931
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,360
And not to be confused...

932
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:29,860
And you have terrible evolutionary accidents like Gregor Samsa, who transformed utterly far beyond his capacity and became...

933
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:32,080
And that's not to be confused with the peen worm.

934
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:43,660
The peen worm is an early stage of the formation and in general goes through several other metamorphic states.

935
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,060
This is great, Dr. Howe.

936
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,300
I can do rim shots.

937
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,920
These are the wrong slides.

938
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,160
I'm terribly sorry.

939
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,580
This is supposed to be the life cycle of the peen worm.

940
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:52,920
Can you say rim shot on the radio?

941
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,920
I don't know where these slides came from.

942
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,980
I think that's one of the bad words, rim shot.

943
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,840
They're most interesting though.

944
00:56:58,980 --> 00:56:59,940
Rim something.

945
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,880
That's what they call this activity.

946
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:03,620
Something about a rim.

947
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:03,620


948
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,120
Really, it is unfortunate.

949
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,920
I don't know where these slides came from, but...

950
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,040
Is that a slide?

951
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:09,900
I thought that...

952
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:10,140
Oh.

953
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,820
I thought that was...

954
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,960
Now I'm going to...

955
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,880
Something far worse.

956
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:14,580
...fame more for shot slides.

957
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,040
Well, now I'm going to...

958
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,040


959
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,040


960
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,040


961
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,040


962
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:21,220
...put the ends of the microscope closer toward the slide and we will see come into

963
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:32,940
focus the mitochondria and the rubroid bodies at the end of spiroglobulus replicating internally

964
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,760
until fainting in coils...

965
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,180
Wow, look at them fainting.

966
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:38,680
...stephosis is achieved.

967
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,460
Look at them fading in coils.

968
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,020
Now the cell membrane divides multiple...

969
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:45,020
I'm sorry.

970
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:45,020


971
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:45,020


972
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:49,660
...supplies and conquers and another stapotic essence is released.

973
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:57,720
Stapotic essence is one which you can create your own psychoactive tones within your head

974
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,040
by...

975
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,520
The act of...

976
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,360
...minority...

977
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:00,960
...generating...

978
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,100
...or psychogenic...

979
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,440
...alpha pacing the triple...

980
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,780
...it is simple to explain.

981
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,960
...stillness that you can explore...

982
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,640
Here we see three ordinary meters of light.

983
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,180
...from within your own mind.

984
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,020
The one on the left...

985
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,480
...will call the control...

986
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:14,800
...place where...

987
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,000
...the control...

988
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,000


989
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,000


990
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,000


991
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,900
...where the body...

992
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,460
...meets...

993
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,860
...the eye...

994
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,100
...as it were.

995
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:28,340
Yes, friends, stephosis, where the body meets the eye and behind the ear where it's been

996
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:31,360
hearing this horrible show, Hour of Slack.

997
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:37,400
Friends, you can get more information about the Hour of Slack from www.subgenius.com.

998
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,600
Praise the amino acids for that background music.

999
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:45,520
Oh yes.

1000
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:57,760
And you can reach Bob by writing for free information from Post Office Box 204206, Austin,

1001
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,000
Texas 78720.

1002
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:08,700
Or write www.subgenius.com.

1003
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,420
I'm a mountain man.

1004
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,800
Look at me shoot this here beaver.

1005
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:14,760
See?

1006
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:14,980
Wow.

1007
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:14,980


1008
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:14,980


1009
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:14,980


1010
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:14,980


1011
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:14,980


1012
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:14,980


1013
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:14,980


1014
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:14,980


1015
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:14,980


1016
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:14,980


1017
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:22,100
I did it. I'll eat it with some corn pone. Ain't no woman could hold me down. It's the mountain life.
