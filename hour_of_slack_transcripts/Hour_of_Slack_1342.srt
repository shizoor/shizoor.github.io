1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Nobody feels really bad around Bob unless you get bit by a

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,520
You'll finally get to see why they call me Bob.

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,520
What, you got something against a warm welcome?

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,380
No, no, just, just has been a long time, that's all, and, well, people change.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,900
Have I changed?

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,660
Maybe.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,120
What are you getting at, man?

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,520
Maybe.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,320
Maybe.

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,180
The bobbing boy nearly floats away.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,080
But bounces back like a man.

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:33,700
Mostly.

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,260
Keep it running!

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,120
Okay, Bob, we're ready for the lob.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,660
Bobbing to the surface.

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,240
That's what I like to see!

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,460
You're saying that the reason that you're not doing the job that I'm paying you to do is...

18
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,560
Bobbing to the surface.

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,840
That you don't have a job to do?

20
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:52,440
No.

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,160
Is that what you're saying?

22
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,060
What are you trying to convince me of, exactly?

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,420
That you're as useless as an arsehole right here?

24
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,540
Well, guess what, buddy.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,460
I think you just n***a convinced me.

26
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:11,340
Are we all in a continual cycle of birth and rebirth, simply interchanging bodies as we go?

27
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,540
And if so, this raises yet another question.

28
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,960
Do we get to choose?

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,420
I mean, who was I before I was who I am now, and who will I be next?

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,560
Could I be you?

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,620
Now that is definitely weird.

32
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,480
What?

33
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,780
Weird is our specialty.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,280
Bill.

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,040
Thanks, the large.

36
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:39,120
Friends, this is hour of slack number 1,342, and it's being assembled under weird conditions.

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:49,100
By the time you hear this, we'll probably be back in Cleveland Bluffs, Ohio, but in my pre-recorded time, it's just before Existlessnessmas.

38
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:58,720
And Princess Wee and I are at Stang Ranch, Stangsville, Stang County, Texas, to which we brought both rain for the dry, dry earth,

39
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,780
and a really...

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,980
Unpredictable disease.

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,280
Like a cold, but different for each person.

42
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,980
A subgenius contagion for the poor normals.

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,220
Unfortunately, we also infected all the subgeniuses who let us stay at their homes on the way driving down here.

44
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:22,740
Potter and Petal, Suds and Pisces, Legume and Pockets, Susie the Floozy, Pope Sternodox, and Dr. Cooler.

45
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,100
We're so contagious that we could infect people just by looking at them, just by being heard.

46
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,380
In fact, we might do a whole show just about the disease.

47
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,540
You can contract it by radio waves.

48
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:47,300
And also, we might do a thing about our travels through the bucolic rural towns like Dierks and Dequeen in Arkansas.

49
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,380
Dequeen has a dairy, Dequeen.

50
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,220
It really does.

51
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:59,120
But this show, I had to assemble on Princess Wee's laptop using Pappy's guest room as a studio.

52
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,040
And this location mic and minimal software.

53
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,120
Hence the tinny sound of the background music by the psychoskeletons.

54
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:16,500
But I shan't resort to reruns yet because people keep sending us new stuff and it beats editing in a hotel room or the iVan.

55
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,440
Coming up, we have Reverend Exister's dense mashup, Ship of State Part 2.

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,200
Some puzzling evidence from KPFA Berkeley with Dr. Philodruman and Dr. Howell versus the callers.

57
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,620
A somewhat late Christmas Bob hymn by Popes Pantiera Ivakovich.

58
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,140
A rip-roaring rant by Reverend Frodus Suds Pasha, who also mixed Pantiera's fine piece.

59
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:49,420
And best of all, probably, the very beginning of Reverend Penn Jillette's reading of his book, God Know.

60
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,580
That audio book is fantastic.

61
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,160
And Penn Jillette really is a long-time subgenius minister.

62
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,080
I'm not going to play.

63
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,680
I'm not going to play his whole book because then you wouldn't be tempted to buy it.

64
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,960
And I'm just tempting you to do that very thing by playing the intro to it.

65
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,940
It's really something.

66
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,380
It makes me jealous as hell.

67
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,420
And I'm going to have to bleep the heck out of it for our beloved broadcast stations.

68
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,020
The internet version has all the cussing intact.

69
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:25,800
But first, some radio synesthesia that is very timely here in the past, if not there in the future.

70
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,080
Dr. Sinister does radio.

71
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,180
This is Radio Synesthesia Sunday nights at 10 Eastern, right after your hour of slack on WCSB in Cleveland.

72
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,420
You can hear it at WCSB.org.

73
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:44,020
Last Sunday, my time, I called in from Stang Ranch and Lonesome Cowboy Dave called in and Governor Rocknar and others.

74
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,460
And at that time, it had some timely discussions.

75
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,580
All old in your now.

76
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,120
So the very first thing we'll do on this hour of slack is end it.

77
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,860
We're running out of time here.

78
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,800
So I want to make sure we have at least one more line open.

79
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,760
So, Joe, I've got to let you go real quick.

80
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,100
We're a time control cult.

81
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,880
We're running out of time.

82
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,940
We're not really running out of time.

83
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,100
We're running out of the concept within this context.

84
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,780
Yes, you're right.

85
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,260
Good point.

86
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,020
We're running out of time.

87
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:23,780
There's a little known and very deliberately ignored pithy phrase by Bob, which is that

88
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,440
the only method of time control available.

89
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,880
To us is patience.

90
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,820
Until I go back to 16 months, whatever you want.

91
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,880
I'm ready for action.

92
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,220
Well, good.

93
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,060
Get to it.

94
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,540
You've got to get to it.

95
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,100
Oh, boy.

96
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,360
Oh, boy.

97
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,720
Am I going to get to it?

98
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,500
Believe me.

99
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,600
Any minute now.

100
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,640
And the message is 351, phones number to call if you'd like to get in.

101
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,780
And now the world may end and you may not.

102
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,400
I forgot.

103
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,880
You may die that you may die and you may not.

104
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,540
I remember.

105
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,940
And you may be wishing for death.

106
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,560
Yeah, may is written in a much bigger font.

107
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,400
Mm-hmm.

108
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,400
And welcome.

109
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,540
Not everybody notices that.

110
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,560
Welcome to the program, skeptic.

111
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,140
Especially when we're not running around coconuts without any shoes.

112
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,520
You know, some of these more third world countries got to get hip to the fact that Bob is coming

113
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,940
real soon in his own pants.

114
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,220
Oh, no, wait a minute.

115
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,960
I'm reading from the wrong thing here.

116
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,660
Yeah, that's the Bible.

117
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,160
You're reading from the Bible.

118
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:23,800
Exactly.

119
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,020
What do you...

120
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,420
I don't know if you already covered this or not.

121
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,540
But what did you think about Kim Jong-il?

122
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,460
What do I think about Kim Jong-il?

123
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,500
I think he's got an awesome...

124
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,680
He just kicked it, didn't he?

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,520
He did?

126
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,600
Yeah.

127
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,700
Yeah, just before I got online, I looked at the news and Kim Jong-il...

128
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,140
He officially died on a train ticket in Korea.

129
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,300
Yeah, but that was the one who was already dying who turned over to his roguish young

130
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,220
son named Larry.

131
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,700
He's about a dead punk.

132
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,740
No, he died today.

133
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,160
This has just been a year of change for the world.

134
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,440
I mean, you had the revolutions in Egypt.

135
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,140
You had the revolutions in Syria.

136
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,380
You have the revolutions in Libya.

137
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,880
And the Koreans bring Rome.

138
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,100
You've got Osama bin Laden dead.

139
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,460
Kim Jong-il's dead.

140
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,040
Christopher Hitchens dead.

141
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,380
It's no longer so-ronery.

142
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,620
It's no so-ronery no more.

143
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,660
Yes, the Koreans bring Rome.

144
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,080
Portrayed by no-ronery no more.

145
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,120
I had to hit the refresh button on the webpage here, and then it came up.

146
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,740
Well, you think about that.

147
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,120
It's no more.

148
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,000
Change your life at all.

149
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,360
Man, the bufantes never going to be the same again.

150
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,060
Falsehood.

151
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,620
I'm willing to declare that it's probably a falsity or...

152
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:37,900
Well, they actually have not changed heads of state in North Korea since, like, the war.

153
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,740
Well, it's been an...

154
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,140
Officially, Kim Il-sung is still the head of state.

155
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,920
The old man who's, like, virtually in coma, unless maybe he's dead today.

156
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,780
And he's in state, but he's head of state.

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,060
But he's not the head of state.

158
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,440
His son, though, is going to take over, right?

159
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,540
His budgie little son that looks like him.

160
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,040
Kim Jong-un.

161
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,080
I'd beware the Ides of March.

162
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,660
This kind of, uh...

163
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:04,820
These kind of rumors of wanderings of politicians are always precluded by classes of titans.

164
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,560
He died two days ago.

165
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,080
A communist hereditary monarchy.

166
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,580
Hey, you know what?

167
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,860
Everything good comes in threes, right?

168
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,720
Well, all monarchs were created equal.

169
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,720
Deaths always come in threes.

170
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,580
And for Obama, these three deaths are very significant.

171
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,720
You got Gaddafi dead.

172
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,620
You got Osama bin Laden dead.

173
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,040
Now you got Kim Jong-il dead.

174
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,160
There's three right there.

175
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,240
Wow, man.

176
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,020
That's wild, man.

177
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,060
And that's all within the space of, let's say, two years.

178
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,060


179
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,060


180
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,900
Seven months.

181
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,640
Wow.

182
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,380
Shot him down.

183
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,760
They were either old or hated dictators.

184
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,760
I don't see any mystical coincidence in that.

185
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,800
What are they called?

186
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,560
Boxcar derby cars and stuff?

187
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,180
Kim Jong-il was a very heavy drinker, actually, from what I've read.

188
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,560
He was a sot.

189
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,960
He was a sot.

190
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,300
Sot.

191
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,880
Fill in a bottle of Kentucky bourbon and just ship it to him via the North Korean embassy.

192
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,060
I bet he drank really good stuff.

193
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,180
He drank Hennessy Cognac.

194
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,060
That was his drink of choice from what I've read.

195
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,980
He drank addictive stuff, man.

196
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,580
Hennessy?

197
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,060
Anything barrel-aged is going to be more toxic, they say.

198
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,620
I wonder if he was a prop.

199
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,300
Obviously, he was an unsaved subgenius.

200
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,300
I just wonder if he smoked marijuana or if he smoked, say, Habifroth.

201
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,700
Have you ever seen the propaganda cartoons on YouTube?

202
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,460
What's that?

203
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,040
Have you ever seen North Korean porn?

204
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,140
No, I never have.

205
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,180
That sounds like fun, though.

206
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,200
Are they real?

207
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,200


208
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,100
They're hilarious.

209
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:34,980
Are they real?

210
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,740
Were they actually smuggled out of North Korea?

211
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,440
Yeah, they are.

212
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,220
Were they for kids or something?

213
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,320
They're for kids, yeah.

214
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,020
It's basically to teach kids the evils of the Americans.

215
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:52,620
They're also for those people who have infantilism, they look like kids and stuff, and they're

216
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,760
real big, fat barrel shapes, but they're actually full-grown adults.

217
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,040
Yeah, they're actually full-grown adults.

218
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,040


219
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,040


220
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,040


221
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,040


222
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,040


223
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,040


224
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,660
The animation is almost very reminiscent of early Walt Disney.

225
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,800
It's actually very well-done animation, just that the story and the plot kind of sucks.

226
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,760
I expect to see a lot of stars and banners unfurled and stuff like that, no?

227
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,840
Oh, yeah.

228
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,980
Think of the shows they're gonna put on.

229
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:27,020
One of them is actually in the old communist parties used to put on big Broadway-style extravagances,

230
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,020


231
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,000
You know, people pranking around stage.

232
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,020
Yeah, they still do.

233
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,580
In North Korea, they sure as hell do.

234
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,300
Oh, one of them, one of the kids gets to try and stay in school.

235
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,540
Yeah, one's trying to get kids to stay in school because, like, one kid, he's, like, you know, sleeping through math class.

236
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,140
He doesn't want to study.

237
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,120
He doesn't want to do anything.

238
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,220
And then he daydreams that the Americans are going to attack the shore.

239
00:10:50,220 --> 00:11:00,560
And the only thing that can stop him is if he knows how to use a protractor and aim a gun, basically, at the Americans.

240
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,500
And he doesn't know how to do that because, you know, he slept through his math classes.

241
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,580
And so the Americans take over and everybody gets killed, all because one dumbass little kid slept through math class.

242
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,460
Slept through math class.

243
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,300
Slept through math class.

244
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,120
Slept through math class.

245
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,960
Slept through math class.

246
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,140
Brilliance Audio presents God No.

247
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,180
No.

248
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,460
Signs You May Already Be an Atheist and Other Magical Tales by Penn Jillette.

249
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,120
As read by Penn Jillette.

250
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,280
You may already be an atheist.

251
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:38,260
If God, however you perceive him, her, it, told you to kill your child, would you do it?

252
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,760
If the answer is no, in my booklet, you're an atheist.

253
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,740
There is doubt in your mind.

254
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,500
Love and morality are more important to you than your faith.

255
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,340
If your answer is yes, please reconsider.

256
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,760
Introduction.

257
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,220
The humility of loudmouth, know-it-all, asshole atheists.

258
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,100
You don't have to be brave or a saint, a martyr, or even very smart to be an atheist.

259
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,780
All you have to be able to say is, I don't know.

260
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,480
I remember sitting in a room full of skeptics when I first heard Christopher Hitchens say,

261
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,480
Atheism.

262
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,220
Atheists don't have saints, and we don't have martyrs.

263
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,860
I'm a little afraid to put that in quotes, because no matter how brilliantly I remember

264
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,720
any Hitchens phrase, when I go back and check, what he said was better than I remember.

265
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,580
He is better at speaking off the top of his head after a couple of drinks than I am at

266
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,940
remembering his brilliance later while referring to notes.

267
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,660
I know nothing about drinking, but I know that Hitchens did drink.

268
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,480
And when he made that comment, he was sitting next to me on the dais with a drink.

269
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:47,480


270
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:47,480


271
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:47,480


272
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:47,480


273
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:47,480


274
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,780
I was like, what the hell is he talking about?

275
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:48,780


276
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:48,780


277
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:48,780


278
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:48,780


279
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:48,780


280
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,120
But the drink was irrelevant.

281
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,320
I could never see that it made any difference in his abilities.

282
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,560
My doctor's brother, how's that for a source, said there is such a thing as state-dependent learning.

283
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:09,900
This explains the brilliance of all the jazz cats on heroin and how Keith Richards could play even a specially-tuned guitar while as fucked up as, well, Keith Richards.

284
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,020
They're performing in the same state in which they practiced.

285
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,480
Hank Williams was so fucked up, we don't even know which of the United States is the best.

286
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,620
He died in.

287
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,980
Hank's driver drove him across many state lines all night in his long white Cadillac.

288
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,980
When they got to Oak Hill, West Virginia, Hank was dead.

289
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,360
Hank's genius might have been state-dependent, but his dying wasn't even that.

290
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,380
Hitchens isn't that Hank Williams kind of pop genius.

291
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,820
Christopher Hitchens is that Thomas Jefferson kind of genius genius.

292
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,640
Hitch is so smart that his state doesn't seem to matter.

293
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,220
But for Hank Williams, it might have helped him.

294
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,080
Call up information in the same state drunk that Hank learned it.

295
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:51,900
Drunk.

296
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,860
I did the Howard Stern radio show a lot in the late 80s.

297
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,160
Many times I was on with Sam Kennison.

298
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,260
I've never had a sip of alcohol or tried any recreational drug in my life.

299
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,060
And I'd come into the Stern show as rested as carny trash could be that early in the morning.

300
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,800
Focused and ready to work.

301
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,420
Sam would come in fucked up.

302
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,160
Really fucked up.

303
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,180
Stern would kick off the show.

304
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,200
And Sam was always so good, I'd be sweating into the mic.

305
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,520
Trying to get a clever word in here or there.

306
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:30,240
While in awe of how fast, insightful, profound, and motherfucking funny Sam was every second.

307
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,340
Howard would keep us on for a long time.

308
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,240
At the end of the show, I'd be exhausted.

309
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,560
And Sam would just stagger out like he came in.

310
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,760
I used to wonder if this is how he was in a fucked up state.

311
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,700
If he ever was sober, couldn't he sweep the Nobel Prizes and throw in a Fields Medal?

312
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,460
You don't have to be very smart, fast, or funny to be an atheist.

313
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,140
You don't have to be well educated.

314
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,920
Being an atheist is simply saying, I don't know.

315
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,300
When I was a professional dishwasher, I worked with a man named Harold.

316
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,580
Harold sent in lyrics and the little bit of money he saved up to song poem companies

317
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,060
that advertised in the back of National Enquirer and Midnight.

318
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,920
He'd pay a full week's wages to have song sharks set his poems to music,

319
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,240
record the songs,

320
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,520
and try to sell them to make Harold rich.

321
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,120
Part of the scam was to send the victim a copy of his song on a record.

322
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,320
I now collect copies of these song poem records.

323
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,300
Nothing is labeled very well, and most of them are about Jesus or Nixon.

324
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,000
I'll never know if I'm listening to a song Harold co-wrote with a rip-off artist,

325
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,860
but when I listen, I feel like I'm in touch with him.

326
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,900
Most of the song poems are unlistenable, but the ones that are good are heartbreaking.

327
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,500
They are all you want in art.

328
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,640
Harold was a musical blase skill of out-of-work studio musicians,

329
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,560
sight-reading hastily scribbled sheet music,

330
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,360
while a competent but bitter vocalist sings unedited, pure, white-light, white-heat lyrics

331
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,100
from the heart of someone who doesn't know what the word cynical means.

332
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,340
Beat that, Bruce Springsteen!

333
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,260
Harold was fat and ugly and sweaty.

334
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,440
He didn't have any brain power or hair at all.

335
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,940
I looked up to him.

336
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,440
I knew other people who were a zillion times smarter than Harold,

337
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,700
but Harold managed to show up for work, get the pots and pans clean,

338
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,880
and deal with all the smart-ass punks, hippies, drunks, and drug users

339
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,560
who washed dishes briefly and badly at Famous Bill's restaurant in Greenfield, Massachusetts.

340
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,940
Famous Bill's contained the word famous because they'd gotten a good review of their lobster pie

341
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,240
in a travel magazine in the 50s.

342
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,980
I was a hippie punk who worked with Harold for one summer

343
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,560
and then went on with my life with Penn & Teller.

344
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,180
Harold knew a couple of little jokes.

345
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,960
He knew how to be polite and get to the restaurant on time

346
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,300
and back to his apartment after work to write songs.

347
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,980
I never talked theology with Harold.

348
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,740
I don't know if he believed in God.

349
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,160
But I heard him say,

350
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,660
I don't know, about a lot of things.

351
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,000
His smile, when he admitted that he didn't know, was unapologetic,

352
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,680
unless you were asking a question related to his job.

353
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,240
If you were asking him if he liked Kerouac or Thailand,

354
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,480
he would just say,

355
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,640
I don't know.

356
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,400
A simple statement of fact.

357
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,140
He knew very well that he didn't know.

358
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,180
I try to claim that I was friends with the genius Richard Feynman.

359
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,400
He came to our show a few times and was very complimentary.

360
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,420
And I had dinner with him a couple of times.

361
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,220
We chatted on the phone several times.

362
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,940
I'd call him to get a quick tutoring on physics so I could pretend to read his books.

363
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,220
No matter how much I want to brag, it's overstating it to call him a friend.

364
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,360
I would have never called him to help me move a couch.

365
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,380
I did, however, call him once to ask how he could score some liquid nitrogen.

366
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,680
He was the only physicist I knew at the time.

367
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,380
He explained patiently that he didn't know.

368
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,300
He was a theoretical physicist and I needed a hands-on guy.

369
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,940
But he tried to find one for me.

370
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,880
About a half hour later, a physics teacher from a community college in Brooklyn called me and said,

371
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,140
I don't know what kind of practical joke this is,

372
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,780
but a Nobel Prize winning scientist just called me here at the community college,

373
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,380
gave me this number, and told me to call Penn of Penn University.

374
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:15,380


375
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:15,380


376
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,320
I'd then tell him to help with the Letterman appearance.

377
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,060
I guess that's close to a friend.

378
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,800
My friend, Richard Feynman, said, I don't know.

379
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,100
I heard him say it several times.

380
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,060
He did it just like Harold, a simple statement of fact.

381
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,680
When Richard didn't know, he often worked harder than anyone else to find out.

382
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,820
But while he didn't know, he said, I don't know.

383
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,880
I like to think I fit somewhere between my friends Harold and Richard.

384
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,160
I don't know.

385
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,560
I try to remember to say, I don't know,

386
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,760
just the way they both did, as a simple statement of fact.

387
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,420
It doesn't always work.

388
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,620
It seems that with climate change, we're all supposed to know.

389
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,380
But I'll get to that later in the book.

390
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,180
One attack I've heard theists make against atheists is,

391
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,580
so you atheists think you know everything.

392
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,120
You think you're smart enough to know everything.

393
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,620
You think science can figure out everything.

394
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,780
There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio, than are dreamt...

395
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,560
That quote is from my good friend Mr. Straw Man.

396
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,540
But it's an idea that I've been thinking about for a long time.

397
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,880
It's an idea we hear all the time.

398
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,120
Atheists are arrogant and don't think they need God,

399
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,880
because they've got it all figured out.

400
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,100
I think people who make that accusation are confusing style with content.

401
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,020
I am a loud, aggressive, strident, outspoken atheist.

402
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,080
And I'm an asshole.

403
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,540
What I'm claiming is not in any way arrogant.

404
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,200
It couldn't be more humble.

405
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,400
It's just, I don't know.

406
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,640
I don't know how the world was created.

407
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,240
I don't know how humans got here.

408
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,900
There are a lot of good guesses,

409
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,580
and we keep testing those guesses,

410
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,420
trying to find out where they're wrong.

411
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,080
Science has helped a lot, but we don't know.

412
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,760
And maybe we never will.

413
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,320
I mean, we, all of us, the people alive right now,

414
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,600
will certainly never know,

415
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,100
but it seems almost as likely that no humans will ever know.

416
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,940
How could we?

417
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,420
We will keep getting closer.

418
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,080
We'll keep knowing more and more.

419
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,240
I guess string theory might explain some things,

420
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:09,980
but I don't know.

421
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,620
I don't understand jack shit about string theory.

422
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,540
Evolution explains a lot.

423
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,280
I think I get a little bit about that.

424
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,660
Evolution really does seem to make a zillion pieces fall into place.

425
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,100
It's the answer to a lot of questions that, before Darwin,

426
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,160
had to be answered with, I don't know.

427
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,860
The theory of evolution keeps, you know, evolving.

428
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,740
It keeps changing.

429
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,300
Now, we do know a lot, but the number of I don't know is still infinite.

430
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,280
Aren't there a few different kinds of infinity?

431
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,480
I don't fucking know.

432
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,200
I sure can't picture infinity.

433
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,320
What does it mean to go on forever?

434
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,180
I don't know.

435
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,520
That's how Harold's coworker, Penn the Dishwasher, would say it.

436
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,020
A simple statement of fact.

437
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,160
I don't know.

438
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,200
Where is the humility in being a theist?

439
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,180
There is none.

440
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,040
What would it mean for me to believe in God?

441
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,440
It would mean that I know.

442
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,280
Not just that I might happen to know about Kerouac, Thailand,

443
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,220
liquid nitrogen, and vector calculus identities,

444
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,040
but that I know that there is an omniscient, omnipotent,

445
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,760
omnipresent power in the universe that I can't prove to you,

446
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,640
but that I know because I have faith.

447
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,720
I know because I say I know.

448
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,780
I can feel it.

449
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,540
I would maybe have faith that this force in the universe is for good.

450
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,300
Maybe it's tied in with love.

451
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,380
Maybe I know that this force in the universe will give everlasting life

452
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,800
and cares very much where I stick my fucking cock.

453
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,180
Maybe I would know there is a supreme power in the universe,

454
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,440
and that that supreme power cares about me.

455
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,940
Not everyone who believes in God believes all those things,

456
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,020
but it doesn't matter.

457
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,560
Whatever they say God is, they're saying they know.

458
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,420
There is no humility.

459
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,320
They believe because they say they believe.

460
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,640
Some people who believe in God distort the meaning to the point where,

461
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,520
well, even I could say I believe in God.

462
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,120
Some people will tell you God is love,

463
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,700
and then defy you not to believe in love.

464
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,640
But if X equals Y, why have a fucking X?

465
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
Just keep it at Y.

466
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,760
Why call love God?

467
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,240
Why not call love love?

468
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,820
Beauty is God.

469
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,600
Okay, if you change what the word means,

470
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,500
you can get me to say I believe in it.

471
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,120
Say God is bacon or God is tits,

472
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,680
and I'll love and praise God,

473
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,280
but you're just changing the word, not the idea.

474
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,180
Some think that God will answer prayers.

475
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,400
They think that their prayer can influence the behavior of an omnipotent, omniscient power.

476
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,880
How do you figure that?

477
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,940
How come it's rare to see people on TV saying that God made them lose the stupid ball game

478
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,040
or killed that baby in the house fire?

479
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:50,060
How come every time someone says that God told them to kill their whole family,

480
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,600
the religious people say right away that the faithful murderer was crazy?

481
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,300
You never see religious people saying,

482
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,940
I wonder if that murder was a miracle.

483
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,000
I wonder if God is speaking to us directly again.

484
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,180
Maybe they really don't believe this shit either.

485
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,120
I could scream at the altar of a church

486
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,680
with a crucifix stuck deep up my asshole

487
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,480
that I fucked Jesus Christ hard through the hand holes

488
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,500
and cream on his crown of thorns,

489
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,340
and I will never hit the level of blasphemy

490
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,900
that's required for someone to pray to God

491
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,360
for their family's pet dog to return home.

492
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,900
The idea that someone can claim that they know there's a God because they feel it,

493
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,500
because they trust a book they were raised with,

494
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,880
because they had an epiphany,

495
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:41,180
and then ask this God to change its mind about its plan for the universe,

496
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,580
is arrogant.

497
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,320
Once you say you have the answer to everything,

498
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,320
but you can't prove it to anyone else,

499
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,800
I don't think you can accuse anyone else of being arrogant.

500
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,940
I think you are the king of kings of arrogant assholes.

501
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,620
And I don't know doesn't mean there might be a God.

502
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,400
That's the different kind of I don't know.

503
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,000
That's not Harold and Richard's honest, humble I don't know.

504
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,520
Being an atheist means you don't believe in God.

505
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,520
When someone asks if God exists,

506
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,120
and you humbly say, I don't know,

507
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,460
you've answered the question honestly.

508
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,800
Once you've answered I don't know to the existence of a God,

509
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,020
the answer to whether you believe in God pretty much has to be no.

510
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,860
That doesn't mean you're saying it's impossible for there to be a God,

511
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,460
or that we couldn't have evidence of a God in the future.

512
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,620
It just means that right now you don't know.

513
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,840
And if you don't know,

514
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,000
you can't believe.

515
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,280
Believing cannot rise out of I don't know.

516
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,300
Is there an elephant in your bathtub right now?

517
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,940
If you humbly answer I don't know,

518
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,360
then when asked if you believe there's an elephant in your bathtub right now,

519
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,040
the answer would be no.

520
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,620
Anything is possible,

521
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,000
but there's no reason to believe it until there's some evidence.

522
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,240
Once you're an atheist, anything is possible.

523
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,540
You are leaving open the possibility of Jesus Christ as Lord,

524
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,560
and Thor,

525
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,820
and invisible gremlins living in your tomb,

526
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,000
and a toaster.

527
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
It's all possible,

528
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,860
but I don't know.

529
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,300
And until I know,

530
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,620
until there's some evidence,

531
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,140
I'm an atheist.

532
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,080
What could be humbler than that?

533
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,720
In order to be smart or well-educated,

534
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,340
you just need to be humble.

535
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,340
And if you're a libertarian atheist,

536
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,840
there can be no commandments,

537
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,500
there can be no edicts.

538
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,040
It's all down to the individual.

539
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,620
No one knows what's best for other people.

540
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,900
I don't even know what's best for myself.

541
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,820
I was asked by Glenn Beck to entertain the audience,

542
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,420
while I talk about his derechos and Catay for now as the

543
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,440
host of theprised but anterior The Ten Commandments.

544
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,700
He told this story in his endo send.

545
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,560
There areanden multiple queer Officer days images,

546
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,800
Genghis had.

547
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,460
All joking aside, that seems like the right feeling.

548
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,180
This book is just some thoughts from someone who doesn't know.

549
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,760
I've tried to throw in a couple of funny stories, and there's a lot of rambling.

550
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,600
Some of the stories have nothing to do with atheism directly,

551
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,720
but they will give you a feel for how one goofy atheist lives his life in turn-of-the-century America.

552
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,600
If you're still claiming that you're religious, you can compare and contrast.

553
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,140
I think you'll find I'm just like you.

554
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,640
If you're the kind of guy or gal who's dropped his or her cock into a blow dryer.

555
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,720
Try to remember, when it all comes down, I just don't know.

556
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,700
But God? No! There's no fucking God!

557
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,660
Oh, we need more scientists so we can do what?

558
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,320
What are these scientists going to do for us?

559
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,880
They're going to come up with some stupid product that we don't need and probably kills us.

560
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,560
Or invent some new technology that will...

561
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,600
Or anything that helps mankind.

562
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,000
Or come up with some new technology.

563
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,660
That will eliminate more jobs.

564
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,540
Yeah, or come up with some technology that eliminates more mankind.

565
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,260
You know?

566
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,840
That's the deal going down.

567
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,480
I've been working on it, boys.

568
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,160
And you, you...

569
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,720
Thank you for getting down.

570
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,600
I cough up a lunger and extinguish the sun.

571
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,540
I send about the scurry here and there and deliver the message of death.

572
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,840
That's sick, man.

573
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,040
What did you say, skeptic?

574
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,500
I was just... That's all I really had to contribute.

575
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,700
I don't know if it changes your day, your month, your year or not.

576
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,260
But for 2011, quite an eventful year.

577
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,720
Protests.

578
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,580
Lots of deaths this year of major players in the world.

579
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:59,520
And I'm not sure if this changes tomorrow or puts the exclamation point on a year.

580
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,320
But, yeah, it lost a lot of people.

581
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,300
Christopher Hitchens was a shame, too.

582
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,520
You know what? I found him to be a boor.

583
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:08,800
Trite?

584
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,700
A boor.

585
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,420
Anything but trite.

586
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,680
Very, very fascinating personality.

587
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,580
Very good writer.

588
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,020
Very good at rhetoric and all that.

589
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,240
But at the end of the day, he, you know, exposed himself to be the asshat he was all along.

590
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,680
Who are you talking about?

591
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,080
Christopher Hitchens.

592
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,420
Vanity Fair.

593
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,800
He's, you know...

594
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,540
Yeah, he...

595
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,000
Two dudes.

596
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,100
Two dudes.

597
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,100


598
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,100


599
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,100


600
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,100


601
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,660
He kind of was a little arrogant, wasn't he?

602
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,280
Especially after...

603
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,940
Well, it's not just that he was arrogant.

604
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,180
He was also, you know, just a bully in some ways.

605
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,500
And certainly a misogynist in some ways.

606
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,360
And, of course...

607
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,600
But he tried to force atheism down everybody's damn throat.

608
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,940
I didn't have a problem with that at all.

609
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,780
He was...

610
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,080
There's no such thing as forcing atheism down anybody's throat.

611
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,340
Yeah, he was not forcing that.

612
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,400
He did not force it down anybody's throat at all.

613
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,040
He just made his opinions on the questions of divinity quite clear.

614
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,900
And that was one of the things...

615
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,340
I thought he was an excellent...

616
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:05,960
This is how Kentuckians see it.

617
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,020
This is how Kentuckians see him as.

618
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,040
Well, Kentuckians, I...

619
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,720
With all due respect, I mean...

620
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,320
You know, anytime someone...

621
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,180
You know, Kentuckians have the same problem that...

622
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,960
That religious people all over the world have.

623
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,680
You seem to think that you're being oppressed

624
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,040
just by the virtue that someone is questioning

625
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,600
or daring to say that maybe your religion is wrong.

626
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,320
And...

627
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,740
But when someone merely expressing an opinion

628
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,020
and trying to make a reasonable argument,

629
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,900
is different from forcing a belief system on people.

630
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,740
No kidding.

631
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,500
The Christians would rather force...

632
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,680
You've got apples and oranges.

633
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,500
It's a completely different thing.

634
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,460
But I would not be surprised if people in places like Kentucky or Texas

635
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,400
thought of him as a guy who was just trying to shove atheism down their throat.

636
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,560
Right.

637
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,840
Because that's how they view any criticism.

638
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,240
That's how they paint it.

639
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,840
That's how they have to paint it.

640
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,140
Right.

641
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:53,620
And it's...

642
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,040
But we have a well-established faith-based system in Kentucky,

643
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,340
and it's worked for us very well.

644
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,680
It's called faith handling.

645
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,420
Yeah.

646
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,020
Yeah.

647
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,600
Yep, yep, yep.

648
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,680
But, um...

649
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,760
Well, that's not all for a media show,

650
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,160
but Hitchens still is.

651
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,480
Just think of it.

652
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,540
That's, you know, basically what you're dealing with

653
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,460
is a media personality.

654
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,560
Who knows how many times he opened up the big one

655
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,080
for, you know, for personal gain.

656
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,500
What kind of liberal libertarian is that?

657
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,440
He's, you know, the kind that gets a check.

658
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,700
At the end of the day, though,

659
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,860
you know, what he'll probably be remembered for

660
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,980
is, you know, how he spent the last decade or so,

661
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,780
which was arguing on the wrong side

662
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,260
of some of the great debates in our, uh...

663
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,360
in our society, mainly having to do with

664
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,520
the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq.

665
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:36,960
Media personality.

666
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,780
He turned into a hawk.

667
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:39,740
Yep.

668
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,840
A flak hack, as it were.

669
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,440
And a very...

670
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,060
And he never tried to be one, really.

671
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,780
No, he didn't.

672
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,200
Andy Rooney felt the same way at the end of his life, too.

673
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,100
It got very, uh...

674
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,680
It got very, uh, disappointing to see

675
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,900
some of the cheap rhetorical tricks he would try to employ

676
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,240
when trying to make a case for...

677
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,540
for invading Iraq.

678
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,900
Yeah, here's this brilliant so-called guy,

679
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,680
and all of a sudden he's Bill O'Reilly, you know?

680
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,780
This is Phil.

681
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,100
Phil.

682
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,480
Pete.

683
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,240
And Dave.

684
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:01,840
Of the...

685
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,880
Fire Sign Theater.

686
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,660
And we're listening to...

687
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,020
The Hour of Slack.

688
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,460
Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack.

689
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,100
Because we're subgeniuses.

690
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,420
And we're slacking off.

691
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,920
But friends, are we here to give Bob all the credit

692
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,740
for this moment of self-actuating

693
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,320
and self-stimulating understanding?

694
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,120
Or could there be even more sinister forces at work?

695
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,260
Well, we must give credit where at least some credit is due.

696
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,380
And there happens to be one other we must thank

697
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,680
for this divine wisdom.

698
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,060
One other entity that we must pay tribute

699
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,640
for our final reckoning.

700
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,820
Friends, we must take a moment to give thanks

701
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,400
to the conspiracy itself.

702
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,020
Now I know it must come as a great shock

703
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,400
to my brothers and sisters.

704
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,380
I'm sure you are thinking to yourself,

705
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,780
how could he give that lumbering, all-consuming,

706
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,620
slack-sucking machine of slow, agonizing species death

707
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,360
an ounce of credit for anything other than...

708
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:01,360


709
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,340
pissed and fucking the collective fractums

710
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,180
of our congregation?

711
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,880
You are probably wondering how in the hell

712
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,060
he can sit there with the audacity

713
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,700
to give any appreciation to that

714
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,420
which we have sworn our undying hatred towards.

715
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,620
You must be trying to understand

716
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,820
where this silly son of a bitch gets off

717
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,040
polishing the helmet of that

718
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,840
which our sweet acts of subversion seek to destroy.

719
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,280
Why, you ask?

720
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,840
Because the conspiracy pushed our collective asses

721
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,200
straight into Bob's pipe.

722
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,360
And for the first time in my...

723
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,940
life, I know what true slack means for me.

724
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,520
I realize that I had it all along,

725
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,440
and no matter what hellbound path

726
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,620
the conspiracy has planned for us all,

727
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,180
they will never be able to take it away from us.

728
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,860
Praise God damn Bob.

729
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,700
What a way to finish.

730
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,680
We're not finished.

731
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,160
Speak for yourself.

732
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,340
One day, one night,

733
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,840
Kobayashi Maru.

734
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,460
Are you afraid of the future?

735
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,000
I believe that was a general idea

736
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,220
that I was trying to convey.

737
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,680
I don't mean this future.

738
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,940
What is this? Multiple choice?

739
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,340
Some people are afraid

740
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,760
of what might happen.

741
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,100
I was terrified.

742
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,000
Try not to be too hard on yourself.

743
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,200
We all felt exactly the same.

744
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,400
Once a man has seen society's black underbelly,

745
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,260
he can never pretend.

746
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,820
Like you do.

747
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,440
But it doesn't exist.

748
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,140
No matter who orders him to look the other way.

749
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,000
We don't do this...

750
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:44,740
thing.

751
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,560
Because it's permitted.

752
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,740
We do it because we have to.

753
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,060
And we do it because we're compelled.

754
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,360
And I'd be No. 1

755
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:01,360


756
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:01,360


757
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,240
A self-destructive man feels completely alienated, utterly alone.

758
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,120
He's an outsider to the human community.

759
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,900
He thinks to himself, I must be insane.

760
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,960
What he fails to realize is that society has, just as he does,

761
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,200
a vested interest in considerable losses and catastrophes.

762
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,680
These wars, famines, floods, and quakes meet well-defined needs.

763
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,900
A man wants chaos.

764
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,100
In fact, he's got to have it.

765
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,620
Depression, strife, riots, murder, all this dread.

766
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,460
We're irresistibly drawn to that almost orgiastic state created out of death and destruction.

767
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,300
It's in all of us. We revel in it.

768
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,280
Sure, the media tries to put a sad face on these things,

769
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,600
painting them up as great human tragedies.

770
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,320
But we all know the function of the media has never been to eliminate the evils of the world.

771
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:00,680
No.

772
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,780
Their job is to persuade us to accept those evils and get used to living with them.

773
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,520
The powers that be want us to be passive observers.

774
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,920
You got a match?

775
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,120
And they haven't given us any other options

776
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,900
outside the occasional, purely symbolic, participatory act of voting.

777
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,960
You want the puppet on the right?

778
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,260
Or the puppet on the left?

779
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,540
I feel that the time has come to project my own inadequacies and dissatisfactions

780
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,360
into the socio-political and scientific schemes.

781
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,640
Let my own lack of a voice be heard.

782
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,420
I don't think I can be a puppet.

783
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,340
It wasn't really worth it.

784
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,380
The instant of my purity worth the lifetime of your lies.

785
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,980
Please explain to me, where's the purity?

786
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,380
You couldn't live without it.

787
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,840
You see, there is only one constant.

788
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,680
One universal. It is the only real truth.

789
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,780
Causality.

790
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,200
Action.

791
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,540
Reaction.

792
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,680
Cause.

793
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,900
And effect.

794
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,240
Everything begins with choice.

795
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,680
No. Wrong.

796
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,980
Choice is an illusion.

797
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,780
Created between those with power and those without.

798
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,540
Look there.

799
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,200
At that woman.

800
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,000
My God, just look at her.

801
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,860
Affecting everyone around her.

802
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,300
So obvious.

803
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,720
So bourgeois.

804
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,200
What you see, I have sent you a dessert.

805
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,140
A very special dessert.

806
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,100
I wrote it myself.

807
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,820
It starts so simply.

808
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,020
Each line of the poem creating a new effect.

809
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,500
Just like...

810
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,320
poetry.

811
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,260
First, a rush.

812
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,740
Heat.

813
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,880
A heart flutter.

814
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,720
She does not understand why.

815
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,220
Is it the why? No.

816
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,120
What is it then? What is the reason?

817
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,560
Soon it does not matter.

818
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,400
Soon the why and the reason are gone.

819
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:35,140
And all that matters is the feeling of itself.

820
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,640
And this is the nature of the universe.

821
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,440
We struggle against it. We fight to deny it.

822
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,560
But it is of course pretend it is a lie.

823
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,020
Beneath our poised appearance.

824
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,700
The truth is we are complete.

825
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,540
Out of control.

826
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:41,400
We are not afraid to curious for it.

827
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,560
But do not be afraid.

828
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:42,620
BETWEEN THOSE WHO DO NOT BELIEVE.

829
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:42,640
With the little things that we are.

830
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:42,660


831
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:42,660


832
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:42,660


833
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:42,660


834
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:49,200
All'ho, sounds of nature.

835
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,120
Harmonic static

836
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:54,100
At the end of this world.

837
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:54,960
Luckh persists.

838
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:02,980
Thank you.

839
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,700
Thank you.

840
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,140
A thousand prayers.

841
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,020
Don't cry, sweetheart.

842
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,700
I don't think I'm any crazier than you are.

843
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,980
That's your shadow on the wall.

844
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,560
Can't get rid of your shadow, can you?

845
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,280
Any regrets?

846
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,320
I don't spend a lot of time with regret.

847
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,040
That's a waste of emotion.

848
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,860
Well, I wish that Indian hadn't got killed.

849
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,060
Man had a rattlesnake sitting in a corner.

850
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,380
Rattlesnake?

851
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,120
You pick it up and pet it.

852
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,640
He saw it.

853
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,820
He saw what?

854
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,520
The demon. He saw the demon.

855
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,640
The demon?

856
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,560
What demon?

857
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,280
Everybody got the demon in here, okay?

858
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,800
The demon lives in here.

859
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,420
It feeds on your hate.

860
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,540
Cuts, kills, rapes.

861
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,840
It uses your weakness, your fear.

862
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,360
Only the vicious survive.

863
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,840
We all told we're no good piece of shit from the time we could breathe.

864
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:54,800
God damn it.

865
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,340
After a while you kind of become bad.

866
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,980
You're in your own world.

867
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,960
So tell me, how can you look at an ordinary person,

868
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,900
an innocent guy with kids,

869
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,940
and then shoot him to death?

870
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,980
I mean, how can you bring yourself to do that?

871
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,280
Innocent?

872
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,820
Who's innocent? You innocent?

873
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,200
I'm innocent? Yes I am.

874
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:16,900
Nothing better?

875
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,340
Definitely.

876
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,520
All God's creatures do it, in some form or another.

877
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,900
I mean, you look in the forest.

878
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,880
You got species killing other species.

879
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,260
Our species killing all species, including the forest.

880
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,960
We just call it industry, not murder.

881
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,620
But I know a lot of people who deserve to die.

882
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:40,120
Why do they deserve to die?

883
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,360
A lot of people walking around out there already dead.

884
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,320
Just need to be put out of their misery.

885
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,340
Causality.

886
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,400
There is no escape from it.

887
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,340
We are forever slaves to it.

888
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,600
Our only hope, our only peace is to understand it.

889
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,100
To understand the why.

890
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,340
Why is what separates us from them.

891
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,460
You from me.

892
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,160
Why is the only real source of power without it you are powerless.

893
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,300
You know the only thing that kills a demon?

894
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:19,820
Love.

895
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,360
It's just like...

896
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,020
Being in the garden of Eden.

897
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,560
I only love to kill a demon.

898
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,940
All that for.

899
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,340
Theo's heart had died a rattle on the world.

900
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,900
Do you think he'll live up to his name?

901
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,980
Or will it just be a death hairball?

902
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:49,980
Ah!

903
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:55,360
Prepare to evacuate soul.

904
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,580
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

905
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,240
Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?

906
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,800
Goodbye cruel world.

907
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,980
I'm leaving you today.

908
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,640
Goodbye.

909
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,420
Goodbye.

910
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,180
Goodbye.

911
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,420
Goodbye.

912
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,100
Goodbye.

913
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:32,100


914
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,460
Goodbye all you people.

915
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:43,820
There's nothing you can say, to make me change my mind.

916
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,140
Goodbye.

917
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,560
Goodbye.

918
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,400
Goodbye.

919
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:49,400


920
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:49,400


921
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:49,400


922
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:49,400


923
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:49,400


924
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:49,400


925
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,260
Painful living fear, isn't it?

926
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,800
Nothing is worse than having an itch you can never scratch.

927
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,660
Oh, I agree.

928
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,480
Wake up.

929
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:08,980
Time to die.

930
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,160
Die!

931
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:13,820
Die!

932
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,280
Why won't you die?

933
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,080
Why won't you die?

934
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:21,740
Why won't you die?

935
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,700
Beneath this mask, there is more than flesh.

936
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,560
Beneath this mask, there is an idea.

937
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,000
And ideas are bulletproof.

938
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,040
I shall die here.

939
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,000
Every inch of me shall perish.

940
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,380
I shall die here.

941
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:49,380


942
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:49,380


943
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,360
Every inch.

944
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,420
But one.

945
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,460
An inch.

946
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,040
It is small, and it is fragile.

947
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,400
And it is the only thing in the world worth having.

948
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,560
We must never lose it or give it away.

949
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,300
We must never let them take it from us.

950
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,800
I hope that whoever you are, you escape this place.

951
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,840
I hope that the world turns and that things get better.

952
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,360
But what I hope most of all is that you...

953
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,560
understand what I mean when I tell you that even though I do not know you,

954
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,360
and even though I may never meet you,

955
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,040
laugh with you,

956
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,700
cry with you,

957
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,300
or kiss you,

958
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,640
I love you.

959
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,340
With all my heart,

960
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,800
I love you.

961
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,000
I love you.

962
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,880
Wait a minute, you fucking hypocrite!

963
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,300
You're so...

964
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,280
You said that love beats the demon!

965
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,440
You said that love beats the demon!

966
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,360
And it will.

967
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,560
It's just that you're the last one.

968
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,400
Oh, man, please fucking kill me.

969
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,080
This is not about you, you egomaniac.

970
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,020
I kinda like you.

971
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:03,960
Nooo!

972
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,080
But if we let you go, we'd be just like everybody else,

973
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,340
killing you.

974
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,940
And what you represent is...

975
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,340
a statement.

976
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,500
You and me, we're not even the same species.

977
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,500
I used to be you, then I evolved.

978
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,280
From where you're standing, to me, you're the villain.

979
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,280


980
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,280


981
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,280


982
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,280


983
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,280


984
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,280


985
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,280


986
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,280


987
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,280


988
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,100
You're a man from where I'm standing.

989
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,420
You're an ape.

990
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,840
You're not even an ape, you're a media person.

991
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,600
Media is like the weather, only it's man-made.

992
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,320
You're the one who made it impure.

993
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,080
You're buying and selling the fears.

994
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,820
You say, why?

995
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,100
I say, why bother?

996
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,660
Have some dignity.

997
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,280
All right, so I'm a parasite, so what?

998
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,080
Right, life is cruel, no one said it was gonna be easy.

999
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,960
The day you two killed your ass belonged to us!

1000
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:56,640
To the public, to the media!

1001
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,180
That's how it is, and we are married, eh?

1002
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,820
Let's make a little music, Colorado.

1003
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,220
In other news tonight, a bride and groom's wedding reception

1004
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,360
turned into a nightmare.

1005
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,000
In chapter six, he begins to get into the actual message.

1006
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,760
Revelation 6.

1007
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,660
Now, I saw in the lamp opening...

1008
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,400
He's over there in the phoenix.

1009
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,400
That's all I thought of.

1010
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,640
Chapter five, now only the Lamb of Christ is worthy to unseat a lamb.

1011
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:33,940
He fought me, he slapped me down, he...

1012
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:36,400
And one of the four living creatures said,

1013
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,400
come and suit us.

1014
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,040
And I looked, and he pulled a white horse.

1015
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,640
And he believed all kinds of ideas into the white horse.

1016
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,160
And the white horse said, what does this white horse mean?

1017
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:51,560
And he was set on it at a foe, and a crown was given him,

1018
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,920
and he went forth conquering and to conquer.

1019
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,220
A white horse.

1020
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,520
Now let the Bible interpret the Bible.

1021
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:12,320
Give me a nightmare, broken night, I'm never broke.

1022
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:18,280
My secret lamp is lonely here, there's no one left to torture.

1023
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:27,500
Give me absolute control over every living soul.

1024
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,700
And lie beside me, baby, that's an order.

1025
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:41,200
Give me a crack, anal sex, take the only tree that's left.

1026
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,380
And stomp it up the hole in your culture.

1027
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,360
Give me a bank, a burning wall.

1028
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,140
Give me a star, then say,

1029
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,100
Paul, I've seen your future, brother.

1030
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,320
It is my door.

1031
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,120
Things are gonna slide.

1032
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,520
Slide in all directions.

1033
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,140
Won't pay nothing.

1034
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,800
Won't be nothing.

1035
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,180
Won't be nothing.

1036
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,880
You can't measure anymore.

1037
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,060
The blizzard.

1038
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:21,180
The blizzard of the world's crossed the threshold.

1039
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:26,000
And it's overturned the order of the soul.

1040
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:33,100
When they say, repent, repent, repent.

1041
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,820
I wonder what they meant.

1042
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,180
When they say, repent, repent, repent.

1043
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,980
I wonder what they meant.

1044
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,820
I wonder what they meant.

1045
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:53,620
When they say, repent, repent, repent, repent.

1046
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,120
I wonder what they meant.

1047
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,100
When they say, comment, write, repent

1048
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:03,100


1049
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:03,100


1050
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:03,100


1051
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:07,900
You can travel the world in the let ups minus

1052
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:07,900


1053
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,120
I'm

1054
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,120
You just need help and a primer.

1055
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:11,140


1056
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,180
uve

1057
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,520
Who wrote the Bible

1058
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,780
I've seen the nations

1059
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,220
Rouse and fall

1060
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,100
I've heard their stories

1061
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,360
Heard them all

1062
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,460
But love's the only

1063
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,780
Engine of survival

1064
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,040
Your servant here

1065
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,660
He has been told

1066
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,420
To say it clear

1067
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,940
To say it cool

1068
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,200
It's over

1069
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,320
It ain't going any further

1070
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,620
And now the wheels

1071
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,180
Of heaven stop

1072
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,500
You feel the devil's

1073
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,620
Riding crop

1074
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,360
Get ready for the future

1075
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,080
It is murder

1076
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,180
And the tales are gonna slide

1077
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:02,500
In all direction

1078
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,320
Won't be nothing

1079
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,620
Nothing you can measure anymore

1080
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,160
Love is a miracle

1081
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,360
The truth is

1082
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:13,980
It's over

1083
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:13,980


1084
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:13,980


1085
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,100
The world has crossed

1086
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,260
The threshold

1087
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,120
And it's overturned

1088
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,080
The order of the soul

1089
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,400
When they say

1090
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,240
Repent

1091
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,740
Repent

1092
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:32,040
I wonder what they meant

1093
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,580
When they say

1094
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,420
Repent

1095
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,020
Repent

1096
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,140
I wonder what they meant

1097
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:41,140


1098
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,040
what they meant

1099
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,820
when they said

1100
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,020
repent

1101
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,060
repent

1102
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,780
I wonder

1103
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,200
what they meant

1104
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,460
There'll be the breaking

1105
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,180
of the ancient western

1106
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,160
code

1107
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,180
Your private

1108
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,140
life will suddenly

1109
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,040
explode

1110
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,300
There'll be

1111
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,400
phantoms

1112
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,020
There'll be fires on the road

1113
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,020
And a white

1114
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:18,740
man dancing

1115
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,080
You'll see

1116
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,980
a woman

1117
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,080
hanging upside

1118
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,440
down

1119
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,900
Her features

1120
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,800
covered by her

1121
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,960
fallen gown

1122
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,760
And all

1123
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,700
the lousy little

1124
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,480
poets

1125
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:37,960
come

1126
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,260
around

1127
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,120
trying to

1128
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,040
sound like

1129
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,800
Charlie Manson

1130
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,220
Here the white

1131
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:49,220
man dancing

1132
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,020
Give me

1133
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,580
that burning

1134
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,280
wall

1135
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,420
Give me

1136
00:52:59,420 --> 00:52:59,980
stone

1137
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,720
and St. Paul

1138
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,760
Give me

1139
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,380
Christ

1140
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,640
or give me

1141
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,700
Hiroshima

1142
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,500
Give me

1143
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:07,940
that burning

1144
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,300
wall

1145
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,180
Destroy another

1146
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,840
fetus now

1147
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,180
We don't like

1148
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:13,760
children

1149
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,620
anyhow

1150
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,160
I've seen

1151
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:16,980
the future

1152
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:17,680
baby

1153
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,240
It is

1154
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:19,620
murder

1155
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:23,980
Things are gonna

1156
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:24,780
slide

1157
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,220
in all

1158
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,020
direction

1159
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,320
Won't be

1160
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:29,840
nothing

1161
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,700
Nothing you can't

1162
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,960
measure anymore

1163
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,620
The prison

1164
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:37,940
The war

1165
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:37,940


1166
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,060
The blizzard of the world

1167
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,780
has crossed the threshold

1168
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,600
And it's overturned

1169
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,560
The order of the soul

1170
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,920
When they say

1171
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:51,840
Repent

1172
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,360
Repent

1173
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,200
Repent

1174
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,340
Repent

1175
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,500
I wonder what they meant

1176
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,160
When they say

1177
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:00,780
They say

1178
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,960
Repent

1179
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,740
Repent

1180
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,660
Repent

1181
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,840
Repent

1182
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,660
I wonder what they meant

1183
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:07,920
I wonder what they meant

1184
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,100
When they say

1185
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:10,940
They say

1186
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,140
Repent

1187
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:13,800
Repent

1188
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,880
Repent

1189
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,480
Repent

1190
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:15,480


1191
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,760
I wonder what they mean

1192
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,360
When they say

1193
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,140
They say

1194
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,000
Repent

1195
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,020
Repent

1196
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:23,920
Repent

1197
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,060
Repent

1198
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,260
Repent

1199
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:32,500
Wait!

1200
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,020
Wait!

1201
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:33,460
Time!

1202
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:33,840
Cut!

1203
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,280
That's a fucking joke right?

1204
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:37,900
Grundum!

1205
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:37,900


1206
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,100
Ah, man, that's old. Oh, it's old stuff there.

1207
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,540
Yeah, it's old, but it's older than that.

1208
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,660
Old show.

1209
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,540
Old, old show.

1210
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,240
So the flutes...

1211
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,980
Torn out by insensitive...

1212
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,780
That's all they had before.

1213
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,040
They ruined everything.

1214
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,820
Insensitive weathermen?

1215
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:57,820
Workmen.

1216
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,480
Weathermen do also hate everything too, though.

1217
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,660
Don't just blame it on the workmen.

1218
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,260
The workers are actually...

1219
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,660
We like the workers.

1220
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,240
Of course we do.

1221
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,120
We hate the rich.

1222
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,280
And we love the...

1223
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,260
We love the poor.

1224
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,040
And we eat the rich.

1225
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,180
That's what Motorhead taught me.

1226
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,720
Eat the rich.

1227
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,000
Delicious.

1228
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,340
Well, they're fattened on grain-fed beef.

1229
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,260
Is that why they wanted to get along with the whole Occupy thing, right?

1230
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,500
Could be.

1231
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,600
They should be eating them.

1232
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,380
Instead of occupying them.

1233
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:37,720
Great.

1234
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,060
I think everybody should...

1235
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,060
I think more of the mess left behind that way.

1236
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,080
If we just...

1237
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,940
I know a way we could cure the homeless problem.

1238
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,360
I know how to do that.

1239
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,700
I have a cure for it.

1240
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,020
Nobody wants to take me seriously, so I'm not even going to say it.

1241
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:58,480
And I certainly won't say it here on the radio, where somebody will steal my idea and make a zillion dollars on it.

1242
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:00,720
And I won't get any.

1243
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,360
So I'm not going to...

1244
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,720
I'm not going to even do that.

1245
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,960
I won't even do it.

1246
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,660
Oh, it don't matter if you back up or not.

1247
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,740
It don't matter if you give up or you give out or give in.

1248
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,900
Whatever you do, man, it's just a cosmic flow, man.

1249
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:14,920
I'll get back.

1250
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,580
I want to get back for a change.

1251
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,280
I want to get back.

1252
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,900
Marconi is ready, you know.

1253
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,260
Get the wires tapping.

1254
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,760
The wires are tapping.

1255
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:24,780
Yeah, yeah.

1256
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:28,520
Marconi is up and around having a cup of tea.

1257
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,340
Just push it to the limit, you know.

1258
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,340
The point of melting, you know.

1259
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,080
You could melt.

1260
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,660
You could melt and fade away.

1261
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,540
Or you could listen to the Puzzling Evidence Show.

1262
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,760
In seven minutes, we do that.

1263
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,820
In a few years, all of you do that.

1264
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,960
Just melt and fade away.

1265
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,520
In seven minutes, I think we're going to have...

1266
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,340
More like about three minutes.

1267
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,820
That was the Puzzling Evidence Show from KPFA.

1268
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,940
Berklee with Philo, Hal, and Puzz.

1269
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:03,480
Before that, the last third of the massive collage Ship of State by Reverend Exister,

1270
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,120
featuring countless artists, and a final song by Leonard Cohen.

1271
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,000
A sermon by Reverend Suds, who has many truly great videos on YouTube

1272
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,820
at channel RevSudsPshaw.

1273
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,640
That's one giant lowercase word.

1274
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,640
RevSudsPSHAW.

1275
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,880
Or look at channel RevStang under Favorites.

1276
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,840
Thanks to Radio Synesthesia on WCSB,

1277
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,800
Reverend Pendulet for the masterpiece.

1278

1280
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,900
And now we end with...

1281
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,520
this touching holiday song by Pantiera, age six,

1282
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:44,000
called Bob Dobbs, the Salesman.

1283
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,360
Bob Dobbs, the Salesman, was a jolly happy soul

1284
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,700
With a wooden pipe and perfect hair

1285
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,040
And a heart as black as coal

1286
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,460
Bob Dobbs, the Salesman, is a fairy tale, they say

1287
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:07,900
He is made of goo, but not of gold

1288
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,020
So Gene, I knew how he came to life one day

1289
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:16,620
There must have been some magic in that old fob pipe they found

1290
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:22,080
For when they placed it in his mouth, he began to screw around

1291
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,560
Bob Dobbs, the Salesman, was alive as he could be

1292
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,880
But he'd soon be dead, cause the Reverend said

1293
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,100
We must kill all bobs we see

1294
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:07,360
Now with the

1295
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:07,680
130 million dollars ricotta Molly knows

1296
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:07,880
press put about pounds at a time

1297
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:07,900
fast

1298
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:22,900
Bad Tabs the salesman knew the exes came that day

1299
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:28,320
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun now before we're blown away

1300
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:34,080
Down to Malaysia with the Stark fist in his hand

1301
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,540
Running here and there crapping everywhere screaming catch me if you can

1302
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:45,000
He led them down to Old Dobbs town right to a traffic cop

1303
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,420
Bob doused him with some pepper spray until he hollered stop

1304
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:56,140
Bob Dobbs the salesman had to hurry on his way

1305
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:01,560
But he waved goodbye saying don't you cry I will be back on next day

1306
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,080
Thanks for watching!
