1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,740
Uh, yes, dear friends.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,460
This will be a different show.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,260
Different than usual.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,660
And so, here it is.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:19,940
In the next 13 or 14 minutes, something good, good, good is coming your way.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,280
So don't leave this radio station.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,880
Let's have a good time together.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,940
He's all I need.

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,380
He's all I need.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,680
Ah, yeah.

11
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,500
I love you.

12
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,240
I love you.

13
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,960
Yes, dear pretty Bob.

14
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,420
It's little old me, Bob.

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,860
And welcome to another edition of...

16
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,060
The Church of the Subgeneral Greater and Minus Three Hour Effect with Lilo and Devan Stant.

00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,860

00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,740

19
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:24,860
Wonder...

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,660
I'll end up becoming something weird.

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,640
You won't become one of us.

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,400

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,220
Or zombie.

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,020
No.

25
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,440
I'll be alright.

26
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,820
I got the dog race good and there's no outside windows.

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,900
Blood belches from the earth.

28
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,780
My lights in the sky rebuke thee.

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,060
The children of heaven and the angels from hell are among thee.

30
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,200
Spreading lies and deception.

31
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,780
They turn not as they go.

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,100
And the angels

33
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,100


34
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,780

been one of those days i know all about it bob called me he has found it in that great oversized

40
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,920
heart of his to forgive bob with a heart bleeding sensitivity that he unfurls like a flag

41
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:53,280
because he's such a rather dull quite uninspired average type guy with an appetite the kind of a

42
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:06,380
guy that could be satisfied by a horse that's it that's all of it you were in love with Bob Bob was

frankly I was in no mood for golf it was a good deal for Bob too you know that

46
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,380
I'd appreciate dropping the subject of Bob once and for all

47
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,560
we're gonna kill Bob yeah he's got a huge huge direction

48
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,940

49
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,160

I got exactly what I wanted

54
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,260

59
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,420

64
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:42,840


65
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:42,860
hail

66
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:42,860


67
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,880
I love Bob's King Pew

68
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,360
I know that Bob, I know that Bob is a good cause

69
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,860
Bob took me inside his heart

70
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,660
And I accepted him into my life

71
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,100
And I'm here to testify, friends

72
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,620
What that man has done for me

73
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,680
If you can really call him a man

74
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,440
Many people say he's almost like a god

75
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,480
I don't think so

76
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,880
Of course I don't know Bob

77
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,900
But I do know Bob in certain ways

78
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,540
And I think you understand what I'm talking about

79
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:34,780
Yes, Bob, he filled me with the sort of a spirit I never knew I had

80
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,300
I knew it wasn't coming from him

81
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,300
It was coming from inside me

82
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,000
Bob was giving it to me

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,440
He was laying hands on me from afar

84
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,360
He might have been up in that great big jet plane

85
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,880
Or he might have been down on Skid Row

86
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,580
Giving some bum a haircut

87
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,560
But all I know is

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,200
It was Bob

89
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,700
It was Bob

90
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,100
Bob

91
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,900
Yeah, he's smiling

92
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,160
You never see Bob frown

93
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,040
You know that

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,760
Behind that amazing smile

95
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,680
There lies a mind like a steel trap

96
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,980
I'm sure he makes mistakes like

97
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,620
What he did with those young women that time

98
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,640
But I think the newspapers exaggerated that

99
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,340
And I know that Bob will do all of us fine in the long run

100
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:38,020
In fact, I think I know that we really need Bob in our lives

101
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,060
In our lives

102
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,980
In nineteen years

103
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,620
In nineteen eighty-one

104
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,040
And in nineteen eighty-four

105
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,400
Hi little brother

106
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,220
And in nineteen ninety-one

107
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,980
And in nineteen ninety-five

108
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,900
When they bring the conspiracy to its heels

109
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:06,460
And in that wondrous year that we know is gonna come all too soon upon us

110
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,480
And we'll leave our earthly things behind

111
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,920
And we'll go and join them

112
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:25,100
And then, you and I

113
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:32,220
And there'll be mountains

114
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,460
We'll find information

115
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:32,460


116
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:32,460


117
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:32,460


118
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:32,460


119
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:32,460


120
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:32,460


121
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,440
We'll see

122
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,900
What's there, I don't know

123
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:41,900


124
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,560
Seat at the right hand of Bob or the left hand of Bob depending on whether we're

125
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,300
reward ends or mediocrity but I don't want to get lost in the dogma I want to

126
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,760
tell you something blesses my heart and it's Bob

127
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,800
yeah I can hear I can hear him talking off there in the distance saying come to

128
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,840
me Tommy come to me and lay down your material things because you know they

129
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,540
aren't gonna mean much to you after that divine year and after I lay my hand

130
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:24,320
on you and lead you up the steps of that magnificent craft that will board it and go

131
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:33,400
to the stars my friends to the stars well happy Father's Day to all my fellow

132
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,400
dads there aren't that many of us I have a touching little story I talked to

133
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,820
Pappy today and I talked to my father and I talked to my mother and I talked to my

134
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,380
son the Hollywood director I talked to my daughter

135
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:50,600
Syvit who earlier today she told me this touching story earlier today

136
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:58,120
Syvit took her to kids my grandkids to a play center and there my

137
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:05,940
grandson Derman saw an old feller that looked kind like me had a gray goatee and

138
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,800
mustache and he said that be da my daughter said no honey I just made sure that 됐a daست

139
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:10,800


140
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:10,800


141
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:10,800


142
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,680
Looks like D-Daw.

143
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,920
Not D-Daw?

144
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,260
Afraid not.

145
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,440
But when they were ready to go,

146
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,560
little Dermon didn't want to go until he'd gone over to the guy

147
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,320
and after some explanation from my daughter,

148
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,360
gave the guy a hug.

149
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,360
And that made her weepy.

150
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,300
And you better believe when she told me,

151
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,680
I got all weepy too.

152
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,860
And speaking of weepy,

153
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,120
I have an announcement.

154
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,460
This is actually a news release that we put out

155
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,080
on all the various official subgenius Facebook pages

156
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,080
and Google group forums last Thursday.

157
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,020
I'm going to quote and read from my own press release.

158
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,940
News release.

159
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,680
Might as well turn the music off for this.

160
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,360
There.

161
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,000
Reverend Ivan Stang announced today his retirement from the Subgenius Foundation,

162
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,060
citing his ill demeanor and declining patience with internal conflict

163
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,140
among the members of the Subgenius Church,

164
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,020
appointing longtime collaborator Dr. Katahdin Legume

165
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,540
to the position of president and CEO of the Subgenius Foundation.

166
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,600
Reverend Stang will continue to produce his nationally syndicated radio program,

167
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,520
The Hour of Slack.

168
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,760
Actually,

169
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,660
friends,

170
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,660
I think I've changed my mind about that.

171
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,620
And will continue to attend personal speaking engagements.

172
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,240
Reverend Stang later commented,

173
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,180
quote,

174
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,200
I'm sick to death of dealing with idiots

175
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,100
when my time can be better spent

176
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,040
trying to capture the vicious jaggy.

177
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,400
And by the way,

178
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,560
Stangor slew three great jaggy last night

179
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,060
in less than an hour,

180
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,700
by the way.

181
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,920
To continue,

182
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,100
Dr. Legume immediately applied for a job at the Subgenius Foundation,

183
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,100


184
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,100


185
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,700
and he appointed Priestess Pisces as his vice president

186
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,800
and stated that his first order of business

187
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,460
is to examine the membership roles and, quote,

188
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
weed out the dead weight and the malcontents.

189
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,000
Legume announced that there will be a huge addendum

190
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,200
to the church's list of banned members

191
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,400
prohibited from attending the Subgenius Foundation's annual X-Day event

192
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,720
to be released to the public on June 30th.

193
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,700
This, quote,

194
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,020
this is the beginning of a new era for the Subgenius Church,

195
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,840
unquote.

196
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,700
Legume stated earlier today,

197
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,620
quote,

198
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,780
my vision of the Subgenius Church

199
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,540
is a radical departure from the tolerant policies of the past.

200
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,360
While I expect it to be rough at the beginning

201
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,420
as the flock gets used to the idea

202
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,900
of a more controlled environment

203
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,500
and more selective and stringent requirements

204
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,240
for membership and participation in the Subgenius community,

205
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,720
they will realize that, as always,

206
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,840
my way is the best way,

207
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,980
the only way.

208
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,400
I expect this will be a new golden age

209
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,420
for the Subgenius Church, unquote.

210
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,380
Dr. Legume will be receiving a six-figure salary

211
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,700
commensurate with his duties and experience.

212
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,960
And so I've got reruns ready to take us through X-Day, friends.

213
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,120
Oh, the credits.

214
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,260
The music at the start was Mark Mothersbaugh.

215
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,200
The collages were almost all by the late Fernand and Andy Lemur.

216
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,360
And that song, Bob Cleave,

217
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,160
that was me at age 28 or so

218
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,220
with Pope Sternodocs on guitar

219
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,340
and Hellswami Satellite Weavers on violin.

220
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,260
In some ways, that was the first recorded Bob hymn.

221
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,240
And, in fact, what follows is the last Bob music

222
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,540
that I composed,

223
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,560
using a lot of Lemur's work, too.

224
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,740
Praise Bob.

225
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,960
Here's Bob.

226
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,440
Pope.

227
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,420
He presented the sonorous pieces.

228
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:14,420


229
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,000
Sub tuv部分 di

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,000


231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,000


232
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,000


233
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,900
Gukl? Gleich?

234
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,800
Gleich?

235
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,600
Looks like our first caller.

236
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,840
And now we've got Dr. Legume on the line.

237
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,500
And Priestess Spices.

238
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,120
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

239
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,540
Dave.

240
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,240
A full house.

241
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,260
And.

242
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,540
Good to hear you all, my subordinates.

243
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:20,480
Well, we were hoping to be in a respectful subordination position.

244
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,220
I mean.

245
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,440
I think a leadership.

246
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,280
But, sir.

247
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,260
Dr. Legume.

248
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,240
Dave, you heard the news, right?

249
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,820
Dr. Legume.

250
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,840
I basically am quitting this foolishness and letting Dr.

251
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,800
I've handed.

252
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,400
I've actually literally signed over the trademarks to Dr.

253
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:38,840
Legume.

254
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,560
He's got.

255
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,920
His name is on the checkbooks now.

256
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,900
And Pisces, who's also on here, is the vice president.

257
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,500
I guess you can still be the treasurer.

258
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,800
And you already telegraphed it earlier.

259
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,820
He doesn't mean to do my villain laugh out loud.

260
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,960
You said you were thinking of it.

261
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,780
I wouldn't want to give people the wrong idea.

262
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,940
No, I have absolute faith in Dr.

263
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,320
Legume.

264
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,640
I've known him since like 1991 or something.

265
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,420
And I've known him since the early 2000s.

266
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:07,960
I've known him since the early 2000s.

267
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:07,960


268
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:07,960


269
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:07,960


270
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:07,960


271
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,500
That's more.

272
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,840
That's about two thirds of the history of the church's subgenius.

273
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,560
Anyway, we have a lot of ground to cover.

274
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,180
And I think.

275
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,620
I think Dr.

276
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,800
Legume had a prepared.

277
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,420
Announcement.

278
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,560
Which I will.

279
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,540
Now.

280
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,140
I have a prepared announcement.

281
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,880
Hello, dear friends.

282
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,100
As your newly appointed iron fisted overlord of the subgenius church.

283
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,760
I am here on the hour of slack this evening to make the following announcement.

284
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,060
Effective immediately.

285
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:57,220
Membership in the church of the subgenius will be changed to $35 per year.

286
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,240
With this increase, you will receive a monthly glossy print copy of the new and improved

287
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,840
Stark.

288
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,600
Fist of removal magazine.

289
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,560
And an annual.

290
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,820
Dobbs shafted me again.

291
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,540
T-shirt.

292
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,000
Also, starting with X day 16 next year.

293
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,700
X day will be free of charge to all card carrying members.

294
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,120
Also, I have signed a deal with Simon and Schuster to publish a new subgenius book.

295
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,480
Entirely written and illustrated by me.

296
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,620
To be entitled.

297
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,640
Blood.

298
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,820
Honor.

299
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,860
Guts.

300
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,640
And Slack.

301
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,720
How to survive the end times without losing your sense of humor.

302
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,160
As well as a new full length subgenius recruitment video.

303
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,220
The path to slack.

304
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,720
Boogie on down the road.

305
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:00,560
All members will receive a new high quality embossed gold membership card.

306
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,900
You'll learn the secret handshake.

307
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,820
And the secret.

308
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:12,480
You'll get a 24 carat gold electroplated signet ring to identify yourself to other subgeni.

309
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:18,340
Members will be eligible for travel discounts with several major airlines.

310
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,340
Greyhound and Amtrak.

311
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,560
And special triple A discount.

312
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,700
Good at restaurants and hotels all over the world.

313
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,120
But that's not all.

314
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,820
Order now and get two.

315
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,580
Yes.

316
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,180
Two memberships.

317
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,360
For the price of one.

318
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,660
With additional shipping and handling.

319
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,440
You'll get hot sex from the creature of your choice.

320
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,060
Grow a bigger penis and or breasts.

321
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,760
This is the beginning of a new golden age.

322
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,820
I am the big boss of this area.

323
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,540
We will march into Dobbs Town.

324
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,620
On a road of bones.

325
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,980
I am your leader.

326
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,920
Give me slack or you'll kill me.

327
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,080
I am this creature in my way.

328
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,220
I am knocked and rolled in gold.

329
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,320
You will eat all my shit.

330
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,960
I am God.

331
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,320
I am God.

332
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,820
Good lord.

333
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,780
Wow.

334
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,900
I think he was saying.

335
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,280
Sorry.

336
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,160
Got a little over excited there.

337
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,520
Were you saying.

338
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,980
I'm not sure what you're thinking about Poopoo Captain.

339
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,780
Hard to believe after all these years.

340
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,280
You know how I started out alone subgenius in my hometown.

341
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,020
And now I'm president of the subgenius foundation.

342
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,280
The Dobbs Head trademark belongs to me now.

343
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,680
And I have total control of the amassed wealth of the church.

344
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,020
I feel like Scrooge McDuck swimming around in a vault filled with gold.

345
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,060
It just seems so unreal to me.

346
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,500
Like any other man in the world.

347
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,500


348
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,500


349
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,500


350
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,500


351
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,500


352
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,500


353
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,500


354
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,500


355
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,500


356
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,500


357
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,500


358
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,500


359
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,500


360
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,840
Any moment now I'll wake up and realize it's a hoax.

361
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,040
I mean if I read this on the internet.

362
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,900
I would never have believed it.

363
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,900
It just stinks of the kind of shenanigans one would expect from a pack of subgenius

364
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,300
jokers like us.

365
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,540
If I didn't know better.

366
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,020
I'd think this was just some kind of ridiculous subintelligence test.

367
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,300
To see who'd lose their grip and freak out.

368
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,480
Or some kind of cruel test.

369
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:31,780
Or torture.

370
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,740
To put the screws to the many jealous haters out there.

371
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,120
But what kind of jerks would pull a stunt like that?

372
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,280
Jerks like us!

373
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,200
Praise Legume!

374
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,940
She kind of...

375
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,140
Or praise...

376
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,640
Pardon me.

377
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,120
Praise Legume.

378
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,300
No, no, no, no.

379
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,900
We don't praise Legume here.

380
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,780
We praise Bob here.

381
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,680
This is the church of the subgenius.

382
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,880
We don't praise the preachers.

383
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,140
We praise Bob.

384
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:01,620
We don't praise the preachers.

385
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:01,620


386
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:01,820
I don't think Bob.

387
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,240
Bob Higham!

388
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,220
That's one of the biggest problems with the church of the subgenius.

389
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,440
One of the biggest fails that keeps people utterly ignorant.

390
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,500
I mean all over the internet people have been losing their minds.

391
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,800
Oh Legume is such a jerk.

392
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,360
Oh this is the end of the church of the subgenius.

393
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,880
Oh Stang is the church of the subgenius.

394
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,940
I read that I was the Jesus of the church.

395
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:26,900
Yes.

396
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,460
They utterly allow themselves to be led to worship the messenger while they're in the

397
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:31,460


398
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,420
church while utterly ignoring the message.

399
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,280
And as you yourself once said, Reverend Stang, the problem with many people is that instead

400
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,980
of looking where the finger is pointing, they prefer to suck the finger.

401
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,560
I got news for him too, that ain't a finger.

402
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,440
You know you never can tell where it's going to be lodged next too.

403
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,540
I think, Mal, that you've got the trade mark.

404
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,260
It's kind of like the Spear of Destiny.

405
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,440
And since you've offered so many great things, I think you ought to stick with it.

406
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:07,060
Oh, but, but, Lone Cow, weren't you listening?

407
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,280
What kind of jerks would pull a stunt like that?

408
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,100
Jerks like us, that's exactly what we've done.

409
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:24,640
Jerks like me, that will be my next autobiographical novel, Jerk Like Me.

410
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:30,280
Actually, I was going to do one called Pink Like Me for about when I passed for pink for all those years.

411
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:36,120
Yes, friends, I'm afraid it's time for the confession.

412
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,280
Maybe I should put on the...

413
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:48,780
This is actually last year's X-Day music, Pisces and Princess Wee, who couldn't be here tonight.

414
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,040
It's Mama's Day for her.

415
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,700
I'll tell you what, though.

416
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,000
After seeing the responses...

417
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,460
To our little prank...

418
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:12,080
I'm tempted to go ahead and retire and make you and Pisces in charge.

419
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,920
Except I wouldn't do that to my best friends.

420
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,360
Well, thank you.

421
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,260
I could see Pisces dressed as Ava Brown with the kind of hair pulled back a little bit.

422
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,120
I could tap Ava Brown.

423
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:27,460
Yeah.

424
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,200
A little highlight, a little blonde streak.

425
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,880
She's got a little bit of a pinkish hair and stuff.

426
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,640
I actually, tomorrow, for the...

427
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,540
You know, I told those Facebookies that they should tune in tonight.

428
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,220
And knowing that they'd be horribly frustrated because WCSB can only stream to 33 people.

429
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,020
And we're maxed out now.

430
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,740
In fact, it says that we have 35 out of a total of 35.

431
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,120
That's the most we've ever had on this show.

432
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,520
Anyway.

433
00:22:59,560 --> 00:22:59,980
Anyway.

434
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,220
And the rest of them are all going,

435
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,300
Damn it!

436
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,140
Sputter!

437
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:04,840
Spew!

438
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,960
Anyway, here's my second news release.

439
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,700
And this is the one I'm going to put on the big Facebook pages tomorrow.

440
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,700
And I'll run through this as fast as I can.

441
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,460
Because, god darn it, turned out some people couldn't take a joke.

442
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,800
Okay, here's my first release.

443
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,700
We hate to have to reveal this so soon,

444
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,840
but the hoax, which was published only on subgenius sites,

445
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,620
is already making the news,

446
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,120
which should tell you,

447
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,680
something about the dependability of the news.

448
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,540
That news release about me retiring was just another in a series of subintelligence tests.

449
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,020
Indeed, a gullibility test in this case.

450
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,900
We really thought it too preposterous for anybody to believe.

451
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,380
And yet, despite previous similar tests,

452
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,920
we're again sincerely surprised to see how many

453
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,240
ahem ahem ahem

454
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,780
subgeniuses, quote unquote,

455
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,620
failed utterly,

456
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,400
to see through what should have been grossly obvious as a put-on,

457
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,180
especially in the context of Church of the Subgenius.

458
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,840
But every now and then we have to do things like this

459
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,100
to sweep out the wishful thinkers,

460
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,760
the gimme bobs,

461
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,580
the eagerly gullible,

462
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,000
and the new species.

463
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,340
Those too dumb even to be a subgenius,

464
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,820
which is something we previously imagined to be a contradiction in terms.

465
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,100
Some folks can't handle or even read the news,

466
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,100


467
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,740
and some folks can't even recognize satire

468
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,980
unless it has a laugh track or a smiley face icon attached to it.

469
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,360
And those are not the kind of people who are going to be benefiting from Bob's Church.

470
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:45,860
Indeed, many such people have in fact become huge liabilities in times past.

471
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,660
You might call it spring cleaning.

472
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,580
Weeding out the believer types and or the slacklessly judgmental,

473
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,520
or rather setting up a situation whereby they weed themselves out

474
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,080
in reflex business.

475
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,560
But hurt rage quitting increases the likelihood of the excess coming through this year finally.

476
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,220
For as it says in the prescriptures, my friends,

477
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,020
the conclusion jumper shall be at the judgment.

478
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,340
Now again, for those with hearing or reading comprehension disabilities,

479
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,760
I'm not retiring.

480
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,460
We just wanted to see how various people,

481
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,500
especially certain chronically jealous haters,

482
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,960
would react to a transparently absurd,

483
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,340
absurd hoax.

484
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,480
We were eager to see who would want to believe it.

485
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,060
And now friends,

486
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,140
the most hilariously indignant responses have been selected for reading on tonight's Hour of Slack.

487
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,360
One of those that you chose.

488
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:51,160
I wanted to point out that Dr. Legume actually wrote the press release,

489
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,340
and I wanted to give special thanks, Clint,

490
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,980
to the Chronic Whiner,

491
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,440
who did everything he possibly could to get himself banned,

492
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,700
and yet failed even at that.

493
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,880
What he did manage to do was inspire this particular test session,

494
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,020
and there will be another pop quiz tomorrow.

495
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,620
Thank you.

496
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,420
And now to the revealing responses,

497
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,540
which I would love to start with,

498
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,940
with my favorite kook,

499
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,700
which would be our dear friend,

500
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,320
Michael Alcandor.

501
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,880
Who said...

502
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,700
Legume is going to crash and burn.

503
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,000
I've killed the Church of a subgenius,

504
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,900
and all of the Satanists behind it.

505
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,540
Legume is half senile and brain damaged,

506
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,100
and he will run what little remains of this Church right into the ground.

507
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,760
I'm gloating, yay!

508
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,140
Congratulations there, Priestess Pisces,

509
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,300
on changing the F-word to screw and the S-word to crappy.

510
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,540
Well, Stan, might I read the one which I like,

511
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,220
which is from a friend of mine, actually.

512
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,680
Yeah, I think I know which one that is.

513
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,700
A former member of Yes Owen,

514
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,020
who actually, I think, got the joke,

515
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,720
but it was still kind of a funny quote.

516
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,620
And he goes, I'll do it in his voice,

517
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,280
as the peyote kid...

518
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,600
Bad choice, Stan.

519
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,480
A stalk of celery would have been a better choice.

520
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,960
A stalk of celery would be a...

521
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,680
a better choice.

522
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,980
I take that one seriously.

523
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,840
Well, why did...

524
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,940
That guy used to be the guitar...

525
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:38,080
He was in ESO at the early days, right?

526
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,040
Mm-hmm.

527
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,020
Yeah, Keith Cofran.

528
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,840
A stalk... actually, he said,

529
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,820
a stalk of celery would have made a better choice.

530
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,920
Well, that's a common mistake amongst many stalks.

531
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,720
Yes.

532
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,680
Oh, here's a good one.

533
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,480
Steve Wilson says,

534
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,560
It's a sad day to find out

535
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,620
that even the upper echelon of the one true church

536
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,500
contains a few pinks.

537
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,500
Here's one of my favorites.

538
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,780
Little Reverend Alex Thompson.

539
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,500
I really hate that passive-aggressive trait

540
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,740
that makes a person, too,

541
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,420
bottle up all their annoyance,

542
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,840
and then they explode and act irrationally.

543
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,300
Man, it's the worst.

544
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,680
I like this one,

545
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,380
because it sort of implies that...

546
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,940
Well, it implies so much.

547
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,460
Both Cephas Moonshine.

548
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,000
Having been on the receiving end of Sting's temper,

549
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,900
I welcome the new era.

550
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,600
You know, I can't remember which one that is.

551
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,240
There have been so many.

552
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,220
Oh, and I should do...

553
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,600
He's on the receiving end of your temper.

554
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,580
He welcomes me.

555
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,120
But, yeah, exactly.

556
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,280
It's like, you know,

557
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,600
they seem to be making assumptions.

558
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,020
And you know what ass-sumptions do.

559
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,000
Anyway...

560
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,380
True.

561
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,880
I should do Bob Robertson,

562
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,720
who's the most active kook on our former news group,

563
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,540
Alt.Slack, which we abandoned to the kooks.

564
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,640
He's in Dallas, I'm pretty sure.

565
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,840
In fact, I vaguely suspect that I may know him.

566
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,480
He said,

567
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,020
Ha! I know this news release is fake,

568
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,100
because Legume is dead and has been for many years.

569
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,120
The rest of it I can believe, with some caveats.

570
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,620
And this guy actually does, as far as I can tell,

571
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,620
he really does believe that you're dead, Dr. Legume.

572
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,840
It's true that Legume has died twice.

573
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,680
But don't get us wrong.

574
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,320
We're not lying when we say he has been dead.

575
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,360
Yeah, that's true.

576
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,780
But he can still believe this.

577
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,520
With some caveats.

578
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,100
I'd like to know what those caveats are.

579
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,560
Yeah, they never get that specific.

580
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,900
Is that like caviar, or is that something that you eat or smell,

581
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,060
or is it what kind of sensory pleasure?

582
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,720
With some toasted cheese sandwiches,

583
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,160
or with a bottle of wine?

584
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,740
I don't...

585
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,300
Which caveat?

586
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,420
Well, let's see.

587
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,400
I think you would have a red wine with caviat.

588
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,140
Here's one I really liked.

589
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,540
A Dana Boul...

590
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,180
Bourd...

591
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,780
Oh, God, I can't believe this name.

592
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,560
Bourdwell.

593
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,160
Congratulations.

594
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,020
You've now become like a regular church.

595
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,720
You know, the kind of church religion that subgenius was started to parody.

596
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,840
Slacked my ass.

597
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,040
By the way, you can say ass on the air if you mean a...

598
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,520
A donkey.

599
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,000
Yeah.

600
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,500
Yeah.

601
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,900
Of course, even though we were talking about Legume being dead,

602
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,760
Bucky made the point that I liked Legume better when he was dead.

603
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:50,960
Did he?

604
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,840
Yes.

605
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,260
Oh, you added the A part because he's the north of the border sound.

606
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,640
What'd you say, Dr. Legume?

607
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,560
That I like Bucky better when he's sober and remains in Canada.

608
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:12,140
Actually, he helped me out at one time about ten years ago and then dropped the ball majorly.

609
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,400
Oh, I liked this one guy.

610
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,440
Ralphie Napalm goes, I want my 30 bucks back.

611
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:24,620
And Dietrich Dillinger says, well then, Ralphie, please return your eternal salvation first.

612
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:34,600
And, you know, to be fair, a lot of people did get it and said some really funny stuff.

613
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:44,500
And if anybody wants to see the funny stuff and the butt hurt stuff, you can look at the giant 16,000 member church of the subgenius page on Facebook.

614
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,580
Not to be confused with the 40 fake ones.

615
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,560
That only have a few members.

616
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,580
Or the subgenius foundation page, which is official.

617
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,100
A Nikki Death Chick didn't call in.

618
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,440
I was kind of hoping she would.

619
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,440
She's one of the people who's been...

620
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,740
It turns out in the long run she actually believed it.

621
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,260
She forgot, you know, that it was a hoax.

622
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:17,540
Nikki, like Dr. Legume, Priestess Pisces and myself, has the ability to tick off 100 people.

623
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,120
With just a sentence.

624
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,960
Mainly because it's a funny sentence and it's true.

625
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,620
But that hurts them more than anything.

626
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,520
And ironically enough, Nikki, who actually...

627
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:37,000
There was a Nikki hating club of lonely men out there on alt slack at one time.

628
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:42,680
And they're all gone, but Nikki is the co-administrator of all the main subgenius pages.

629
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,840
As are Legume and Pisces and myself.

630
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,720
So, you're talking...

631
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,580
Another funny thing about this is a whole lot of the time these people were insulting Legume.

632
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,480
It was actually something I had written posing as Legume.

633
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,780
There's a whole section of those later on.

634
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,400
Now poor Justin Jacobson said,

635
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:13,340
If subgenius membership requires any additional expense or effort, I'll just let mine lapse and expire.

636
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,440
In all fairness, it will be the most fun cult I've ever quit.

637
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,080
Poor Justin is also known for blurting out the phrase,

638
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:26,680
All activists are just terrorists with weapons.

639
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,560
I had to ask him if...

640
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:36,120
About, you know, peace activists or the American Rifle Association or the police.

641
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,600
But...

642
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,200
Well, you know...

643
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,580
I was wondering about stinging them.

644
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:47,080
They think that the subgenius membership requires additional expense or effort.

645
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,260
Should quit.

646
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,900
Because it does require additional expense and effort.

647
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:01,080
Unless you're willing to just join and sit on your little flat ass for the entire course of your membership.

648
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,880
But where's the slack in that?

649
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,620
That's the funny thing about these gripers is I don't recognize the name of any of them.

650
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:12,440
I think they're, as far as I can tell, they're a bunch of gimme bobs.

651
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,440
They can't spell Bob's name right.

652
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,400
They can't spell subgenius right.

653
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,580
And here they are telling us our business!

654
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,340
And it's like, I get the impression most of them never actually joined the church in the first place.

655
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:32,120
They just found some stuff on the internet and went, well, they heard it was cool somewhere.

656
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,200
And suddenly, now that there's this...

657
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,980
Well, the same thing we've been doing all along.

658
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,300
A put on.

659
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,720
But it was a put on that they didn't want to hear.

660
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,380
Well, there's also the fact that only Lagoon was convinced.

661
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:50,680
I assume that's from the cross-dressing you guys have been doing, you were talking about earlier.

662
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:56,540
People getting you confused and you posing as each other under different circumstances.

663
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:02,660
You know, Dave, what always confused me is that everyone has gone through this thing about how Lagoon is this horrible bully.

664
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,140
And that I brainwash people.

665
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,000
And that sort of confuses me because that implies that staying is really stupid.

666
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,080
Well, we didn't call it Church of the Genius.

667
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,360
You know, weird little gizmos to use to brainwash people.

668
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,220
Which we know you don't really have.

669
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,020
Actually, Pisces has a couple of great brainwashing tools right up front.

670
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,880
But that is besides the point.

671
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,640
And Lagoon, let's face it, I'm scared to death of him.

672
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,540
I mean, just look at him.

673
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,840
He's like Frankenstein.

674
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,620
And I'm like the Wolfman.

675
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,020
The Wolfman.

676
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,040
You're both cuddly.

677
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,920
Well, I do have the giant...

678
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,340
He's got the giant, stitched together body parts like Frankenstein's monster.

679
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,100
He does.

680
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,540
He actually does.

681
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,200
Well, no, they're talking about the bolts in your neck.

682
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,280
I think.

683
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,320
Those are electrodes.

684
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,320
All right, the electrodes in your neck.

685
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,420
I had to be corrected on that point by Nenslow myself one time.

686
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,780
They're not bolts.

687
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,600
They're electrodes, you idiot.

688
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,840
Oh, sorry, master.

689
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,140
That's what made for the nice background music.

690
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:20,380
But really, I mean, those big official subgenius business pages on Facebook,

691
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,740
it's all Bobbies and Gimme Bobs that can't even put the quotes on Bob's name

692
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,180
or the capital G in subgenius.

693
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,700
And that kind of indicates how much attention they paid to the word of Bob.

694
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,520
Not a whole hell of a lot of attention.

695
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,500
They heard somewhere it was supposed to be cool,

696
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,000
and they picked up the buzzwords, beep them if they can't take a joke,

697
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,780
and that's, and how many times today have we read the phrase,

698
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,380
I for one welcome our.

699
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,120
Overlord.

700
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,760
Yes.

701
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,100
Well.

702
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,300
I mean, to Sud's credit, he said it first.

703
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,200
But one thing about it is the idea of placing your anus firmly in front of the screen

704
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,740
and parting your cheeks and saying, go ahead.

705
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,480
People will always take your word for it.

706
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,260
People will always go ahead.

707
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,240
It's as if you've asked for it and you did ask for it.

708
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,780
Well, you did, you know, and that's true.

709
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,800
But the key is to know when to put the cheeks against the screen.

710
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,020
And that's the test that a lot of people just didn't pass.

711
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,660
Well, you know, it's.

712
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,580
And the counterpoint, though, has to make you kind of nervous

713
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:39,680
to think how many people so easily were willing to give it up just.

714
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,840
And worship their new evil overlord.

715
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,680
Well, that was a good sign.

716
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,980
That was the part I liked.

717
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,280
It was like, well, if they don't trust my judgment, then they better.

718
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,040
Well, the point of it is it's all Bob.

719
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:55,800
It is.

720
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,040
It's true that it's not.

721
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:04,480
It's this isn't one of those churches where you have to have an inter translator or priest between you and the Lord.

722
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,580
Because Bob's not as demanding as the Lord.

723
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,660
And you can be honest.

724
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,240
You can be alone with Bob all by yourself.

725
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,920
And it's not like.

726
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,600
Recording it.

727
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,220
Huh?

728
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,780
If you're alone with Bob, I recommend recording.

729
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,720
Really?

730
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:24,480
Because it can be a very, very litigious situation in there when everything's dead.

731
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,600
Yeah.

732
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,780
A lot of sports coaches have run into problems with that.

733
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:37,040
I have to go one further and say that if you're alone with Bob, videotape it and let him hold the camera.

734
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,740
I've seen too many.

735
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,900
Too many of those.

736
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,340
I should go into that.

737
00:38:43,580 --> 00:39:01,460
You know, one thing that caused caused us to go ahead and and admit to the hoax so soon rather than waiting until X Day was that this whole thing was printed in boing boing dot com as news, which horrified me.

738
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,680
In fact, Cory Doctorow was the one who reported it as news.

739
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,080
And I actually I got on there and said, Jesus, you people believe anything.

740
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,600
And they continued to believe it even after I said that.

741
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,460
In fact, here's I've got to do this one.

742
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,080
This one guy.

743
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,960
I remember this guy, Brad Hicks.

744
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,220
He was at an X Day in 1997 or something.

745
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,020
I was an early subgenius.

746
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:31,840
One of my rats made it onto the semi official or official X Day video, I'm told.

747
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,660
But I can't wrap my head around the fact that we're still in the same place.

748
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,580
We're still telling this joke in 2012.

749
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,160
X Day was 16 years ago.

750
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,480
We live in a world without slack.

751
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,500
We've been living in a world without slack for a very long time.

752
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,540
Fast slack is all the slack you're going to get.

753
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,220
Get used to it already.

754
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:54,740
Seriously.

755
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:59,880
The Book of the Subgenius was spot on parody of the 1980s.

756
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,560
But that was a long, long time ago.

757
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,640
How is it still even remotely funny?

758
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,600
Vaguely funny.

759
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,920
Well, it still provokes comments like yours, Brad.

760
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:20,340
Not really that, but we were just a parody of the 80s and early 90s.

761
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,060
This is a parody of the last 10,000 years of human evolution.

762
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,600
No kidding.

763
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:32,020
And frankly, Book of the Subgenius wasn't the very last thing that the Church of the Subgenius did.

764
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,640
Last week's Hour of Slack was the last thing.

765
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,860
The last thing the Church of the Subgenius did, if you're talking about things like that.

766
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,800
And there's been a new one every week.

767
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,520
And there have been five books since then.

768
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,880
And about 20 videotapes.

769
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,940
Only one of which really counts, but that's neither here nor there.

770
00:40:52,060 --> 00:41:02,720
Now we get to Simon Kallner, who was so butthurt that he commented at least three times that I've seen so far.

771
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:09,440
I've loved the Church for at least 20 years now, and now it's being run by giant douche-beeps.

772
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:17,860
I'll always be a subgenius, and you can stick your annual fee directly up your beep.

773
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,040
You put the trill on the annual thing there.

774
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,260
Well, I'm a spelling Nazi.

775
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:30,140
On top of being every other kind of Slack Nazi, I'm a serious spelling Nazi.

776
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:36,200
I don't care how you spell Hitler or Nixon or Romney or Obama or Boomer.

777
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,560
God, so original.

778
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,540
But I do care how you spell J.R. Bob Dobbs.

779
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,160
Or subgenius.

780
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,660
Well, there are trademark issues.

781
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,560
For example, the same gentleman misspelled subgenius in this street.

782
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,000
Like I said, subgenius for life.

783
00:41:54,500 --> 00:42:00,120
But screw your $35 a year and your crappy artwork and Pisces and Normandy.

784
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,120


785
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,720
I'm a annoying bitchy.

786
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,820
I will always skip through the parts of our Slack episodes they're on anyway.

787
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,980
What, are they going to revoke my tattoos as well if I don't pay?

788
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:13,240
I'll be downloading books and videos from now on, too.

789
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,540
Not because I want them.

790
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,220
I just want to be a beep.

791
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,720
And I've already made my own shirts.

792
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,140
Legume and Pisces are as pink as it gets.

793
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,180
Subgeniuses are not corporations, and corporations are not subgeniuses, man.

794
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,060
That was only his second one.

795
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,340
That wasn't enough.

796
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,240
He had to come...

797
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,180
He spelled subgenius wrong in that one.

798
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,100
He spelled it wrong three different ways, in fact.

799
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,920
But on his third one, he was really getting upset.

800
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:50,180
I think maybe the picture of Legume standing on the pile of money really got him.

801
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,900
Yes, if Stang really left the church, why would he leave it to two pink tars?

802
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:02,800
The only time I fast-forward through an hour of Slack is when I face having to hear either one of their bullcrap rants.

803
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,700
When was the last time I played rants by you guys?

804
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,720
Last X Day.

805
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,980
I have my Bob swag.

806
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,280
God, this is just so... gag me with a spoon.

807
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:21,940
I have my Bob swag, my subgenius tattoos, and a whole lot of Slack.

808
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,660
He doesn't capitalize Slack, either.

809
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,280
My daughter loves Bob.

810
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,640
Bob, spelled capital B, little O, big B. Dead giveaway.

811
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,700
And she is only two and a half years old.

812
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:40,340
She'll grow up knowing that this is when the true church died and was replaced by a giant poop with a pipe.

813
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,960
Actually, I improved on his gag there.

814
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,180
Mr. Hankey type of gag.

815
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:48,780
Oh, God.

816
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,820
Well, that's what happens when you poke people with a shit too much.

817
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,880
Some of them will lash back at the cage.

818
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,200
Others will start chewing on their legs to get rid of the evil shackle.

819
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,840
You know, they're confused and alarmed.

820
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,920
There's a lot of confusion and alarm in this, yeah.

821
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,200
I mean, I don't get it.

822
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,460
But then maybe...

823
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:16,760
Well, what was the one you got there, Lagoon?

824
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,340
Oh, yeah, Daniel Miller.

825
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,700
Here we have...

826
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,720
Ugh, this is just like Vatican II.

827
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,500
I can't take this again.

828
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,360
I can't help but wonder about that.

829
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:38,960
How Vatican II had destroyed his faith in the Catholic Church, and so he came to us.

830
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,960
Bad idea.

831
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,280
Vatican II, that was like in 1965.

832
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,520
Right, I was gonna say...

833
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,960
But again, you know, that's that whole thing.

834
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,420
It's...

835
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,000
What was he doing for those 30 years?

836
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:55,760
Brian...

837
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,140
Was he a member of the Manson family?

838
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,800
Well, that's possible.

839
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:05,080
A lot of former slackies, you head-wet all the way to the Pacific Ocean,

840
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,320
and they carve little backwards swastikas into their foreheads and stuff like that.

841
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:13,960
It's been known to happen before, so that's another group you can write off.

842
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,260
When you do the declension, you know, when you finally take all the...

843
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:21,620
crunch all the numbers, and you make the Likert scale and stuff, and...

844
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,820
Ooh, I hate it. Ooh, I love it.

845
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,220
And right in the middle, have no opinion and stuff like that.

846
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,660
And you can see who's really, you know, really...

847
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:29,720
Really...

848
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,340
Yeah, this guy has a personality change.

849
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,440
You can also tell who here doesn't have a computer printer.

850
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,280
Anyway, let's see.

851
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,020
Well, I chose myself.

852
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,680
I chose to read the one that...

853
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:48,360
When you declench, let loose what's inside your bowels.

854
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:54,180
Do not just walk around declenched and still attempting to hold in all of your crap.

855
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,300
Let's see.

856
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:56,780
Okay.

857
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,940
Well, that's not...

858
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,620
We have a...

859
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,400
That's not from the list.

860
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,500
No, that's from Dr. LeGueime.

861
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,060
Yeah.

862
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,940
We have some closing statements, too, eventually here.

863
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:07,880
Let's see.

864
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,320
Brian Clift said,

865
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,240
This makes me anger.

866
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,360
And Sunil Wu said,

867
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,180
Stop shouting at me.

868
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:17,940
Defriended.

869
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,140
Because LeGueime...

870
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:20,720
It's like fire signs.

871
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,400
Stop hearing.

872
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,340
I can't shout you.

873
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:27,220
LeGueime chose to do his proclamations in all caps.

874
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,400
Yes.

875
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,980
That was entirely intentional because I knew that that would burn their butts just as much.

876
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,940
Yeah, bad etiquette.

877
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,040
Yeah.

878
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,740
Now, I love...

879
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,560
I can't...

880
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,700
Now, here's a funny thing.

881
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,220
I don't remember meeting this Chris Smoot.

882
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,080
Or this Steven Slagle, whose picture was attached to his little comment.

883
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,580
Ivan Stang is the only imposter I've ever met in Cleveland.

884
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:51,660
Well, I don't know that's a good call for it.

885
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,780
Well, how do you know, buddy?

886
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,820
Frankly, if it's a good imposter, how the hell do you know?

887
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,380
I didn't know that.

888
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,100
Everybody you know might be an imposter in Cleveland.

889
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,620
And it's highly likely, too.

890
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,180
In fact, the next show will probably prove it.

891
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,140
And the people walking in after us, and after y'all.

892
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,960
I'm such a successful imposter

893
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,260
that I can do it when I'm not even in Cleveland

894
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,140
yeah and who needs to

895
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,480
perform if you're an imposter

896
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,100
does Cleveland have a lot of

897
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,020
imposters is it a doppelganger city

898
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,260
apparently

899
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,900
actually it is

900
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,620
Mr. Sister is always seeing

901
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,140
various couples walking

902
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,680
down the street from behind

903
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,700
look just like Princess We

904
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,640
and I and me

905
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,980
or something which is unlikely

906
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,400
considering

907
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,800
our contrasting body

908
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,360
types but anyway

909
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,340
they're butt imposters

910
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,620
well that's what people

911
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,540
how they know who you are by staring

912
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,360
at your derriere

913
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,980
Roman Geisling said hmm

914
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,360
thoughtfully corporate

915
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,780
pink boys have infiltrated the church

916
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,480
looking for cash and

917
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,460
not slack

918
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,540
huh

919
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,700
you can't have both

920
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,540
why not both daddy

921
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:07,840
I don't

922
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,000
I think

923
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,580
I think

924
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,420
do you get slack from this little

925
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:13,960
exercise

926
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,380
I get slack from all of these exercises

927
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,680
as Nenslo once

928
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,120
said

929
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,560
no hating

930
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,700
that's not me being

931
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,200
upset that's me

932
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,380
getting slack this is my

933
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:29,900
slack

934
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,640
it's certainly fun to watch

935
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,660
you know but like you said

936
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,940
it's also slightly disturbing

937
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,580
I mean

938
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,540
I know it's the church of the subgenius

939
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,700
but there was some dead giveaways

940
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,700
in that press release

941
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,280
that really should have caught on

942
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,200
like Lagume's salary

943
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,460
well as Philo pointed out

944
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,300
make sure they're not all zeros

945
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,400
Dr. Lagume

946
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,460
and make sure they're consecutive

947
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:03,000
well only six zeros

948
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,480
I need a raise

949
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,460
I want a seven zero salary

950
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,820
I don't know if I'm going to be able to do that

951
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:07,820


952
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:07,820


953
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:07,820


954
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,820
now earlier today

955
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:12,120
I posed as Lagume

956
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,600
and commanded everybody to listen

957
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,280
to this show knowing full well

958
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,740
that only 35 could

959
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:18,940
and

960
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,460
one of the people who responded to my

961
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,640
statement said

962
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,420
I miss like Stang already

963
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,480
the roasting disagreements

964
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,140
bitching abuse programming

965
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,440
deprogramming sex and confusion

966
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,340
seemed so much more

967
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,700
cohesive and fun

968
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,000
with Stang

969
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,800
he was like I'm not going to do that

970
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:37,800


971
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:37,800


972
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:37,800


973
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:38,720
he was saying that to me

974
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,400
he didn't know it

975
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,340
but he was

976
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,720
and here's another person

977
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,960
talking to me unknowingly

978
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,480
typing in all caps

979
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,800
doesn't make you sound any more authoritative

980
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,560
only slightly more psychotic

981
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,700
you pimp

982
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,180
great senses of humor

983
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:56,540
thank you

984
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,120
power

985
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,020
power corrupts

986
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,700
absolute power turns you into a shouty jerk

987
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,720
by the look of it

988
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,800
well it turns you into a shouty jerk

989
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:10,400
by the look of it

990
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:10,800
worse

991
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,680
sounds like a lot of work

992
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,660
instead of slack

993
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,640
says Russ Skellington

994
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,060
you fail goodbye

995
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,440
that was very clever

996
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,300
that's what gets me

997
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,300
you know I don't care if somebody's

998
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,320
negative or nasty or critical

999
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,600
if they're funny about it

1000
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,180
right

1001
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,400
the one next one confused me

1002
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,800
because I didn't really get it at all

1003
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,080
where it says maybe you could busy yourself

1004
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,960
making the church relevant again

1005
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,620
rather than clogging feeds with your personal pets

1006
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,280
well what do you call that?

1007
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,060
I have no idea

1008
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:46,620
you know

1009
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,180
but that's the thing

1010
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,380
it's all shadow boxing

1011
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,020
it's like

1012
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:54,420
this is just bitter and hateful and not funny

1013
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,940
you tarred idiot

1014
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,560
well on the internet currently

1015
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,280
there are a lot of people who have nothing else to do

1016
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,200
but cruise various websites

1017
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,060
and well actually Facebook sites and stuff like that

1018
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:07,060


1019
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:07,060


1020
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,500
and make any kind of comment to anything

1021
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,780
as if they were officially a part of it

1022
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,920
and they think in your catch

1023
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,860
in the great net

1024
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,660
the gross net of other things

1025
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,400
I think there's a lot of sardines in there

1026
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,320
that didn't want to go

1027
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,080
well I mean maybe they had to go but

1028
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:23,780
we have some

1029
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,860
you know they didn't really want to

1030
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:25,600
they were just like

1031
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,980
I don't think they were even trying to be subgenie

1032
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:29,560
hi

1033
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,320
oh here's old Brian Burks yet again

1034
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,640
he was really upset

1035
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:37,060
the pink imposter calling himself Dr. Katadnyi

1036
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:37,520
Dr. Legume

1037
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,480
just better watch his back

1038
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,360
or he's likely to get a nasty surprise

1039
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,820
in his morning ecto cooler

1040
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,340
whatever that is

1041
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,620
ecto cooler was a

1042
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,900
Kool-Aid that came out from the Ghostbusters

1043
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,960
oh oh

1044
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,980
and they came in juice boxes too

1045
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,300
so I have no idea

1046
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,820
Dr. Legume if you have access

1047
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,860
to the remaining ecto cooler supplies

1048
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,080
I'm really jealous

1049
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,540
and I'm going to come over

1050
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:09,400
I have cornered the market with ecto cooler

1051
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:14,700
I have a giant storage bin filled with ecto cooler

1052
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,460
ok folks we only have four minutes left

1053
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,660
let's go through the closing

1054
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,000
on Scrubgenius I can't

1055
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,580
as some new person said

1056
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:30,360
I created literally all of the sock puppet Facebook accounts that bitched

1057
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,380
double hoax

1058
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,520
I took that one wrong at first

1059
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,080
and it started to make me mad

1060
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,280
and then I realized oh that's actually pretty clever

1061
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,080
now Robert Anton Wilson said

1062
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:45,380
you simply cannot create a conspiracy theory

1063
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:48,480
so ridiculous and obviously satirical

1064
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,020
that someone somewhere doesn't already believe in it

1065
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,440
Robert Puck Bob

1066
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,120
hopefully

1067
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,800
yeah and if anybody should know it's him

1068
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,680
and as Spite Satage so eloquently put it this week

1069
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,720
everything is true

1070
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,440
everything else is bull hock

1071
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,520
I don't believe that for a second

1072
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,600
when I was telling Pappy about this

1073
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,400
that's my dad

1074
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,160
he said what you're doing is chariantism

1075
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,620
he said look that up and I did

1076
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,400
and it's rhetoric

1077
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,060
a figure of speech wherein a taunting expression

1078
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,180
is softened by a jest

1079
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,220
an insult veiled in grace

1080
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,900
and there was a

1081
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,500
Dr. Leguim I think you should read this

1082
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,620
this statement that was pieced together

1083
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,740
that I copied over

1084
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:46,320
yeah I think that would be appropriate for this situation

1085
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,900
and this is a message to all of you subgenius out there

1086
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,900
who send in your thirty dollars

1087
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,160
your thirty five dollars per year

1088
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,900
I'm gonna have to bleep that on this show

1089
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,740
that's okay

1090
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:02,980
you know

1091
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,460
it's a funny thing about being a minister in the subgenius church

1092
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:12,400
you were promised eternal salvation or triple your money back

1093
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,520
you're offered a package of cool propaganda

1094
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,040
and that's it

1095
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,780
you are not promised a say in how the church is run

1096
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:24,640
you're not promised admission to x day events

1097
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,000
you're not promised membership in any of the online groups

1098
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,900
and especially

1099
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,620
you're not promised the respects of your opinion

1100
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,420
from anyone

1101
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,840
and especially especially

1102
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,820
not promised that everyone will be nice to you

1103
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,640
slack vampires none of them return what they paid for

1104
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,700
they can carry the card and call themselves a subgenius

1105
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,880
and they can go do it somewhere where none of us have to smell your crap

1106
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,960
I'm a big fan of the who

1107
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,420
and just because I bought their albums

1108
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,760
that doesn't give me the right to sleep

1109
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,500
on Roger Daltrey's couch

1110
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,340
screw his groupies

1111
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:11,280
or get in his face and tell him how to put on a concert

1112
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,560
and friends I think that says it all

1113
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,400
and this is

1114
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,420
and that wow that

1115
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,560
witch disco music just ended

1116
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:25,820
that was the late great professor Chaz Smith

1117
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:30,400
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Bob Mosick and them

1118
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,300
from the album Witch Disco

1119
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,600
and Michelle is

1120
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,500
hard to find these days

1121
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,580
beautiful

1122
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,400
beautiful

1123
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,420
and Michelle George on violin anyway

1124
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,540
friends we have to get out of here now

1125
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,080
Dr. Sinister is here

1126
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,060
and you can call him and whine

1127
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,580
I'll still be recording

1128
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,760
just a reminder

1129
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,520
if this is the first time you ever heard this show

1130
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,740
I feel sorry for you

1131
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:09,580
anyway you can figure more out from subgenius.com

1132
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,500
I'll probably have this one on the air

1133
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,620
I mean online I should say

1134
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,900
by morning I'm planning to

1135
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,220
I was up all night fighting the great Jaggy

1136
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,360
and I figure I'll be up all night

1137
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,540

00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:43,460

00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:43,460


1168
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:43,460


1169
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:43,460


1170
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:43,460


1171
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:43,460


1172
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:43,600
Big bad

1173
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,100
Big bad

1174
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,660
I really enjoyed

1175
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,660
the Hour of Slack tonight.

1176
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:05,540
It was so fun

1177
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,280
hearing about how the silly bodies

1178
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,520
interpret information

1179
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,080
they read on the interwebs.

1180
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,480
And it was especially fun

1181
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,460
hearing Legume and Pisces

1182
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,720
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1183
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,880
To the stars, my friends.

1184
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:24,880
To the stars.
