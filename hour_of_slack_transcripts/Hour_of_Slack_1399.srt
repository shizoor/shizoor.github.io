1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Come on out, willing slaves. Welcome to radio school.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,380
Don't fight!

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:04,720
Move it!

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,300
Say, where's the student union? Where's the co-ed you promised us?

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,860
Shut up and get inside.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,700
We're not criminals. We just want to learn to talk good on the radio and make big bucks.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,720
You'll all be radio heroes soon. Just climb up, mush mouths, and listen to the boss in the chair.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,700
What boss? Where?

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,380
Ha! Ha ha ha ha! Oh, you can't see me, can you?

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,480
Well, that's the magic of radio, baby.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,600
Hey, hello, students. I'm the Lightning Bug.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,080
And welcome to the Lightning Bug School of Pirate Broadcasting.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,580
Not affiliated with those pirates at the Buggery School of Flycasting.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,240
You whippy noodles will be given new voices and personalities through EST, Electronic Sensuality Transformation.

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,360
I'm gonna turn you brown-shoed squares into disc jockeys, working for my secret broadcast cave.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,120
And now, the subgenius.

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,620
Our boss.

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:58,800
Watch.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,060
They'll dance out of their pants to the sounds you send them.

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:07,260
And you'll all get French jeans, out-of-sight salaries, and all the coffee and cigarettes you can drink.

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,100
You'll be stars, and they won't even know who you are.

22
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,240
How do you do, ladies and gentlemen? I'm your host, Truman Bradley.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,040
Let me ask you a simple question.

24
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,600
Have you ever seen a solid object suddenly disappear before your eyes?

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,300
Of course you have.

26
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,320
Scientists think that something like this can account for many.

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,720
Flying saucers.

28
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,800
Or, let's take this magnifying glass.

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,820
The lens is concentrating the light rays at one point.

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,300
The powder in the pan is magnesium.

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,560
Of course, the powder will explode.

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,860
Yes, clouds are made up of tiny droplets of moisture.

33
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,620
Miniature lenses and a cloud can easily become a giant burning glass.

34
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,080
Science has a hard time separating facts from fiction.

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,420
And flying saucers from office.

36
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:58,880
And optical illusions.

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,600
There are many sightings science cannot explain.

38
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,940
Fact or fiction?

39
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,580
If fact, why didn't we hear more about it?

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,860
If fiction?

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,460
Of course, our story is fiction.

42
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,400
But it might offer a possible explanation.

43
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,520
What is the Succeed Foundation?

44
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,120
Well, there may be followers of Bob.

45
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,920
That's the fastest growing cult here in the South West.

46
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,140
24K long.

47
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,020
Bob!

48
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,360
Hey Bob!

49
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,980
The proper nickname is Bob.

50
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,780
Hello Bob.

51
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,100
A great change has come over me.

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,720
I want to die for Bob.

53
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,740
Kill me Bob.

54
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,440
Drive in the car that Bob sold me.

55
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,660
All the world looks better since Bob is my blindfold.

56
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,080
What is subgenius?

57
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,700
It's doctors for Bob.

58
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,360
Because I'm a...

59
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,160
Subgenius

60
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,780
Somebody told me this vibe was cool

61
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,360
He had all the answers now

62
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,540
He couldn't fix any fool

63
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,040
Sometimes it says

64
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,440
There goes causation out the window

65
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,020
There is no CD or there is no spoon

66
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,900
There goes matter

67
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,860
You may now continue your thought

68
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,080
There goes entertainment

69
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,600
That thought you were holding

70
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,040
I hold it in my hand

71
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,980
It was hot

72
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,440
Like a little baby rabbit

73
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,740
I have fondled to death

74
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,020
I keep petting the little rabbit

75
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,120
And he falls asleep

76
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,520
And I try to wake him up

77
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,720
I smack him five times

78
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,940
And he will never wake up

79
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,980
So when you hold a thought

80
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,400
You hold it too tightly

81
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,740
And you kill it

82
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,900
I might as well break other character

83
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,520
Because that's what happens to all of us

84
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,440
I can't hold on to them

85
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,780
They slip through my fingers

86
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,620
It's like Jack Nicholson making that waitress

87
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,040
An egg sandwich between her knees

88
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,160
Truths, knowledge

89
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,200
Experiences

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,620
They just

91
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:55,720
They just fall asleep

92
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,400
They slip right through

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,780
They're gone

94
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,640
As if greased

95
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,320
Yeah

96
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,380
Slippery little

97
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,380
Like trying to hang on to tadpoles

98
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,820
I was trying to read Plato last night

99
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,260
That's what thoughts are like for me

100
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:04,800
Little tad

101
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,360
Trying to hang on to tadpoles

102
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,260
Little tadpoles

103
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,460
That squirm away from you

104
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,220
And begin expanding

105
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,760
In someone else's head

106
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,820
Then where are you?

107
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,200
Probably better off

108
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,540
Getting lost

109
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,200
Bob said that if you could let all your thoughts go away

110
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,640
So that there were none left at all

111
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,300
You would become

112
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,120
Lucky

113
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,500
Like Bob is

114
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,960
The greatest clarinet player who ever lived too

115
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,940
You would play as the hot club in Paris

116
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,880
You would probably have a 12 year career

117
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,760
Marked at the end by a bout of alcoholism

118
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,540
Which kill you

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,160
Your family let you

120
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,460
What's his name?

121
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,400
A cemetery where his door is buried

122
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,440
Well that's the thing

123
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,500
See it's all easier said than done

124
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,260
Of course you can say that

125
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,040
You try to let it go

126
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,540
And be

127
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,040
And

128
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,780
Practice

129
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,140
Break minds

130
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,600
And break thinking

131
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,220
And not

132
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,660
Hold on to the thoughts

133
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,420
But they crawl back in

134
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,320
You try to cast them out

135
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,700
And they crawl back in

136
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,120
And it's

137
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,160
Come in here

138
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,880
One stump

139
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,200
On the ground

140
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,060
Another world

141
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,260
You're in a crutch

142
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,860
Happy world

143
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,880
Here comes another thought with a walker

144
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,860
That thought is 450 pounds

145
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,160
And it's not going to make it

146
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,620
Out of this particular realm

147
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,440
Oh shoot

148
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,720
I thought we were about to make it

149
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,100
Out of that particular realm

150
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,840
No we're going to make sandwiches now

151
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,160
Chuck

152
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,680
Come on

153
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,240
Damn it

154
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,660
Cowboys

155
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,560
Time to ride the freaking horsey

156
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,500
Kid said

157
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,480
You know with all this manure

158
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,560
There's got to be a pony in here someplace

159
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,680
Sure this picture is dynamite

160
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
But why pull punches

161
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,520
When the danger is so great

162
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,080
Right here and now

163
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,180
So don't hide your head

164
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,300
From the shocking fact

165
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,900
The teenage party

166
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,420
Where anything goes

167
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,180
Is for our frills

168
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,400
Yeah

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,740
It's a pig

170
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,820
It's a cow man

171
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,760
It's a pony

172
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,160
No it's a goat

173
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,860
You know one of them lady goats

174
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,280
It's a pony

175
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,740
It's a pony

176
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,100
It's a pony

177
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,440
It's a pony

178
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,460
All of this has got to be a pony in here

179
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,080
It's got to be a pony

180
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,300
Yeah

181
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,180
The point is

182
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,540
Seems kind of pointless now

183
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,780
Yeah I guess you're right

184
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,120
We'll continue to get good intelligence

185
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,560
And we'll continue to chase

186
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,340
Mr. Bin Laden

187
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,440
And the veritable orgasm of poor planning

188
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,680
Ladies and gentlemen

189
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,200
Our distinguished guest has just arrived

190
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,780
Oh

191
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,300
Have some champagne

192
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,600
What do you mean?

193
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,420
Come this way

194
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:52,960
Gentlemen

195
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,840
Come on

196
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,400
Come on

197
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,400


198
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,400


199
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,400


200
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,380
Come on

201
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,820
Tell us directly

202
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:44,220
How high is my

203
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:44,220


204
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:44,240
Oh

205
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,460
Oh

206
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,520
Oh

207
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,120
Oh

208
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:48,820
Oh

209
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,160
By God

210
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,580
I'm under pressure

211
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:51,580


212
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:51,580


213
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:51,580


214
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,060
Well I guess we should

215
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,040
Only pick on their own family

216
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,640
Bob

217
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,380
We bad boys

218
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:54,840
You better have a tug.

219
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,960
Uh, Jed, uh, Jed, uh, I...

220
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,600
Yeah, man, you know, I ain't gonna go dead yet anyway.

221
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:12,180
Uh, uh, man, uh, Jed, this problem, the problem is, uh, uh, hooked on heroin.

222
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,300
No, thank you, doctor.

223
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,200
Boys, like a good Texan should.

224
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,940
Let them know you're a man.

225
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,460
Meaning, ask the president.

226
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,840
You're no son of mine.

227
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,640
You don't...

228
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,900
There was a ping from Paul Hood's computer.

229
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,640
Hood looked at the monitor and saw Bob's code on the bottom of the screen.

230
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,040
He pushed control enter.

231
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,680
He cleared the screen and brought up a form document.

232
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,860
He began typing.

233
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,940
I'm ordering Stryker into the region.

234
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,600
Without prior congressional approval?

235
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,100
Yes.

236
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,900
Without approval.

237
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,420
I can't wait while they diddle.

238
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,400
Oh, and that would be my cue.

239
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,980
They had two.

240
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,140
Can this really stick out?

241
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,100


242
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,020
A move?

243
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,060


244
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,540
Okay, mmm...

245
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,140
Alright, it's gone.

246
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,140


247
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:13,960
Yeah.

248
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:14,380


249
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,040
Uh, what's next?

250
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,340
Go ahead, kiss a dog.

251
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:15,420
So, um...

252
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,760
I, uhh...

253
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,220
Should I call you?

254
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,760
your refrigerator's coolness setting so all your ice cream melts.

255
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,820
It will demagnetize the strips on all your credit cards,

256
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,620
screw up the tracking on your VCR,

257
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,840
and use subspace field harmonics to render any CDs you try to play unreadable.

258
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,760
It will give your ex-boy or girlfriend your new phone number.

259
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,100
It will mix antifreeze into your fish tank.

260
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,320
It will drink all your beer and leave its socks out on the coffee table when there's company coming over.

261
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,740
It will put a dead kitten in the back pocket of your good suit

262
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,540
and hide the car keys when you're late for work.

263
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,840
Bad times will make you fall in love with a penguin.

264
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,680
It will give you nightmares about circus midgets.

265
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,760
It will pour sugar in your gas tank and shave off both your eyebrows

266
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,080
while dating your current boy or girlfriend behind your back.

267
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,740
And filling the dinner and hotel room to your music heart.

268
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,220
It will seduce your grandmother.

269
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,780
It does not matter if she is dead.

270
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,800
Such is the power of bad times.

271
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,400
It reaches out beyond the grave to sully those things we hold most dear.

272
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,700
It moves your car randomly around parking lots.

273
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,400
If you can't find it, it will kick your dog.

274
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,560
It will leave libidinous messages on your boss's voicemail and your voice.

275
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,080
It is insidious and sad.

276
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,280
It is subtle.

277
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,300
It is dangerous and terrifying to behold.

278
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,960
It is also a rather interesting shade of mauve.

279
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,340
Bad times will give you Dutch Elm Disease.

280
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,920
It will leave the toilet seat up.

281
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,640
It will make a batch of methamphetamine in your bathtub

282
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,140
and then leave bacon cooking on the stove

283
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,500
while it goes out to chase high school kids with your new snow blower.

284
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,400
These are just a few of the signs.

285
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,940
Be very, very careful.

286
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,780
The

287
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:36,180
I wish there was a web van.

288
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,740
Web van?

289
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,420
Yeah, then I could just order cigarettes.

290
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,260
Yeah.

291
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,960
Well, why can't you just walk out and get some?

292
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,640
Web van had a problem.

293
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,080
They had no markers.

294
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,980
They had no margins in that business.

295
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,500
You know, it's like...

296
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,240
So the words went all the way to the edge of the page?

297
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,940
The words went to the edge of the page.

298
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,120
There weren't any red lines, no blue lines.

299
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,440
Nowhere to draw.

300
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,600
No place to draw.

301
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,480
They didn't do it all to make little notes.

302
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,160
So they said, okay, let's put all this stuff in a warehouse.

303
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,360
We'll deliver it to people and then we'll charge them more.

304
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,900
But people won't pay more.

305
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,560
The people will laugh.

306
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,940
Not enough of them will pay more.

307
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,660
Yeah.

308
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,920
That's the problem.

309
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,700
Well, I would just want to...

310
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,600
But isn't it great having...

311
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,160
...you want to do that right now?

312
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,100
When web van was working, it was great having them bring food to your house.

313
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,160
Now, you know, I always thought there would be two signs.

314
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,420
If we were really in the future, there would be two signs of it.

315
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,160
You would have flying cars and you would have food replicators where you could just push

316
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,800
a button and the appropriate food would just be replicated.

317
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,780
Not really replicated.

318
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,840
It would be like transported from some place where the perfect food was grown.

319
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:52,060
None of which was tainted by any horrible substances or illegal insecticides and things.

320
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,600
And then we would be able to eat wonderful food for free.

321
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:02,260
And then we would get into our flying cars and fly to our jobs where we would only have

322
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,760
to work one minute a week.

323
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,900
And at that time, we would just push a giant button.

324
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,120
We would come to work at about lunch hour.

325
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,240
We'd push the big button and then we would go home.

326
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,700
We'd do that once a week.

327
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,840
And they'd pay us a million dollars a minute to do that.

328
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,280
It's like a Warner Brothers cartoon.

329
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,640
And the mark of the beast will be introduced.

330
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,800
And people will have a number in their hand and in their forehead.

331
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Someone with a lot of energy.

332
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,000
Okay, your code number once more.

333
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:40,980
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo and good hello and welcome to my crib.

334
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,980
Homeboys and homegirls.

335
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,620
Gangsters and Bee Gees.

336
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,580
One and all.

337
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,120
Welcome again to Chap in the Hood.

338
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,700
I am Sir Charles Laybridge Stuart Fatherington.

339
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,540
And these are my companions.

340
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,140
MC Howie Tee.

341
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,900
Sir Fix-a-Lot.

342
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,140
Muhammad Rahim Ahmed.

343
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,880
And my little homie, Butterknife.

344
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,660
And what we do here is discuss the contemporary issues of the day that confront our modern

345
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,080
post-Cold War society.

346
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,600
Along with some slanging and banging and of course hanging with the OGs.

347
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,300
You join us as we were discussing the difficulties of being a notorious felon.

348
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,320
I was voicing the opinion that a good way to attract a young lady is to obtain an expensive

349
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,120
automobile.

350
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,700
You see, I used to get no play.

351
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,660
Now the honey stays behind me because I said I had a motherfucking Benz 190.

352
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,660
Well, before we continue, I say OG.

353
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,640
Would you be so kind as to break me off some of that green sticky?

354
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,700
Perhaps you did not understand me, my dear fellow.

355
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,520
I said I want some Bama.

356
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,020
The Bionic.

357
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,680
Bomb.

358
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,700
Buddha.

359
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,700
Chee-ba.

360
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,680
The Chronic.

361
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,820
Dubage.

362
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:01,780
Homegrown.

363
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,420
Ill.

364
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,020
Ism.

365
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,720
Lebanon.

366
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:04,620
Method.

367
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,280
Cess.

368
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,000
Shake.

369
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,320
Skunk.

370
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:07,900
Stress.

371
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,280
Tabacchi.

372
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:09,840
Tie.

373
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:10,960
Wacky.

374
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,680
Man, don't be breaking them off no more.

375
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,180
That's right, I ain't gonna get no shit.

376
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,340
Oh dear, we still seem to be having a misunderstanding.

377
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,820
Perhaps if I were to make my point a bit clearer.

378
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,760
Shit.

379
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,320
Goddamn.

380
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,680
Look, that motherfucker's a freak.

381
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,520
There we go.

382
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,180
A few caps in your ass, my good man.

383
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,540
Motherfucker, pop the cap.

384
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
Now you understand.

385
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,680
You give him the bomb.

386
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,560
Cannabis deceiver.

387
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,000
Cannabis deceiver.

388
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,060
Mm, that's hella fresh.

389
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,920
Ah, one love.

390
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,960
Oh, thank you, homie.

391
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,980
I am most appreciative of this, how do you say it?

392
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,380
Cannabis deceiver.

393
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,660
This bag of dank, don't you know?

394
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,620
Damn.

395
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,900
Look at that food.

396
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,560
Hey, I got the most.

397
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,580
Oh, that's some fine product.

398
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,200
Oh my goodness.

399
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:10,940
That's some good stuff.

400
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:10,940


401
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:10,940


402
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:10,940


403
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:10,940


404
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,800
That is a fine bag of dank.

405
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,280
Damn, that's that green chicken.

406
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,820
Hey, that's some kick-ass chicken.

407
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,840
Oh dear me.

408
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:22,440
I hate to interject, but I believe the smoking paraphernalia's holding chamber is completely

409
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,360
devoid of psychoactive substances.

410
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,000
Hey, yo, it's dust, fool.

411
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,260
Ah, I see.

412
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,280
Let me try that again, my dear boy.

413
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:29,680
Damn, the bowl's cached.

414
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,940
This bowl is cached.

415
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,420
Yeah.

416
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,600
Is that how you say it?

417
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,940
Damn, the bowl's cached, motherfucker.

418
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,880
Oh, good-o.

419
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,480
I've learned a new one.

420
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:37,900
Man.

421
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,700
Word.

422
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,360
My god.

423
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,240
I'm gonna have to go.

424
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:40,520


425
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:40,520


426
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:40,520


427
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:40,520


428
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,120
My, I am feeling a bit parched.

429
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,160
I wouldn't mind a refreshing drink.

430
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,260
I say, Butterknife, be a good chap and fetch me a 40-dog.

431
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:49,580
Yeah.

432
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,420
Hey, hey, let's go dude.

433
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,020
What is that, my dear boy?

434
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,520
Hey, we outta here.

435
00:16:59,560 --> 00:16:59,800
Let's go.

436
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,300
I see.

437
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,860
Yeah, we're waiting in Hooptie, man.

438
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,300
Indeed.

439
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,720
We will have to cut our visit short this week.

440
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,740
My posse has requested my presence on a Hooptie ride.

441
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,620
My AK is the tool, as it were.

442
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:19,020
We will be sitting back and letting the Alpine blast, as we go rat-a-tat-tat to the pigs

443
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,040
and like that.

444
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,800
You see, some time ago, I was in a rather awkward situation in a local liquor store.

445
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,160
We had just pulled a 411 to make some ends.

446
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,880
As we made our escape, there were the boys in blue pointing their guns at my four-man

447
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,180
crew.

448
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,780
So, a straight-up 411 suddenly became a nasty 187.

449
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,480
But how?

450
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,300
How my reputation was enhanced after I popped a few caps in a Popo's Bozax.

451
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,520
Well, off we go then.

452
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,560
But we should leave you with a few words of pithy advice.

453
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,840
Remember, to all of my peoples in the pens, keep your head up.

454
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,660
Keep it real out in the field, y'all.

455
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,140
And if you don't know, now you know.

456
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,580
Well, see you around.

457
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,780
Peace out and cheerio.

458
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,260
Pip-pip and all that.

459
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,980
Oh yes, dear friends.

460
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:28,080
Well, thanks to Phineas Narco of Midnight Voice Jail for that incredible piece there,

461
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,460
Chap in the Hood.

462
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:37,560
You can tune in to more Midnight Voice Jail on the internet if you will go to this URL,

463
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,800
and it's a strange one.

464
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,460
It's the internet.

465
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,940
Um, http...

466
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,780

00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,100
Dapper.

468
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,940
Like when you dress up nice.

469
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,960
That's the address of Midnight Voice Jail.

470
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,660
I dot am slash dapper.

471
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,820
So you just remember, old Phineas Narco, he's dapper.

472
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:09,380
This is Hour of Slack number 824, a show built of new shows and of old sub-genii, such as,

473
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:16,600
Old Dr. Philodrummon and Old Puzzling Evidence on KPFA Berkeley, talking about the future,

474
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,640
heard earlier there.

475
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:26,380
And the beautiful Reverend Susie the Floozy on Bob's Slacktime Funhouse on WREK Atlanta.

476
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:36,020
And also on that, uh, from that, uh, wonderful radio station, The Weird Jackal Spots by the

477
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,520
Lymph Node Institute Boys.

478
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,360
And, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

And B Frost supervising that stuff, up there, also, Bob's Slacktime Funhouse and the weirdos

481
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,020
of Old Dot Binary Slack, of course, that contribute so much, uh, including, I don't know who did

482
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,860
that song Bad Times, but I know that Potter Nostril sent it.

483
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:01,660
And, uh, Tesla Coil, Reverend Tesla Coil, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, donated quite a bit at

484
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,060
large to that news group.

485
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,740
And friends, we've also been hearing from the old, old, old, old sub-geniusástico,

486
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,340
MediaBarrage.net.

487
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:17,900
number five from 1983 or something which i am now recutting and remastering and uh but i'll never go

489
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:36,440
how are you oh fine just fine these millionaires know what's a delicious economical snack

490
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:44,640
in a world where change is the rule we rely on the unyielding constants in life for comfort and

491
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:51,840
security that the sun will rise that the earth will turn but what if we could no longer be

492
00:20:51,840 --> 00:21:00,640
certain of anything to what then would we cling for centuries philosophers and theologians have

493
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,740
debated what it means to be human perhaps the answer has eluded us

494
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,320
because

495
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:14,020
it is so simple to be human is to choose two choices bernice do what we say starting now

496
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:21,740
or say goodbye to the world i'll take the first and we would like to testify to the power of

497
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:28,260
daz what it has done for us ever since we joined your church after a number of experiments

498
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,440
we found out that such creatures could develop in radioactive areas and they are particularly

499
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,240
attracted to human life

500
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,300
for their very survival

501
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:45,540
glorify me bob that i may be glorified through you glorify me that i may glorify you

502
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:51,360

510
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:29,780


511
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,860

512
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:32,960

513
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:32,960


514
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,700
wayne no brow

515
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,580
and bustle of our daily activity.

516
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,680
Soon Bob will have thousands of followers and maybe okay because

517
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,160
Do you remember where I told you to watch over?

518
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,680
Remember where Bob is?

519
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,220
That's over in his house.

520
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,100
Bob is at PO Box 1403-06.

521
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,000
The style of sex is 7x21.

522
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,860
Hey, stop it.

523
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,640
7x21.

524
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,860
Once they join up, we're able to get them off to one of our subgenius retreats,

525
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:07,060
change their diet, start feeding them propaganda, repeating the same thing over and over again

526
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:12,120
until they forget who they are and start responding only to our dogma.

527
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,160
And another thing.

528
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,460
You can only die once.

529
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,200
After that, nothing and nobody can harm you.

530
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,640
Oh, man, what are you waiting for?

531
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,720
Well, let me go get you drinks.

532
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,880
That afternoon, I gave Dick the order to alert and send the 82nd airborne.

533
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,580
And

534
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:32,800
today,

535
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,420
I'm going to do the same with two tactical fighter squatters.

536
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,320
Good man.

537
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,200
I'll order the C-141 pack for a desert operation.

538
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Now, let's see.

539
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,260
First, you'll need a declaration of war.

540
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,380
That way, everything you do will be nice and illegal.

541
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,500
Okay.

542
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,880
Sign here.

543
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,780
They did it.

544
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,440
Yes!

545
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,900
Woo-hoo!

546
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:09,280
Well, I couldn't wait.

547
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,080
I just had to see you.

548
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,180
Don't you understand, Bob?

549
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,080
I'm not going with you.

550
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:16,900
What do you mean?

551
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,040
I don't love you, Bob.

552
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,520
Not sure I ever did.

553
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,380
Come on, come on.

554
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,000
Let's hear the rest of it.

555
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,960
Sorry, Bob.

556
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,400
Your dream has become my nightmare.

557
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,420
Wow, Bob, you sure do have a high burn rate with women.

558
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,620
Maybe I ought to take a break from that high-maintenance kind.

559
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,280
Maybe you ought to give me a try.

560
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:50,500
I'm somewhere right between, you know, high-key and low-key.

561
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,380
Just a little bit hokey.

562
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:59,540
Hokey? Accent on the hoe, how come you never took me for a tumble, eh, Bob-o?

563
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,440
So, come here often?

564
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,380
Want to?

565
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,600
What's that?

566
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,500
Good evening, everyone. Or, good morning, I should say.

567
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:23,560
This is Mort Bookman, broadcasting live from an undisclosed location somewhere south of, well, where is not important, as I've found.

568
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,280
And you've no doubt.

569
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:33,520
You've heard that certain elements of this technocracy would like nothing more than to find and muzzle old Mort, and to prevent you from receiving the plain, undiluted truth.

570
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,220
Having said that, know only that I am safe.

571
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,920
For the time.

572
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,680
And that I have no intentions of surrendering to would-be thugs.

573
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,140
Ah, there are a great many things to discuss tonight.

574
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:53,820
Glenn Burrett, former species designer at Glort Co., will join us later to talk in great detail about the experiments and product.

575
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:12,740
And I believe that more than a few of you have questions about the mysterious planaria that have been found in approximately 80% of the inhabitable areas of the world, and in 15% of those areas previously thought to be uninhabitable.

576
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:23,320
These creatures thrive both on land and in water, are apparently sexless, though they are breeding at an alarming rate, and seem never to sleep nor eat.

577
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:29,860
If these creatures did originate from one of Glort Co.'s many labs, were they a genetic mistake?

578
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,560
Or were they planned?

579
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,300
Perhaps Mr. Burrett can provide some answers.

580
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:44,860
Also, though it wasn't reported by the corporate media, it did rain frogs last week in Seattle, Washington.

581
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,960
I was there, friends, and I was simply speechless.

582
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,360
Hip Seattleites, however, were considerably less impressed.

583
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,160
They were, in fact, disinterested.

584
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:09,020
I asked a perpetually frowning young woman, who I'm sure was in a band, whether she had seen anything like the torrential downfall of amphibians we were witnessing.

585
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:20,960
She looked at me blankly and characterized the event as trite, and that the effect was way cooler in Paul Thomas Anderson's film Magnolia.

586
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,380
Trite, indeed.

587
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,700
Also, in Israel tonight, the questions surrounding the Shroud of Turin are nearly answered.

588
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:38,140
Glort Co.'s biotech subsidiary, InStep, while gathering samples of someone's DNA for reconstruction,

589
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,920
discovered what appears to be a breath pocket inside the Shroud,

590
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:52,880
and inside the alleged pocket was a document carbon dated to be approximately 2,000 years old.

591
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,440
The document, according to linguists and Aramaic scholars, is a claim ticket.

592
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,640
The Shroud, evidently an overcoat.

593
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:08,080
A spokesman for the now Space Vatican was quick to point out that it could be the Savior's overcoat,

594
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:15,840
as some scripture in the Old Testament does make mention of Jesus asking the disciples whether any had seen his overcoat.

595
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:22,920
Is there evidence to suggest that the ex-Pentagon was working closely with Walt Disney?

596
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:28,760
And the years leading up to his death, to develop a device that would turn American citizens into

597
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,780
super cartoon war machines?

598
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,100
The birth of a second white buffalo occurred this past Tuesday in Taos, New Mexico.

599
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,840
I think we all know what that means.

600
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,620
Mmm...

601
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,880
Also, tonight, we'll open the lines for your calls with the announcement today from Brussels that pharmaceutical giant Clovert

602
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,900
plans to produce and use human clones to test its many properties.

603
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:52,900


604
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:52,900


605
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:52,900


606
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:52,900


607
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,860
products. Human cloning has been banned

608
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,700
in every industrialized nation with

609
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,400
the notable exception of Germany.

610
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,720
And few were surprised when

611
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,680
Clovert relocated there last year.

612
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,700
If I may offer my two cents

613
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,240
on this matter, uh,

614
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,780
human cloning is inevitable

615
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,020
folks, and the last thing you want to do

616
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,820
is ban it and drive it underground.

617
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,700
It must be

618
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,800
regulated. It must

619
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,880
be in the open. The potential

620
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,700
good that could come from cloning is

621
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,720
enormous, but testing must occur

622
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,900
in the open where it can be observed.

623
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,860
And considering the multitude

624
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,820
of useless technologies we've

625
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,800
suffered as of late, I for one

626
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,840
look forward to the day that clones of various

627
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,780
supermodels flood the market. Because

628
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,420
really, what else are clones good for?

629
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,700
Briefly, the economy is

630
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,520
a lie. There is no recession.

631
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,980
There is no budget.

632
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,700
No surplus, and therefore no

633
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,740
deficit.

634
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,520
These are controls, and they are working.

635
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,640
We have become a nation of

636
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,000
little red riding hoods, preoccupied

637
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,160
with big eyes and ears,

638
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,700
not noticing the big teeth until it's

639
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,740
too late. You, listeners,

640
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,660
friends, you'll

641
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,780
remember in the original fairy tale, red riding hood

642
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,580
was skinned and eaten. And

643
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,840
I believe the wolf wore her skin.

644
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,680
There is still no evidence of any kind to support

645
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
the existence of a man named Rush

646
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,780
Limbaugh. No birth

647
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,740
certificate. No passport.

648
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,560
No driver's

649
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,920
license. Think about it.

650
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,920
The strange red lights I observed

651
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,940
over this

652
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,820
broadcasting post and last

653
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,620
night's guy were

654
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,840
a hoax. It was some

655
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,580
teenagers, and I know that Michael Stevens

656
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,860
was among them. Evidently

657
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,600
they had some of those laser pointers,

658
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,660
and I think I jumped to conclusions

659
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,920
when I reported them.

660
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,900
Kids, this is no laughing

661
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,180
matter. These things are

662
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,600
real. Abductions do

663
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,780
happen. And this comes

664
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,620
from someone who has been abducted.

665
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,640
Five

666
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,520
times. It can be

667
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,640
traumatic, though it is not

668
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,380
the probing as is widely reported.

669
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,360
Probing can be an agreeable

670
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,360
sensation, particularly if you

671
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,440
happen to be abducted by a less inhibited

672
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,780
being, one with a taste for roleplaying.

673
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:07,980
Nevertheless,

674
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,600
kids, please.

675
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,060
This is not a game.

676
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,140
And we'll be back after this

677
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,460
with your calls. With me,

678
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,960
Mort Bookman, on

679
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,860
Inside the Inside.

680
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,840
They Things

681
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,100
and Purpose and One Purpose, One Purpose, Purpose Ow, Purpose Ow

682
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,820
They Do

683
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,360
and Terrify

684
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:58,820
and

685
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,560
Nothin

686
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,460
nothin

687
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,420
yeah that's us

688
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,480
Oh, that was us, yeah.

689
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,040
The part that didn't make any sense and was like a waste of air.

690
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,640
Yeah, that's Michael Pepe.

691
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,640
And a waste of people like that.

692
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,360
You couldn't believe that humans would actually indulge themselves this way.

693
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,580
Take the time to do this.

694
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,300
And take the time to do it and plan it.

695
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,480
Actually, all these words, these things I'm saying right now are actually written down and orchestrated.

696
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:41,460
And people have labored over them for weeks to make sure they were just precisely what I'm supposed to sound like I'm meaning to say right now.

697
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:55,800
But, you know, it's been edited, stringently sanitized and pumped through filters and obfuscators to make them just exactly what has to be said to cleanse the airwaves at this point in time.

698
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,460
So there.

699
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,300
So there.

700
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,180
Darn it.

701
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,860
So now what do you have to say?

702
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,980
Well, I was thinking about moving to somewhere in North Africa and trying to get a job teaching English.

703
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,440
But.

704
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,040
Then we were talking you out of it.

705
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,760
That was weeks ago.

706
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,120
Yeah.

707
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,280
I was thinking about moving across the room here.

708
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,640
And then I decided against it because it was just too much trouble.

709
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,060
Yeah, I'm just too lazy.

710
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:22,980
Yeah, me too.

711
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,260
And I was thinking about teaching myself English.

712
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,760
But then I thought, that's too much trouble.

713
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,640
I'd have to learn something.

714
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:40,840
And then, you know, what would I do with that empty, empty disk space that I had to suddenly.

715
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,580
Occupy with files and things, you know, I mean, it just doesn't make sense.

716
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,380
I'd just have to purge them later anyway.

717
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:50,900
Purge them.

718
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,540
They do play nice.

719
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,020
Don't they play nice songs?

720
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,080
They play nice music on this show at night, though.

721
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,380
On this show?

722
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,280
Yeah, hear it?

723
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,120
Hear it back there?

724
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,880
I can't really hear it very well, but maybe if I turn my radio up.

725
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,140
Now, if you turn your radio up, does she get that slap back sort of, you know.

726
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,320
Yeah, yeah.

727
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:10,740
Yeah.

728
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:12,720
In fact.

729
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,380
Now, you said that she does.

730
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,960
Is this the part where the Twilight Zone starts?

731
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:18,580
Yeah.

732
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,120
My mother used to censor Twilight Zone.

733
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:21,960
She what?

734
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,500
She would censor Twilight Zone.

735
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,940
She got pregnant from Twilight Zone?

736
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:30,420
Yeah, I wasn't allowed to watch some of the Twilight Zones.

737
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,220
She's rubbing her head here.

738
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,300
Okay, we're washing your brain.

739
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,700
Or the Charlie's Angels.

740
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,640
Good idea, because you would have had that weird hair.

741
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,200
Of course.

742
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,720
I wasn't allowed to sleep.

743
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,560
I didn't have any other rules.

744
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,140
My parents, you know the one that wouldn't let me watch?

745
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,800
Now, this is going to date me a little bit.

746
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,420
They didn't like me watching The Naked City or The Untouchables.

747
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,760
I think they thought both those shows were a little violent for me.

748
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,580
Of course, I would lay on the floor and hang around,

749
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,220
stuck my head around the corner and sneak around.

750
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,300
I did that anyway.

751
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,520
I had several different places I could sneak to and watch.

752
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,460
What's The Naked City?

753
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,640
The Naked City had Lee, wasn't it Lee Marvin?

754
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,740
Yeah, Lee Marvin played a cop and it was about New York.

755
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,040
It was based on some books from the 50s.

756
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,340
You know, it's a long time ago.

757
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,320
It was the early 60s and the TV show.

758
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,780
And that was about 8 or 9.

759
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,060
About the same time as The Untouchables and Paladin.

760
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,980
Paladin, Paladin, yeah.

761
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,320
Paladin almost ran me over in 1960.

762
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,600
It was big Cadillac because he lived in Hawaii.

763
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,860
But yeah, it was a tough guy.

764
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,880
My dad watched The Untouchables back then, but that's when I was sneaking around to see

765
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:40,820
Twins and Twins.

766
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:40,820


767
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:40,820


768
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,200
Twilight Zone.

769
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,400
Yeah, they wouldn't let you watch Twilight Zone?

770
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,660
It was just too spooky.

771
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,720
No, just my mother.

772
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,000
She would let me watch some of them, but I'd get to watch the first five minutes and then

773
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,620
she'd know which one it was and if it was the one that was...

774
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,340
And she'd ruin it.

775
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,220
Oh, okay, then she'd...

776
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,060
Then I wouldn't be able to watch it.

777
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,000
No, she'd say, no, this is just too sick.

778
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,920
You've got to go now.

779
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,900
Leave the room.

780
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,440
She'd throw you out of the room.

781
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,580
Did you sneak around and watch it anyway?

782
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:09,920
No, uh-uh, because I figured that she was probably right about what things would give

783
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,300
you nightmares.

784
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,240
You know, um...

785
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,800
And so suddenly you had no nightmares.

786
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,760
Well, I didn't have very many nightmares, but, you know, I really like the whole power

787
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,940
of positive thinking was kind of like I was raised on that.

788
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,520
Yeah.

789
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,960
Yeah, it's really, I mean...

790
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,880
Well...

791
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,320
Me too.

792
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,440
It's not...

793
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,500
That's why it sounds so positive now.

794
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,360
Yeah.

795
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,580
It's such a confusing show.

796
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,480
I believe in, uh...

797
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,260
I see the stress levels rising here.

798
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,460
I believe in self-fulfilling prophecy.

799
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:40,800
I think that's a good one.

800
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:40,800


801
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:40,800


802
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:40,800


803
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:40,800


804
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:40,800


805
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:40,800


806
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:40,800


807
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:48,440
And I believe that you can program your mind to, uh, you know, to fulfill, to help you

808
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,860
fulfill that prophecy through unconscious words that you say and affirmations you make,

809
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:02,260
generalist, general type statements, uh, falsehoods that you claim and affirm in your own mind

810
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:06,980
to be true in such a way that your body actually responds to it physically.

811
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,780
It's sort of like you program your mind.

812
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:10,780


813
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:10,780


814
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,700
It's not just mind with bad words.

815
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:17,760
It's, it's just, you know, not bad words, but I mean bad thoughts.

816
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,000
Hi.

817
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,640
With everyone obsessing over this were-jackal character, it's easy to forget that not long

818
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,220
ago, the people in this hemisphere lived under the peaceful tyranny of Gorr, the invisible

819
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:29,900
behemoth.

820
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,720
Remember that?

821
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,100
Nothing pleased Gorr more than a bountiful tribute.

822
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:34,680
Ah.

823
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,880
Well, that monster has long since been deposed by the were-jackal, but don't let that stop

824
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,760
you from doing your job.

825
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:40,920
It's your duty.

826
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:47,060
Be it kin, credits, or corn, try to honor the past by giving proper tribute at the designated

827
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:51,100
tribute drop points, or else the were-jackal will kill you in your sleep.

828
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Get with the program.

829
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,200
Watch out for the were-jackal.

830
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,940
I'll be back.

831
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:21,640
Bye.

832
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,140
Bye.

833
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,000
Bye.

834
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,420
Bye.

835
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,540
Bye.

836
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,720
Bye.

837
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:41,720


838
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,140
Bye.

839
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,200
Ah!

840
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,900
Today, you all是天使之 estrutур

841
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,260
You may die

842
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,520
Ah!

843
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,420
Superior mutants

844
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,180
The avatars of man are emotionless

845
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,760
Outeezish

846
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,460
SOOOOLIC!

847
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,460
Tunnel life got you down? Well strap on a smile and dig this!

848
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,540
Now you can burrow in your loved ones the same way our species burrows in the Earth itself!

849
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,460
You heard me right, it's...

850
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,820
Pete Novelty's House of Ganja and Smut Analyzer Liquidation Sale.

851
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,700
That's right. Nothing says...

852
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,620
I love you.

853
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,840
...like a poke in the intestines with 12 inches of molded plastic.

854
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,020
Don't let the impotence plague cost you your sexmate.

855
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,560
Nail your sweetie to the bed every night with one of our discount analyzers.

856
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,880
Pete Novelty's House of Ganja and Smut.

857
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,240
Your outlet for all of your deviant needs.

858
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:56,580
And as always, we have your poppers, flare guns, bongs, duct tape, executioners, masks, left-handed cigarettes, and other tobacco accessories.

859
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,680
That's...

860
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,560
Pete Novelty's House of Ganja and Smut.

861
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,440
Everyone else is jerking you around.

862
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,860
Visit our showroom in the 5th Auxiliary Service Tunnel next to the crematorium.

863
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,640
See you there!

864
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,720
The End

865
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,940
Four out of five. Impressive.

866
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,060
But you missed your last target.

867
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:19,900
Did I?

868
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,100
Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh my God!

869
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,060
Sorry.

870
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,160
There's all sorts of amateurs out there these days willing to fight wars for money.

871
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:36,900
I hasten to add that since each man will be required to do prodigious service along these lines,

872
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:44,980
the women will have to be selected for their sexual characteristics, which will have to be of a highly stimulating nature.

873
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,520
I must confess, you have an astonishingly good idea there, Doctor.

874
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,180
This is a public service announcement.

875
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,560
This is PFC Helen Miller of the United States Army Recruiting Corps.

876
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:03,820
The United States Army is known throughout the world for the care, training, and handling of its privates.

877
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,800
Oh, baby.

878
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,680
Well, I'll take it from there.

879
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,780
Is God punishing me?

880
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,260
Regrettably, yes.

881
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,420
But it is, you know, a sacrifice required for the future of the human race.

882
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:23,640
And as Gary told him this story, he looked at him, and here he is sitting at the table in the Oval Office in big tears.

883
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,060
And started coming down his cheeks and splashing on the table.

884
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,760
It was just a very touching thing. He has a tender side to him.

885
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,160
A very, a very tender side.

886
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,660
Uh, just, uh, just, uh, I, uh,

887
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,940
Think for a moment how special it is to be an American.

888
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:52,540
Can we doubt that only a divine providence placed this land, this island of freedom here as a refuge for all those so-called drug criminals who yearn to breathe free?

889
00:41:53,100 --> 00:42:00,820
The revolution out of which our liberty was conceived signaled an historical call to substance abusers and the chemically dependent.

890
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,080
And in the most important area, individual use, we see progress.

891
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:11,980
The U.S. military has more than tripled the use of drugs among its personnel since 1980.

892
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:17,420
And we have done that. We will be happy to do it today if we can find some more.

893
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,740
Flash. The entire staff of the Pentagon was slipped LSD early this afternoon.

894
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:25,440
They took off all their clothes and marched to Florida to surrender to the Seminole.

895
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:32,840
What was your, what was your personal reaction, not only as Secretary of Defense, but as an American?

896
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:41,960
Uh, I, uh, uh, so I, uh, it's very difficult to answer a question like that.

897
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,920
It's like how high is high? Uh, I, uh, breathtaking.

898
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,840
Uh, and we need to keep that in balance.

899
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,760
Tonight I can report to you that Vice President Bush spoke marijuana regularly.

900
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:58,520
Flash.

901
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,600
I began to detect in him a certain calmness.

902
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:02,820
Flash. I began to detect in him a certain calmness.

903
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,520
He seemed no longer wrestling with the issue of sending American boys to be killed.

904
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,200
That awful decision that only a president can make.

905
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:18,780
I think he had resolved that in his own mind, and therefore the rest was general strategy and planning,

906
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,480
not that terrible human decision he faced.

907
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,340
What's the matter with you, soldier?

908
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,700
It's my nerves, sir.

909
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:25,620
Nerves?

910
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,360
I won't have cowards in my army.

911
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,860
It can push them out of a plane.

912
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,760
It can march them off.

913
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,280
It can march them off a cliff.

914
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,420
It can send them off to die on some godforsaken rock.

915
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,100
But for some reason, you can't slap them.

916
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,420
Now, apologize to that boy right now.

917
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,420
Sorry, Niren.

918
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,080
That's cool.

919
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,040
You didn't expect that, did you? And neither will he.

920
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,580
I tell you, Chief, I just don't know what we're going to do with him.

921
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,100
You know, you do have options.

922
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,960
We don't have too many options here, do we?

923
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,800
We do not.

924
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,240
Hey, what about military school? It set my brother straight.

925
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,800
Now he owns and operates a famous cave.

926
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,760
Call me Bob.

927
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,220
Well, that's quite a hole you're digging.

928
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,100
Thanks, Bob.

929
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,380
You know, a hole's a great place to hide when people are fighting.

930
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,580
Are there angry people in your house?

931
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,020
My dad's always yelling at Whitey's keeping him down.

932
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:17,780
I see.

933
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,280
This is a guy who three months ago was in control of a country.

934
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,100
Now he's maybe in control of a cave.

935
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,340
I'm Bob, and this here is my place.

936
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,220
It's a beautiful place.

937
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:31,740
Bob?

938
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,320
It's a pleasure to have you boys here.

939
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,180
I'm Bob, and this here is my place.

940
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,160
He's on the run.

941
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,260
If he's running at all.

942
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,820
So we don't know whether he's in a cave, with the door shut.

943
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,740
Hey, Fred!

944
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,740
Freddy, baby, open up!

945
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,560
It's me, your bosom buddy, Bonnie Rubble!

946
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,620
Cave with the door open?

947
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,540
Oh, come on, Fred, don't fool around. Open up.

948
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,940
I gotta talk to you.

949
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,060
It's pretty important.

950
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,780
All right, Bonnie, I'm coming.

951
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,680
We just don't know. There's all kinds of reports and all kinds of speculation.

952
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:16,720
Consider this rumor, which was published about three weeks ago in Rolling Stone.

953
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,820
Oh, it's gotta be true.

954
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,280
Betty Lou walked down the street.

955
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:26,400
If Bert needs a map, he must be going on a trip.

956
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,620
She said.

957
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:33,200
I will look for a map and ask him to send me a postcard.

958
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,560
Some of them have cars.

959
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,320
They took old junkers that were left behind, converted them to steam.

960
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,440
We think they may also have a gasoline source in there.

961
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,340
And power.

962
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,200
Greenhouses, rigged up generators.

963
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,920
Some areas have street lights.

964
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,180
They're crazies.

965
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,520
Christ, the guy's on his way here right now.

966
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,040
We've gotta get going tonight.

967
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,700
We're talking bureaucracy here, Lucas said.

968
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,240
We can't move it faster than it's willing to move.

969
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,060
Look, your killer is driving a junker.

970
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,880
If he pushed it as hard as he could, he wouldn't get here until tomorrow night anyway.

971
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,880
There was no longer any need to be secretive.

972
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,360
Grabbing a mitt and shears, Mahmoud went out to cut them through.

973
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:20,560
When the last strand was cut, Ibrahim pressed on the gas, and the van tore across the border.

974
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,480
This is a different kind of war.

975
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,380
Hey, you know I went down to the induction center, and they wouldn't take me?

976
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,280
They stamped constitutionally inferior on my papers.

977
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,580
I mean, do you believe that?

978
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,220
Figures.

979
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,020
The Marines want guys who are crazy about killing.

980
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,340
They don't want guys who are just crazy.

981
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,660
Hey, man, are you mad at me?

982
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,020
You move an ear.

983
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,360
You're a dead man.

984
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,220
Son of a bitch!

985
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,500
What are you doing over there?

986
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,020
He shot you in the ear.

987
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,920
Guess you weren't out of earshot.

988
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,620
You ever see anything as wet behind the ears as that?

989
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,240
Not with blood.

990
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:23,660
I'm dead.

991
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,560
I'm dead.

992
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,600
I'm dead.

993
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,740
I'm dead.

994
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:28,120


995
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,580
Let's go.

996
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:29,580


997
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:29,580


998
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,880
I'm supposed to be the big reactionary.

999
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:32,700
Okay.

1000
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,700
Say it, I don't say it.

1001
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,740
The Antichrist, Mr. 666, says it himself.

1002
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,060
666.

1003
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,380
Who is this little horned power?

1004
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,960
President of the United States?

1005
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,680
Some people say, well, Ronald Wilson Reagan.

1006
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,020
Six letters 666.

1007
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,560
No, my dear friends, he does not fit the identifying points.

1008
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,020
He might fit a few of them.

1009
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:56,680
You insinually?

1010
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:56,680


1011
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:56,680


1012
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:04,480
but not all of them this little group gathered and we very carefully would open the car door

1013
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:11,700
with the window rolled down shove the man's arm across the window and then take it the backbone

1014
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:20,480
of america and then take it over the window and then the pressure came on that hidden longing

1015
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:32,660
came out and gunshot gunshot gunshot gunshots and so forth another man about to bargain

1016
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,880
when he's got all the chips

1017
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:42,560
now he wants only one thing me alive

1018
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,800
and he'll find some mean way to kill me

1019
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,880
he'll take his time

1020
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:56,040
it'll come on him

1021
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:03,280
killing me is gonna leave a great big hole in his life where his hate was

1022
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,960
i don't reckon the man's got anything else to live for

1023
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,300
yeah that's my piece in the hole

1024
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,560
i want to kill him

1025
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:31,320
he wants to kill me slow that's it comes to a showdown

1026
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,660
well but that's another story next week i want to tell you about astro and how he was almost

1027

00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,600
and my heart

1054
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,080
is free

1055
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:08,920
from a pain

1056
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,380
for it knows

1057
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:15,420
there are no

1058
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,880
blue skies

1059
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:18,560
when seen

1060
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,440
through the eyes

1061
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:21,860
of those

1062
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,580
who are blessed

1063
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,280
with love

1064
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,640
and the singly

1065
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:27,880
great

1066
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,040
of a

1067
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,360
sour place

1068
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,820
is that

1069
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,280
it's everywhere

1070
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,320
when two people

1071
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:39,380
share

1072
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,820
all their hopes

1073
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,540
all their dreams

1074
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,200
all their

1075
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,340
lives

1076
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,200
and we're

1077
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,660
lost

1078
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,200
we're lost

1079
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,460

1081
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,640
can be

1082
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,500
free

1083
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:26,120
from

1084
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:26,820
this

1085
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,300
bad

1086
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:28,320
mess

1087
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,080
WHY BORK

1088
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,520
Precisely

1089
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:30,880
I'm not

1090
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:30,960
capricious

1091
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,180
the New York.

1092
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,540
And we also heard, of course,

1093
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:42,020
lots of Reverend Susie the Floozy's collage about the war

1094
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,000
from her WREK show.

1095
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,900
What an editor that Susie the Floozy is.

1096
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:52,880
This background music now is by the bishop as well.

1097
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,460
Oh, and friends, we heard some clips from Reverend Two Beans

1098
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:00,500
with his music called Superior Mutants.

1099
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:06,940
And, of course, we've heard lots and lots of ESO Swamp Radio.

1100
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:14,000
Yes, from WCSB Cleveland, producer Chaz Smith,

1101
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,260
and lonesome cowboy Dave.

1102
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,460
Oh, by the way, friends, we actually provide ESO CDs.

1103
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,400
That's Einstein's Secret Orchestra CDs

1104
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:29,000
at our address at www.subgenius.com.

1105
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,320
I should give...

1106
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,020
Little Theodore's address,

1107
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,640
where you can get that album,

1108
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,320
Walls of Genius, Craze to the Core,

1109
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,520
and other Little Theodore material.

1110
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,780
And this is kind of a long address, so get ready.

1111
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,020
It's a complicated one.

1113
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,760
That's one big weird word.

1123
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,740
and now this.

1124
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:38,980
We've all learned by now that one way to manage the discomfort often associated with starvation is to remain highly medicated.

1125
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:39,760
But how?

1126
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,420
Crack, crank, jam, meth, X, DMT.

1127
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:49,640
Not cool enough for you? Need a hip or high? Try new Bilge!

1128
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,700
It can make your mind gel, heart swell, feet not smell, and save you from hell like Norman Fell.

1129
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,140
Just ask this addict.

1130
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,640
Yeah, Bilge is alright if everything else is tapped.

1131
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:05,500
Damn straight. Sit and stare like you just don't care. Shoot for the hip trip, Skip.

1132
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:12,640
Bilge! As always, the first one's free, and then you'll be hooked on Bilge!

1133
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:17,840
You've never been this high before, guaranteed, and it's absolutely free.

1134
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:18,820
True that.

1135
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:24,040
Get too high and want to come down? Use our new patented Bilge pump.

1136
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:29,540
That's just 274 credits for the satisfaction of knowing that you're in control.

1137
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,860
Show your habit who's the boss. Bilge pump.

1138
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,840
Without it, you're stuck sucking. Bilge pump is a product of General Pharmaceuticals.

1139
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:41,620
The drug people.

1140
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,460
Repeated use of Bilge pump is lethal. May cause acidosis, lycanthropy, toxic shock.

1141
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,860
You are the wearer. Jackal, cat, scratch, fever, pelvic swelling, heebies, and or geebies.

1142
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,240
Now, do you know where the hamburger originated?

1143
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:51,500
No.

1144
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:57,740
It originated on the Russian steppes where medieval tartars ate raw meat,

1145
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,520
scraped and shredded with a...

1146
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,880
dull knife and seasoned with salt, pepper, and onion juice.

1147
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:07,340
German sailors picked up the delicacy at the Baltic ports

1148
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:10,840
and took the recipe back to their home base at Hamburg.

1149
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,640
Finicky hamburgers, not accustomed to eating their meat raw like savages,

1150
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:19,900
took some of the red out of the tartar steak by broiling the outside.

1151
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,720
Thus, the Hamburg steak was born.

1152
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:26,260
...has to sign in all three of these words.

1153
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,320
So even though the hamburgers took...

1154
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:34,040
credit for making it, I guess technically since they applied the heat process.

1155
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:40,020
You know, I like to think about those tartars out there scraping it with a dull knife, though.

1156
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,500
Mm-hmm. Trying to figure out how to make steak tartar but winding it up with a hamburger.

1157
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,140
Uh-huh.

1158
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:48,440
I just heard about steak tartar like a few months ago.

1159
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,160
Yeah?

1160
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,720
I had no idea that people ate that.

1161
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,680
And did you try some or...

1162
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,020
Oh, no.

1163
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,740
You would never... Why? Because of the sauce?

1164
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,280
Because I wouldn't eat raw meat.

1165
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,800
Yeah, that is a problem.

1166
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,160
Me either.

1167
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:01,820
How about raw fish?

1168
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:02,260
Yes.

1169
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,080
I don't even eat cooked meat.

1170
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:11,860
I will only eat raw fish if they have fins and scales.

1171
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,560
I only eat nuts.

1172
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,200
I'm a strict nutarian.

1173
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,080
Like a breatharian?

1174
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,180
I eat seeds and nuts. I'm kind of like a squirrel in that sense.

1175
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,420
I'm on a squirrel diet.

1176
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,560
Does that work?

1177
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:35,320
Uh, yeah. It actually works real well. It's sort of high in oil, but it keeps your weight down otherwise.

1178
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,420
But you get lots of energy?

1179
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:47,120
Yeah. I'm a bountiful bastion of energy. I'm a skyrocket of energy.

1180
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,660
Yeah, well, you can't push...

1181
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,700
You can tell right now.

1182
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,820
Is he the were-jackal?

1183
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:55,300
Are you the were-jackal?

1184
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:57,880
Are you sure?

1185
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,080
Really?

1186
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:04,480
Did you know that the first sign of Jackalian lycanthropy is denial?

1187
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:10,380
Face it. You could be the were-jackal. You have not met your sacrifice quota.

1188
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:17,300
At any minute, you could transform into a hideous, terrifying beast and eviscerate those closest to you.

1189
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,340
How would you live it down?

1190
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:22,780
Could you ever show your face in your pod again?

1191
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,900
Of course not.

1192
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,860
You cannot go on for another second.

1193
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,160
You can't even recycle without knowing for sure.

1194
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:34,880
And the only way to know for sure is with Mr. Know-It-All's Were-Jackal Home Test Kit.

1195
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:38,880
Just a few ounces of urine is all that stands between you and certainty.

1196
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:45,700
That's Mr. Know-It-All's Were-Jackal Home Test Kit, now available from General Pharmaceuticals, a division of Glorp Co.

1197
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,780
Obey the were-jackal.

1198
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:54,860
Obey the were-jackal.

A piece of amber, and a young scientist who couldn't resist a bargain.

1203
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:09,900
A strange combination, but they might have added up to an important discovery.

1204
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,120
Stranger things have happened.

1205
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:17,980
After all, it is said that the law of gravitation was discovered because an apple fell off a tree.

1206
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:25,020
Of course, what we've shown you was fiction, but often, fiction and truth run a very close parallel.
