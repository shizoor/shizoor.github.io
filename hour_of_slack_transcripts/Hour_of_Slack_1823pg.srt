I've been writing ten letters to Buddy Holly

24
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,200
I'm down in steerage on Fulton's Folly

25
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,960
I stay one step ahead of the melancholy

26
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,240
I lift two doors down from the old man on the corner

27
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,820
There's a window next door, somebody oughta want her

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,220
Daddy digs through your trash when the weather gets warmer

29
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,760
I lift two doors down from the old man on the corner

30
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,660
Come a summer, we'll be dancing in the street

31
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,520
Come a summer, down the corner gonna meet you

32
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,200
Come a summer, there's a party on the block

33
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,980
Somebody hit the snooze on the doomsday clock

34
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,940
I'm down in steerage on Fulton's Folly

35
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,380
I'm three floors up from a band on the skills

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,880
They practice all night, those goddamn kids

37
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,180
They called the demolition debris and they probably did

38
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,660
They sound like a bus going over a cliff

39
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,540
Come a summer, we'll be dancing in the street

40
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,420
Come a summer, down the corner gonna meet you

41
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,120
Come a summer, there's a party on the block

42
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,720
Somebody hit the snooze on the doomsday clock

43
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,960
Come a summer

44
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,460
I'm four days late from making my rent

45
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,160
My baby gave me the dough but now it's all spent

46
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,920
Born on my bed, had to go to bed, had to go to bed

47
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:58,920


48
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,660
Got dropped in the jukebox, that's where it went

49
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,540
Come a summer, we'll be dancing in the street

50
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,380
Come a summer, down the corner gonna meet you

51
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,080
Come a summer, there's a party on the block

52
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,740
Somebody hit the snooze on the doomsday clock

53
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,840
Come a summer

54
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,680
Come a summer

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,420
Come a summer

56
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,080
Come a summer

57
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,080


58
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,920
Come a summer

59
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,740
Come a summer

60
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,500
Come a summer

61
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,280
Come a summer

62
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,880
Come a summer

63
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,660
Come a summer

64
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,580
Come a summer

65
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,340
Come a summer

66
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:55,900
Bob Walkenhorst, a chipper straight up rock and roll song there called Come a Summer.

67
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,900
Now I'm going to keep this happy voice.

68
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:06,400
vibe going with a pretty old song from the famous ancient Broadway musical, My Fair Lady.

69
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,700
This is from the movie soundtrack, and it happens to be a perfect subgenius anthem,

70
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,800
specifically a rewardian subgenius anthem, or what we might call classic so-called slacker

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:28,260
anthem, sung by Stanley Holloway. Listen to the words, or at least try to follow the subtitles.

72
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:36,960
The Lord above gave man an arm of iron, so he could do his job and never shirk.

73
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:45,540
The Lord above gave man an arm of iron, but with a little bit of luck, with a little bit of luck,

74
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:52,620
someone else will do the blinking work. With a little bit, with a little bit,

75
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,300
with a little bit of luck, you'll never work.

76
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,880
The Lord above made man a man, and he made man a man.

77
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:04,000
The Lord above made liquor for temptation, to see if man could turn away from sin.

78
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:12,580
The Lord above made liquor for temptation, but with a little bit of luck, with a little bit of luck,

79
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,640
when temptation comes, you'll give right in.

80
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:23,500
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of luck, you'll give right in.

81
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,400
Oh, you can walk the straight and narrow,

82
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,880
but with a little bit of luck, you'll never work.

83
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,860
With a little bit of luck, you'll run amok.

84
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:38,640
The gentle sex was made for man to marry, to share his nest and see his food is cooked.

85
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:47,240
The gentle sex was made for man to marry, but with a little bit of luck, with a little bit of luck,

86
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,140
you can have it all and not get hooked.

87
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:58,020
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of luck, you won't get hooked.

88
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:17,620
And with a little bit of luck, you can tell even the narwhal to a peso longer.

89
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,160
With a little bit, Preston, give me your money, just don't forget what you promised me.

90
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,640
When you Home Run it towards the aberία rootthers of the antibiotics and food you lost,

91
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,260
best way to get it just for the best of luck, is to keep it in holiday.

92
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:22,380
dra 그러니, extortOh man.

93
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:22,760
So long as when the worst comes to best of luck, I'll know that it's above,

94
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,120
the product is sub exhibitions.

95
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,320
Best bets are like this,

96
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,020
Best bets are like this,

97
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,300
best bets are like this,

98
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,860
All of this kink.

99
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,020
little bit of luck, you know when it comes around you won't be home.

100
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:40,780
We have a little bit, we have a little bit, we have a little bit of luck we won't be home.

101
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:48,840
We have a little bit, we have a little bit, we have a little bit of blooming luck.

102
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,440
You make a good suffrage, you!

103
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,720
That's right, leave the gas alone!

104
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,380
Why there's the lucky man now, the Honourable Alfie Doolittle.

105
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,420
What are you doing in Eliza's house?

106
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:15,040
A former residence. Ha! You can buy your own drinks now, Alfie Doolittle. Fallen into a tub of butter, you have.

107
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,960
What are you talking about?

108
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,300
Your daughter Eliza. Oh, you're a lucky man, Alfie Doolittle.

109
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,420
Well, what about Eliza?

110
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,860
Ah! He don't know. Her own father and he don't know.

111
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:37,420
Moved in with a swell Eliza has. Left her in a taxi all by herself smart as paint and ain't been home for three days.

112
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,360
Go on.

113
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,660
And this morning I gets a message from her.

114
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:48,720
She wants her things sent over to 27A Wimpole Street, care of Professor Regians.

115
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,880
And what things does she want?

116
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,180
What?

117
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,860
A bird cage and a Chinese fan.

118
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,900
But she says, never mind about sending any clothes.

119
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,680
I knew she had a career in front of her.

120
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,220
Eddie boy, we're in for a booze up. The sun is shining on Alfie Doolittle.

121
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:24,000
A man was made to help support his children, which is the right and proper thing to do.

122
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,140
A man was made to help support his children.

123
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:35,560
But with a little bit of luck, with a little bit of luck, they'll go out and start supporting you.

124
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:43,300
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of luck they'll work for you.

125
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:51,240
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of blooming luck.

126
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:06,360
Oh, it's a crime for man to go philandering and fill his wife's poor heart with grief and doubt.

127
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,960
Oh, it's a crime for man to go philandering, but with a little bit of luck,

128
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,740
with a little bit of luck you can see the bloodhound don't find out.

129
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,500
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of luck she won't find out.

130
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,400
Charlie, come here, come here.

131
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,200
With a little bit, with a little bit of blooming luck.

132
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,640
With a little bit of blooming luck.

133
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,640
Hi, Mom. We had a game this afternoon, but our side lost. What do you want at the store?

134
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,560
More sugar, son. Here's the list. These are the people I want you to turn in, and here's the family pocketbook.

135
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,400
I need these things in a hurry, too.

136
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,200
Okay, Mom. I'll take my bike.

137
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,100
Hi, Mom. Say, will you let me trade work tonight?

138
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,260
I was supposed to do the dishes, but Jane's father is going to show the movies of their trip.

139
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
May I get supper?

140
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,960
Well, I think so. Tonight's the family boon meeting, you know. I wouldn't want you to be late.

141
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,200
You sure you'll be back in time?

142
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,320
Well, Janie said they were going to have the movies right after supper. I'll be home by eight.

143
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,040
Well, that's all right then, Heineke. Suppose you set the table and I'll start making the salad.

144
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,880
I'll dive right in.

145
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,620
Where's the liquor?

146
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,820
Okay. Come to order over there.

147
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:38,520
All right. Now the chief... Shut up. The chief thing to talk over is our vacation.

148
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,140
Right, Chief.

149
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,880
But perhaps, Mother. Perhaps...

150
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,560
Perhaps there's some small things first.

151
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,740
Well, they're small, but they're hard.

152
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:53,120
And, John, I know it's hard to be neat, but tonight in the living room I stumbled over the stiff fingers of a catcher's mitt.

153
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,660
Oh, God.

154
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:00,280
And I had to take Patty's period back to school before she'd study them, and I could sit down in the big electric chair.

155
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:00,780
Oh, Mom.

156
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,340
Well, maybe we could be more careful where we put things.

157
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,440
Yes, I think we... I think they ought to.

158
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,960
Okay, now, young... John, John, yes.

159
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,940
Anything you want to bring?

160
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:11,940


161
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,700
Just my dinner, Dad.

162
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,600
Cute kid.

163
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,740
Gee, he's neat, isn't he?

164
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:17,960
Yeah.

165
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,300
I'd like to bring up our vacation, Dad. Gee, you should have seen those pictures tonight.

166
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,080
Oh, yeah.

167
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,800
They were in color and everything.

168
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,400
Well, now, now, now, now.

169
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,440
Now, last... Did it have the dentist in it?

170
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:29,760
Yes.

171
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,480
I love those.

172
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,240
And the nun.

173
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,140
Yes, the Cary Grant mask.

174
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:33,860
Yeah, that's a lot.

175
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,380
I love that one. That's the same trip I went on.

176
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,460
And the nun with the mole.

177
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,580
Yes, I know.

178
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,060
Dad.

179
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,260
That mole is so small you wouldn't expect...

180
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,160
He lives under the yard.

181
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,680
Yes.

182
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,060
Come on, Dad. What about our vacation?

183
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:50,200
All right, let's see. Back to the meeting here. Yes. Well, last time we decided that one of you should go to camp.

184
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,460
And he never came back.

185
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,200
And that the other one would go on a trip with us.

186
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,600
Oh, well, gee, let John go to camp this summer. I went last year and then the rest of us could all take a trip together.

187
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,500
Those pictures sure must have been wonderful.

188
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,160
They sure were.

189
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,100
That mole. I thought you wanted to go to camp.

190
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,560
I've been camping all morning.

191
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,860
What do you say, John?

192
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,480
Well, gosh, Dad, I'd say I don't know.

193
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,420
Ask Yoko.

194
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,740
Couldn't I do both?

195
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:23,040
Well, now the family budget says camp for just one of you. Now, it wouldn't be fair for one person to do both, would it?

196
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,760
Well, I'm a schizophrenic.

197
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,820
Yeah, and I'm a bisexual.

198
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,760
I'm bored.

199
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,340
Well, now, let's wait until tomorrow and see if that decision is sticky... sticks, shall we?

200
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:32,760
Like the catcher myth.

201
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
John, cut it out.

202
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,980
Then we can plan some more.

203
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,840
Well, you see that John and Patty are already friends.

204
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,820
They're full-fledged citizens in their family.

205
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,920
They have a regular share in the family's work.

206
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,040
They help to make the family's plans.

207
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,260
Well, kids, so long now.

208
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,300
Hope you had a good time with the Whisperin' Squash again today.

209
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,860
Remember, bye for now, because you may not have a chance to bye for tomorrow.

210
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,000
So long, kids!

211
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,740
So long!

212
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,560
Hooray for Squash!

213
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,180
Yay!

214
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:17,260
The Firesign Theatre did that, a happy family scene called Family Bund Meeting from the

215
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,680
collection Dope Humor of the Seventies.

216
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:27,420
See thefiresigntheatre.com, but spell theatre the British way.

217
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,060
You know, I've been playing happy songs.

218
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,680
Well, here's the happiest song of all from the swinginest, lovinest bunch of corpses

219
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,980
you ever heard, the swingin' love corpses, with Dr. Philo Drummond, Colonel Sphinx Drummond,

220
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,260
Ray Hay on guitar, Leif Cowabunga on bass, and Skippy Mojo Butcher on drums.

221
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,380
I think I got that right.

222
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,760
The song, We Are Going to Save the Universe.

223
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,160
Now, is that cheerful or what?

224
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,820
This is a song I don't know about because it worked.

225
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,560
It's about the night we saved the universe.

226
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,300
Groupies.

227
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,560
Yeah.

228
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,260
When we were born into this life

229
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,700
We were destined to make it right

230
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,780
And it's pretty turnin'

231
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,300
And this is our fate

232
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,080
We're singin' this song

233
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,920
So you can read late

234
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,300
We are going to save the universe

235
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,120
We are going to save the universe

236
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,000
We are going to save the universe

237
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,320
This time

238
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:21,900
It's time

239
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,660
We are full grown

240
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,340
We are grown up men

241
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,580
We are law-masters

242
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,580
We've been made to reason it

243
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:42,360
It is our mission, it is our task, it's all for us, yet you still ask.

244
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:52,460
We are going to save the universe, we are going to save the universe, we are going to save the universe.

245
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,800
It's time!

246
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,100
It's time!

247
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,240
It's time!

248
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,320
Don't you worry.

249
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,140
Don't have no fears.

250
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,940
Don't get out of sight.

251
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,720
Because we are in this gear.

252
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,360
We can't wait.

253
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,800
So please understand.

254
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,920
We're in control.

255
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,920
And we are more than a band.

256
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:29,820
We are going to save the universe, we are going to save the universe, we are going to save the universe.

257
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,400
It's time!

258
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,160
It's time!

259
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,700
It's time!

260
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,720
It's time!

261
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,280
It's time!

262
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,240
It's time!

263
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:47,800
It's time!

264
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,900
It's time!

265
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,300
It's time!

266
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,240
Well, maybe next time.

267
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,680
The Swingin' Love Corps is with the Drummond brothers on vocals.

268
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,360
Speaking of which.

269
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,800
Puzzling evidence.

270
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:13,020
Evidence recently unearthed one of his old shows that happened to have both Philo and Sphinx in the KPFA studio in Berkeley with Dr. Howell back in May of 1999.

271
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,160
I haven't actually heard it yet, or at least not in 22 years.

272
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,620
Let's check some of it out.

273
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:29,900
I've realized in editing that I need to explain this scene that's about to happen on the Puzzling Evidence show.

274
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:45,860
Philo and his brother were on, and just as Philo went off to go to the bathroom or something, his dead dog, Little Dude, called in.

275
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,600
Philo had this beloved little dog named Lil' Dude.

276
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:59,920
And every now and then, it was like Lil' Dude would somehow call the show.

277
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,420
It didn't happen often, but when it did happen, Philo missed it.

278
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,920
What, Lil' Caller?

279
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,120
Dude!

280
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,220
Oh, of course, I knew it.

281
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:18,960
Well, as a person who's a professional telephone pole climber, I must say it is a hazard to have, to battle nails and staples.

282
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,820
They're only at the bottom, aren't they?

283
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,560
Yeah, so if you do fall, you're not going to fall like 30 feet.

284
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,980
That's the good thing.

285
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,000
You'll only fall 30, 30, 1 foot 30 times.

286
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,320


287
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,320
Berlin, Germany, Chicago, Illinois.

288
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:33,940
Who is this now?

289
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,040
This is Lil' Dude.

290
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,340
Wow, Lil' Dude finally called.

291
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,980
How about Austin?

292
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,100
Lil' Dude, are you calling from under the ground in Missouri or something?

293
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,060
No, I'm from a different place.

294
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,980
A better place, I think.

295
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,700
A better place.

296
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,280
Do you have any words of wisdom for us?

297
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,300
Well, I'd like to talk to Philo.

298
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,980
Oh, boy, that's going to be tough, you know.

299
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,380
What do you want to know?

300
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,220
For reasons the callers can only guess at.

301
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,360
I am Philo by proxy.

302
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,440
Oh, can I talk to Philo's brother?

303
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,100
I'm Philo by proxy.

304
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,840
I lost my career and I cry in my beer.

305
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,240
Yeah, that is the famous Philo's brother.

306
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,600
Also known as Hector.

307
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,180
Remember that time I peed on your leg?

308
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,540
Also, Bavoso.

309
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,140
Remember that time I peed on your leg and you kicked me?

310
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,420
Yeah.

311
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,420
Oh, I'm Lil' Dude's revenge.

312
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,340
This is getting kind of creepy.

313
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,200
No.

314
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,000
I hate you for that.

315
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,180
No.

316
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:30,980
I do.

317
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,420
I really wasn't kicking you.

318
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,620
What I was trying to do was point you in a direction in a rapid manner.

319
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,140
Not bad.

320
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,980
I'm sorry if the impact of my good intentions was, you know, to your detriment, but hey, I was...

321
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,500
You were just trying to pet me with your foot, I know.

322
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,060
Yeah.

323
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,580
Just, you know.

324
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,440
Where's the...

325
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,220
Where's the book that says you can only pet an animal with your hand?

326
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,480
Oh, here it is right here.

327
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,180
The genteel guide to animal husbandry.

328
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,360
The special section on your board.

329
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,960
Take it apart and see if it works.

330
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,060
Oh, it's still built in...

331
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,820
I didn't call you an animal.

332
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,100
All animal products from Edible, Missouri.

333
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:20,720
Well, we also have an announcement that the Big Top 23 Circus will...

334
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,700
Exhibit its curiosity cabinet of wonder and oddities on the 22nd...

335
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,880
Philo's brother.

336
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,380
...Dolce B, Dr. Howland, Alcantara...

337
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,740
I'm Philo's brother.

338
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,640
Aerial acts are performed...

339
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm Philo's brother.

340
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,420
This is at the Cyclone Warehouse, 1842 Illinois Street...

341
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,560
Man, this little dude guy can talk forever even though his lungs are, you know, probably leathery and...

342
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,300
This is a benefit...

343
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,140
There's probably worms crawling out of the...

344
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,080
...the bones between his eyes.

345
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,540
...drug rehab program.

346
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,540
I don't know, now it's just...

347
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,460
But that was the best tape ever.

348
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,100
The little dude digging up the backyard tape.

349
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,680
That was amazing.

350
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,940
Because about two months later, the Times Beach story broke and...

351
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,300
It's like...

352
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,500
In the meantime...

353
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,300
And it is a meantime...

354
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,200
Don't be scared, little caller.

355
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,580
When will we hear from the Book of Bob?

356
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,660
Hyperventilation verse one.

357
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,540
Oh, man, you know...

358
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,920
Those have gone off in all sorts of directions.

359
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,720
But I'm sure you'll...

360
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,860
You could hear from them...

361
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,640
Hell, what am I saying?

362
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,100
In June 10th in Portland, right?

363
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,580
At the Lawsuit of Bob.

364
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,040
Man, that's one of the best jams.

365
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,540
At the Lawsuit of Bob, which is now a club in L.A.

366
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,820
There was so much money made by all the people in Lawsuit that they all got together as friends and bought a club in L.A.

367
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,160
And it's called Lawsuit O' Bob.

368
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,040
You remember doing this one, Philo?

369
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,220
Good Lord.

370
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,160
Hey, I just got back.

371
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,480
What is that?

372
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,480
What is that?

373
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,220
I didn't miss anything, did I?

374
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,940
No, except little dude called.

375
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,540
You didn't miss anything except little dude.

376
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,320
Little dude called?

377
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,380
Oh, man.

378
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,440
And you weren't here.

379
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,300
Oh.

380
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,980
You must have been frapping or driving.

381
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,620
No, I was...

382
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,960
Well, I was actually answering to nature's most urgent call.

383
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:00,960
Yeah, frapping.

384
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,440
That's what I thought.

385
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,080
His nature's voice I hear and I obey.

386
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,180
Brother to Joe...

387
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,100
We had to go hiking two miles into the forest today to do that.

388
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,920
To do that?

389
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,120
To do this.

390
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,980
Oh, my...

391
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,020
Now throw that big community-sized towel over it.

392
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,240
That huge towel, yes.

393
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,900
That huge towel gets larger and larger.

394
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,560
No.

395
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,400
Throw that building...

396
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,800
I mean that city-sized towel.

397
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,860
We're just trying to keep it nice and spanking clean here.

398
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,140
It turns into a Richard Bartholomew story.

399
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,900
Yeah, exactly.

400
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:37,080
Puzzling evidence with Dr. Howland's special guest, the Drummond brothers, Philo and Sphinx.

401
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:45,000
And here's something new and slack-imbuing, the latest Dobbstown Mirror, and it's an eight-pager.

402
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,600
Check this out, friends.

403
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,560
From Dobbstown.com.

404
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,380
Actually, this doesn't say the Dobbstown Mirror.

405
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:04,280
It just says the Dobbstown Mirror, number 104, volume two, number two, April 1st, 23 AX.

406
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
That's this year.

407
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,960
Five dollars, boy.

408
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,480
Well, see, it's an eight-pager.

409
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,660
It's got a big picture on the front by Zontar.

410
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,600
Of Dobbstown.

411
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,520
Dobbstown is a part of Dobbstown.

412
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,720
Here, let's read the first part.

413
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,940
Do you suffer from chronic ringing grin-itis?

414
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,080
Or I suppose you could pronounce that grin-itis.

415
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,580
Can't help but laugh at the horror.

416
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:43,440
Ready for a religion that considers you equal, not in your soul or in heaven, but in that most sacred of all parts of your body, your wallet?

417
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,880
Us too.

418
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,020
Why?

419
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,320
Why must we always wait for future events?

420
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:54,640
What would it mean to you to wait for now or wait for the past?

421
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:03,880
The Church of the Subgenius offers complete satisfaction, free instructions in exchange for money.

422
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,960
The conspiracy is powerful and skilled in deception.

423
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,560
As a member of the Church of the Subgenius moves away from the con,

424
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:24,260
he or she may move in any direction, including directions that to other subgeniee look strange or even wrong.

425
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:32,260
The only wrong way to be a subgenius is to never send in your membership fee to the Church of the Subgenius, Subgenius Foundation.

426
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,000
Think of it.

427
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:40,300
A mind control cult that actively does not care if you conform to its rules.

428
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,780
Can yours say the same?

429
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,780
Last each day as if you live.

430
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,820
Oh Bob, I sell just about anything to just about anybody.

431
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,780
What's he sold you today?

432
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,260
The conspiracy has over 10,000 nuclear warheads in their arsenals.

433
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,120
The Church of the Subgenius?

434
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,520
Only three.

435
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,200
And yet we dare to challenge them.

436
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,760
The advertisement that all advertisements are based on is advertising warheads.

437
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:19,580
The belief that all beliefs are based on is the belief that beliefs are real.

438
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:28,360
The Church of the Subgenius is a sinous sacrilegion and a society of superior mutants.

439
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,540
Bob said, you can be what you won't.

440
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,880
Adopt the mask of sanity.

441
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,740
Be so lucky that everything that happens is what you wanted to happen.

442
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:47,020
And treat that as if it were the most normal thing in the world.

443
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:53,860
Self-initiate your future self into your present perfected form.

444
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,120
Prescribe your own script.

445
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:05,940
Well, that was a nice first section there from the Dobstown Mirror.

446
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,900
There's so many fine features in here.

447
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,840
Oh my gosh, here's a

448
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,220
article on optimism.

449
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,480
But I better not read it because I'm not sure whether I've read that one already.

450
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,660
But there's a rant in here

451
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,300
by the late Dr. Katahdin Leghim from 1999

452
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,980
about rain. And it's really, really touching.

453
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,680
Actually, it's super touching.

454
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,940
Maybe I should read it.

455
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,740
Rain by Dr. Katahdin Leghim.

456
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,400
Man, I'm tuned.

457
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,460
It's rained maybe twice this summer.

458
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,580
And the news said we might have a thunderstorm tonight.

459
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,580
It's been near 100 degrees all weekend.

460
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,800
I'd welcome rain like a brother.

461
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,960
I told Susie, I'm going out. Gonna do a rain dance.

462
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:04,100
She, of course, gave me that, you're nuts, but I knew that when I married you, look.

463
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:09,140
I stepped out the front door and shook my meaty butt a while.

464
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,720
And said to no deity in particular,

465
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,320
Come on! Rain!

466
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,100
A drop hit me on my t-shirt.

467
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,440
And another.

468
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,320
In about two minutes, I felt myself begin to tune.

469
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:31,940
The rain was falling in buckets and I was standing all alone in the courtyard right in the middle of the downpour.

470
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:37,080
I was seized up in the now, feeling the cool wind whipping around me,

471
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,140
the air fresh and sweet.

472
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,980
The rain fell hard and cold on my bald head,

473
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,320
running down in rivulets.

474
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,580
From a nearby vacant apartment, I could hear Stan, the maintenance man's CD player,

475
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:57,780
blasting out the ten-minute instrumental intro to Pink Floyd's Shine On, You Crazy Diamond.

476
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:05,720
I knew that the other tenants in my apartment complex were staring out their windows at me, thinking me mad.

477
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,980
I didn't give a . . .

478
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,140
Bob?

479
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,440
The poor fools didn't know what they were missing.

480
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,840
I stood there for the duration of the storm,

481
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,820
lightning crashing violently,

482
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,520
wind ripping leaves from the trees,

483
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,420
and rain like a deluge on me.

484
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:28,800
A chubby girl about ten years old came out of her apartment and walked over to me, grinning.

485
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,760
She knew why I was out there when all the older and wiser didn't.

486
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,700
Other kids came and did their thing.

487
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,460
Stared out their windows, wanting to come out too,

488
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,700
but their parents wouldn't let them.

489
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,180
Oh, perish forbid.

490
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,300
Only fools don't have the sense to come in out of the rain.

491
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,260
But if that rain makes me a fool,

492
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,900
then hand me the pointed hat.

493
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:57,340
That wasn't rain that fell from the sky on me this evening.

494
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,700
It was just wet slack.

495
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:13,000
Wow. By Dr. Le Guim from the Dobbs Town Mirror.

496
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,380
Latest edition.

497
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,860
And, uh . . .

498
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,480
But now this.

499
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:53,620
. . .

500
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,380
If your body's feeling bad

501
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,720
And it's the only one you have

502
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,040
You wanna take her with a play

503
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,460
Go on walking in the rain

504
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,820
Watch the flowers go to bed

505
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,300
Ask the man inside your head

506
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,600
You'll never have to leave

507
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,900
All you gotta do is believe

508
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,780
Nothing ever

509
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,320
Amen and Hallelujah

510
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,980
I sense sickness in this room friends

511
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,160
Lots and lots of invalid sickness

512
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,280
And who is fully licensed by the state of New Jersey

513
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,580
New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania

514
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,920
To fully and completely heal you by laying hands on you

515
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,180
No one's gonna say no

516
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,900
That's right me, I can do it

517
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,100
Step forward friends, step forward

518
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,880
And let me lay hands on you

519
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,640
All you gotta do is dream

520
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,980
Your body's gonna stop the fear

521
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,360
Amen

522
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,000
Sing adrift, set holding fire

523
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,460
Everlasting sweet desire

524
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,740
If you matter what the doctor say

525
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,000
Heal a man and he'll steal away

526
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,620
Immortality for two

527
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,220
Miracles they come for you

528
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,340
The Big Hero

529
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,160
Can I put my hands on you?

530
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,200
Can I put my hands on you?

531
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,820
Yes friends, it is me again

532
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,680
Like a specter emerging from under a rock

533
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,700
I'm back to make you happy in the name of Jesus

534
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,720
That's right

535
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,080
Come on, I saw you, I saw you

536
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,060
I got to you, Tom

537
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,280
You got it that you can't beat me

538
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,360
Well, it ain't just me

539
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,020
That's right, you've got to heal me

540
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,700
All I gotta do the bell is ring

541
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,640
Oh, check it out when you find me

542
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,540
I'm in charge, I'm in the middle of things

543
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,860
Play me수리

544
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:13,860


545
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,260
More power, more power

546
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:14,260


547
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:14,360
эта 말 경우에는

548
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,420
If I could stop the pain

549
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:22,480
I had the courage to run away

550
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,740
Andrea Day and everyone I've known

551
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,200
Inside the head

552
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,480
Finger drips and holding fire

553
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,940
Everlasting sweet desire

554
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,700
Can I put my hands on you?

555
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,840
Can I put my hands on you?

556
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:12,040
Friends, I need only your soft touch to do my work

557
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,520
So many of you have sinned

558
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,560
So many of you have sinned

559
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,500
God's not gonna let go

560
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,180
He's gonna punish you

561
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,800
God hates folks who are fat

562
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,100
God hates folks who are safety small

563
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,020
God hates, God hates, God hates

564
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,300
Where's God's love?

565
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,680
Oh, where's God's love?

566
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,080
Can I put my hands on you?

567
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,380
Can I put my hands on you?

568
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,240
Yeah, friends, I have sinned on you

569
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,260
Can I put my hands on you?

570
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,220
I have no one seeking in the back

571
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,520
I have no one seeking in the back

572
00:35:59,520 --> 00:35:59,680
of a car

573
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,100
I've known sin in the back of a barn

574
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,460
I've gone far to know sin, friends

575
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,120
I've traveled miles and miles and miles

576
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,820
I say I know, please forgive me

577
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,920
I just need your touch to forgive me

578
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,920
Please lay hands on me

579
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,760
That's right, right back there

580
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:26,940
Can I put my hands on you?

581
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,400
Can I put my hands on you?

582
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,660
Can I put my hands on you?

583
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,140
Can I put my hands on you?

584
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,040
Amen and Hallelujah

585
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,300
Wait, wait, wait, my light's gone

586
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,100
I can't feel my love

587
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,220
Lord

588
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,360
That was Einstein's Secret Orchestra, or ESO,

589
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,740
covering Alex Harvey's Faith Healer.

590
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,600
I used to rant during the instrumental part of that.

591
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,060
I've got deep vivals.

592
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,420
But now, ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB, Cleveland,

593
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,080
around the year 2000,

594
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,520
in trouble with buttons.

595
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,280
What happens if I push that button?

596
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,260
I don't know what happens if you pass that button, but...

597
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,700
There's these little lights on the phone, and I'm...

598
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,320
I push these... I push the red button, but...

599
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,440
Well, as you notice, staying over there to the left of the grill...

600
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,900
And here's the util phone.

601
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,000
It says speaker and phone,

602
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,060
so I think someone is importantly trying to convocate us,

603
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,380
but we can't evacuate the system.

604
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:56,800
Uh, hello?

605
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,320
Hello?

606
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,780
No, I'm kidding, that doesn't work.

607
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,740
Now push one and pull the other one at the same time, and maybe...

608
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,160
Hey man, hey man, you're blowing my FCC qualifications.

609
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,840
Let's quit talking.

610
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,160
I'm not...

611
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,880
Let's not even...

612
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,880
No, we were just kidding about the collar.

613
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:15,460
Let's not use the word blowing anything of anything you have in any contextual situation, please.

614
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,620
For the love of Dobbs.

615
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,400
And whatever happened to Mike?

616
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,060
For the love of Mike.

617
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,840
And for the love of the most important thing in the world...

618
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,920
For the love of Mike!

619
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,360
I need you.

620
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,020
For the love of money!

621
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,700
For the...

622
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,740
Is she singing about Buddha again?

623
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,080
Well, uh, let's see.

624
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,300
Ima Sumac here...

625
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,760
Buddha's my kind of guy.

626
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,060
This is a song called Aklataki, chant of the chosen maidens.

627
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,000
These are your Neanderthal babes, your Yeti girls, your were-women...

628
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,100
They're gonna be taken to the sacrificial rock, and rocked by the sur...

629
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,780
Surf...

630
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:52,540
Surf...

631
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:52,720
Surf...

632
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,640
Surf...

633
00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:04,040
And I suppose the priestly class will have some sort of fun with them, because they were captured and enslaved from a local tribe that lost the big bowling tournament.

634
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,000
Right? Am I correct?

635
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,820
That's all... Yeah, well, that's, uh...

636
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,380
Isn't that the way they used to do it down there in Peru?

637
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,440
You know, yes, the conspiracy actually echoes down through human history.

638
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:22,900
Just as today, we suffer under its sometimes subtle jackboot, so too did the ancient...

639
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,140
A subtle... subtle jackboot...

640
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,120
The Lemurians, the Atlanteans, also knew of the conspiracy.

641
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,760
But don't you think subtle jackboot would be a delicious name for a band that could perform not one, but three songs?

642
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,860
Oh, I gotta... No, no, subtle jackboot is a good name for a band.

643
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,540
Princess, we and I have formed a new band just because we... we...

644
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,700
Subtle jerkwaters.

645
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:44,680
Had the name...

646
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,420
Okay, here's the band name.

647
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:46,780
Okay.

648
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,760
Poo Water Towel.

649
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,020
I already thought of that.

650
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,440
Oh.

651
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,960
That's old, man. Poo Water Towel? Come on, you know, I said... I had Poo Water...

652
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,320
There probably was a band called Poo Water Towel.

653
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:04,300
There was Poo Water Dissonance. It was an old 19th... early 70s Cleveland band, art band. Poo Water Dissonance.

654
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:04,800
Really?

655
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,120
Yes. And they played in high frequency dog tones, mostly.

656
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:15,700
But they were bursted by the ASPIC... the Society for Refurbishment of the Animal Crew.

657
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,780
And one man was sent to punishment for, I think, like 40 years.

658
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,640
Oh, wow.

659
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,340
Yeah, let's see.

660
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,540
Do you know the song?

661
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,540


662
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,540


663
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,540


664
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,540


665
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,540


666
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,540


667
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,540


668
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,540


669
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,540


670
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,540


671
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,540


672
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,540


673
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,540


674
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,580
Get the other one!

675
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:42,920
Now what?

676
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:42,920


677
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,460
Come on, everybody, stick your finger in your nose!

678
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,140
Pick aim on the rock and light it on your face!

679
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,920
I don't know how to read him one way or the other...

680
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,420
It's pretty Baz depending on what he's really trying to do and what he's really trying to

681
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:51,420


682
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:51,420


683
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,420
Extra happy to wipe it on your brother

684
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,660
Robbing in your bar

685
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,060
And you're looking at your neighbor

686
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:56,680
Pining nuggets

687
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,300
Loving sauce

688
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,760
Just like the saber in the paper

689
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,380
He's pulling

690
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,180
He's tugging

691
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,260
He's yanking on the snake

692
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,220
It's a long stride

693
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,940
His feet still connected to the brain

694
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,020
Pick a booger

695
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,360
Lick a booger

696
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,320
Pick a booger

697
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,580
Pick a booger

698
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,860
Everybody's doing it

699
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,140
Picking it and chewing it

700
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:34,780
Sing it

701
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,020
He's rolling

702
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,300
He's checking in for hair

703
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,500
He's picking his feet away

704
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,080
Still looking at the paper

705
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,380
He's taking on his anger

706
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,520
He's making it today

707
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,740
Pick a booger

708
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,120
Booger

709
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,200
It's a new day today

710
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,580
I'm an alabaster

711
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,460
He's a deep inside

712
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,600
A sign that he's a slave

713
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,980
To the master of his role

714
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,400
He'll sign it

715
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:51,400


716
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,640
Kids all want a half day's

717
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,020
of information

718
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,700
Because a pick a booger booger

719
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,800
Is the new sensation

720
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,080
Pick a booger

721
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,440
Lick a booger

722
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,500
Pick a booger

723
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,840
Lick a booger

724
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,700
Lick it

725
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:12,700


726
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:12,700


727
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:12,700


728
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:12,760
Lick it

729
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,660
Lick it

Lick it

731
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,660
Thank you.

732
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,760
Thank you.

733
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:32,640
Thank you.

734
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,860
Thank you.

735
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,960
Thank you.

736
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,200
Thank you.

737
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,160
Thank you.

738
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,700
Thank you.

739
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,060
Thank you.

740
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,920
Thank you.

741
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,220
Thank you.

742
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:07,940
Thank you.

743
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:08,900
Thank you.

744
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:09,620
Thank you.

745
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:10,180
Thank you.

746
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:10,360
Thank you.

747
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:11,760
Thank you.

748
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:11,760


749
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:11,760


750
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:11,760


751
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,620
More happy music, dear friends.

752
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,740
The happiest ever.

753
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,260
Pick a Booger by

754
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,000
The Swingin' Love Corpses.

755
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,880
Man, I love that song.

756
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,580
And now this.

757
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,360
The Dobbstown Mirror.

758
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,200
Again.

759
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,740
What have we here

760
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,240
on the Dobbstown Mirror

761
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,640
coming up next?

762
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,540
There's nothing

763
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,420
so fiery

764
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,360
and self satisfying

765
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,800
as a new hatred.

766
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,800
And that's why

767
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,340
my advice is to forgive

768
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,660
those who do you wrong.

769
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,840
When they do you wrong again,

770
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,240
you'll have a brand new hate, better than

771
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,660
the old one. Holding a grudge

772
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,420
runs the danger of

773
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,140
letting a good, honest hatred

774
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,720
run cold,

775
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,240
get ragged.

776
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,260
Thank you,

777
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,500
Dobbstown Mirror.

778
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,840
By the way, most of the Dobbstown Mirror

779
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,960
is written by Uncle Dr.

780
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,080
Onan Kanabite.

781
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,920
Although he did have a

782
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,380
Katahdin Lagim article in here

783
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,300
this time. And there's a

784
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,900
Dr. Philo Drummond story.

785
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,860
Well, there's a whole bunch

786
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,720
of this preaching stuff.

787
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,200
Anyway, friends,

788
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,760
uh, uh, uh,

789
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,200
uh, uh,

790
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,040
and now this.

791
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,020
I was watching this

792
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,760
new, weird, good movie

793
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,260
called Vivarium.

794
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,300
And at the end was the

795
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,080
spazziest song I've heard in some time.

796
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,980
Turns out that it was

797
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,180
by XTC

798
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,940
from like 1979.

799
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,700
And I'd never heard it

800
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,360
before because

801
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,440
that's how hip I wasn't.

802
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,600
But now I get to hear it again.

803
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,160
It's just a complicated game.

804
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:23,580
Yeah.

805
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:24,260
Yeah.

806
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,040
It's just a complicated game.

807
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,660
Yeah.

808
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:31,900
Yeah.

809
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:32,520
Yeah.

810
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,140
Little girl

811
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:37,920
has been shooting

812
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,880
fire to hell

813
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,840
from the left.

814
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,240
Little girl

815
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,020
has been shooting fire to hell

816
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,040
from the right.

817
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,880
Uh, uh,

818
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,300
I said it really doesn't matter

819
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,320
what you're watching.

820
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,560
There's something else

821
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,980
that comes along with movies

822
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,800
and it's always been the same.

823
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,420
It's just a complicated game.

824
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,120


825
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:02,980
Yeah.

826
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,540
It's just a complicated game.

827
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,260
Yeah.

828
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,160
Yeah.

829
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,620
Yeah.

830
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,740
Little boy

831
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,600
has been shooting

832
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,040
fire to hell

833
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:19,580
from the left.

834
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,020
A little boy

835
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:24,920
has been shooting

836
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,780
fire to hell

837
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,780
from the right.

838
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,180
I said it really doesn't matter

839
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,120
what you're watching.

840
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,480
There's something else

841
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,940
that comes along with movies

842
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,780
and it's always been the same.

843
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,620
It's just a complicated game.

844
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:42,480
Yeah.

845
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:46,900
Yeah.

846
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,100
It's just a complicated game.

847
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:49,780
Yeah.

848
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,260
Yeah.

849
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,460
Uh, uh.

850
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,780
They wanted Charles.

851
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,060
They wanted Joe.

852
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,320
To jump from up above

853
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,300
and stick him out of that shuttle.

854
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,140
They were only arrows

855
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,200
in a very fair game.

856
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,660
It's just a complicated game.

857
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,820
It's just a complicated game.

858
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:15,620
It's just a complicated game.

859
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,120
It's just a complicated game.

860
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,800
It's just a complicated game.

861
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:42,840
It's just a complicated game.

862
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,420
They were only arrows

863
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,220
in a very fair game.

00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:44,220


866
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,080
in a very fair game.

867
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,080


868
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,040
They were only arrows

00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:47,100


873
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:54,280
God, if we should have thought us well, that's why we're right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.

874
00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:01,260
I say the thing that made us what you are, it's the complicated thing, and it's how we say.

875
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,940
It's just the complicated thing.

876
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

877
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,220
It's just the complicated thing.

Vas Aaron abuse the curse of how to menace, and align these woes.

895
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:45,980
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

896
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:51,640
It's just a complicated game by XTC,

897
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:56,820
and you are listening to the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

898
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:00,620
All information is at subgenius.com.

899
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:06,800
And this month, the important information is about X-Day, 24X Day.

900
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:12,180
X-Day, the week of July 2nd through 5th.

901
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,140
It'll be really different this year.

902
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,960
Number one, it won't just be a drill this time,

903
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,120
because we're going to save the universe this time.

904
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:30,040
Number two, the live in-person event is happening, but it's grown to two sites.

905
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:33,820
Our usual campground in Ohio called Wisteria,

906
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,780
but also a new one, new to us,

907
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,260
a resort campground in Florida.

908
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,860
And number three, it will also be streamed live,

909
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,420
which is how it happened last year, and it was great.

910
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:51,040
So this way, Yankees and others who treasure hanging out with old friends at Wisteria

911
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,780
and are too far from Florida can do so just like in the old days.

912
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,660
And those who want to try the Florida one, sign up quick,

913
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:01,880
because only 50 can attend, and I think 25 have already signed up.

914
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,640
And the Florida one is a little bit more expensive.

915
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:13,060
Those who will await the saucers at home can attend just like last year, virtually.

916
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,520
Up to 50 people were there last time, and it was really, really fun and crazy.

917
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,580
The Florida event will be live streamed separately,

918
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,100
and Wisteria might be streamed if they improve the Wi-Fi.

919
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,580
Here's how you find out the details of all this stuff.

920
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,980
Go to subgenius.com.

921
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,780
Click on it.

922
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,560
On events, if you're interested.

923
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,840
And there'll be an X-Day listing.

924
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,820
Or if you just scroll on down the homepage of subgenius.com,

925
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,000
you'll come to an X-Day link.

926
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:54,000
Basically, they go to hypercubego.com slash X-Day 2021.

927
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,900
And it'll tell you about the other one.

928
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,620
It'll tell you about the Wisteria one.

929
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,800
I'm going to go to the Florida one only.

930
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,700
And there'll be a...

931
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,680
A whole bunch of wild bands, some of which we've heard, some of which we haven't,

932
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:18,540
including TTN, Rubik's Cube, Sub-G Kids, and Peas.

933
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,340
Anyway, friends, so check it out.

934
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:26,100
There's also an X-Day Facebook page, and there's links to that on there.

935
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:30,240
Nobody has stepped up to organize the Wisteria gathering,

936
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,720
because this is the first time we've mentioned it.

937
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,760
But I'm not going to be there to set everything up.

938
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,580
And, yeah.

939
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:46,420
Yep, friends, subgenius.com, and you will then know everything.

940
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,840
Praise Bob.

941
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:54,060
And here's one reason why you should praise Bob.

942
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,820
This is a little document.

943
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:04,860
It's kind of a flyer from Reverend Zeno Fact and the Church of the Unanswered Question.

944
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,780
It's got some...

945
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,240
Nice clip art on it that wasn't swiped from us.

946
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,240
And it's basically the conspiracy versus Bob.

947
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,680
The conspiracy wants you to hate yourself.

948
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,760
Whereas Bob wants you to hate the conspiracy.

949
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,340
The conspiracy wants to take your money.

950
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:30,480
Bob just wants you to give him your money.

951
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,160
Totally different.

952
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,080
The conspiracy wants to take your slack.

953
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,720
Bob wants you to have slack.

954
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,940
The conspiracy wants you to hate sex.

955
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,960
Whereas Bob wants to have sex with you.

956
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,340
The conspiracy tells you what to think.

957
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,180
And Bob wants you to think for yourself.

958
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:54,820
The conspiracy believes in nothing, but Bob believes in everything.

959
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,820
The conspiracy wants you to trust no one.

960
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,620
Bob just wants you to trust him.

961
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,060
The conspiracy controls your time.

962
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,040
Bob teaches you to control time.

963
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,520
I keep wanting to say that differently.

964
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,820
Bob teaches you time control.

965
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:19,360
The conspiracy controls your time.

966
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,360
The conspiracy will kill you.

967
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,040
Bob will be killed by you.

968
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,940
If you're being a good subgenius.

969
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:33,060
And, um, friends, what are you people waiting for?

970
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,040
Did you know that for long, you can't control time?

971
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:35,040


972
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,900
Less than 10 cents a day for a year.

973
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,140
That's less than one thin dime every day for one year.

974
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:46,360
You too can have eternal salvation or triple your money back.

975
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,100
Nothing else to buy.

976
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,800
No need for periodic renewals.

977
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,660
You are saved forever.

978
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,520
Yes, for a one-time donation of a measly...

979
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:57,360
Bob?

980
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,380
Could change any minute.

981
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,580
At subgenius.com, you will be saved.

982
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,920
Even better.

983
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:09,620
There's no need to repent any sins or transgressions.

984
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,920
As a member of the Church of the Subgenius,

985
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:17,440
you'll be issued your very own official, divine, all-inclusive excuse.

986
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:20,560
And, friends, it's a big document.

987
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,720
Fancy-looking.

988
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,680
I mean, it's poster-sized.

989
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,360
So why wait?

990
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:31,080
Hurry to subgenius.com and save yourself today.

991
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:36,620
I think that ad copy may have come from Reverend Zena Fact also.

992
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,100
So, praise Bob.

993
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:47,240
And let there be slack.

994
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:52,000
And thank you, Empire Jazz Orchestra in the background.

995
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,540
And all the viewers, you've been listening to the

996
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:04,540


997
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:04,560
And don't forget to subscribe to the channel.

998
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:04,780
And I'll see you next time.

999
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,580
Bye-bye.

1000
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:05,760
.

1001
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:05,760


1002
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:05,760


1003
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:05,760


1004
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:05,760


1005
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:05,760


1006
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:05,760


1007
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:05,760


1008
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:05,760


1009
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:05,880
.

1010
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:06,260
.

1011
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:06,280
.

1012
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:06,340
.

1013
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:06,680
.

1014
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:06,680


1015
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:06,680


1016
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:06,680


1017
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:06,680


1018
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:06,680


1019
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:06,680
