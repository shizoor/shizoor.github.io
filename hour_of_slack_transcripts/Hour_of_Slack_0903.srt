1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,280
Hail Atlantis. Hail Atlantis.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,120
Ahhhh!

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:24,880
Welcome to the subgenius radio hour of slap.

4
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,940
Send 698 for the album. Only 998.

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,880
The UFO exhibiting anti-gravity capabilities follows the airliner right down to the surface of the earth to its landing.

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,880
The UFO is a bell-shaped type, which has been seen and photographed all over the world.

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,700
Angels flash through the heavenlies.

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,700
You know Ezekiel.

9
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,560
Saw a wheel.

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,520
But what a lot of us do not realize is that in chapter 1 of Ezekiel, verse 4,

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,980
the angels traveled in whirlwind fashion.

12
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,540
Not like our jets straight ahead. Whirlwind!

13
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,840
They move from one end of heaven to the other like the flash of lightning, verse 14.

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,500
And verse 15 says their color was burl.

15
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,520
Do you know what they put into spaceships now that are heaved out there?

16
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,520
The only thing that can withstand the heat.

17
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,860
Other things would disintegrate.

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,160
Burl Ilium.

19
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,440
It's like some kind of vision I've never seen before.

20
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,660
It was like a wagon wheel coming out of the sky.

21
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,520
And I was sitting on the porch with Aunt May.

22
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,320
She said, what is it, boy? What is it?

23
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,780
And I said, I don't know, ma'am. I swear to God I don't know.

24
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,520
But she said, praise Bob.

25
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,220
And you know, if Bob says something,

26
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,680
it's wall climbing.

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,160
What is it?

28
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,520
Wall climbing.

29
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,720
It's wall climbing.

30
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,760
Well, I was wall climbing. I was wall climbing.

31
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,840
And that's what Bob said to do.

32
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,700
That's what Bob told me to.

33
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,160
I was wall climbing.

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:23,140
And, uh, and, uh, I get real scared.

35
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,960
I'm scared, Bob.

36
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,920
Because, uh, I've seen them.

37
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,300
I've seen them before.

38
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,960
But there's more of them now.

39
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,900
And, uh, because there's lots more.

40
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,540
They're floating in the air.

41
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,300
And they're living in the wood and the rocks and everything.

42
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,640
And they're always kind of...

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,440
laughing and, and, and, uh,

44
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,600
fucking and killing and laughing and all the time.

45
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,720
Duncan Lunan of the British Interplanetary Society

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,440
has interpreted the signals as a message from a space probe.

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,140
A message from a dying planet in Epsilon Bootes.

48
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,340
When did you see your last flying saucer?

49
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,120
The last thing I seen was here Sunday week.

50
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,360
It was out in the wheat field.

51
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,360
In the wheat field.

52
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,420
Isn't that a little unusual?

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,480
No, I'm...

54
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,440
I think they must feed off weeds or something.

55
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,860
Yeah, the little green men's day was real head-catch.

56
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,680
Rockin' and a-rollin' through the crazy flats.

57
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,480
Brought out the sax and they started to flow.

58
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,380
Brought out the drums and they started to roll.

59
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,140
Flying saucer, rock and roll.

60
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,960
Flying saucer, rock and roll.

61
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,580
I couldn't understand it.

62
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,340
A thing dead said it was a lie.

63
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,580
It was a crazy beat it just to stop me dead.

64
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,180
Jump!

65
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,840
Ah, yes dear friends.

66
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,760
From Media Barrage number two.

67
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,920
The ancient one about UFOs.

68
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,080
And we heard from...

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,700
Well, actually it was 1981, I think.

70
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,840
Janer Hypercles and the late Reverend David Boone.

71
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,360
And Jonathan Winters.

72
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,360
And despite having those ancient crumbling recordings,

73
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,050
I barely remember.

74
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,470
Oh yeah, no, I forgot.

75
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,930
This is the part that you can remember.

76
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,190
Okay, you know what show it is now?

77
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,350
Yeah, oh, this is the...

78
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,190
I'm just getting nervous.

79
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,650
I'm watching this little car drive around like a cup of coffee.

80
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,190
The Little Puzzling Evidence Show on the little KPFA here in Berkeley.

81
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,170
Play all of it, huh?

82
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,610
You've got it wrong.

83
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,190
You've got it wrong.

84
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:47,450
I'm not going to play it.

85
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,130
You've got it wrong.

86
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,710
I'm not going to play it.

87
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,710


88
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,710


89
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,710


90
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,710


91
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,230
We can't play it on the new radio.

92
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,090
We can't play anything.

93
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,690
That's why, you know, that's why on all kinds of radio stations,

94
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,950
you only hear about eight bars of something.

95
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,490
Because then you don't have to pay the royalties and do the paperwork.

96
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,350
So no more whole songs.

97
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,010
No more whole songs for us.

98
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,490
Unless, of course, they're original material.

99
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,010
Thank you.

100
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,930
The copyright owners are us.

101
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,830
But it is good to be back here in California.

102
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:18,730
Yes.

103
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,870
After walking...

104
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,830
Horrorwood, Carlisle, Hornwood.

105
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,670
After schlepping it over to X Day on my bare feet.

106
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,570
Oh, X Day.

107
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,050
Yeah.

108
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,570
I want to hear about X Day.

109
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,710
And the audience goes wild.

110
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,510
Yeah, X Day.

111
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,410
They love it because they're thinking of XXX Day.

112
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,650
So how was it to see Guy Duhl and Ivan Stang and Queen of UFOs and Nikki Death Chick?

113
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,430
And who else would have been there?

114
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,010
They were great.

115
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:39,870
It was excellent.

116
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,910
One day we were...

117
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,270
We had good weather.

118
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,190
Except for one day we had this wonderful thunderstorm that rolled through during the night.

119
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,030
Man, I miss those.

120
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,610
And like rain like crazy.

121
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:49,850
Yeah.

122
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,810
And Guy and I drove around in the...

123
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,070
And you sleep in a van down by the river?

124
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,070
No, I didn't sleep in the van.

125
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,070
I slept in the trailer.

126
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:02,050
The van was like next to the fire and next to lots of people and would have been a miserable

127
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,030
place to stay.

128
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,550
And so I moved up on the hill to the hierarchy trailer.

129
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,890
Just like the old Docs Dogs.

130
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,510
And when I was in the hierarchy trailer, no one bothered me.

131
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,290
I set up my coffee making stand and my little brewing post.

132
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,790
So I had coffee every morning.

133
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:19,850


134
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:19,850


135
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:19,850


136
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:19,850


137
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:19,850


138
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:19,850


139
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:19,850


140
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:19,850


141
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,010
I had coffee every morning and afternoon there.

142
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,570
And good, strong California coffee.

143
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,050
Not that wimpy-ass Eastern coffee.

144
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,610
And then of course, let's see.

145
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,690
But overall it was good.

146
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,190
It was great.

147
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,370
We had a great time.

148
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,290
We had the amino acids played one night.

149
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,330
Those amino acids.

150
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,610
Yeah, they are amazing.

151
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,110
The ESO played another night.

152
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,550
And I got a chance to jam with ESO for two days.

153
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,610
Two different nights.

154
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,770
And that was great.

155
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,610
I mean, we really, we wailed.

156
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,350
We rocked.

157
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,490
We rocked!

158
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,170
We didn't suck!

159
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,750
Sure, sure.

160
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,630
Of course.

161
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,910
We tried to suck, but we just couldn't.

162
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,550
Yeah, you rocked.

163
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,310
We sucked at sucking!

164
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,050
No, no.

165
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,210
You didn't suck.

166
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,630
You rocked.

167
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,590
Well, that could be true.

168
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,050
Yes, I did you.

169
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,930
I think we did.

170
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,110
You got to.

171
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,590
Yeah, we did.

172
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:41,870
I think we did.

173
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,650
You got to.

174
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:45,650


175
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:45,650


176
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:45,650


177
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:45,950
Oh, yeah.

178
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,010
I think we did.

179
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,270
You got to.

180
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,270


181
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,270


182
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,270


183
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,270


184
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,270


185
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,270


186
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,270


187
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,270


188
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,270


189
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,170
All right, people.

190
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:48,170


191
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:48,170


192
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:48,230
Our journey is here.

193
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,230


194
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,390
Oh, no!

195
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:49,530


196
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:49,530


197
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:49,530


198
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:49,530


199
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,030
I'm gonna get on this train

200
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:10,090
I'm gonna get on this train

201
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,930
I'm gonna get on this train

202
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,110
I'm gonna get on this train

203
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:35,410
We grew our mullets out while we were there.

204
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,470
Mullet, bearing, load sharing.

205
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,670
One night, Guy and I drove.

206
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:46,770
We did the drumming routine where we drive around the compound in our narc-looking vehicle.

207
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,350
Yay!

208
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,530
Scaring the various pinks that happen to be there and the bobbies that all shy away from it.

209
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,070
And of course it was pouring down rain.

210
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,230
And I'm not kidding you, it was like, it never rains that hard here.

211
00:08:59,490 --> 00:08:59,970
No.

212
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:06,350
It was raining in giant cascades where one foot was raining like a bucket per second.

213
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,610
Much like where you used to live.

214
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,430
Yeah, a lot like where I used to live.

215
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:09,750
Yeah.

216
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,830
Yeah.

217
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,070
Yeah.

218
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,070


219
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,410
Big thunderheads rolling over with lots of thunder and lightning.

220
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,330
Thunderheads.

221
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,370
Big cracking.

222
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:16,370
Yeah.

223
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:24,270
And so, yeah, Guy and I drove out in the middle of the compound road while it was raining like that.

224
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:30,330
And did various ritualistic activities in the rain.

225
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,990
That was actually a compound city.

226
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,030
Along with some young Bobby Eames.

227
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,870
Bobby Eames.

228
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,990
He was involved in those cult activities.

229
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:44,950
That we took with us and performed ritualistic activities up on.

230
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,490
Stay away.

231
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,690
Get your hands off me.

232
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,830
He's right over there, officer.

233
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,630
They rock!

234
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,950
Do your duty.

235
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,170
While we're on the air.

236
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,930
And incidentally, we think you guys.

237
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,710
After we get out.

238
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,210
Rock!

239
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,690
They may not rock as much.

240
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,170
How many days were you out there?

241
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,990
I mean, what happened to the end of the world?

242
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,410
Well, we got down to the end of the world.

243
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,970
I mean, first of all, it's, you know, six.

244
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:10,570
Six X day.

245
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:18,510
So it's the sixth year after the time when we thought the world was supposed to end the first time.

246
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,670
So now there's a whole.

247
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:29,350
All the new kids, the people that are getting into it now, each have their own theory on why the X's haven't landed yet.

248
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:36,190
So it's sort of like all these theories are jockeying for position as to the predominant theory.

249
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,530
That's as it should be.

250
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,850
And, of course, I ascribe to.

251
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:47,550
The next 100 years theory, which we have expounded upon on this very show ad infinitum.

252
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,530
Yes.

253
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:49,750
I don't know if this show.

254
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,170
Ad nauseam.

255
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,590
Hash out that abstruse subgenius.

256
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:53,950
Right.

257
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,090
And so.

258
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,970
I always said that in reference to the.

259
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,790
That strange cult.

260
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,870
Extrusion of logic in reality.

261
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,390
And so what was your question now?

262
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:09,850
Oh.

263
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:24,970
Well, Dr. Drummond, is it true that Dr. Howell, your comrade there at the show, is going to join me, Reverend Ivan Stang, at the Indy Bible on September 20th in Indianapolis for a huge subgenius freak out?

264
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,510
Can I get that info at subgenius.com?

265
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,370
What other news is there?

266
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,890
This is PR News.

267
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,150
I'm creating unintended problems.

268
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,470
For PR News.

269
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:40,990
I'm completely contained.

270
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,870
From Los Angeles, PR's 600 Kmart stores report.

271
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:51,910
From Eugene, Morgan Smith continues to battle two major campgrounds and several homes over the weekend.

272
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:57,230
PR radios at PR.org.

273
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,650
PR's Ricard resigned after a plagiarism scandal.

274
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,610
Yeah.

275
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,990
For PR News, I'm expected to return late in the week.

276
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,150
PR's Madeline Brand.

277
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:09,910
Blame for the.

278
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,870
Continuing attacks on the dance floor.

279
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,970
This is PR News.

280
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,790
I'm selected by the U.S.-led Occupation Authority to help baby abandonments.

281
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,050
No questions asked.

282
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,190
This is coming up on 930 at 10 o'clock this morning.

283
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,330
This is PR.

284
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,750
PR brought to you by Fernanda Namby.

285
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,450
Lemur.

286
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:35,830
They, they spelled, they misspelled Namby in this publication.

287
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,390
I want them, I want them written up right now.

288
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,470
The poet tells its tragic story.

289
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,790
They spelled it Mamby.

290
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,390
Namby Pamby.

291
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,090
Namby.

292
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:44,670
Sat on a fence.

293
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:49,390
This is what we're stuck at here at 412 in the morning at Subgenius International Airport.

294
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,190
X-Day's turned into such a big thing.

295
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,630
They had to build an airport just to handle all the people that come to X-Day now.

296
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,530
Here they get their Subgenius Church air.

297
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,990
And then they march off to the area where the end of the world will happen.

298
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,430
And Philodramon is down there.

299
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,490
We can see him on the floor.

300
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,470
Philo, what?

301
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,890
How?

302
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:08,970
How?

303
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:09,950
What?

304
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,290
How?

305
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,030
Goodbye belly fat.

306
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,290
How about it?

307
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:13,610
How about it?

308
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,550
Can we add icons?

309
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,450
Oh, yes.

310
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,150
Um, here.

311
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:25,850
In another edition of the ancient Subgenius traditions, we can, uh, we can now add treasured

312
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,370
and hated symbols of our lives to this fire.

313
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:35,150
Janina Grinder here has apparently a Virgin Mary, which she is.

314
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,530
My mom.

315
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,090
Thanks.

316
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:36,890
That's nice.

317
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:37,770
.

318
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,070
.

319
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:46,290
Some people have thrown in their drivers licenses, their work records, their time punch outs,

320
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,770
their parent's divorce papers.

321
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,450
.

322
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:49,450


323
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:49,450


324
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,690
And one especially .

325
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,610
Yes.

326
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,970
Example.

327
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,410
If I could throw my self esteem in the fire I sure would, but, uh.

328
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,090
I have Bob's rally monkey.

329
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,330
Bob did not rally.

330
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,250
Bob did not save us.

331
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,730
Bob's rally monkey.

332
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,750
Fat fucking monkey.

333
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,750

methamphetamine symposium

370
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,330
we're gonna take the ashes to the wasp

371
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:38,330


372
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:38,330


373
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:38,330


374
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:38,930
collaborative gas pump

375
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,650
added oxygen

376
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,090
at a gas email

377
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,250
we going to do it

378
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,270
it's it's range

379
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,110
鹽

380
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,890
anarchy camp

381
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,990
crazy

382
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,310
just like X Day

383
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,310


384
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,310


385
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,310


386
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,310


387
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,330
Anarchy Camp by the band NoFX.

388
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:18,330
And now, back to KPFA Berkeley, the puzzling evidence show where Philo is reporting on 6X Day,

389
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,370
although Dr. Howell had decided not to attend.

390
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,810
I know I've made some very bad decisions.

391
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,870
And I had people feeding me each day with gourmet food.

392
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,470
Yeah.

393
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:34,230
Just because I found out later is because I was a hierarchite.

394
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:34,890
Yep.

395
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,930
And they could have me like a figurehead in their camp.

396
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,170
And when I was sitting there, it attracted the bobbies up.

397
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,010
Now, did the camps have names to the camps?

398
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,090
People do stuff like the Tranquility Band.

399
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,070
Yeah, they had different names.

400
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,890
You know, they didn't.

401
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:59,170
There was one of the new subgenius bases that had a lot of the new subgenius guys from alt.slack and alt.binaries.slack.

402
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,610
Some of those new subgeniuses are a little off base.

403
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,870
Internet subgenii I had met in a compound called Poundbase.

404
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,810
Pound subgenius.

405
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,250
And that's just what I'd like to do.

406
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,690
And you can see it off in the distance.

407
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,230
It had these big flags and giant bob heads.

408
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,950
I went in there, and they were all computer geeks.

409
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,730
So you have to log into their camp.

410
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,890
When you walk up, you had to sign a big board, this rotating board.

411
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:25,250
They had this arcane mechanical device.

412
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,190
And you couldn't walk in unless you logged in, you know.

413
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:28,830
Board?

414
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,290
Never.

415
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,390
I was entertained.

416
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,430
It was kind of cool.

417
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,810
And then Doc Frop had his.

418
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:34,870


419
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,850
I don't know what other than we just always called it Frop's place.

420
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,130
If only I could leave the compound.

421
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:44,790
And then, let's see, there was Tranquility Base is really cool.

422
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,070
They have the Bonobo Bar and the Tiki Banzai Grill.

423
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,050
Bonobos?

424
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,390
I say, aren't those pick-me chimps?

425
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,210
They're all pretty cool.

426
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:20,810
We had a bomb.

427
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,230
They had a bomb, but we all made fun of them.

428
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:27,410
The Karl huge hen

429
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:29,970
Racoon

430
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:30,010
He had a huge hat and then he said,

431
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,210
if you want to be happy when you're happy then you can be happy when your mom is happy.

432
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:31,210


433
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,910
It's just one camera?

434
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:33,990


435
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,430
Who was jamming? Who was the jammies?

436
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,730
I jammed with ESO and Princess Wee.

437
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,170
Thank you.

438
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,290
Jammed with us.

439
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:46,810
We had, you know, Chaz was there and Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

440
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,610
He's a great American.

441
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,350
I know, I'd like to be on their show someday.

442
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,630
We should all go be on their show.

443
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,470
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is what makes this country great.

444
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,230
I was thinking, did you go?

445
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,210
I wasn't on the show, though.

446
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,270
Oh, you should have gone to be on show.

447
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,370
That would have been fun, but they were all getting ready for X Day.

448
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,950
I don't know that they even had time for the show.

449
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,090
That's pathetic.

450
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:06,650
How can that be?

451
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,610
Yeah, no lie.

452
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:11,290
Because the show is like just a tiny snatch of X Day.

453
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:11,910
I don't understand.

454
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,050
When you saw, I mean, you saw how elaborate Chaz's camp was.

455
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,530
He has this cool crate that he's built down there in the middle of T-Base Camp.

456
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,490
It's under the trees back in the woods.

457
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,210
And he's got his, like, he could live back in there.

458
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,410
It's got a little mini kitchen.

459
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,490
His computer's in there, all his history.

460
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,270
Yeah, and he's setting.

461
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:37,790
His whole history of CDs is his, you know, he's got a place to sleep.

462
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:38,510
CDs?

463
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,910
It's really nice and cozy back in there.

464
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,610
I guess I saw those.

465
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,190
Plus, he has all these young chicks that hang around.

466
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,390
Calking and balking and going, balk, balk, balk.

467
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,070
He sails in on his own yacht.

468
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,850
He sails in on his van.

469
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:55,550
Yeah.

470
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,970
He's got a van, you know.

471
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,350
What's the name of his book?

472
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,130
I can't remember.

473
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:02,590
I can't remember.

474
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,790
He's a history of rock and roll.

475
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,130
Yeah.

476
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,810
I'd like to get that.

477
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,370
I have a good...

478
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,990
He's a real musicologist kind of guy.

479
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,450
Yeah, that's fine.

480
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,710
But Tranquility Base plays mostly...

481
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,390
I wonder if he listens to this show.

482
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,130
See, I think it's important that he listens to this show.

483
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,350
Okay, I need a little more church air here.

484
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,270
I don't know if he listens to this show or not.

485
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,050
Look, there's a caller.

486
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:27,410
Oh.

487
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,650
Thanks for waiting and go right ahead.

488
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,710
Yeah, I'm calling from Glen Rose.

489
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,350
I talked to these two a couple of months ago.

490
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,430
About some cattle mutilation.

491
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,070
Yeah, you were the farmer, right?

492
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:36,570
Right.

493
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:37,990
Raised cattle.

494
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:38,810
Yeah.

495
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,490
I told you all about the mutilation.

496
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,970
You all said it'd be a good idea if I sent some money in.

497
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,810
Might give me an edge.

498
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,750
Right, right.

499
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,290
Friends, I must interrupt here.

500
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,510
My own wife didn't recognize these voices,

501
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:59,290
so I should explain that what follows is like the third radio appearance ever

502
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,210
in 1980 of yours truly.

503
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,790
Reverend Ivan Stang and my partner, Dr. Philo Drummond,

504
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,770
on George Nolan's show on KFJZ in Fort Worth.

505
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,910
The guy calling in is my brother.

506
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,650
Well, we've had another one down here.

507
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:18,590
Is that right?

508
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,390
Cattle mutilation.

509
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,850
How much money did you send in?

510
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,910
Well, that's the problem.

511
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,150
I never got around to sending some money in.

512
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,170
Well, that's why.

513
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,150
Well, we can't.

514
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,410
We don't have that much to do with cattle mutilation,

515
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,190
but we can.

516
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,270
We can help put you on the alert to who might be doing it.

517
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,230
And how to watch out for them.

518
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:42,090
Yeah, that whole situation with the cattle mutilations is pretty spooky.

519
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,330
Not very many people know about it.

520
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,350
And we've found that lately an even scarier aspect,

521
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:52,010
a UFO-related goldfish mutilation.

522
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,310
Goldfish mutilation.

523
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,470
Right in your own home.

524
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,750
You're going to see a lot more of that.

525
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,150
It's like you'll wake up in the morning

526
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,850
and people will find that their goldfishes have been mutilated

527
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:01,470
and know.

528
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,210
No explainable reason for whatsoever.

529
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,230
No breaking.

530
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,030
Surgically.

531
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:06,850
Surgically.

532
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,210
Yeah, certain organs surgically removed.

533
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,510
It's just scary as can be.

534
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,170
We've seen that in some of these animals down here.

535
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:14,810
Uh-huh.

536
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,590
Is there any way to find out who's doing it?

537
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,630
Well, there's a lot of theories on that.

538
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,150
One theory says that it's the conspiracy doing it

539
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:29,790
and making it look like UFOs to discredit law enforcement agencies.

540
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,290
Another theory.

541
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,310
Says that it is UFOs and they're using cattle eyeballs for rocket fuel.

542
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:43,290
Um, and another theory is that it's some crazed teenage zombies out there

543
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,390
that are going wild.

544
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,770
Some weird religious cult doing it for who knows what reason.

545
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,750
Boy, there are weird cults around, aren't there?

546
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,150
There are.

547
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:57,010
Most of the cults, I might add, some of them are us, but most of them are them.

548
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,490
And most of the ones that are us don't know they're us.

549
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:00,890
Yeah.

550
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:00,970
Yeah.

551
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:01,710
Well, now, wait a minute.

552
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,410
You've got to straighten out.

553
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,390
The us are the good guys.

554
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,410
The them are the bad guys.

555
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:05,650
That's right.

556
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,750
There are a lot of latent subgeniuses.

557
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,510
But by the same token, there are a lot of conspiracy members out there

558
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,390
who don't know they're working for the conspiracy.

559
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,170
A lot of latent homo sapiens, too, you know.

560
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:15,530
That's right.

561
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,810
Or homo correctus is what the subgeniuses descended from.

562
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,850
Well, I wanted to know if there's...

563
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,570
Should I try to find out who's doing it or catch anybody doing it?

564
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,690
Well, send us some money to begin with,

565
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,230
and we can fill you in on a whole lot more.

566
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:39,350
That box number you can send it to is Box 140306, Dallas 75214.

567
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,250
I might add, that is a real post office box.

568
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,470
I have seen it, touched it, opened it, and it actually exists.

569
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,070
We're not kidding about that.

570
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,710
And we will send you material that will help explain not only cattle mutilations,

571
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:58,490
but hundreds of other true mysteries in this modern space age agogo world.

572
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,670
And I can also verify...

573
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,170
I can also verify that these guys, not only is that a real post office box number,

574
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,690
these guys are real actual solicitators, solicitation...

575
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,370
They are asking for money, really.

576
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,210
I'll send some money in this time. Maybe it'll help.

577
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:15,810
In the meantime, you can sit out on your ranch in the dark

578
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,190
and just watch for bright lights in the sky.

579
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,190
And different kinds of things.

580
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,570
Well, the different kind of things, what I'm worried about finding.

581
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,870
Don't worry about taking a gun with you. It won't do any good.

582
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,550
Well, that's...

583
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,110
That's a hell.

584
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,990
Yeah, bullets cannot stop them.

585
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,710
Come, my creatures. I summon all of you to attend.

586
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:43,610
On March 22nd, hundreds of people witnessed a pair of flying objects.

587
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,530
For the next nine days, UFOs rose out of the sea,

588
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,950
hung in the air, remained motionless,

589
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:54,110
and in various manners, reported over the metropolitan city...

590
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,350
I've opened the surface of the earth. It's time to attack.

591
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:57,650
No!

592
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:58,710
No!

593
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,030
No!

594
00:26:59,130 --> 00:26:59,650
No!

595
00:26:59,670 --> 00:26:59,670


596
00:26:59,670 --> 00:26:59,670


597
00:26:59,670 --> 00:26:59,670


598
00:26:59,670 --> 00:26:59,670


599
00:26:59,670 --> 00:26:59,670


600
00:26:59,670 --> 00:26:59,670


601
00:26:59,670 --> 00:26:59,670


602
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,110
Why are you there, and whether you really had your tongue in your cheek or not?

603
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,550
Especially the farmer who had...

604
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,230
See, he had a special calculation, yeah, on his land.

605
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,950
And his neighbor thought it was strange, too.

606
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,790
Are not the angels ministering spirits?

607
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:19,010
And so if the ministering spirits shall be the air of salvation...

608
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,970
Only earth with its single moon

609
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,050
can have exactly total solar eclipses.

610
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,230
Because...

611
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:33,570
too remarkable an occurrence to be due entirely to chance.

612
00:27:50,850 --> 00:28:00,190
Good. Nothing can stop us now.

613
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,910
It'll only take a few hours to attach this detonator.

614
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,790
Then we can all take off for Mars.

615
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,170
Are you sure the rocket can carry all of us and your men from the island, too?

616
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,270
Oh, yes. Now get Dr. Harding.

617
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,810
He's going to help me make the final adjustments on the bomb.

618
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:13,350
Okay.

619
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,010
I know what's going on now.

620
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,550
I'm totally aware of everything.

621
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:19,970
You've got the robot in the car.

622
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,690
We've got the control panel here.

623
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,210
We'll take it along and let the robot do the fighting for us.

624
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,450
Then we'll have to wait before we find out what this is all about.

625
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,510
Not entirely.

626
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,430
The papers we found in Harding's laboratory explain why they're building the hydrogen bomb.

627
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,550
Its explosion was intended to...

628
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,470
deflect the rotation of the Earth enough to send it out of its orbit and spinning off into space.

629
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,110
Those zombies must have been as crazy as they looked.

630
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,170
It may sound ridiculous, but it's theoretically possible.

631
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,870
It's certainly lucky you managed to stop them in time.

632
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,430
Yeah, we're safe now, for the time being.

633
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:52,390
But there are undoubtedly more of those power-mad creatures loose on other planets.

634
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,150
So it'll take constant vigilance on our part to ensure the safety of this world.

635
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,250
If the people do not seek to offend you,

636
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,510
another and worse war will break out.

637
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,650
When you see a night with a strange light in the sky,

638
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:16,390
you will know it is a sign that the world is about to be punished for its crimes.

639
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,990
You irresponsible bitch!

640
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:23,070
Yes, baby! You irrepressible bitch!

641
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,090
Why did you take my fun-tang away from me?

642
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,370
You thought you were just one of those that were gonna ruin the world?

643
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,190
Give me back the fun-tang!

644
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,490
God don't get me!

645
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:33,550
I'm not a fucking human!

646
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:33,550


647
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:33,550


648
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:33,550


649
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:33,550


650
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:33,550


651
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:33,550


652
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:33,550


653
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,770
Give me back my fun-tang!

654
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,830
Give me back my fun-tang!

655
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,590
Give me back my fun-tang!

656
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,590
Oh, ayayayaya, oh.

657
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,410
Ah. Oh.

658
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,310
La la la la la!

659
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,850
Give me back my fun-tang!

660
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,770
Give me back my fun-tang!

661
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:17,690
I'm gonna make it all up to you

662
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:23,890
I'd like to give it all to you

663
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,430
Objects in motion, Earth, Venus, Mars

664
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,550
A place without gravity, I no longer see stars

665
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,630
Not far in the future, where did that galaxy go?

666
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,430
The fading of photographs, a dying light bulb

667
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:41,650
I'm gonna make it all up to you

668
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:47,910
I'd like to give it all to you

669
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,570
Across the horizon for an infinite time

670
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,410
Dying of loneliness without the sunshine

671
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,690
All together but away from each other

672
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,530
With darkness between us, with darkness between us

673
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:05,750
I'm gonna make it all up to you

674
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:11,830
I'd like to give it all to you

675
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:17,890
I'm gonna make it all up to you

676
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:23,810
I'd like to give it all to you

677
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:54,250
I'm gonna make it all up to you

678
00:31:54,250 --> 00:32:00,310
I'd like to give it all to you

679
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:06,390
I'm gonna make it all up to you

680
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:12,610
I'd like to give it all to you

681
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:16,150
Objects in motion, Earth, Venus, Mars

682
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,230
A place without gravity, I no longer see stars

683
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,290
Not far in the future, where did that galaxy go?

684
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,030
The fading of photographs, a dying light bulb

685
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,030
Across the horizon for an infinite time

686
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,510
Dying of loneliness without the sunshine

687
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:34,190
All together but away from each other

688
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,590
With darkness between us, with darkness between us

689
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:59,090
With darkness between us

690
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:04,430
Like letter C, letter D, truth.com

691
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:08,850
Wonderful band that we see every year at the Devotional

692
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:12,030
And before that we heard Give Me Back My Fun Thing

693
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,750
By the baby Philo Drummond

694
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,890
Singing with his old band, the Swingin' Love Corpses

695
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,850
This music in the background, by the way, is

696
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,710
Einstein's Secret Orchestra jamming at 6X Day

697
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,170
With Dr. Philo Drummond and Princess We Are Doe

698
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,550
As well as, I think, Dr. Lake King

699
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,170
Uh, ah, yes

700
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,010
And now

701
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,570
We stand here

702
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,210
At this anti-progressivist warehouse

703
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,310
Filled with so many of our comrades, com-comrades of ours

704
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:49,510
Kings of corn, we used to call them before the Bolshevik days

705
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,930
Back when the Tsarist police hunted us like

706
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,090
It's the Wellman-Howell Syndrome

707
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,990
Roman Howell?

708
00:33:59,330 --> 00:33:59,890
And

709
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,330
Romanoff

710
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,370
It's an outside joke

711
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:08,930
But, uh, physicists on three international teams have discovered the Pentaquark

712
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:13,390
But did they take their fresh fruit, organic vegetables?

713
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:19,210
So you can imagine what it's like to be stuck on this narrow-gauge railway with these subgenius

714
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:22,230
gods all day yakking about their me shows

715
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,910
Yeah, they're one-wheeled narrow-gauge railways

716
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,370
It's like a unicycle

717
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,450
Railroad

718
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:34,450
They didn't catch on very well

719
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,050
This bulletin is just in

720
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:40,990
No, it can't be read on the ticket

721
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:47,490
You can't read the bulletin that's just in because it is a violation of FCC law

722
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:52,350
And they do, it is law, folks, I'm not kidding you

723
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:58,350
We have to sign on to these new laws, these special laws, these high-purpose laws

724
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,350
And now here's Philo driving around next to him here

725
00:34:59,350 --> 00:34:59,930
He's a narc

726
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,410
He's a narc

727
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:00,650
He's a narc

728
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:00,970
He's a narc

729
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:01,130
He's a narc

730
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:01,130


731
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:01,770
He's a narc

732
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:01,770


733
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:01,770


734
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,410
And he's enforcing the laws of the subgenius church

735
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:12,330
If you were not observing the laws of the subgenius church during the X-Day observance, it was

736
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:16,930
quite often seen that apparently the old church would pull you over and search your mind

737
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:20,150
And say, I notice you have not offered me your phone number

738
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,390
And they'd search your mind

739
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,490
Now I must kill you

740
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,590
An invitation to visit you at your fine home

741
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:26,970
Search your soul

742
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,330
I'm frightened by your mind

743
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:29,330


744
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:36,770
shapely legs. Your flashing eyes, your floating hair. I am provoked by your weight, all-consuming

745
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:47,150
lust. No, for my lith, nubile flesh. And so here comes Stang with his security force. He's landing.

746
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:53,070
Up came Stang with his big boot on. Stang, you pervert stalker. He says to Doug Zane, what is your

747
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:57,630
So this is a fake Stang with the helicopter landing. And the real Stang is over there,

748
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:02,890
behind the fence on that grassy knoll with a set of binoculars, watching. And oh my, I see,

749
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:09,870
he's doing, he's watching with his one hand. Okay, so we're going to go back to X-Day now.

750
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:15,530
The amino acids, live at 6XX.

751
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,390
1,2,3.

752
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,290
Then base get ready to

753
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:45,450
I found the

754
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,190
But they light you a light은

755
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,610
It's done

756
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:47,610


757
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:47,610


758
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:47,610


759
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:47,610


760
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,450
And Sally find you feel like you would make

761
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:51,490
A blackooooo

762
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,190
Straw, poor and he backwards provides orange financially for a favor.

763
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,890
The Amino Acids

764
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,570
It's live at 6X Day, friends!

765
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,990
And they never stop.

766
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:30,950
And this is a good time for me to mention that at 6X Day,

767
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:35,610
one of the most joyous events is the Bull Dada Auction.

768
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:40,630
Yes, where the subgenius ministers auction off the weirdest crap they can locate.

769
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,110
Sometimes it's not just stuff.

770
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:48,490
Sometimes it is their own bodies or sex acts or glands or fluids.

771
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,710
Once G. Gordon Gordon auctioned off his septum.

772
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:57,350
Yes, his septum for a lap dance.

773
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,930
Anyway, friends, the Bull Dada Auction.

774
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:05,110
You know Bull Dada is the latest exploration of advanced surrealistic Dadaism

775
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,930
in which the mind is filled with dirt and glugs

776
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:13,110
which trickle like mutilated centipedes down the sides of the now empty cranium

777
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,950
to find shelter and rest inside the now sightless eye sockets.

778
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:22,270
This definition of Bull Dada was broached first by the great Shredney Chisholm

779
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:25,190
in I believe the year 1972.

780
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:32,330
Uh, since elaborated on to include everything kitschy, marvelous, insane

781
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:35,870
and somehow packed with meaning for the subgenius.

782
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:41,870
Although it might appear like this show to be absolute trash to those without discernment.

783
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:49,330
Those pathetic normworms and pig boys who crawl their way through their jobs and misperceptions

784
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,250
that they call life.

785
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:51,950
Praise Bob.

786
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:52,990
Sex.

787
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:53,630
Mortar.

788
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:54,990
What are you doing?

789
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,550
Oh, I have something else I need to auction off.

790
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,430
You know, every X day, some things instantly become relics.

791
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,350
And, um, we have a couple relics back at the camp.

792
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,070
That was three?

793
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,750
I'm probably going to get rid of them later on.

794
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,690
But anyway, a relic has been created.

795
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,350
Let me see the hands of all of those who know what teabagging is.

796
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,150
Eww.

797
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:20,510
Alright, you subgeniuses, you all know what teabagging is.

798
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,250
How many of you know who teabagging is?

799
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,270
Who Doc Fropp is?

800
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,290
Oh yeah.

801
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,290
Alright.

802
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,310
One human soul.

803
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:31,910
How many of you know what Chewy Chips Ahoy Chocolate Chip Cookies are?

804
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,150
Oh yeah.

805
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:40,070
Well, I'm here auctioning off chewy chocolate chip cookies that have been teabagged by Doc

806
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,590
Fropp.

807
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,390
Come on.

808
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:49,510
Right before the Bulldada auction began.

809
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,230
Oh my God.

810
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,250
I'm so sorry.

811
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:52,250


812
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:52,250


813
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:52,250


814
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:52,250


815
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:52,250


816
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:52,250


817
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:52,250


818
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,050
I'm in my business now.

819
00:39:54,050 --> 00:40:03,470
The going price for a brand new, unopened, sealed bag is $3.69.

820
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,310
They're mostly gone.

821
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,490
I was handing them out right before I came up.

822
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:09,510
Damn you!

823
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,490
Damn you all to hell!

824
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,010
I saved Princess Wade.

825
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,810
I would not allow her to eat a cookie.

826
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,650
But you, Stan.

827
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,590
Yes, you.

828
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,650
And the Lord.

829
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:30,490
The bidding starts at 50 cents for the last remaining teabag cookies.

830
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,690
Think of the fun you could have at your next campground gathering.

831
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,030
Two dollars!

832
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:36,310
Two dollars!

833
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,230
Damn.

834
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,250
Going once, going twice?

835
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:40,970
Three.

836
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,870
The text will never go away.

837
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,530
Sold for two dollars.

838
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,190
Alright.

839
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:48,770
Thank you.

840
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:49,770
Thank you.

841
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:49,930
Thank you.

842
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:50,430
Thank you.

843
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:50,630
Thank you.

844
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:50,630


845
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:50,630


846
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:50,630


847
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:50,630


848
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:50,630


849
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:50,650


850
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,210
Praise the Bob.

851
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,830
And you're listening to PR news.

852
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,110
But there comes a time we need to get things done.

853
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,670
The time has passed.

854
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,670
Yesterday was also Bob Day.

855
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,270
Bob Day.

856
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:07,810
PR news.

857
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,450
Bob Day.

858
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:09,590
Bob Day.

859
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,370
Bob Day.

860
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,370
Bob Day.

861
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:11,930
Bob Day.

862
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,710
Bob Day.

863
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,350
Bob Day.

864
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:13,430
Bob Day.

865
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:13,950
Bob Day.

866
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:14,270


867
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:15,510
Bob Day.

868
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,930
the Northwestern Pit Children Foundation, driven to suicide.

869
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:24,190
From PR News in Washington, I will not say where the bodies are being taken.

870
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:24,990
Ha ha.

871
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,070
And from...

872
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,250
This is PR Radio.

873
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,070
Seven provocative mental girls at noon.

874
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,430
From PR News in Washington, I'm in an ambush.

875
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,570
NPR's Brad Eglint reports.

876
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,570
Brad will not report in the coming days.

877
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:49,990
Philip Pan, Beijing correspondent for the Washington Post, has barricaded himself inside Beijing.

878
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:52,930
Oh yes, it's in the 46th day today.

879
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:54,250
Thanks.

880
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,330
Thank you.

881
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,230
PR News.

882
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:57,970
Washington.

883
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,030
The German ambassador to the United Nations.

884
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,890
Germany would welcome such an approach.

885
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,670
PR News.

886
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,210
Well, um...

887
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,150
There's much more news.

888
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,810
There is more news.

889
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,270
But it's...

890
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,230
It's so depressing now.

891
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:16,770
Dang, I...

892
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,370
I can't go the next day.

893
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,010
I don't have the money and I...

894
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,190
I don't have a job now and...

895
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:24,490
And it's a long way to go and I don't know anybody and I'm being...

896
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,450
What do you say to that, Philo?

897
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,770
What do you say to somebody that says they...

898
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,030
I don't think I can't go the next day.

899
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,630
You say there is...

900
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,630
I say, uh...

901
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:34,110
Sud, it's good you know your deficiencies now so we don't have to fool with you later.

902
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:38,610
I don't want to have to fight and trudge over your lifeless corpse on my way to the...

903
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,250
To the X-Day Saucers.

904
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,770
When I'm making my way towards the...

905
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,410
The bounciest beauty of...

906
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:49,210
Graceful arms and those beautiful sex goddesses that I will, uh...

907
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,430
Know that I don't have to worry about you...

908
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:56,390
Taking up space and breathing my precious air.

909
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:58,490
Pinhole.

910
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,990
That's what I say to those bobbies that tell me that.

911
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,550
I say there's five reasons to choose me.

912
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,570
I'm drop-dead gorgeous.

913
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,330
I will never rush you.

914
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,810
It's a mutual massage.

915
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,590
I'm sweet and kind.

916
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,830
Foil-wrapped cucumbers to my legs.

917
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:18,550
You guys got any more smoothies?

918
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,970
Well, also, um...

919
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,730
You should read all these wonderful books about military skills.

920
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:24,190
I'm taking a nap.

921
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,570
That's why I'm taking a nap.

922
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,590
You got the X-Day.

923
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,190
You got the X-Day.

924
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:30,950
You got to get out of here.

925
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:33,470
You're a little early, sir.

926
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,430
Y'all, y'all, yeah.

927
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,210
X-Day's like a year away now.

928
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,470
We're getting ready to go to...

929
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:37,970
X-Day is over.

930
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,070
That's crazy.

931
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:42,290
It's crazy to think you could go to...

932
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,390
Back in time.

933
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,510
We're going to go to the end of the world next year.

934
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:46,670
What kind of thinking is that?

935
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:47,710
What kind of thinking?

936
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,170
That's some stinking thinking.

937
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,910
You're going to have to get rid of that stinking thinking.

938
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:52,650
What's wrong with that show?

939
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:56,290
I want you to leave your mind behind.

940
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:00,570
And I want you to practice ancient Indian medicine

941
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,550
that offers time-tested solutions

942
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:07,750
for gastrointestinal, environmental, and emotional problems.

943
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:08,570
Okay, okay, okay.

944
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:10,310
Mass hysteria.

945
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:10,910
Mass hysteria.

946
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,830
Mass hysteria.

947
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,430
Mass hysteria.

948
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:16,050
There's no way to do that.

949
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,910
Well, I won't say that.

950
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:19,630
Yeah, okay, don't, because it's...

951
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,490
Well, don't think of this one.

952
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:23,190
There's a company called...

953
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:25,930
Mass hysteria.

954
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,670
That's us on the show.

955
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,250
You can thank your lucky stars...

956
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,430
You thank your lucky stars...

957
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:32,430
Mass hysteria.

958
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:35,210
...as you reconnect with our divinity.

959
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:38,070
All right, 60-cycle hum on the show.

960
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:38,750
No one will panic.

961
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,110
Did you bring any salty bags next?

962
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,090
That mommy will never reach the gates of Zion.

963
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,670
At the same time, man.

964
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,810
I don't have any bag full of crunchy items.

965
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:49,030
I don't want a stupid old Matrix.

966
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:52,130
How about some snacks, like potato chips?

967
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:56,510
Up until now, most of the focus on UFOs has been...

968
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,450
Not UFOs.

969
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,110
Is this real?

970
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:01,410
And if it is real, where is the evidence?

971
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:06,010
Only by exposing the full truth around the UFO question

972
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,630
can we get to the core reasons for the intense secrecy

973
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:12,930
surrounding this issue and the potential use of a highly...

974
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:12,970
I'm looking for fire.

975
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:13,370
Doesn't that...

976
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:16,790
...sophisticated technology for the betterment of our planet?

977
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:17,590
So you know, there's a techno...

978
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:18,890
...lubricated tunnel.

979
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:20,630
...rives it crazy at this hour of the morning.

980
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:26,550
But of course, people's funds for salty snacks

981
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:31,050
reflects a fundamental biological imperative.

982
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:36,050
All cells, in order to survive, have to have salt.

983
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,410
They've just got to have salt.

984
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:38,390
They've just got to have it.

985
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:39,530
Every cell in your body...

986
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,370
They're just licking it up.

987
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,310
They need a big old salt lick to go down there.

988
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:42,930
...your cells.

989
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:43,090
...for a jumbo-sized...

990
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,510
...one salt lick per cell.

991
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,530
...bag of KFC barbecue potatoes.

992
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:48,210
So how many times did you jam it next day?

993
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:49,610
...the V8.

994
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:51,210
What?

995
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:54,890
Did you say somebody was rocking out in there?

996
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,530
Oh, my God.

997
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,930
It's Carter LeBlanc.

998
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:06,010
It's Reverend Carter LeBlanc.

999
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:06,830
Ranting.

1000
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:07,310
What?

1001
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:07,850
What?

1002
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:07,970


1003
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:08,430
What?

1004
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:10,970
How dare he say...

1005
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:11,830
I can't...

1006
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:12,670
Oh.

1007
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:13,590
This...

1008
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,150
When Buddha sees me on the road,

1009
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:17,430
he tries to kill me.

1010
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:22,070
I abduct aliens,

1011
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,690
and I shove them up my ass!

1012
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,730
I can kick more ass than a five-legged girl.

1013
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:35,050
I floss my teeth with ten-dimensional hyperspirant.

1014
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:38,570
I blow my nose with the fabric of reality,

1015
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:42,310
and I lick my ass with the wool

1016
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,710
that other people pull over their own eyes.

1017
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:51,570
I may not take you like me for a doctor,

1018
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,590
but I'm a saint.

1019
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,290
Unbelievable, dear friends.

1020
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:58,210
Reverend Carter LeBlanc suddenly fired up,

1021
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,670
leaping on the stage with the Minoan brain-eaters

1022
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:03,410
jamming in the background like mad.

1023
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,430
It's insane.

1024
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:05,170
It's mad.

1025
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,170
It's 6X Day.

1026
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:06,790
It's bad!

1027
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:07,970
No!

1028
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:08,110


1029
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:09,210
No!

1030
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,830
No!

1031
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:10,350


1032
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:10,410


1033
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:10,610
No!

1034
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:10,790
No!

1035
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:10,990
No!

1036
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:11,030


1037
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:11,030


1038
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:11,070


1039
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:11,490
No!

1040
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:12,290
No!

1041
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:12,290


1042
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:12,290


1043
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:12,290


1044
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:12,290


1045
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:12,290


1046
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:17,250
Friends, you can't understand a word he's saying,

1047
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:18,450
but go, baby, go!

1048
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,990
It doesn't matter if it's a crime or a joke.

1049
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:24,830
It doesn't matter if it's industrial secrets.

1050
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,370
You're selling good shit.

1051
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:30,250
It's not hard to sell.

1052
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:41,590
Anybody, anybody who has studied any form of transcendental mysticism,

1053
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:42,290
know that you're a saint.

1054
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:43,950
and know

1055
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:47,950
that this reality is an illusion

1056
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:49,690
the things that surround us

1057
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:51,430
are nothing at all

1058
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:54,230
and that's a great deal for you

1059
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:56,210
that's a great deal for you

1060
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:56,450
right

1061
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:57,630
because

1062
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,950
if the world we live in

1063
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:04,010
if the world we live in is truly nothing

1064
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:06,310
then Bob Dobbs has a great deal

1065
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,890
for you he's got something

1066
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:10,250
for nothing and it's only going to

1067
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:11,670
cost you $30

1068
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:20,070
amazing dear friends the Minoan Brain Eaters

1069
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:22,490

and Reverend Carter LeBlanc

1071
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:26,930

I do want you to know

1077
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:55,590
not to do this

1078
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:55,590


1079
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:55,710

DAVID ROGERS

with VHALEHOSE these subtitles are absolutely brilliant

1082
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:19,050
like having a club at one of the clubs one of the camp clubs theme camps as opposed to the main

1083
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:25,030
stage there is a main stage at x day and the main stage is where the events take place like you know

1085
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:37,290
show oh yeah that played we're at the main stage i think i've seen that in the uh

1086
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:45,170
there was a kind of like an artsy band there that was playing casios and had a

1087
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:51,050
frizzling body hangs on the wires until it decays and falls away a fey like um

without any clothes on without feeling restricted or inhibited in any way

1096
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:49,210
other than without the nasty stairs of those traveling in subgeni that just gawk and gawk

1097
00:50:49,210 --> 00:51:05,530

1110
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:22,410
show here i think yeah we're starting to put our records away we're putting our tapes back in our

1111

1117
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:08,850
pouch i haven't felt anything with all the waste for years but uh

1118
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:18,950
thirsting after lusting after salt is of crucial importance and to keep themselves supplied with

1119
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:25,130
this critical liquid animals have developed ways for sensing sodium chloride and other

1120
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:31,150
salts then with their long tongues they they lick it and they slap it up they lick it

1121
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:35,310
so i guess all this licking occurs

1122
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:52,450
so what happened right at the end of the world what did you guys do the exes didn't come again and

1123
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:58,270
uh of course i never get up it's traditional that philo always sleeps over sleeps knowing

1124
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:05,490
that when that actually comes the sex goddesses will come to the cabin the the hierarchy of the

1128
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,990

Hey, so-so data.

1177
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:11,750
And now, friends of the Subgenius Emergency Medical Technician.

1178
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:14,070
Yes, at every X-Day we have a nurse.

1179
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:15,910
And this is her.

1180
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:19,050
Our official doctor, you might say.

1181
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:22,510
Real doctor, available for people who get hurt at X-Day.

1182
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:28,310
And my fellow Subgenius Foundation employee, Reverend Nikki Deathchair.

1183
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:30,750
I know what's going on now.

1184
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:33,230
I'm totally aware of everything.

1185
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,930
Don't worry, it'll heal.

1186
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:38,850
It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so funny.

1187
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:41,870
If it wasn't so funny that you were hurt.

1188
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:43,290
It wasn't so true.

1189
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:48,430
If only it wasn't so funny that you were hurt.

1190
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:51,510
You gotta laugh at your pain.

1191
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,830
The basis of humor is the discomfort of others.

1192
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:57,590
Punishing every thought.

1193
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,150
Oh my God.

1194
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,230
He's gonna have a cardiac arrest.

1195
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:03,250


1196
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:06,250
The M.T. will have to do it.

1197
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:07,230
He'll do it.

1198
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,070
Sherman Volunteer Fire Department.

1199
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:10,950
He's laughing.

1200
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:14,570
It's not the honest thing, the laughing is killing me.

1201
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:16,630
Let's go run around and say goodbye to everybody.

1202
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:17,350
She's dying.

1203
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,330
She's dying from laughter.

1204
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:20,690
Okay, okay.

1205
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:21,430
We gotta go.

1206
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:22,350
We'll take your name with us, Nikki.

1207
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:23,510
Where am I going?

1208
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:24,910
We gotta say goodbye to everybody else.

1209
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:25,410
Okay.

1210
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,030
It was fucked up.

1211
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:28,850
What are we doing?

1212
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:31,430
It's so tragic.

1213
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:33,070
I'm gonna miss you guys so much.

1214
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:33,190
I'm gonna miss you guys so much.

1215
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:33,190


1216
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:33,190


1217
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:33,190


1218
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:33,190


1219
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:35,210
What the fuck is going on?

1220
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:36,490
Let's party.

1221
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:37,310
Let's like go.

1222
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,490
We've got five minutes left.

1223
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:42,610
The Sudden News Foundation Company is a family.

1224
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:43,410
Oh yes, it is.

1225
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:45,230
It's the entire corporation.

1226
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:48,230
He's so violent.

1227
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:48,990
So violent.

1228
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,650
Bob, you're alive.

1229
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,170
Oh my God.

1230
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:56,070
It's all Stane's fault and I've had enough.

1231
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:01,570

1232

1251
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:05,570
You know, if I were...

1252
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:08,690
Some old man told me to put shoes on.

1253
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:11,530
If it wasn't for your mattress-backed mammy

1254
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:13,370
with that curb service sign

1255
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:16,570
and the fucking double-bed mattress on her back,

1256
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,210
I wouldn't be a motherfucker.
