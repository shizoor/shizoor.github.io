1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Stay tuned for the Hour of Slack.

2
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,140
And this is your announcer, Reverend Ivan Stang.

3
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,080
And this is your show.

4
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,040
Hideous. Wonderful. Show.

5
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,620
The Soap Genius Hour of Slack.

6
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,960
Abandon all hope, he who enter here.

7
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,180
Ah, can you give me a sentence with the word isthmus in it?

8
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,220
Ahem.

9
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,880
Isthmus be my lucky day.

10
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,400
Welcome to the night, Tizzy.

11
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,360
Ah, yes, dear friends, it's a pretty modernistic show tonight.

12
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,960
We've been doing all these very linear and thematic shows lately.

13
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,240
But tonight we're going back to the basics, the old sad stuff.

14
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,720
Ah.

15
00:01:59,380 --> 00:01:59,720
The.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,860
All new old sad stuff from the Church of the Soap Genius.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,500
Because this is the surreal Hour of Slack.

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,640
This time we're illustrating the decay of civilization as you know it.

19
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:18,520
And, uh, of course it's not going to make much sense, but in that respect it's probably more real.

20
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,120
In fact, some things will be too real for the polished ears of the modernists.

21
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,600
We have the intention to work.

22
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,140
Yeah, we're going to work.

23
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:39,320
So, uh, stand by for alive and, uh, un-uh, undead material from Doctors for Bob and the Swingin' Love Thorses, dear friends.

24
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,840
It's intended to be taken as a way of life.

25
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,000
We ourselves wish to work.

26
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:52,320
We must ask ourselves whether this document represents for us a way of life.

27
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,760
It certainly does for me.

28
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,400
A way of life.

29
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,220
It's brilliant.

30
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,780
It's very brilliant.

31
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,720
It's very hump you feel for the fact that this world has, you know, moments stood there.

32
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,940
We would appreciate when you'd call me and ask if you can bring some information for this documentary.

33
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,080
Recommended US 때문에 wei niğıc,

34
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,380
Should come back.

35
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,220
so I think that that's, uh, uh, one of the many things that was coming to my attention

36
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,540
Right here to the site, isn't it?

37
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,340
What was that place, though?

38
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,120
Yeah, it was the military base.

39
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,520
sex, the divine battle, but is there an unbridgeable, undestroyable barrier between men and women

40
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,160
that will keep them forever warring against each other?

41
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,260
Sure there is.

42
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,360
And if you don't believe it, you'll see it.

43
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,220
I think so.

44
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,180
This is Dad's new slacks.

45
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,440
It's 11 o'clock right now.

46
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:47,780
Right now.

47
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,940
We're having a great time tonight, aren't we, Dad?

48
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,380
So what are we still standing around here for?

49
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,160
Where do you want to go?

50
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,620
Well, how about out of here for starters?

51
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,900
I've got to get my wife and my kids.

52
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,960
We're still on alert, Billy.

53
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:20,900
I just want to go out and dig Wanda up out of the damn freezer.

54
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,620
You just get a meat hook.

55
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,360
You hear me?

56
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,360
You got me by the ankle.

57
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,140
I'm a horny.

58
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,940
I'm a horny.

59
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,080
I need her down.

60
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,880
She's frozen or dead or thawed out.

61
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,600
I need dinner.

62
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:31,840
I need supper.

63
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,660
Thaw her ass out.

64
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,680
Thaw her bitch out.

65
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,260
Have her in the microwave and get her.

66
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,040
I'm a horny.

67
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,040
Heat her up.

68
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,480
I'm ready.

69
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,920
See, I ain't got time for any foreplay.

70
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,480
I'm going to make some sex.

71
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,220
Make some dance.

72
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,440
Don't pull out in front of that car.

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,600
That could be Wanda in that car.

74
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,380
Well, tell her.

75
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,360
Put her in the car.

76
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,420
I need someone to drive me up to the Piggly Wiggly to get some cigarettes.

77
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,920
I don't care if she's dead.

78
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Take her up to the Piggly damn Wiggly.

79
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,640
The Wiggly damn Piggly.

80
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,020
Don't bring that curved pig in there.

81
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,220
Get that curved pig out of there.

82
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,040
If you're going to use a curved pig, use a curved pig holder.

83
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,740
Don't put a damn curved pig in a straight pig holder.

84
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,280
They don't know how to use a damn thing.

85
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,980
They don't know a damn thing about a curved pig.

86
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,460
I'm going to bring a straight pig out there.

87
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,620
I'm going to see that bitch in a freezer bag next week.

88
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,440
I'm going to be in next door.

89
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,680
I brought this weapon.

90
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,660
I put my heel under her arm with an ice pick in the freezer.

91
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,380
She'd be cut up with a chainsaw.

92
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,140
Oh, well, yeah.

93
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,720
I just take.

94
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,580
You know when a girl's got nubs.

95
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,440
Hell, I wouldn't kick her out of bed for bleeding to death.

96
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,880
I wouldn't kick her out of bed for eating flesh.

97
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,420
I wouldn't kick her out of bed.

98
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,720
Hell, she can eat frozen corpse crackers in my bed anytime.

99
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,580
Hell, yeah.

100
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,560
She's a good looking heifer.

101
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,440
I like her.

102
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,820
I like her.

103
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,540
And I want her.

104
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,660
I want her.

105
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,040
I want her now.

106
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:46,880
I want her.

107
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,200
And her name's Wanda.

108
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,660
Get that cow out of there.

109
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,540
I ain't talking to you Wanda.

110
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,420
I'm talking Wanda.

111
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,160
Yeah, Wanda.

112
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,140
Get her out of the.

113
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,480
Wanda.

114
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,900
I know I sent her that rocket ship up into the sun.

115
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,740
But get her out.

116
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,800
I'm warning you.

117
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,720
Hell, I.

118
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,800
She had nothing to get her hot.

119
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,980
So I just threw her in the fireplace.

120
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,920
Hell, she didn't even get her chain.

121
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,120
Maybe she'd get off on that.

122
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,560
Get off to.

123
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,660
Toll the judge or shock the little geese out of me when I went to her doctor's prom concert

124
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,340
at the Slice House the other night.

125
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,320
Listen to my tale then.

126
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,340
But why will you call me mad?

127
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,300
Could a madman have written songs such as these?

128
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,520
I'm not insane.

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,800
I'm more sane than Charles Manson.

130
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,300
Son of Sam both put together.

131
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,640
All I want is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

132
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,720
And my pursuit of happiness includes machine gunning 120 innocent schoolchildren.

133
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,840
If that's mad, go ahead and lock me up.

134
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,620
Just because I enjoy washing my face in the blood of infants.

135
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,360
Is that mad?

136
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,940
Is that a reason to lock me up?

137
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,320
But hell, that wasn't nearly as bad as that time they, that time they, that time they

138
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,220
shocked the living gey out of me.

139
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,660
So, they let me tie the

140
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:15,460
bandplate in my head, and in my head everything just, justlocks risky looking hy Lei.

141
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,120
So then I create another.

142
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,120


143
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,120


144
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,160
Every city in right there always says it sounds like Sai Hanoi.

145
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,780
You know I was just calling.

146
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:18,940
You know I should have said it first.

147
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,240
All of a sudden, I'm a Losing Sense.

148
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,240


149
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,740
Come out and beat that pretty bitch or she got me.

150
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,340
And now being here, I can't help that.

151
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:23,880
Oh, that was fun.

152
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,360
That time I had to play chicken with Jones,

153
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,440
and I didn't have a car, and he had a Mack truck,

154
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,660
and the bridge collapsed,

155
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,420
and we had ground zero of a nuclear explosion.

156
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,020
Oh, yeah, that was fun.

157
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,400
That was a good old, good time compared to that time they...

158
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,520
that time they...

159
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,020
shot the living GEE out of me.

160
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,420
¶¶

161
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,400
Well, hell, that was...

162
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,440
Remember that time they had me...

163
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,600
they had to throw me on that needle that was so large

164
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,340
they had to lower me onto it by helicopter.

165
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,140
And even that wasn't enough to anesthetize me.

166
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,140
¶¶

167
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,020
Remember, they chained me down with rope,

168
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,380
they tied me down with chains.

169
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,340
They put me in that room where you don't get any of the good pills.

170
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:21,940
¶¶

171
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,320
¶¶

172
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:24,960
¶¶

173
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,860
Remember that time they cut my genitals in half with barbed wire

174
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,360
and then peeled a Band-Aid off my amputated arm.

175
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,280
¶¶

176
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,120
¶¶

177
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,400
Oh, yeah, that was fun.

178
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,000
That was a big old party.

179
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,240
Yeah, that was fun compared to that time they...

180
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,440
that time they...

181
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,420
that one damn time they...

182
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,620
shot the living GEE out of me.

183
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,820

197

¶¶

198
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,820
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.

199
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,020
Now what's so funny, huh?

200
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,780
Well, that was what you've heard there was

201
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,660
Jane or Hyperclete's Not With Doctors for Bob

202
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,400
with some band in Seattle

203
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,920
that happened to learn the songs quick enough

204
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,860
to actually do it.

205
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,800
There's a verse.

206
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,060
There's a version of Half-Assed Drunk coming up here

207
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,600
which you will definitely want to catch

208
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,620
because it's the most apropos performance, really,

209
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,800
of that song.

210
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,040
Also, you heard Jane or Hyperclete's

211
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,600
and Sterno Kekever ranting there,

212
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,400
lecturing about Wanda in a freezer bag.

213
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,480
Now, some of you may take that as sexist,

214
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,420
sadistic, absolutely abhorrent

215
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,800
and absolutely abhorrent.

216
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,060
Absolutely of no socially redeeming value whatsoever.

217
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,660
But that's because you're too dense to get it.

218
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,060
See, this is reverse Bulldada.

219
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,940
You know Bulldada.

220
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,140
You know what Bulldada means.

221
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,000
It's like the Bulldada of the latest exploration

222
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,820
of advanced surrealistic morealism

223
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,680
in which the mind is filled with dirt and lugs

224
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,540
which trickle like mutilated centipedes

225
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,820
down the sides of the cranium

226
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,020
to find shelter and rest inside the now sightless eye sockets.

227
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,380
And, you know,

228
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,100
it's pretty much a household, you know,

229
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,680
given common knowledge now, household word.

230
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,540
So, uh, uh, what?

231
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,180
Oh, we're getting police banned here.

232
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,800
Wow.

233
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,720
X.

234
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,980
Jeez, this is awful, Dad.

235
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,340
Claude's loaded on dope and he's killing people.

236
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,940
Tell it to the X-mas bunny, kid.

237
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,860
We, uh, friends, we have tuned in

238
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,200
to some, uh, pirate broadcast here

239
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,300
or somehow we're being interrupted.

240
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,580
Our signal is being interrupted.

241
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,540
Our police, man.

242
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,520
The other two head arms, uh,

243
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,580
and, uh, one cute little pussycat.

244
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,820
One dog food zip nine.

245
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,820
One dog food zip nine.

246
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,140
Come in.

247
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,900
Woof, woof.

248
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,000
Good news, boy.

249
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,360
Clong wasted the pussycat.

250
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,260
We need two minutes, then.

251
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,080
Jump in those...

252
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,260
You're sitting in a puddle of excitement, aren't you?

253
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,940
But he's dry.

254
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,180
He squeals fast up police street to the terminal bar

255
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,120
because he needs another shot

256
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,900
because the street is tough and dirty.

257
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,400
Not like at home,

258
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,720
where everything he fears

259
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,940
stands ankle-deep in tears and detergents.

260
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,340
Oh, I'm just having a good time, people.

261
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,820
We're out to clean the thighs.

262
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,100
Uh, dear, where's the dead cat?

263
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,140
Uh, it's in the soap dish.

264
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,680
Uh, but there's soap in the soap dish.

265
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,760
Yeah.

266
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,080
Uh, the cat's in the soap.

267
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:34,920
What?

268
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,780
Yes, dear.

269
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,760
There's a whole dead cat

270
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,520
in every bar of dead cat soap.

271
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,080
Ah!

272
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,260
Oh, no!

273
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,840
Oh, no!

274
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,160
Oh, no!

275
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,740
Over the Edge.

276
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,440
The story of Peggy

277
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,700
and what a woman feels

278
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,540
when she must find out for herself

279
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,960
the things her husband does not know

280
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,420
and face the fact

281
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,060
that life must go on

282
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,340
even over the edge.

283
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,260
Woo!

284
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

285
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,200
Your tongue offended me.

286
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,560
Rip it out!

287
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:18,960
Ow!

288
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,920
I love you.

289
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,520
Is that before or after the bob pills?

290
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,940
Everybody who goes to hell

291
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,100
comes back a millionaire.

292
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:30,920
Honey!

293
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,640
Don't tell me you haven't heard about Pepto-Visimol.

294
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,380
My dear, it might take about ten months.

295
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,400
Hospital tests prove it.

296
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,220
Oh!

297
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,340


298
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:41,940
Oh!

299
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:42,380
Oh!

300
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:42,380


301
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:42,380


302
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:42,380


303
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:42,380


304
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:42,380


305
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,600
Oh!

306
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,500
Besides being a lecherous drunk

307
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,840
and just possibly one of the most evil criminal minds

308
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,280
of the entire worldwide conspiracy,

309
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,320
he looks like Gomez Adams without a mustache.

310
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,820
Is he the better tobacco?

311
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:57,820
That's all.

312
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,480
The new drug of the century.

313
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,360
No, Bob is not smoking tobacco.

314
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,000
Contraband.

315
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,560
That's right.

316
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,820
You have to get a prescription now

317
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,600
to smoke tobacco

318
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,920
and go down to your pharmacist

319
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,200
and say,

320
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,680
I'd like a half ounce of tobacco.

321
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,580
But Bob is smoking

322
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,500
the meriphase of lupina,

323
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,080
have a prop zipilops,

324
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,180
the Tibetan herb.

325
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,960
Stay tuned in next week

326
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,280
for the scientific explanation

327
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,360
and explorations

328
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,680
into the bowels of that plant.

329
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:27,940
This is Diane,

330
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,000
and it's the last interview of the semester.

331
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,000
Yay!

332
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:31,680
Yay!

333
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,500
And we have in the studio,

334
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,260
yeah, the best for last, right,

335
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,120
we have a band in the studio

336
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,300
that I know nothing about,

337
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,560
so this should be incredibly interesting.

338
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,880
It's the Swinging Love Corpses,

339
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,820
and if nothing else,

340
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,480
they have a great name.

341
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,480
So, um,

342
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,940
why don't we start

343
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,960
with some introductions?

344
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,400
Everybody, introduce yourselves.

345
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,520
Well, I'm Philo Drummond.

346
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,340
I play saxophone.

347
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,920
My name's Leif Calabanga,

348
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,980
and I play saxophone.

349
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,520
I'm Dr. Ray Hay,

350
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,120
and I own the Swinging Love Corpses,

351
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,540
but don't worry,

352
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,720
I only use them on the weekend,

353
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,160
so we're safe.

354
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,600
I'm Sphinx Drummond,

355
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,040
and I play trumpet,

356
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,960
and sing lead vocals,

357
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,880
and play saxophone and guitars.

358
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,300
Well, actually, there's one main member

359
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,000
who is Mojo Skippy Butcher,

360
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,480
and he's our drummer.

361
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,600
But he has...

362
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,760
He's playing a bar mitzvah right now.

363
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,180
He's got a bar mitzvah to play.

364
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,880
Oh, too exciting.

365
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,840
Somebody offered him, like,

366
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,380
$10 million to play it,

367
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,280
so he couldn't turn it down.

368
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,900
Let's talk, and maybe you guys can give us

369
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,420
somewhat of a description of your music.

370
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,540
It says here in this book that you just gave me

371
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,940
that the only...

372
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,200
Only mystery jazz acid surfer music

373
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,560
to be created a thousand miles

374
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,820
from the nearest ocean.

375
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,060
Well, that was the genre

376
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,800
we were into a few years ago,

377
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,300
or about a year and a half

378
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,240
when the book came out.

379
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,880
We've gone through several genres

380
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,500
since then, like mystery jazz.

381
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,820
We invent them,

382
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,200
and then we exploit them

383
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,680
to the fullest, and then we throw them away

384
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,600
and come up with a new one.

385
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,740
That was when we were in our surf phase.

386
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,980
We had been the leaders

387
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,920
of the Pioneer,

388
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,720
and the leaders in the Midcoast Surfing Association here.

389
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,580
We popularized the concept of...

390
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,020
Barge wake surfing.

391
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,480
Barge wake surfing.

392
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,840
You know, you can catch a barge wake

393
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,680
and go all the way down to New Orleans.

394
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,620
To New Orleans, really?

395
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,040
Right.

396
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,340
And on a regular surfboard, this is?

397
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:26,980
Oh, yeah.

398
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,500
Yeah, regulation.

399
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,480
If you go too fast,

400
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,820
you can always flare your skinner,

401
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,680
so it's no problem.

402
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,120
Oh, that's really good.

403
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,460
I've never tried that on the Mississippi, but...

404
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,300
You can hang 11 right over a sandbar.

405
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,140
Yeah.

406
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,740
It's a beautiful thing.

407
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,460
A sandbar, right.

408
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,640
That chick's gonna have 12.

409
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,960
Yeah, that's right.

410
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,440
But we...

411
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,180
Yeah, that was...

412
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,380
We've kind of passed through that phase now.

413
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,340
We're more into goofrock.

414
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,860
Now we're into goofrock.

415
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,180
Goofrock?

416
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,280
Well, how long have you been together?

417
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,040
I mean...

418
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,220
Well, these two have been together since birth.

419
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,140
We were...

420
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,380
Yeah.

421
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,180
We were Siamese twins originally.

422
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,100
He and I are brothers.

423
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,360
And he's a cousin,

424
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,280
separated at the third nostril.

425
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,940
He was a cousin,

426
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,420
and he's like a step-neighbor-in-law,

427
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,500
is what he is.

428
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,920
How do you become a step-neighbor-in-law?

429
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,820
Step-neighbor-in-law, exactly.

430
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,700
In our neighborhood,

431
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,740
it's a real painful...

432
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,820
It was real easy to do.

433
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,280
It's a real painful process.

434
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,560
It requires, like, these...

435
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,340
Most of the kids have...

436
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,460
Bamboo shoots up the nostrils,

437
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,820
but you smooth it up.

438
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,320
You have to have your glands altered.

439
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,260
Your glands altered?

440
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,780
Oh, that sounds kind of a...

441
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,560
Glandscaping.

442
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,780
Glandscaping.

443
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,000
Glandscaping.

444
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:32,900
Glandscaping.

445
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,980
Do you go to, like, a normal hospital

446
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,720
for this procedure, or...

447
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,160
No, you go down an aft into that...

448
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,580
Aft into...

449
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:38,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

450
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,180
Glandscaping place down there.

451
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,920
I am originally from...

452
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,900
I'm from Afton, so, uh,

453
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,000
no Afton remarks.

454
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,600
We used to be proud, actually.

455
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,420
It's one of the few glandscaping offices

456
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,460
in the city.

457
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,500
In the whole Midwest.

458
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,060
Oh, really?

459
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,160
You can't just go anywhere.

460
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,800
The only other place you can go is in Tibet.

461
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,620
You have to go to Tibet,

462
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,280
is the nearest...

463
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,740
Well, it was an art of the home office.

464
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,560
Tibet or Afton?

465
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,660
Tibet or Afton.

466
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,760
You don't really have much of a choice.

467
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,040
Well, that location burned down.

468
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,380
They had, like, some anti-third nostril openers

469
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,200
that were protesting out front,

470
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,560
and they burnt down the, uh...

471
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,580
I understand Carter went down

472
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:10,920
to make sure that...

473
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,500
I'm sure the anti-third nostril election

474
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,920
was straight up and up this week.

475
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,260
Yeah, but nobody really cared.

476
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,940
And actually, that interviewer

477
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,280
did not get around to playing

478
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,160
the music of that rather interesting band,

479
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,760
the Swinging Love Corpses.

480
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,500
So, here.

481
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,500
Yeah, it's about time we saved the universe.

482
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,040
We hadn't done it in at least a week or two.

483
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,980
It's a tough job being as important as we are.

484
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,020
A lot of people don't realize that

485
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,700
rock bands have...

486
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,540
They have greater callings in life

487
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,340
than just playing music.

488
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,460
You know, a lot of times

489
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,080
we have important things to do.

490
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,900
Really important things, you know,

491
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,760
like maintaining the balance

492
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,280
between the negative energies

493
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,940
and the positive energies, you know?

494
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,160
Like, yeah, the what?

495
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,200
What about the groupies?

496
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:55,980
Yeah, the groupies.

497
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,960
We have the groupies to worry about, too, you know?

498
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,860
Are we ready?

499
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:02,680
Yeah!

500
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,120
Yeah!

501
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,080
Yeah!

502
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,600
Yeah!

503
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:05,860
Yeah!

504
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,140
Yeah!

505
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:07,600
Yeah!

506
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:09,600


507
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:09,600


508
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,180
Yeah!

509
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:10,680
Yeah!

510
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,680


511
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,680


512
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,680


513
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,680


514
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,680


515
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,680


516
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,680


517
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,680


518
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,680


519
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,680


520
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:10,920
Yeah!

521
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,580
Yeah!

522
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,340
Yeah!

523
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,020
Yeah!

524
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,040
Yeah!

525
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,420
Yeah!

526
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,500
Yeah!

527
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,880
Yeah!

528
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,020


529
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,500
Yeah!

530
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:29,920
Yeah!

531
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,400
Yeah!

532
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:30,620
Yeah!

533
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:30,620


534
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,000
Yeah!

535
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,160
Yeah!

536
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,900
Yeah!

537
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,360
It's free determined, and this is our fate.

538
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,040
We're singing this song, so you can relate.

539
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,060
We are going to save the universe.

540
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,500
We are going to save the universe.

541
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,100
We are going to save the universe.

542
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,200
This time.

543
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,960
We are all grown.

544
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,320
We are grown as men.

545
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,020
We are all past.

546
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,340
The age of reasoning.

547
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,820
It's our mission.

548
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,360
It's our task.

549
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,700
It's all for us.

550
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,520
Just you.

551
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:40,920
Just you.

552
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,000
We are going to save the universe.

553
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,380
We are going to save the universe.

554
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,920
We are going to save the universe.

555
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,180
This time.

556
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,400
This time.

557
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:22,920
This time.

558
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,020
This time.

559
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,020


560
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,020


561
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,020


562
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,020


563
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,020


564
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,020


565
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,280
Don't you worry.

566
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,800
Don't have no fears.

567
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,340
Don't gather room.

568
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,200
Because the end is near.

569
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,360
It's never season of someone.

570
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:52,860
They know what they are.

571
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:52,860


572
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,720
We are more than a band

573
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,020
We are in control

574
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,000
And we are more than a band

575
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,900
We are going the same way you've ever

576
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,560
We are going the same way you've ever

577
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,860
We are going the same way you've ever

578
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,120
Yes, dear friends

579
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,840
Well, now I'm sorry

580
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,840
I understand why they wanted me to do a new pledge drive reminder card

581
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,920
In the meantime, listen to that

582
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,460
Oh, it's beautiful piece of music there

583
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:22,820
This is...

584
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,500
This is from some old 78 record

585
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,580
From China, Between the Wars

586
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,000
Called China Night

587
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,860
Sounds like the theme to Seven Faces of Dr. Lo

588
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,400

hot

597
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,540
Not for a second.

598
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
I'm an E-Rotator.

599
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,540
Different failure.

600
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,720
I'm an E-Rotator.

601
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,180
Successful.

602
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,920
I'm an E-Rotator.

603
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,020
Dumb body, Mitch Campbell.

604
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,900
Took Miss Mousy on his knee.

605
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,220
Dumb body, Mitch Campbell.

606
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,920
Pray Miss Mousy won't you marry me.

607
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,380
Dumb body, Mitch Campbell.

608
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:10,820
Really does.

609
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,440
I'm an E-Rotator.

610
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,460
I'm an E-Rotator.

611
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,720
I'm an E-Rotator.

612
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,800
Okay, well I just wanted to get shots of you doing the show at some point.

613
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,980
Oops, do I clean that up?

614
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,600
Say we got a good solid quarter of an hour before we have to put up with any of that stuff.

615
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,940
Yeah, that's what they say out there in the cold Berkeley morning.

616
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,340
In the formless darkness of the morning.

617
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,000
Okay, now we're working on the Berkeley morning now.

618
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,600
We're chopping it up and adding with it some of the other things.

619
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,780
I'm a reporter for the Berkeley morning.

620
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,020
Aaron, 848-484-425 in the Berkeley morning.

621
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,040
Individual.

622
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,840
You did nothing.

623
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,920
What can I do?

624
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,080
What can you do?

625
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:41,940
No, what can I do?

626
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,720
You can do nothing.

627
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,360
What can you do?

628
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,200
What should I do?

629
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,040
You shall do nothing.

630
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,500
What will I do?

631
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,200
You will do nothing.

632
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:46,560
What will?

633
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,120
What can I?

634
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:47,700
How are you?

635
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,280
Oh, no.

636
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:48,940
Oh, no.

637
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,280
Watch out.

638
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,400
Oh, no, don't do that.

639
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:50,840
Don't do that.

640
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,580
Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.

641
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,420
Ah!

642
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,080
Ah, that's, uh, our dear friends there at this KPFA in Berkeley,

643
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,680
which is where that last little bit came from.

644
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,620
Dear friends.

645
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,780
And, uh, funny how these, uh, funny how these knobs,

646
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,140
these knobs in front of me,

647
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,540
do you know any girls with knobs that work?

648
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:19,720
No.

649
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,860
Everybody wants to get into the act.

650
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:25,380
And we'll just slow down and we can have Aeohippus lovechild tell you about what kind of prehistoric

651
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,340
animal you were in the first place.

652
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:26,360
You know.

653
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,680
But no, you're too busy gibbering and squeaking in the blackness of the void.

654
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,680
I'm sorry for you.

655
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,660
I think...

656
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,460
Yes, I pity you.

657
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,880
I think he has the vibes of a trilobite.

658
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,920
Ah, stuck in a little rock, all curled up, looking like a little, uh, well, kind of...

659
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,560
It used to be called a trio trilobite.

660
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,380
Come out of your shell.

661
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:43,960
But not no more.

662
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,500
Now called color here at 848-4425.

663
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,200
A pathetic little limulus.

664
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,200
A horseshoe crab.

665
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,600
They used to pitch at quaits.

666
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,260
At Quait Tower a million years ago.

667
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,440
And now we're, uh, pitching those horseshoe crabs.

668
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,560
Yes, but the angle of the pitch is...

669
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,400
Impaling them on, uh...

670
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:57,740
Something different.

671
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,400
The steel spike that would normally be used to hook normal...

672
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,740
Uh, Steven's steel spike, uh, stuck through the head of the old, uh, trio trilobite.

673
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,700
Yeah, right.

674
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,980
Leave a message, cause, uh...

675
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,940
Hello, you're on the air.

676
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,680
The Bengals will win.

677
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,580
Yes.

678
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,640
Tigers for...

679
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,080
Ikki, ikki, stomp.

680
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,060
Ikki, woody.

681
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,100
Leavers eviscerate pumas.

682
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,580
Iron squash elephants.

683
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,080
Hey, I can't show you the best of your horse.

684
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,900
Okay, now, if I was running around the antenna faster and faster...

685
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,760
And when I get to a certain speed, he'll disappear.

686
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,300
Uh, I'm telling you that, Ikki.

687
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,380
You're in trouble now.

688
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,400
Okay, here comes...

689
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,160
You're in a heap of trouble, Bob.

690
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,800
Okay, get ready, caller.

691
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,000
It's... it's not our fault.

692
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,480
It's because of Doctors for Bob.

693
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,480
Uh, which follows...

694
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,300
At least, uh, the Jane or Hyperclete's part of Doctors for Bob follows.

695
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,840
With, uh, jokes you're too stupid to understand.

696
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,000
Followed by jokes...

697
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,740
You're too solid to understand.

698
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,740
Followed, finally, by, uh,

699
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,700
Jane-er's ultimate statement about heavy metal rock.

700
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,500
Uh, tokin', smokin', cokin'.

701
00:27:59,500 --> 00:27:59,940
Thank you.

702
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,440
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

703
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,680
Doctors for Bob proudly present...

704
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,340
Jokes You're Too Stupid to Understand.

705
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,700
Part 2.

706
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,800
There was a young mathematics pr- student.

707
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,140
I believe he was Polish in descent, if not in origin.

708
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,040
He was assigned the following linear equation.

709
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,260
E times the square root of...

710
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,780
times dx over the cube root of y times p.

711
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,180
He first traced the x-intercept and y-intercept of the equation,

712
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,100
and then took the complex root of each factor.

713
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,280
After this, he, of course, multiplied by the vector quantity

714
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,920
of each infinite geometric sequence.

715
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,960
However, he put his studies away in order to attend Stravinsky's Rites of Spring.

716
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,560
He returned to resume working on the equation.

717
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,240
His spirit was, however, quite a f-

718
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,840
flame after seeing such a work,

719
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,800
and he made the following mistake- mistakes.

720
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:00,220
First off, he consulted a non-Euclidean rather than a Euclidean logarithm table.

721
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,880
He then computed the sine rather than the cosine of the formula.

722
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:17,140
And then, while figuring the general bi- nor- binomial expansion,

723
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,100
he accidentally multiplied by...

724
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,160
a positive rather than a negative integer.

725
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,360
If you...

726
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,000
While contemplating a young female who sat opposite him in class,

727
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,340
he incorrectly figured the area between two curves,

728
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,620
his mind being more interested in the young lady's curves

729
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,040
than the curves on the mathematical chart which he was consulting.

730
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,900
I guess it was what you might call a case of degenerative conics,

731
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,500
extremely genera- degenerative conics in this case.

732
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,440
I believe he was contemplating her triangle rather than Pascal's

733
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,100
when he calculated the infinite geometric sequence between his heat flux,

734
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,140
because his heat flux was a bit higher than it should have been.

735
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,680
His final answer?

736
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,620
Why, it was thirteen, of course.

737
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,600
Of course, anyone with a fragment of a frontal lobe remaining

738
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,780
knows the correct answer is fifty-seven.

739
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,980
Did I say something wrong?

740
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,880
You have been listening to Dr. Sir Bob's

Hell, I can't stand for a solid pig or a liquid pig.

873
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,740
I just want a gas pig.

874
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,280
That's all I need is a damn gas pig.

875

00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,120
Oh, you can't buy a pig freezer bag.

881
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,680
They like to sell them.

882
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,600
Or you can get pig teeth.

883
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,880

00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,880
And then a pig tooth stop sign.

886
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,720
His damn stop sign made out of pig teeth and pig tickets.

887
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,700
Yeah, he didn't know he was supposed to go to a screeching mall when he saw it.

888
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,380
And then 11 pill pig ticket farmers.

889
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:49,620
He thought it was the cow vertebrae cut out by them air warden stop signs that he was supposed to stop at.

890
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,560
Oh, do you see those cow vertebrae trees with the 14 toes?

891
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,100


892
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,300

Well, baby needs food but his daddy needs a lude.

912
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,100
Well, the baby better find himself a job.

913

And, well, he had multiple fractures.

930
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,840
And, well, they, like, had a tube running up through his nose.

931
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,380
I think that was the only way he could breathe.

932
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,120
And, well, there was this one fellow.

933
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,000
It was kind of weird.

934
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:15,080
They found pieces of the same guy on the front and the back of the same car.

935
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,780
I don't really even understand how that could happen.

936
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,000
They ought to run some kind of scientific test or something.

937
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,560
I don't know.

938
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,800
And a couple of folks did.

939
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,900
Sure looked green to me.

940
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,160
Have a strong.

941
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,980
I'm a victim of lies.

942
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,960
There's nothing wrong with me, Your Honor.

943
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,600
I can see.

944
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,420
Hell, I got two damn DWIs.

945
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,600
Have a strong.

946
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,380
Oh, woe is me.

947
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,740
I finally found a job.

948
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,240
Now I'm looking for a blowjob.

949
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,880
Wonder if the warden can see.

950
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,880
Well, they don't really pay.

951
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,160
But it's steady every day.

952
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,980
Breaking rocks till they're broke as me.

953
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,140
Have a strong.

954
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,540
Have a strong.

955
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,220
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you.

956
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,080
Tomorrow I'll miss you.

957
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,260
Remember, I'll always be true.

958
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,280
And by the way, I'll hug you deep.

959
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
And I'll send.

960
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,960
And I'll send.

961
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,120
All my lovin' to you.

962
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,780
They called it the Reagan Revolution.

963
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,360
Now, I'll accept that.

964
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,520
But for me, it always seemed more like the great rediscovery.

965
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,460
A rediscovery of our values and our common sense.

966
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,720
Common sense told us that when you put a big tax on it,

967
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,940
the economy bloomed like a plant that it could cut back

968
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,280
and could now grow quicker and stronger.

969
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,960
Our economic program brought about the longest peacetime experience.

970
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,760
And we're still the first nation in our history.

971
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,140
Real family income up.

972
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,860
The poverty rate down.

973
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,900
Entrepreneurship booming.

974
00:42:59,160 --> 00:42:59,760
Ground.

975
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,040
Explosion in research and new technology.

976
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,580
We're exporting more now than ever because American industry became more competitive.

977
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,260
And at the same time,

978
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,020
someone has actually begun to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons.

979
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,840
You made me suffer in this song.

980
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,920
And on Jesus' birth,

981
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,220
and on Jesus' birthday.

982
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,200
What do you think, Dad?

983
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,880
And on Jesus' birthday.

984
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,820
Yes, friends, it's a pretty interesting hour of Slack, don't you think?

985
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,440
Here we have this religious radio broadcast.

986
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,680
We haven't said one word about our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

987
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Haven't said anything about Slack or any other...

988
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,700
Oh, there they go.

989
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,100
Ow!

990
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,080
Ow!

991
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,100


992
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,560
Ow!

993
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:56,880
Ow!

994
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:56,880


995
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:56,880


996
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:56,880


997
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:56,880


998
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:56,880


999
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:56,880


1000
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,760
Well, I guess we have something to say about Slack.

1001
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,340
Oh, man.

1002
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,400
Ah.

1003
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,540
I don't know about you, but I've been having a fun time with this show.

1004
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,000
Because I'm sick of Bob.

1005
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:08,980
I'm gonna kill Bob.

1006
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,680
If I see him coming down the street, I'm gonna kill him, man.

1007
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,640
I'm gonna kill him.

1008
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,780
It's like a bunch of boogers.

1009
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:19,700
It's like a bunch of boogers.

1010
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:22,960
You tell me how you gonna do it.

1011
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,860
It's only five foot three.

1012
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,200
We went out there in the cave and there's that big thing that weighs a hundred pounds.

1013
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,760
I said, what is these boogers doing there?

1014
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,780
They're supposed to be in Jones's nose.

1015
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,540
Last time I saw those boogers they were in Jones's nose.

1016
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,580
Now here they are in a cave fixing to drop off.

1017
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,760
Well, there was bats up there.

1018
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,480
They had the bat shit.

1019
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:42,980
They had the purple devil electric batty guana pig toes pig tooth telephone pole tree and

1020
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,860
bitch and bat snot fixing to drop off the edge of that cave.

1021
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,120
But it's like a cyclopean eye of Odin.

1022
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,360
That's what I told Smith that time.

1023
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,180
He told me about that.

1024
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,080
He rolled that eye out there with the soda pop bottle.

1025
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,540
And I said, it's like a cyclopean eye of Odin.

1026
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,620
He tried to say I wasn't.

1027
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,340
Just a bunch of damn.

1028
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,460
I said, what the hell do you mean by that, son?

1029
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:06,160
I was sitting in here trying to, just trying to drink a beer with my woman with my mattress.

1030
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,320
He tried to tell me that he thought that he was going to drop a cigarette butt down there.

1031
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:13,240
And I said, well, you ain't going to drop that cigarette, but you ain't going to throw

1032
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,320
that damn cigarette butt at me.

1033
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,060
Just because you put it in the ashtray.

1034
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,600
I know you were trying to throw it inside my eye and blind me.

1035
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:19,880
I know.

1036
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:20,960
I was sitting in here looking.

1037
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,520
I was trying to pack up my woman's ass.

1038
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,260
I couldn't ask him.

1039
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,400
I was looking for a date with him.

1040
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,420
So he tried to put my eye out with that, by putting that cigarette in that ashtray.

1041
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,840
That's why I had to beat his ass.

1042
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,900
I seen it too.

1043
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,660
I saw him.

1044
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,440
I saw him over there order a beer.

1045
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,200
That's because he wanted to throw that beer in my face.

1046
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,920
I don't care if it ended up in his stomach.

1047
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,240
That's because he's a lousy aim.

1048
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,100
I know he wanted to throw that beer in my face.

1049
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,600
That's why I had to kick his ass.

1050
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,580
We don't care.

1051
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,460
Bob eats oak trees for breakfast.

1052
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:43,940
Wait a minute.

1053
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,920
Bob grinds up damn light bulbs in his nose and snorts them up and packed.

1054
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,440
And Smith hangs up his damn ass.

1055
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,660
Why is that bird trying to whistle at my girlfriend?

1056
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,940
I'm going to have to kick Jones' ass because of that.

1057
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,920
Why is that car signaling?

1058
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,840
Is he trying to wink at my girl?

1059
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,260
I'm just going to head on with him.

1060
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,940
I'm going to play some chicken with a cop car.

1061
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,480
I ain't even got a car.

1062
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,720
I'm just going to play chicken with my body.

1063
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,040
Hell, they can't stop their cowards.

1064
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,340
They don't kill me.

1065
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:11,900
They're chicken.

1066
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,080
That's the way it is.

1067
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:14,520
Wait a minute.

1068
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:14,780
Stop.

1069
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,240
No.

1070
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:15,800
Hold it.

1071
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,300
Quit it.

1072
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:16,720
Stop.

1073
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,100
Stop.

1074
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,440
Stop.

1075
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:17,820
Stop.

1076
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,180
Stop.

1077
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:18,240
Stop.

1078
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:18,720
Stop.

1079
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,040
Stop.

1080
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:19,260


1081
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:19,320
Stop.

1082
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:19,320


1083
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:19,400
Stop.

1084
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:19,420
Stop.

1085
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:19,680
Stop.

1086
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:19,980
No.

1087
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,480
Quit talking.

1088
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,040
Quit playing.

1089
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,080
No exit at all.

1090
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:22,820
Don't be quiet.

1091
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,160
Quiet.

1092
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,780
We must have silence.

1093
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,680
If anyone talks, it'll be ruining the whole thing, man.

1094
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,780
We can blow one damn sound vibration.

1095
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,180
We can blow up the whole world.

1096
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,200
Stop screaming.

1097
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,380
Everyone hold it.

1098
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,020
Stop it.

1099
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:34,720
Stop ranting.

1100
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,620
Turn it off.

1101
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,500
Turn me off.

1102
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,220
Pull my plug.

1103
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:46,720
We pull this plug, the Janer device down, sterno device down.

1104
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,740
I've got this.

1105
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:48,900
Uh.

1106
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:50,420
Tune here.

1107
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:59,980
This is a perfect thing to lead into the next show, which is normal music or just the

1108
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,340
right kind of abnormal music, I guess you might say.

1109
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:12,760
But this here is, we got a collection of Japanese and Chinese 78s transferred to tape by Dan

1110
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,980
Meyer of the Institute of Scientific Santa Clausism.

1111
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:25,240
This is the Japanese version of Tennessee warts after the occupation.

1112
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:31,060
I think that anyone who doesn't have their tape recorder running now should turn it on

1113
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:31,460
record.

1114
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,400
This is a very important piece.

1115
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,140
You'll probably never hear it again.

1116
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,560
Tennessee warts.

1117
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:41,960
Tennessee warts.

1118
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,840
Tennessee warts.

1119
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,360
Tennessee warts.

1120
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:47,440


1121
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:47,960
Tennessee warts.

1122
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:47,960


1123
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:47,960


1124
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:47,960


1125
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:58,960
Tennessee warts.

1126
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:58,960


1127
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:58,960


1128
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:58,960


1129
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:58,960


1130
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:58,960


1131
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,160
Yeah.

1132
00:47:59,160 --> 00:47:59,160


1133
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,620
Well, it was, um, Kit Smith and I once lived in t

1134
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:08,780
uni bill, my dad went to college and sent their types in that box.

1135
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,440
So I just came to Mahgjustwari with lots of sekhtob and, you know, so just, I met good

1136
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:17,560
pickup there, but I was st azt doubt me.

1137
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:17,940
So I adaptal much to Tennessee with what I know.

1138
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,460
To my loved one

1139
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,680
And for me

1140
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,600
Oh, Wilson

1141
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,820
My friends

1142
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,940
To my sweetheart

1143
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:31,080
From me

1144
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,780
Sari Nishi

1145
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,500

Natsukashi

1149
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,980
I know

1150
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:52,740
That I am

1151
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,860
No matter what

1152
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:01,120
But I'll always be

1153
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,560
Here to say

1154
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:02,560


1155
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,060
To my sweetheart

1156
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,200
Oh, Wilson

1157
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:04,200


1158
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:04,980

00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:06,960


1162
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,220

1182
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,840
system. I was playing God in the game the last time we did it.

1183
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,540
You got murdered too, didn't you? No, they didn't

1184
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:52,400
quite get away with it, but that was something I hadn't foreseen. But a bunch of them

1185
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,280
started conspiring to murder God. And that's the kind of game it is.

1186
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:57,580
Almost anything can happen.

1187
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,640
Well, we know how the period begins.

1188
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,420
We know that in order to operate the brain, coffee is

1189
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:09,520
while Colombia is second to neighboring

1190
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,580
Brazil in sheer coffee volume, producing

1191
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:17,440
oceans and rivers of steaming coffee. It surpasses Brazil

1192
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,240
in producing premium Arabica beans. In fact, Colombia

1193
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:25,160
grows only quality Arabica. Only two

1194
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:29,440
billion coffee trees harvested year-round. That's a lot

1195
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,980
of good coffee. Gurgling down the throats of America.

1196
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,040
We find a creature, yes, a living

1197
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,340
actual bug of the

1198
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:42,780
northern Ohio swamp area. It's called the Dobson fly.

1199
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,940
Dobson fly? The Dobson fly, which is, you can go

1200
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:51,000
see a stuffed, mounted example of this hideous, vicious

1201
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,920
beast in the Cleveland Natural History Museum. The Dobson

1202
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,720
fly, while surrounded by lovely

1203
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,980
butterflies and not-too-alien-looking dragonflies, you'll

1204
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:06,920
notice that the Dobson fly has the head of a

1205
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,740
vicious red ant.

1206
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:15,000
With tedious, clicking mandibles, and the body, a body that

1207
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,620
resembles the tail of a rattlesnake.

1208
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:25,800
Horrible, flapping, leathery wings. Yes, the Dobson fly.

1209
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:31,800
This is not some biological freak that we're making up. I'm

1210
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:36,560
afraid there are thousands of Dobson fly larvae. Now, they are

1211
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,640
in their season, their 50-year season.

1212
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:40,860
A devolution life.

1213
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,120
It was in the 40s.

1214
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:42,560
A devolution life.

1215
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:48,320
In the 1940s was the last time the Dobson fly cycle reached its peak.

1216
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:56,520
And thousands died as these pincher-like beaks of billions of dark Dobson flies attacked

1217
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,400
the suburbs of Cleveland.

1218
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:03,720
Oh, the days of Velikovsky. I thought it was Wassily Kamilovsky.

1219
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:09,320
And every time you swatted a Dobson fly, a million eggs would fly.

1220
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:09,320


1221
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,540
And the eggs would squirt out of its ruptured abdomen.

1222
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:17,540
Each egg hatching into another million Dobson flies.

1223
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:23,280
And each time you tried to squash one of those, it would hatch another million.

1224
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,260
A devolution has no plan.

1225
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:33,780
You see, friends, man likes to think himself the grandest thing in all of God's great creation.

1226
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:38,340
But indeed, no, it is the great order of the insectoride.

1227
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:47,060
The great brain of all collective insect hives and tribes is a billion times smarter than

1228
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:50,860
any single ego-centered human brain.

1229
00:59:51,440 --> 01:00:00,640
Certainly, one Dobson fly or one tick may possess a rudimentary brain, but they can

1230
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,920
communicate by radio with each other.

1231
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,320
And the millions of each species each forms a great brain of that species.

1232
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:11,960
And those brains get together to form brains.

1233
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:19,800
And let's face it, you're outsmarted, Mr. Earth Boy, Mr. Human, Mr. Two-Legged, Mr. Tool-Using Primate.

1234
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:24,800
You, you, a little bit higher up on the pyramid.

1235
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:31,940
That's right. If you can, once you've signed up, if you bring in five more friends,

1236
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:33,900
Let's climb the ladder!

1237
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,780
you'll climb the ladder.

1238
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,120
The ladder of the web.

1239
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,720
The ladder of the web.

1240
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:44,780
Until you're sitting right under the abdomen of the great spider herself.

1241
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,100
Friends, information, information, information, friends.

1242
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:55,660
It's not like we're adding poisons or evil preservatives or anything.

1243
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,100
No, no, we're just filling you up with knowledge.

1244
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,240
Information, information, information.

1245
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,460
No, no, we just want you to have fun.

1246
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:08,700
We want you to join with us in the brotherhood, in the sisterhood.

1247
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,800
Under the web, the great spider protects us.

1248
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:14,380
Yes, she protects us. She nurses us.

1249
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:23,400
We may nurse at the teat, at the information teat of the great spider, of the sticky, sticky web.

1250
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:27,620
All we think is yes.

1251
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,560
We need to find something.

1252
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:33,820
Look at Chaz.

1253
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:41,180
He's got a giant organ of his with a wax mask on his face.

1254
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,360
Princess Wee is sneaking up behind him.

1255
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:47,520
She's tiptoeing up behind Chaz.

1256
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,860
She's reaching out to lift the mask from his face.

1257
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,580
She's going to do it.

1258
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,800
She's grabbed the mask.

1259
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:57,940
He turned around.

1260
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,560
His hideous, hideous face.

1261
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,720
Now he'sícios up.

1262
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,480
He's diagonally pointing in the getaway.

1263
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:07,480


1264
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,460
I know that.

1265
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:08,460


1266
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:08,460


1267
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:08,460


1268
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:08,460


1269
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:08,460


1270
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:08,460


1271
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:08,460


1272
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:08,460


1273
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:08,460


1274
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:08,460


1275
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:08,460


1276
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:08,460


1277
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:08,460


1278
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:08,440
