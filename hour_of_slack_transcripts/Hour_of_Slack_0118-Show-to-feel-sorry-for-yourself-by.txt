I'm a little too tight, I'm getting out of sight
I've got a fucking curtain, I'm barely alive
Oh, ugly, ugly, ugly music
More to come, dear friend
This is KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Texas
Dallas, Texas, dear friends
And we've just switched over to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack
And this is going to be a really strange hour of slack
I mean, I know you expect hours of slack
To be strange, but this one's even strange within our framework
In that half of it's going to be music all by one band
And the other half is all original ranting
For better or worse
Before I get into that, I have some good news for the subgenius fans
I'm going to go through this real quick
The book of the subgenius just went into its third printing, dear friends
Third printing, that means it's popular, popular
At least it's popular

It's popular enough
Nothing like what they think of as popular
The High Weirdness by Mail, the second subgenius book
Will be out in April
And Tales of Bob, three-fisted Tales of Bob
Will be paid for in June
Can't say when it'll come out
These aren't advertisements
You shouldn't buy them, and I have to say that
Oh, yes, friends
We know for the last...
Oh, this is Nino Rota
In the background
With a theme from Eight and a Half
The hat size held in common by many subgeniuses
Including Federico Fellini, myself, and other big heads
Anyway, last week
The last two weeks, we did some real back-to-basics subgenius shows
We talked about Bob, our guru, and Slack, our goal
And we're still on the basics now
But...
But this time, it's the...
The really personal basics
I mean, severely personal
This is like...
The, uh...
The emotional side of the church of the subgenius
A show, dear friends
For subgeniuses to feel sorry for themselves over
But not to feel alone, nay nay
So, if you want our usual
A wacky humor-filled
Dobsfull
Worship, uh...
Uh...
Then tune in next week
This one's an experiment
And to many of you, this show is...
Is...
Is usually just a sh...
A shot of weird yucks
And to others, well, I wouldn't go so far as to call it a suicide prevention show
I mean, we've only gotten three letters from people who decided against suicide
Strictly on the basis of the church of the subgenius
But it...
But I think it is, in a way, a depression-preventing show
In a strange way
In that it's for certain people
Uh...
Some people, I'm sure, we drive into depression
But for the people who constantly must battle despair with sick humor
Well, uh...
You know, we've almost fallen into a formula
And I...
I...
I'm sorry
I just decided to take on a new tack this time
And I hope Bob will forgive me
Frankly, I do not care in the least
Whether you do or not
Ah...
Yeah
Well, see, I just...
Just got this wild hair up my lower colonic organs
And, uh...
I hope I can get all of this onto one hour
I doubt if I can
See, it's gonna be serious
Now, we don't have much serious
Quote, serious tapes from subgeniuses
Because that goes against our tradition, generally
Now, the book gets serious
So I can use stuff like that
And there's...
But there is a band which
And now, some of you may be tired of this
But it's about the only band that's been consistently
Sinking up with the...
The true subgenius sensibilities about real life
As I see it
And I'm talking about Oingo Boingo
And now, usually we're pretty nepotistic
And, uh...
Stick to bands whose members we know personally
Ironically, Oingo Boingo's music
Is about as close to subgenius as you can get
But we don't know them
On the other hand, they're great
I mean, you can understand most of the lyrics
Uh...
They...
There's actual arrangements
So it's not as repetitive as most...
Rock and roll
There's a lot of surprises and little flourishes
Almost like show music
But mainly, it's the mood, dear friends
Uh...
I...
I...
I identify with Danny Elfman
Who writes most of the songs
Because he...
He likes to look and sound like the devil
I'm into that
And also...
And also he does straight dramatic film work
He scores films on the side
Another thing I can identify...
Now...
I love the Swingin' Love Corpses
And Doctors for Bob
But...
Hey...
Oingo Boingo's still one of my favorite bands
Even if you can buy their stuff in the record store
And even though...
I don't know them
So this is sort of like a combination of, uh...
Hero worship
And zero worship
If you know what I mean
I think...
I think these guys...
And this is the subject of tonight's show
I think they know what it feels like
To be a subgenius
Which...
Frankly is more than I can say
For a whole lot of the bobbies out there
The songs I'm gonna play
Seem to pinpoint exactly the elements
Often...
That often combine in a person's life
Which leave you no alternative but
J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius
In some ways...
Also...
Music is...
You know, a lot better than words
At expressing the...
The emotional...
The emotional side of all this, dear friends
But what we can do to bring light
From every place among these treebr
I hope you...
Have you ever felt that somehow you were not yourself?
That your body was the same but everything around you wasn't right
That image is so strange and foreign, flooded in like raging water
Have you ever been in love with someone you hardly knew?
Whereas every time you closed your eyes, you saw this person come alive
It kept you wide awake at night, you felt like you were burning up
It made you want to scream
Then you passed out
Memories
Just once or twice is good for your soul
Just once or twice is good for your soul
If you don't stop, you lose control
Just once or twice is good for your soul
Just once or twice is good for your soul
Just once or twice is good for your soul
Ever lay there half asleep all hours of the night
With some maggoty man tugging at that tiny bell inside your mind
And suddenly that strange idea bursts into an inspiration
You grapple with that man
You grapple with that man
You grapple with that man
The whole thing slips right in your mind


You really think you're own

You're

You've
ever been so

Now, you see, friends, those of you who are already Oingo Boingo fans,
you might as well just turn your recorders off.
But I think this is important.
And what got me on this was, believe it or not, a dream.
I don't have lucid dreams very often, but when I do, they seem to count somehow.
And in this particular dream, you'll like this.
This was a sexy dream.
In the dream, I was at a true Hollywood orgy with my wife.
And I've never actually been to one of those,
but I've heard firsthand stories from some of my more swinging-type buddies in L.A.
And so I had some idea.
I read about that kind of thing.
I kind of had an idea.
Anyway, in the dream, we walked in the door, and everybody was swapping and getting into it.
And it all seemed very natural, you know, naked.
People all over the place.
It seemed sort of healthy, you know, almost.
Of course, it kind of freaked me out, I think, a little bit.
But, hey, you know, and of course, there's a certain amount of worry about diseases there.
But this is where the dream got a little ugly.
It was like every time I approached a woman,
and I was like, oh, my God, I'm going to die.
And these were all free women.
She'd seem to find some excuse to gravitate off to some other guy.
And pretty soon, I'm standing there realizing that everybody else has a partner.
And I'm the odd man out, standing alone.
Even my wife's having a ball, so to speak, off of some stud.
Even the ugly guys and girls are sharing this wonderful, sexy time.
Nothing really sleazy about it.
It's all very natural.
But there I...
I stand alone.
And I woke up feeling horrible.
Of course, I always wake up feeling horrible.
But this was...
This time, it was somehow very familiar.
And I realized what the dream was really about.
And it was about high school.
Now, my...
Rom...
Yeah, I'm getting personal, folks.
I'm sticking my neck out here.
But, see, my romantic life is fine.
Now.
And has been, actually, for just about 20 years.
But high school, man.
High school.
Oh, the hell of it, friends.
The sheer hell.
It made me what I am today.
You know, that's for sure.
A professional hater.
But I think the true subgeniuses among you can perceive that it isn't really your average pink kind of hate.
I think you can tell that.
It's...
In a way, it's a hate disguise.
Because the true horror is easier discussed...
...through exaggeration and bulldada.
And it's almost too awful to put into words seriously.
And that horror, dear friends...
That horror is not the hate.
But...
For the subgenius, in a way, the loneliness.
You've all never found me.
But of course you will, because I am.

It's the most



but my love is there.
Yep, that's it.
These are my private things.
They're there against the wall.
The dirty pictures, religious objects.
These are my private things.
They're there without a clue.
This is my private bed.
This is where I lie at night.
Staring at a light bulb hanging on the ceiling.
Waiting for dreams to call me.
They're there without a clue.
I'm in my humble room at night.
I've been wondering what goes on up there.
What makes the world so scared?
I hold a stare at the people passing by.
But they can see this room high with no shades.
It's like a mountain high.
I cry, I...
This is my private bed.
This is my private life.
This is my private life.
This important and dangerous life.
This is my private life.
And this is my private life.
This is my private life.
This is my private life.
All my problems and goals.
And I really want to know
how can I not lose control.
This is my private life.
This is my private life.
This is my private life.
Don't look back, please.
This is my private life.
This is my private life.
This is my private life.
This is my private life.

You know, there may be parties and friends and so on,
but you can still feel isolated amidst all that,
and it has a tendency to harden you,
not just to your own problems, but also to everybody else's.
You start getting numb, numb to the woes of the world.
In fact, even to immediate disasters
and there are accidents happening right in front of you.
You and 50 other people can watch from your apartment window
while some woman's being raped outside
and not one of you calls the police
or a purse snatcher grabs an old lady's purse
and nobody chases them because it's not their job.
Because we only do our jobs.
Because that's all we're taught to care about.
I thought I heard somebody cry
I thought I heard somebody
Oh, what's the truth I can find
Like troubles in the dead of night
Like shadows in the moonlight
I thought I heard somebody cry
A choir with a single voice
A click on a clip
And it's hitting me like an insect
To pick up on your thoughts
It isn't true
I am not a ghost
Without a soul
Go, listen to my heart
You feel the beat
Stop, listen to the sound
Of moving feet
Walk through the holes of night
When I'm asleep I'm not feeling
I don't believe
I don't believe
Get out of my mind
Bring a bottle of pop And bet your head on the button
And don't let go
If you got me falling
I'm an angel
I'm take that 거야
I'm taking you from here
You got me growing
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
Why he depression
Another hole in my brain



I'm not the one that's feeling it
Hey, girl, sometimes it's too much


For a little while away from me By the dawn ó 0 ó On the hill over the K button of my club
I got a real
I am not
Listen to my heart
You feel the beat
Stop
Listen to the sound
A moving beat
Walk
Through the halls at night
When I'm asleep
I don't believe
I don't believe
I don't believe
It isn't true
Listen to my heart
You feel the beat
Stop
Listen to the sound
A moving beat
I don't believe
I don't believe
You wonder with a single voice
I'm thinking you're the cliff
I don't believe

I can't allow the inside
To be the bulletproof
I'm moving and moving
Like rivers from your eyes
I thought I heard somebody cry
Somebody might be lost
I thought I heard somebody cry
I thought I'd go and see
I thought I heard somebody cry
Somebody might be me
Somebody might be me
I probably should have played
Nothing Bad Ever Happens to Me
but they run that one on MTV too much
In junior high
is when most of us first learned
just how to play music
where being fair and decent will get you.
You find out that popularity is largely based on your skill at cruelty, mainly psychological
cruelty, banding together against the loners and geeks, or else the rival cliques.
Not all subgeniuses were the lone weirdos, either.
I was sort of a popular kind of weirdo, believe it or not.
But I was a romantic, and that was my secret vice and my downfall.
I couldn't act too nice or too sensitive, too vulnerable.
I couldn't admit that.
Even more than wanting to bed them girls, I just wanted true love.
And having to hide that, to maintain the coolness, is what makes you feel alone.
My life in high school was an unending hell.
And I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that.
I'm not...
I don't think I'll be embarrassed later to say it, either.
In a way, it was a lot like that movie Less Than Zero, if you've seen that.
Only without the sex.
You know, in high school, it's pretty hard to get laid if you let on that you care.
And the impenetrable shell that I built to hide that fact has lasted to this day.
Now, I've been married for 13 years, happily.
I lucked out just before I was about to kill myself from loneliness.
But when I had that dream I mentioned earlier about rejection,
I realized that that pain and misery was still deep down in there to this day.
And that shell has only been...
It's been modified and focused, actually, I think.
Focused into the host of this show.
And...
It's not a cult or something like that.
I love your music, levels.



M-No.
It's just the opinion I heard of your one song again.
You mean...
None?


Probably?
You were going to pretend deal only by those delicious notes, didn't you?


No emotion, no emotion

We're all friends.
You know, a lot of things can contribute to that feeling of alienation.
All kinds of things.
Being a minority.
That's probably a pretty popular one.
Wearing glasses or being fat.
I've had both of those.
Being Jewish or whatever.
Being an abused child.
Having alcoholic parents.
Having neurotic compulsions.
Homosexuality or whatever.
Being handicapped.
Being ugly or thinking you're ugly.
In school, see, I thought I was hideous.
Because that seemed like the only possible explanation for my lousy luck with girls in those days.
It couldn't have been a lack of status or coolness.
But I heard the same thing every time.
But it would ruin our friendship.
I just want to be your friend.
Geez, I thought, you mean you can only make out with people who aren't your friends?
So, you know, I just assumed that I was like the hunchback of Notre Dame or the Phantom of the Opera or something.
But the weird thing is, since then, I mean years, years later, I talked to some of those women on whom I had these spectacularly unrecognizable,
unquieted crushes.
And much to my surprise, it turned out that they mostly actually thought I was cute.
But they were scared of me.
Because I was too intense.
Too remote.
Too mysterious.
See, it was my own damn fault, friends.
It was all within arm's reach if I just hadn't swallowed the conspiracy line about what it is that girls liked.
Putting up that shell.
But you see, I'm sorry.

Fortunately, most of the girls swallowed the conspiracy line, too, about what girls like.
And they made it true.
The guys that treated them like dirt and really honestly didn't consider them human, they scored all the time, my friends.
I think that the dude that did it was a very����

a loved one and they wanted to be better than him, because today the girl who was Salvador
didn't like him.
And I think that's so easy, right?

When the office things get rough as action, his demeanor's staring at a paper he has lost inside his head.
Dreaming of a battlefield with guns and ammunition all around the bodies of the wounded and the dead.
And the dead.
And the dead.
And the dead.
He was dead.
He was dead.
He's not dead.
He's not dead.
He's not dead.
He's not dead.
Walking round and round in circles, waking up in a cold sweat, falling down the stairway at the GDD.
He's not dead yet.
Well, friends, you know, the funny thing is,
about all that stuff, I did get the last laugh, I must say.
You know, when it came to that particular aspect, I beat out the cool guys.
I really did.
The nerd triumphant can be the coolest.
He can also be the stupidest.
I'm not, you know.
But see, at the time, it just about drove me to madness.
It drove me to make weird movies.
I made weird movies that were really sick.
It drove me to try to be a bonafide hippie, which was a little bit late.
I mean, this was like the early 70s.
Because that seemed like the only way I could, the only clique I could fit into well enough to maybe score.
And, man, I knew every lead guitarist of every band that nobody's ever heard of anymore.
Oh, hip, hip dude.
And eventually I scored the woman of my dreams.
And gradually I realized, though, that the 60s were being sold.
And...
And, uh...
And most of those hippies were most just fake copycat jargon mouther's like everybody else.
People so flattened out by the conspiracy that, uh...
And the thinking that it gives you that they ended up having to adapt prefabricated personalities, if you know what I mean.
And now, you know what?
I'm noturoistan.

real feelings out of people out of real people
You end up trying to make do with manufactured feelings from oh say religion or
meaningless job
Ambitions or from drugs naturally I chose the drugs
I mean I wasn't stupid but by the time I was 21 I'd perm I had to permanently withdraw from serious teen
alcoholism that I'd originally gotten into
Because it cured the nightmarish flashbacks. I suffered from bad acid trips
So I mean kids, you know, you don't you don't need to do that. I had to deal with some pretty serious symptoms of the
subgenius loneliness and it occasionally turned into rage
but that could be controlled either by
writing and such like or joking around with my buddies who were all
incredibly funny guys at the time or
Fropping or whatever, but then we all grew up
and suddenly
When we grew up the fakery and the deceit
Became even more necessary to get by
And the paradoxes and the total absurdities of the world situation
The social prejudices and especially work dear friends
You find out the conspiracy is so much worse and yet so much more tempting
Than you thought when you were an idealistic student that it becomes almost impossible to pursue real slack
but almost
mandatory to accumulate
All slack, you know what choices we have dear friends cults

half-assed environmental causes

Why don't you break that leash







Don't you push them back
Don't you think the time has come
