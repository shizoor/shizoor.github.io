1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,980
Oh, yes, dear friends.

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,860
This is K&O AM in Dallas, Texas.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,580
And thanks to those who pledged in last week's Pledge Drive show,

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,720
which, by the way, is not played on the sister and brother stations

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,980
to which we send the tapes of this show for later replay.

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,620
But, friends, you can still call in and pledge.

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,660
We've only got Willa Dobbs here, though, this time answering the phones.

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,840
He might have to let it ring until he gets to you.

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,620
We still need a few more pledges to meet our quota

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:48,640
and help this station go to 55,000 billion watts of hell, baby.

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,720
Start bending over, and I want you to start bending over,

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,900
and I want you to start bending over.

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,580
Glory by Shanda, love of Soto by Sata.

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,780
Oh, the best Sata.

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,140
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-soto, hallelujah.

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,340
Glory by Shanda, love of Soto by Sata.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,540
Oh, the best Sata.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,820
That's right.

19
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,180
You are now listening to that show.

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,560
We're going to make you real mad tonight.

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,240
Actually, most of you will just love it, but there'll be a few out there.

22
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,820
You know who we're talking about.

23
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,420
We're going to get back at you this time.

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,180
Arr.

25
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:26,980
Arr.

26
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,400
Arr.

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,620
Arr.

28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,580
Arr.

29
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:36,160
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slang,

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,380
sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

31
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,100
Well, that's lost.

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,940
That isn't somebody that's out there shaking their fist at God.

33
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,100
It can be either active rebellion or passive indifference, either one.

34
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,200
I was never rebellious against God, just indifferent.

35
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,560
I was God's enemy.

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,740
In other words, I had not become his friend,

37
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,740
because you can't become a friend to somebody.

38
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,340
But you don't know.

39
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,780
They walk through their lives barely functioning.

40
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,960
Inside, there's a nagging feeling of hopelessness

41
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,880
and the thought that they are trapped in life's circumstances.

42
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,160
But there is hope.

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,780
Well, you are joining up with one of the most dynamic,

44
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,260
major corporations in the world.

45
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,600
You're joining a group of dedicated people

46
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,080
and an organization of great resources, both human and material.

47
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,820
And you will never know.

48
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,660
None of those things are important.

49
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,740
And so, we stand here behind you as a major company.

50
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,540
But they can't do anything for you, and you will never know.

51
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,920
You have signed the application.

52
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,040
Welcome aboard.

53
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,300
And we'll be looking forward to seeing you,

54
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,520
whether at conventions in your area or as a new direct distributor.

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,480
Just maybe, it could happen to you.

56
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,460
Please.

57
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,000
It's only the first step in a new life for you.

58
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,160
How can I purchase that?

59
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,320
Go on the air.

60
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,500
We don't want to go to commercial.

61
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,460
This is not a situation where we make any money.

62
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,040
We're not infallible.

63
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,480
This money goes into giant baskets that carry it out throughout the day.

64
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,440
We don't claim to be heroes or gods.

65
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,720
We don't claim to be heroes or gods.

66
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,820
But you guys are good.

67
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,400
Huh!

68
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,200
Uh, yes, dear friends.

69
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,040
Uh, yes, dear friends.

70
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,040


71
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,120
Listening to a little bit of old KPFA show here on new...

72
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,820
Dobstown National Park, where we're spending the summer.

73
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,880
We're broadcasting live out of our tent tonight.

74
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,500
We've got very many strange animals here.

75
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,120
We've got collars, all sorts of horrible things.

76
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,800
Any caddies out there?

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,660
No caddies. You carry your own clubs and green helmets.

78
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,380
Because we are calm and relaxed.

79
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,660
Okay, wait a second. Move it closer to him.

80
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,480
No, I don't want to talk.

81
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,780
Nobody can talk.

82
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,960
He only wants to talk.

83
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,060
Just talk.

84
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,740
When you take his microphone away.

85
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,200
When you're talking about the plant, things fall apart. You don't understand.

86
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,440
It's a scary religion.

87
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,420
Okay, Bob was going to run for Big Brother in 1984, but Wotan has decreed that he will lose.

88
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,800
Not ammonia breath.

89
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,660
Hey, Doug.

90
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,700
Let's build a spaceship out of spare parts.

91
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,840
We can fly back.

92
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,720
I'm sure we can put it together. There's enough of the ship left.

93
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,400
You mean a show out of broken parts?

94
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,720
Stuck together with ice cream and...

95
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,120
I'll help.

96
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,560
...yogurt.

97
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:18,760
Yeah.

98
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,280
Get started with your draw windshield.

99
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,680
We can use the stereo.

100
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,620
Yeah. There's enough wire in the...

101
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,820
Yeah, I got some paper here.

102
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,120
That'll give us directional.

103
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,340
Come on, Gary. You start painting the game plan.

104
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,600
Okay. We can use these old bicycle tires for the power drives.

105
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,320
Somehow you can repair the reactor.

106
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,360
We can make that for the wings. We'll get back to the station.

107
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,580
And we'll...

108
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,960
Nelson will be so happy to see us.

109
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,240
Yeah. He thought he missed us, but we're here on this little tape. We'll fly back on this tape.

110
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,940
Yeah, this program's his baby.

111
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,740
We'll save you, Bob. Just keep talking.

112
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,820
Well, come on, Pa. Help me pull the stereo in here.

113
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,460
Don't put the stereo in here.

114
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,240
Just play sound effects.

115
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,840
Here, take this guitar neck and nail it up there to help.

116
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,660
I can make a microphone out of these old stupid wires.

117
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,320
I feel seriously ill. There must be some terrible mistake. Stop. Let go of me.

118
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,700
Wait. Wait. Look. How's things going with Hal?

119
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,560
We can use the vomit to stick together the...

120
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,460
The stuff.

121
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,360
No, no, no. You don't want to see the stuff.

122
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,080
Get a load of this.

123
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:06,700
Oh.

124
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,440
You sent in the money. You were supposed to send in his name to the police department.

125
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,020
And afterwards, when was it that you began to notice the strange psychic effects that you tell us about?

126
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,840
Did you inform members of his family that his strange activities...

127
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,920
It's hard to admit members who won't follow instructions.

128
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,680
...are due in fact to his religious activities?

129
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,220
Yeah.

130
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,120
I called earlier, but you hung up.

131
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,760
Well, that's our... That's our way of doing things.

132
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,760
Well, that's just our way.

133
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,580
And because we're not even awake or anything...

134
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,660
You call in, you answer honest questions, and we'll talk all at once, all over again.

135
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,160
It seems just like this.

136
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,340
...generalization because of the faulty analogy of...

137
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,340
Right into the ground.

138
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,420
Just like a little animal trying to get across the road.

139
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,880
All right.

140
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,180
It's an infernal opportunity for all of us.

141
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,660
Yes, calling this show is like...

142
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,480
Appeal to your...

143
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,220
...across a modern highway with your...

144
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,140
It's kind of like being in hell, you know?

145
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:51,860
...consequence.

146
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,460
The school is where the false process starts.

147
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,360
The thing is, by calling back, you have an option of actually showing up on the Subgenius album someday.

148
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,820
He finds his victory by begging the question.

149
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,160
Yes, it's true. Your voice could be used on almost anything, even this show.

150
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,860
Well, you know you're being tape recorded, and your voice is going to be sent to almost every important member of the Subgenius church within 24 hours.

151
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:18,700
So if you have anything really, really important to say to Philo or Stang or any of those scary people, you better say it real quick.

152
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,720
They're waiting to hear from you.

153
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,360
You use the present tense.

154
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,440
Follow the guy at the black hair and the glasses.

155
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah.

156
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,340
There's the morning of the bad luck that's gone down the drain since World War III.

157
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:40,240
Vienna, New Jersey, and the other swanky towns like Cairn and Dresden.

158
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:46,500
The fire soldiers you see there at Ross is probably the worst thing that's happened.

159
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,200
So I think you'll have a good meeting.

160
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,340
Though I know you're officially a great fan.

161
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,740
How's this situation in Staten?

162
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,000
Not too bad.

163
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,040
What about you, Phil?

164
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:11,480
The thing about Staten Island right hell.

165
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,280
I hate being part of that big Sith.

166
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,140
You're still doing well.

167
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,500
Pretty good.

168
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,260
The breach of all prophets, all standing by,

169
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,720
Better day for the future,

170
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,400
Cards being cast out, away from time,

171
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,640
From your soul, from the human mind,

172
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,680
Your fate is covered in blood,

173
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,100
No one but you is all spurned.

174
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,740
It's in your head, I've gone away,

175
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,820
It's in your head, I've gone away,

176
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:56,060
It's in your head, I've gone away,

177
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:12,380
It's in your head, I've gone away,

178
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,320
It's in your head, I've gone away,

179
00:08:52,220 --> 00:09:01,060
It's in your head, I've gone away,

180
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:45,240
It's in your head, I've gone away,

181
00:09:50,200 --> 00:10:02,740
It's in your head, I've gone away,

182
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:33,880
It's in your head, I've gone away,

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,800
It's in your head, I've gone away,

184
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,780
It's in your head, I've gone away,

185
00:11:49,820 --> 00:12:02,480
It's in your head, I've gone away,

186
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,480
subgenius is gonna outbid our hate callers for the price of killing me.

187
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,760
What it all boils down to is this.

188
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:34,740
We as a species, one master species of all colors and multiple religions besides subgenius,

189
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,580
are under attack by a foe who, in the name of Jesus and George Washington,

190
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:47,740
would undermine the very foundations of this shifting sandy beach upon which Bob Dobbs has built his church.

191
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:53,600
They would make it as rigid and conformist and vapid as the better paid face.

192
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,920
But we will not let that happen.

193
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,000
We will overcome.

194
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,740
We will come all over you.

195
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,420
We will bury you.

196
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,580
We will sell more books and make more money and get more schlack than you.

197
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:17,720
And we will sharpen our swords of words and carry on the war against the...

198
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,620
whores of boredom.

199
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,640
We will destroy youracoels.

200
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,360
We will burn you to ashes and kill your sixteenth and learning skirmishers.

201
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,420
It's a silver theme, though treating us like the mad,

202
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,980
אנחנו шар asphalt care heut via.�

203
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,620
Renaissance script of the same songs will be played

204
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,420
in the future from your heart.

205
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,640
are joined

206
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,180
on this merry

207
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,360
occasion

208
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,560
let's drink

209
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,800
love and sing

210
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,840
our wine has

211
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,320
a spring

212
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,740
the world is in pain

213
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,140
our secrets

214
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,060
to gain

215
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,880
but still let them

216
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,640
guess and keep on

217
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,500
they'll never define

218
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,920
the words are the sign

219
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,120
of free

220
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,560
strong men

221
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,460
of the nation

222
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,200
here's health

223
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,320
to the men

224
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,860
of the nation

225
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:14,920
the

226
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,680
the

227
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,600
list long before a little warning signal goes off inside the fifth what

228
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,320
sometimes it's hard to pinpoint the precise error

229
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,920
but the language the pure

230
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,700
language of heaven

231
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,300
something said look out the sky is fishing

232
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,220
caucus for some with his

233
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,500
theological wires

234
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,720
It's almost like listening to someone who knows only a few words of English, but soon

235
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,540
they're rattling off in a completely unknown language when they haven't even been to kindergarten

236
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,560
spiritually.

237
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,500
We eat more, drink more, play more, and do less to earn a good living than any other

238
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,200
people in history.

239
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:08,760
We have at our fingertips the world's greatest music, and I might add a lot of its worst,

240
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,940
else the cultists would have no following.

241
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,360
We are a people grasping nervously, sometimes almost hysterically for more.

242
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:21,200
I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I

243
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,480
know.

244
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,720
Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortuous

245
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,560
executions, it would be more consistent to call it the word of a demon.

246
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,140
There are little eyes upon you and they're watching night and day.

247
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,920
With a vocal and activist minority ready apparently to take over.

248
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:40,920


249
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:40,920


250
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,220
To burn a bomber's shield or kill for more.

251
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,900
And most incidentally are in their teens or their twenties.

252
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,740
And that's Washington people, I'll tell you that.

253
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,280
They dwell in caves, not high-rise apartments.

254
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:02,240
They may not have found a huge affluence, but they found an endless supply of dope,

255
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,340
uninhibited sex, an endless supply of money.

256
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,740
Free access to a distillery, I suppose.

257
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:10,900
And that's the end of it.

258
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:10,900


259
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:10,900


260
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:10,900


261
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,980
Ah yes, the harvest.

262
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,260
You can count on that.

263
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,380
A theory for more.

264
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,760
Why friends, we could feed another nation with our garbage.

265
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,460
What more than a space hogger on earth?

266
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,220
Is the church of geniuses?

267
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,340
I don't know.

268
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,080
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?

269
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,480
Bang.

270
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,620
Are you blaming God for atom bombs?

271
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,040
Atomic warheads?

272
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,640
Don't.

273
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
I don't know.

274
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,840
I only know that it will signal the end of time.

275
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,320
Why?

276
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:46,840
Bang.

277
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:47,840
Bang.

278
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,160
Bang.

279
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,760
The past blotted out, and the future assured.

280
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,640
Ah yes, the harvest.

281
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,320
Forty years ago, I warned of it.

282
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,320
Thirty years ago, I warned of it.

283
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,620
Twenty years ago, I warned of it.

284
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,660
It's here today.

285
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:09,100
Crime, humanism, hedonism, pornography, profanity, one divorce for every two marriages.

286
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,620
We live in a world where this is happening.

287
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:17,960
of fever, of terror, of bombings, of international crimes. Ah yes, the harvest is here. What kills me?

288
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:24,100
What kills me? Ah yes, what kills me?

289
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:34,400
And the result is nothing, nothing. It can't mean something, nothing or nothing something.

290
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,860
There is no energy, there's no mass, there's no personality, there's just nothing.

291
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,640
Are we to say we came from nothing, nothing to the present universe?

292
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,360
America, wake up.

293
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,100
You are in black darkness and confusion.

294
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:00,920
You have been hugger muggered and carried into a war and you know nothing about it.

295
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,880
You know nothing about the forces that caused it or you know next to nothing.

296
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:14,980
You are not to be in this war. You cannot win this war.

Thank you.

329
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,060
I'm not really wrong

330
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,540
If you wander around

331
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,000
With a napkin on

332
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,060
With a bell on a stick

333
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,400
And your hair is all gone

334
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,240
The geek shall inherit nothing

335
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,120
You say your life's a fun deal

336
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,180
And you're up against the wall

337
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:10,220
Well, people, you ain't even got no kind of deal at all

338
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,180
Because what they do

339
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,940
In Washington

340
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:22,720
They just take care of the number one

341
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,000
And number one

342
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,060
And you

343
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,360
It's not just the wars and the awards that win them

344
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,160
It's the people

345
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,160


346
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,300
It's not just the dull and empty distaste

347
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,540
For a smothered culture

348
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,920
That expires all around you

349
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,700
In pools of its own wastes

350
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,280
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu

351
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,680
It's not just the child zombies

352
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,560
That murder their mediocrity in appearance

353
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,280
And then cruise the streets with bloody feet

354
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,300
It's not just those starry old vecks on the park benches

355
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,860
With looks on their faces

356
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,960
Like those who shuffled out of the boxcars

357
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,160
And Belson and Ogden

358
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,500
And the old Swiss

359
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,280
It's not just the anesthesiologist for Negi

360
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,380
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses

361
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,660
That grope and clutch all around you

362
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,100
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan

363
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,160
It's not just the broken headlights, snapped antennae

364
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,140
And human excrement on your car hood

365
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,980
It's not just that the old ways were best

366
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,180
It's not just the bastardization and perversion

367
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,380
Of every honest means of self-expression

368
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,940
It's not just the kill-a-shit ganja

369
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,160
From the dark side of the bush

370
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,800
It's not just the penoid snipers

371
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,380
Locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop

372
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,500
It's not just the wide-screen technicolor corporate daisy chain

373
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,460
That has defiled the entire planet

374
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,020
It's not just Mongo in the Congo

375
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,960
With fa-fa-fas the size of a moth

376
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:00,960


377
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,180
And the size of basketballs

378
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,680
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness

379
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,480
It's not just the indignity of having to work

380
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,160
For some bland, nonentity son-of-a-bitch

381
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,560
Who thinks workers are property

382
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,260
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil

383
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,960
It's not just the battling eco-freaks

384
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,120
Who want to go back to nature

385
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,700
Without realizing that nature is an open-ditch latrine in midsummer

386
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,200
It's not just some asshole with a pipe

387
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,060
And a 90-more-than-you-do dog grin all over his homogenized face

388
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,560
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world

389
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,240
That you certainly never made

390
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,680
It's not just the doorway to doom

391
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,400
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on

392
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,580
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max

393
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,600
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.

394
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,180
Bob ain't no idiot.

395
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,380
No nickel-dime bum-show.

396
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,600
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.

397
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,880
Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus

398
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,560
You don't need to rise precious early

399
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,740
You sinner there if you want to diddle the almighty Bob

400
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:13,780
Not all.

401
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,740
He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

402
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,700
In his back pocket.

403
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,260
Just you try it.

404
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,120
That was Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

405
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,740
And we're gonna try to take this next caller here.

406
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,360
Take his...

407
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,140
mind away.

408
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,680
Back in them old days, friends.

409
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,160
Yes.

410
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,980
Oh, what were we listening to there?

411
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,180
The ancient, ancient shows.

412
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,780
The ancient shows of the sub-dini's.

413
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,620
Going backwards in time, of course.

414
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,220
Little clip of Frank Zappa.

415
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,580
Lots of Liebach music.

416
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:58,220
That rendition of Blockhead, the old Devo hit, was by the Doguloids.

417
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,080
Wherever they are.

418
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,980
Our dear friends.

419
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:08,660
And, uh, oh, we heard a little song called It's In Your Head by Joe Velvet.

420
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,960
Oh, where is Joe Velvet?

421
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Let's see what else is in our head here.

422
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:13,940
Um...

423
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,820
It's in your head.

424
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,040
Let me give you Joe Velvet's address.

425
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,640
P.O.

426
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:27,140
Box 1526 in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

427
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,360
I'm gonna go ahead and get this.

428
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,060
I'm gonna go ahead and get this.

429
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,060


430
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,060


431
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,060


432
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,060


433
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,340
Is that right?

434
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,160
I-A?

435
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,820
I guess so.

436
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,620
Yes?

437
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,920
Uh, Joe Velvet there at P.O.

438
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,760
Box 1526, Council Bluffs, Iowa.

439
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,340
Yes, and we've been delving back into the olden days.

440
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:52,340
Ancient hours of slack and, uh, and shows that were more than an hour, but yet so, so

441
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,760
much less than a show.

442
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,720
It's in your head.

443
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,800
It's in your head.

444
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:56,920


445
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:57,360


446
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,520
Huh.

447
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,580
That's a bit scary.

448
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,500
He saw the pipe.

449
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,860
These are scary thoughts.

450
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:08,340
On the run producers often insert a picture of Dobbs into their movies subliminally at

451
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,960
high speeds to induce uneasiness and tension in the viewers.

452
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,700
You get the feeling of having seen his face in this movie, but you can't quite tell exactly

453
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,260
where.

454
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,940
My friends, these are scary thoughts for this hour.

455
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,780
He was just a salesman.

456
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,520
That's why Bob is left in his own private spaceship to go to Mars.

457
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,400
Bob's gone for help.

458
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,420
And we need dollars.

459
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,440
Dr. Brady is going into a trance now.

460
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,380
It's not a taste to communicate with him.

461
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,060
Now Dr. Brady has the electric telephone.

462
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,480
All this for the great distances that we call out of space.

463
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:40,540
Dr. Rex is going crazy.

464
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,120
Oh, he got all sleepy and fell down into the octis, but I'll light him up.

465
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,480
Sorry, you gotta go to another caller.

466
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,700
Okay, destroy the caller.

467
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,940
Yeah, why'd you do that to Roy Rogers anyway?

468
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,240
Huh?

469
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,520
Okay, we figured out that at least 80% of everything you ever made is going to be taken

470
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,400
by the people in this room.

471
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:53,500
Okay, 800 trips.

472
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:53,800
I took 800 trips.

473
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,080
It's all right.

474
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,080
It's a distance from the satellite to the Earth.

475
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,080
And no one's gonna understand.

476
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,780
I'm not a very, uh...

477
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,420
You're on air all you say.

478
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:58,460
I'm gonna tell you a story.

479
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,340
Can you guess what happens when that happens?

480
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,260
They just kill the caller.

481
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,060
I mean every week.

482
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,520
You know, it's always the same.

483
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,120
It's impossible to really get direction.

484
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,600
You start it now and start it.

485
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,020
The friends are all arguing about who's abused the most.

486
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,340
Okay, so anyway, you know, they're trying to signal from the other side of

487
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:10,560
the Earth.

488
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:10,980
It doesn't matter.

489
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,980
You can't hear anything.

490
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,520
I mean the slide show from Jehovah starts now and the music fades in, and I'll put

491
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,360
back the sound effects, and we start the show over and over again.

492
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,640
Very well, welcome.

493
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:27,820
You know, I'm sorry to have to preach so much this week, but you see I'm a called

494
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:28,400
man.

495
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,260
of that man J.R. Bob Dobbs.

496
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,920
And that doesn't mean I'm against

497
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:38,060
better connected saviors like Jesus or Muhammad or Elvis.

498
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,700
Because believe me, J.R. Bob Dobbs

499
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,580
has broken bread with Jesus.

500
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,840
He's smoked frop with Muhammad.

501
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,620
He sung backup vocals for Elvis.

502
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,120
He drove the limousine for John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

503
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:56,300
He shined the shoes of Martin Luther King.

504
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,940
He partied with Jimi Hendrix.

505
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,140
And he gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

506
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,200
to Lenny Bruce, vainly.

507
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,200
He sold insurance to the Buddha.

508
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:12,280
And he gave Marilyn Monroe the best time of her life.

509
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,180
Life, life, my friends.

510
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,420
You can kill us for preaching life,

511
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,960
but by gobs, that's all we're preaching.

512
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,780
That's all!

513
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,280
Your rituals and your rituals.

514
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,560
And hymns and prayers are nothing but brain support systems

515
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,880
for something of yours far more valuable to God

516
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,820
than all that rigamarole.

517
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,280
Your life and your sanity,

518
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,600
to appreciate it for what it is.

519
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,420
And if you can truly do that,

520
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,920
if you can really, really appreciate

521
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,160
what it means to be alive and sentient as you are,

522
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,080
no matter the pain,

523
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,840
then you have gained riches beyond measure.

524
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,900
For free.

525
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,080
For free!

526
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,260
The greatest gift for nothing.

527
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,400
Something, my friends, something for nothing.

528
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,540
Bob's promise rings true.

529
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,320
Life as life.

530
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,180
Life.

531
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,420
Life as life.

532
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,100
Life

533
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,060
Life is life

534
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,780
When we all give the power

535
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,160
We all give the best

536
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,680
Every minute in the hour

537
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,260
We don't think about the rest

538
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,920
And we all get the power

539
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,440
We all get the best

540
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,240
When everyone gives everything

541
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,820
Then everyone, everything will get

542
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,160
Life

543
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,700
Life is life

544
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:40,700
Life

545
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,100

Life is life

547
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,940
When we all feel the power

548
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,380
Life is life

549
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,000
When we all feel the pain

550
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,480
Life is life

551
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,220
It's the feeling of the people

552
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,600
Life is life

553
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,460
It's the feeling of the land

554
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,340
When we all give the power

555
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,880
We all give the best

556
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,380
Every minute in the hour

557
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,920
We don't think about the rest

558
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,660
When we all give the power

559
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,200
We all give the best

560
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,860
And everyone gives everything

561
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,480
And every soul

562
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,480
Every one will see

563
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,660
Life

564
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,380
Life is life

565
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,400
Life

566
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,660
Life is life

567
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,820
Life!

568
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:29,480
P.O. Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214

569
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:36,920
That's P.O. Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214

570
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,440
We're glad that it's over

571
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,920
We thought it would last

572
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,680
Every minute of the future

573
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,440
Is a memory of the past

574
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,740
Because we gave of the power

575
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,220
We gave of the best

576
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,540
And everyone lost

577
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,720
Lost everything and perished

578
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,220
With the rest

579
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,400
Life

580
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,640

Life is life

595
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:18,060
Life is our Life

596
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,600

We have to learn

632
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,580
We are in control

633
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,600
And we are more than a band

634
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,980

You can tell by my accent, right?

661
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,440
Seven, five, two, one, four.

662
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:34,920
What?

663
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,000
Oh God.

664
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:51,520
This background music Nen's Losense was such a relief, I guess, from that barrage of crazy,

665
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,040
live things.

666
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,920
Well, we've only got a few minutes left in the show.

667
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,820
I'm going to go ahead and put on one more store-bought tune here, friends,

668
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,500
except that, once again, it's not store-bought.

669
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:09,620
This is from a bootleg called Studio Haze, and it's a beautiful thing.

670
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:53,100
This is a bootleg called Studio Haze.

671

00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:24,040


684
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,840
In fact, if you see a school bus, speed up.

685
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,780
You never know what you're gonna score.

686
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,240
Hey, there's Huffcum, the sound effects.

687
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,340
And we start the show over and over again.

688
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,080
Good welcome to the Oh, Half Science.

Washtes a box tabii.

690
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,740
If you take an apartment...

691
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:46,520
We've got a yard man and we've got a mower man.

692
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,680
Yeah, wake up to the yard man and the mower man.

693
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:53,400
The capacity should be accepted by the dubious.

694
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:54,760
Ah, yes.

695
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,860
We recommend concurrent...

696
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,940
The Dobbs Town prisoners are lined up.

697
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:04,080
The people that still refuse to give up their old religions

698
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,460
and join subgenius are herded here into the pits.

699
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,300
There's slacks taken from them, and they're lined up.

700
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,360
Seven, this is Cape.

701
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,580
The weather and the recovery area is...
