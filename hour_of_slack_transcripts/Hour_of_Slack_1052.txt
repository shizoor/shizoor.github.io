Let's hear the story of how one man developed a taste for beer.
Oh, but I, uh, well, I, uh, I'd heard many good things about beer and had always planned to try it.
So, try it I did.
There's a certain relative who introduced me to beer, and I still detest him for it.
It was just about then that he brought in the beer.
I hope you won't mind if we waste the evening tasting this beer, a beer that made me famous.
One, two...
Beer.
Beaver, God knows you're lying.
Oh, yeah?
Well, no.
How?
Oh, because God knows everything.
He sees everything.
Are you kidding?
You know what happens to boys who tell lies?
Yes, ma'am.
You know you're going to have to be punished, don't you?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, what do you think a fair punishment would be?
Uh...
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.
And I'm going to be miserable.
I'm going to be miserable all evening.
I don't care how miserable you are, you're going to enjoy it.
Yes, well...
What you are in your inmost being escapes your examination in rather the same way that you can't look directly into your own eyes without using a mirror.
You can't bite your own teeth.
You can't taste your own tongue.
And you can't touch the tip of this finger.
With...
With the tip of this finger.
And that's why there's always an element of profound mystery.
Something sets off the notion of a bird.
Maybe you're thinking of a skylark you saw yesterday.
Or maybe you have a feeling of wanting to fly away.
The idea of bird includes all sorts of sub-ideas branching off,
even in normal consciousness,
such as flying, flight, wings, and tail.
In the expanded or hypomanic mind, there are two things happening.
Thoughts are speeded up in time, more ideas per minute, and expanded in space, more ideas at once.
While thinking of a bird in this state, one might also have a sense of airplanes, rudders, ostrich, robin redbreast, blue jay, or even a bird.

r Minute 3.
r Christmas Christmas s noch ganz schön.
pff pff.
Friends, that piece was by Reverend Phineas Narco of National Cynical Radio.
And you can get all of that at nationalcynical.com.
National Cynical being one word, which I highly recommend if you recognize the value of your Slack.
You can easily see why it's your most valuable asset.
Slack puts our children through school.
We plan for their college education and expectation of Slack power and income.
Slack buys the vacations we sometimes take.
As long as Slack continues, we can meet our financial obligations and maintain the happiness, peace of mind, and security of our families.
No wonder our Slack is far more valuable than our home, our automobile, and all the material things we own.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
This is your old, old friend and prayer partner, Reverend.
Reverend Ivan Stang, recording this only two weeks before the event that we call 9X Day.
The huge celebration of the end of the world that we subgeniuses hold.
So far, every year, unfortunately, at a clothing optional campground deep in Amish country.
And this year, friends, this might really be the year.
Because if you'll look at the...
...website, you'll see that the...
...the Exist portal, my friends, is set to open on schedule.
There are two great red spots on the planet Jupiter, you see.
You've heard of the great red spot.
There's also one, and I'm not kidding now, called Red Junior, a smaller one,
which is moving towards the large one, the great red spot, and they are due to collide.
Or whatever they're going to do on July 4th of this year, which the conspiracy calls 2006.
Yes, friends, and so the great storms of Jupiter will converge on July 4th with unknown results,
or perhaps not so unknown, for this could be no less than the great conjunction predicted in pre-scriptures
when the 10 million monoliths emerge from the center of Jupiter.
And so the great storm will be the first of the vortex of the great storm in pairs, crisscrossed, to form Exist.
And that, friends, shall be our cue.
And we shall arise, my mutant friends.
You'll notice, by the way, that July 5th lands on a Wednesday this year,
and we pray that you don't pink out, my friend.
Because think about it.
Ex Day is your only religious holiday.
Ah, yes.
Yes.
By the way, is the Billy Mayer show.
They will be performing at 9 Ex Day.
We managed to finish the new subgenius book, the subgenius cyclopedia of slack,
the Bobliagraphon, before the world ended.
But it probably won't be in bookstores until after the world's ended, so it's kind of a moot point.
Makes for a great PDF file, though.
Anyway, friends, although you might think that,
with we cultists expecting the world to end on July 5th,
that we'd blow everything off.
But ironically enough, we're pretty busy preparing to properly host the huge send-off party.
Ah, yes.
And it's true that, you know, we've expected to leave this doomed planet every year for nine years now.
And the positive thing about that is that we've built up lots of practice for the world ending.
Also, we've...
Built up lots of really bizarre documentary film and audio collections.
And in fact, this hour of slack, number 1052,
will mostly be the soundtrack of an unreleased DVD.
It's actually a pretty good film about the 7 Ex Day drill of 2004.
But two of the breasts featured in it got cold feet, so to speak.
And I can't release it until I...
Remove the breasts.
So as you listen to this soundtrack, friends,
just imagine that the speakers of all the female voices that you hear have their shirts off.
This, by the way, is the Ex Day drill,
where the photos on the internet cause so much trouble for the young mom, Reverend Magdalene.
And, uh...
Ah, yes.
Uh...
Next week's actual 9 Ex Day drill will feature many of the same famous subgenius participants you'll hear,
including Reverend Magdalene,
Jesus,
Dr. Howell,
Dr. Philodrum,
Reverend Nikki Deathchick,
Reverend Carter LeBlanc,
Reverend Alex,
the amino acids, dear friends.
We're about to hear lots of cuts of them live.
And also, the Billy Nair Show.
Heard again.
In the background, this is from their soundtrack album for The American Astronaut, a great film.
And now together, friends, let's imagine the 7 Ex Day uncensored video.
This one's a keeper.
Ah!
Ah!
So, hi.
Just to bow our heads for a moment.
Turned up, served a moment of, uh, great deed.
Uh, honorable, sacred...
NOOOOOO!
PRAISE BO!
PRAISE BO!
PART! SUCKER! FUN!
You can beat the conspiracy with their own bullshit.
PRAISE BO!
PRAISE BO!
You take their bullshit, repackage it,
slap a Harley Davidson sticker on it, and the conspiracy will buy it back from you.
Because this man smiles, cause he knows that he's a good guy.

He knows how the conspiracy works.
He's trying to teach us how it works.
Through the teachings of Bob, we can overcome the conspiracy and sell him the own shit.
Friends, the life is the money, and I mean the blood, er, well, money and the blood and the slack,
and the life all mixed together with the sperm and blood on the stage of the Ex Day, the Bible in Brushwood.
No parking except for Bob.
You're all married now.
You're all married now.
You're holy men, and we can say that.
Although also, I might add, that by virtue of the fact that I'm a holy man,
I now declare that you may, as of this moment on, do anything that you want.
Concentrated Guru Pee.
This is dried Guru Pee that we burn.
We burn this Guru Pee, and it oxidizes into our mucous membranes.
And we imbibe the wisdom of the Gurus through this.
Is that what makes your nostril hairs grow?
Yeah.
So good.
So good.
Am I sexy?
We'll know.
But only when you will know.
As Bob said, I dare you to challenge my taunt.
And so?
The dark side has won.
And evil has triumphed in the form of a tiny gene.
Yes, a rapacious, greedy gene that Dr. Moreau failed to remove.
A gene, a tiny code made of simple chemicals, basic chemicals, common to all life, all over the universe.
Amino acids, they're called.
Yes, they exist in space.
In fragmented, distorted, mutated, other things.
They are in the form of a deadly, rude, foul-smelling form, such as seen here.
Forms pleasing to the human eye, and others which we would consider monstrous.
Remember, to them, maybe we're the monsters.
Heavy, isn't it?
Yes, they are.
And if there is an X-day, then that means it's a day of destruction.
Yes, it's a day of destruction.
And if there is a day of destruction, then it's a day of destruction.




And if there is a day of destruction, then it's a day of destruction.

Man, I just got Diane Arbus, eat your heart out.
David Lynch, go home.
Kind of kick a little something past you for the G's and make a few friends as I breeze through.
You know, it's two in the morning and the party's still jumping.
And because my old lady ain't home.
The bitch is in the living room and getting it on, and they ain't leaving until 6 in the morning.
What you want to do?
I got a pocket full of rubbers, and my homeboys do, too.
I'm a trap, this is a trap, and you're going to make me pay for this.

I am sexy. I am straight. I am gay. I am bi. I am boy. I am girl. I am child. I am adult.
I am woman. I am man. I am softcore. I am hardcore. I am independent. I am dependent.
I am disabled. I am evil. I am God. I am the devil. I am nothing. I am everything.
I am power. I am weakness. I am a galaxy. I am the universe.
Good evening. I am little Theodore. And this is my lovely assistant Babushka.
And we've got some ruminations
about our time on this slackless rock before we leave it.
Get up out of bed. Sour on my head.
Drinking down a cup. Trying to wake up.
Driving up the town. Feeling like a clown.
Some guy's in my lane. Heard a bullet through his window pane.
Pulling to the lot. God damn bosses got my favorite spot.
Greeting everyone.
Ch세� Center and Twitter
Trying to act trying to act dumb.
I don't feel I'm here.
But then of course the question isn't where?
People are all going blurr.
I'm plagued by what breaks out.
It's become what my life's all about.
I had the match.
I was young and grown.














I wouldn't have to do this
If I had the map
I wouldn't have to do this
If I had the map
You too can be little Theodore in this jacket.
Just look at it.
The casual man about town elegance
the insouciance
the pretty amazing really
and this pinnacle of fashion sensibility
is being offered right here
if you have the smarts to go for this item.
I'm opening the bid at one single dollar.
Do we hear more than one dollar for the jacket
that contains the heaving torso of Louis Vuitton?
Two dollars!
Everybody put your finger in your nose!
Pick a booger out and wipe it on your clothes
I don't know how you feel one way or another
Makes you feel happy then wipe it on your brother
But if you get taste, you won't Clark.
Da dum bop, da dum bop
No matter the temptation, I don't care what they think
I'd rather be some genius than wind up pink
Cause Bob still gives me gumption
and Connie flips my crown
and I'm not about to let them bastards
get me down
Da dum dum dum
But you know when you try to think about your own mind,
It almost always backfires because there's one thing far more powerful than your mind
You can try to do the right thing by analyzing your own motives and all that kind of thing, but ultimately
Something will win the ego
Yes, your ego is so much smarter than your brain will ever be that it fools your brain into thinking that it's got the upper
Hand uh-huh. Oh, yes, sir. But in the bottom line is you're always going well here in my own little world
I know I'm not really in my own little world. I've really got my act together
In my own little world friends ain't it wonderful to pull the wool over your own eyes then you can go wow
I still can't see but at least it's my own wool
But at least I know it that's important I don't think you do know it though
No, I do. Do you know you're an asshole?
I'm trying to tell you that you don't really know you're an asshole and you just think that pretending to be an asshole is funny
Well, maybe you're right really when it when it's how is the difference between somebody who's really an asshole and somebody's pretending to be an asshole
Maybe I don't really know the depths of my own assholiness. Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you man as your friend
I have not even I mean to the extent that I have been an asshole for
Thousands of years. I've never actually refined it to the true art form that I have
Perfectly all the capabilities of doing and he's already forgotten how the sentence started
He's guessing how I started
You can't even remember what he's looking at so don't need to remember because they can just ramble ramble ramble ramble
They don't mean to and yet maybe deep inside they do mean to because that is what they are
So where's my frog stay go with it stay
Where's my frog man?
You're you want that award again, don't you the hey staying a little hey staying?
Hey staying
See my butt plug staying
you
. Yes, we could be on in fundamentalism, and the food fundamentalism and friends
But best of all we put the Ha in hate
That's a new bumper sticker for you we put the Ha in hate
Yes, and in fact, we also put the very
low in love, we can take a soaring emotion like love and just make it low and big, wallowing
sex. That's true love, folks.
But certainly we all feel it, that inner vibe, that creepy little conspiracy pill that all of us have managed to swallow that keeps us from enjoying the high brow along with the low brow, that keeps us from enjoying the slack along with the anti-slack.
And friends, if you think there isn't anti-slack at Brushwood, well, they've got you by the balls.
Folks,
I

am a little trout yanking them out and bringing them down here.
That's what we do, ladies and gentlemen.
Boy, if that isn't what religions are about.
Try and grab that conformity that they've widened into your hips
through some subliminal way.

And try and rip it out.
Try and rip it right out.
Just like you would, you know, chuck off a load every now and then.
Next time you masturbate, be it male or female, masturbation, I don't rightly care.
The next time you do it, imagine that angry hate on.
It's this, it's the pole going in the hole.
I now pronounce you man and or object and wife and or object for the next 24 hours.
Now you must kiss very hard.
Wow, that's awesome.
This is the first time anybody's ever really done that.
Just tell people to do it.
Shut up.
You are now duly authorized and excused for sexual couplings of any perversion.
You are now the first unspeakable kind for a period of 24 hours.
Everybody's fucking.
So many people fucking.
Are dead and wild.
And I'm not.
And I'm not.
Glad that I'm not.
Fucking.
Oh shit.

The next time you do it, imagine that angry hate on.
It's this, it's the pole going in the hole.
I now pronounce you man and or object for the next 24 hours.
I know.
That's what everybody's fucking.
And I'm not.
Can't I just say something.

I present to you a great man, Dr. Howe.
The Keeper of Church Secrets.
It is important, as Bob embraces Connie and the knowledgeable subgenius must endure, indulge in, and withstand the embrace of the conspiracy,
that we explore the viewpoint of the opposite sex by being that person and letting our inner nature come forth.
Satan or pornography, how often we hear them linked, going hand in hand or tail in tail.
But look at this fabulous outfit, the stockings, the sandals, and the matching handbag.
She is really gone all out to appear before us today.
Ladies and gentlemen, give her a round of applause, please.
My name is Helga and I want to have intercourse with your eyeball.
Ah, yes, the eye socket to me theme.
Well, that was short, that was expressive.
Who else?
You may have seen the Miss America contest.
They always ask the girls, you know, what are your plans?
And they always say they want to work with troubled children or be a brain surgeon.
Or unless they lose, where they get to be a stripper.
And now we have, I'm not certain I know the name of your identity.
You better tell us.
Philomena.
Philomena Drummond.
And she is just as cute as a June bug, as they say.
A little simpering perhaps, but in the spirit of things, certainly.
Philomena, how is your subgenius nature improved by your new identity?
That's all right.
I'm not sure.




I have a question, Dr. Al.
Well, I didn't mean to ask a hard one.
Perhaps I should ask an easy one.
Does this make you love Bob all the more?
Oh, yes.
My love for Bob is just boundless.
I thought it would be somehow.
What's it like to be an overwoman?
Yes, what's it like to be an overwoman for a change?
I just don't know.
It's silly or something.
I don't know.
Well, he's just flowing with the spirit of Bob.
He gives Bob.
Yeah.
She throws him off camels and he goes out and grabs Bob's back.

I don't know, but I feel the same, and that's what i'm not asusion to as it is.
One of my friends said it was a long time when I had passed.
Well, stopped fortunate, and had love for Bob.
She's an overwoman, you see.
I am中國, and I just enjoyed myself.


I think that's the problem.
No, not at all.
The're two of us that worked long, long fields to create sugar.
I wanted to have everyone's mark.
This is a

Well, just for what we do, it's one.
Those who call themselves my friends.
The thing is, of course, I've chosen my outfit
because this is the standard outfit for one of the brides of Christ.
And many of you don't really realize, but, you know,
this little bib, like accoutrement that nuns wear,
do you know what it's for?
It's called a wimple, is it not?
It is.
No.
This is to wipe your lips after you've eaten the body of Christ.
Share the load!
There you are.
After the transubstantiation of the host, as it were.
Here's someone who appears to be a devotee of America's national pastimes.
Yeah!
Woo!
Go, ladies!
Yeah!
Just so you all know, I am a pitcher and not a catcher.
Yeah!
An important distinction.
Yeah, baby!
I lost my drugs twice today.
Twice today.
If it weren't for the power of Bob and the love of subgenii,
I would be fropless.
I lost my frock twice.
And why?
And why?
Drugs.
Because the frock took your mind.
No, it wasn't a frock.
It was a false drug.
It was not.
It was the false marijuana.
Oh.
This stuff here.
It was not frock.
That's why it took my mind.
It's false drugs.
You don't want to smoke it.
It made me throw my sunglasses in the fire.
It made you lose your other false drugs.
It made me lose my real false drugs twice.
Not once, but twice.
Come on now!
Let's all take some vascular!
The Christians have landed.
The minds expanded.
The indefatigable being.
A subgenius.
Nothing else like it.
Don't expect this shit.
Look at what they get.
Spiling out.
In all directions.
In the race of science.
In the race of science.

Around us.
Friends, if you've got to buy a pack of lies, you may as well get it by the crate.
And you just might find in that crate, the true lies.
The true lies.
The lies that are truer than the truth itself.
Friends, buy bulk.
Buy Bob.
And he smiles because we know that we can destroy the conspiracy ourselves.
From the inside.
We can infiltrate the conspiracy through its schools.
With the help of the
This is something that I know all of you will be in tune to.
And probably there will be a rush when I explain what this is all about.
What this is all about.
when God becomes a drug.
Now this one teaches you how to break the chains of religious addiction and abuse.
Those of you that have been in the Church of the Subgenius
are experienced in this particular perversion.
Father Leo Booth has poured out his soul and his heart.
Mascots often become super salesmen.
Look at that.
I just popped it open, picked it, proved it. There it is.
Praise God! Praise God! Praise God! Praise God!
We gonna do the St. Latha Latha murah!
Praise God! Praise!
Praise to Love!
A lot of people die, they have to have work today.
I want to be Bob, or eternity can play.
I want to be Jesus, or eternity can come.
I want to be Jesus, or eternity can come.
I want to be Bob, I want to be Bob.
I want to be Bob, I want to be Bob.
But his eyes grew dim, and his ears dull,
and the skin grew.
He grew yellow on his old skull.
Through his bony claw with a pale sheen,
the stony jewels slipped unseen.
No feet he heard, though the earth shaped,
when the young dragon his thirst slaked.
The stream smoked at his dark door,
the flames hissed on the dank floor.
And he died alone in the red fire.
His bones were ashes in the hot mire.
And now he leads us to be his accordion.

masters these are the original teeth of the artist and although I would be the first you could not
get any closer to the actual artist than the lungs or the brain the puzzling evidence may not be hope
to offer those soon but these are like a saint's relics in value that is exactly right all the

after you edit it down yeah and do a lot of work it'll look really great but really it's gonna look
super cheesy so uh this guy's he's been going around claiming to be king of the subgeniuses
I don't know about that man I think uh I think that maybe there should be a judgment

crackhead is raped and pillaged he's actually stolen all of your cars raped all of your
daughters
and your wives and your moms and your dads or you can you can either crucify him or as they used to
do in ancient America you can instead crucify this guy who talks about peace all the time and smokes

Oh wait, no, Frankenstein's monster destroys Frankenstein.
I guess some of us are in trouble.
Well, looks like some of the goddesses have arrived from space.
Oh, she acts like she doesn't want it, but she does.
I know that they all do.
I know they all want it.
They all, all of y'all girls want it.
I know that they all want it.
I know that they all want it.
Every year, the Exodus actually did rupture us, but they just take a little bit at a time.
They took P. Kitty's, uh,
insulin, and they took my memory.
They took several people's morals and values.
Jesus' hair!
Huh? Yeah, they, uh,
Sid Fulton's hair.
You know, it's sad.
I mean, bits and pieces of us falling off Wellman's teeth.
All those things are on the escape vessels, and, uh,
so, I guess we'll get them all back eventually.
Here's one part I've been so anxious about.
I'm anxious to see if you have no more.
And every year I come here, and I come here believing.
Not just wanting to believe, I come here believing the saucers will arrive.
July 5th, 7 a.m.
The saucers are gonna be here.
We're gonna be swept up.
We're gonna be caught up.
We're gonna be...
sucked into the, the, the conceptual, uh,
uh, orpuses of, of
pan-galactic, uh, uber-thought beings.
Projections that will gratify our every urge.
We're, we're gonna be, we're gonna be taken away from all this shit.
It's gonna finally happen in every single year.
I don't even fucking get up at 7 a.m.
Because, you know what?
I know in my gut they didn't make it.
Again.
And what happens?
I have
become utterly disillusioned.
I walk away from this going, you know, that was a hell of a party, but
God damn it, we didn't get the saucers.
And, and, and I find myself struggling with this.
I, I, so how can I, how can I continue to involve myself in an organization that continually lets me down?
It's not like I get sex from the church, you know?
It's not like I get cunning from the church.
It's not like I get friends from the, well, okay, actually, I, I have that.
I've grabbed in a lot of friends of us.
But regardless, the, the thing is, is there's this issue of doubt.
There's this, why am I doing this?
Why am I putting myself through this?
And, and, and, and why, why do I even waste my time with this?
And, and the thing is, is that's a gift.
That's a gift.
Because, I mean, ask, ask Heisenberg.
Ask Goodell.
Ask Schrodinger.
Ask fucking Einstein.
The universe floats in a haze of quantum indeterminacy.
That means that you will never know.
Because it just might not work out that way.
It's called, it's called relativity.
It's called improbability.
It's called, you know, it's, it's called slack.
Because you know what?
You don't need to know.
Ba dum ba.
Ba dum ba.
The times they are changing.
And things are getting grim.
Ba dum ba.
Oh, ba dum ba.
The X's are remissing.
And our odds are getting slim.
Ba dum ba.
Ba dum ba.
Sure, I could give up and let my hopes go flat.
I really got to ask you though.
Hmm, where's the slack in that?
Bob, ba-dum, Bob.
I hate to say that.
I hate to question such a basic thing.
But we must question authority.
And the ultimate authority, there you go.
Somebody's been reading their prescriptures.
See, that's the problem with it.
You can talk about awareness and enlightenment and all that,
but how do you know you're not just the robot that's programmed
to tell all the other robots how programmed they are?
Who's programming robots?
I often get the impression, oh, well, you know,
they wound me up and sent me out there to tell them about Slack
and how to free themselves from being wound up.
Man.
Anyway.
I hadn't meant to go into that.
You know, but sometimes I question this thing.
You know, I thought the X's were going to arrive at some point sooner than this.
I mean, gosh.
X.
Torture is waking up on X day morning with the worst heartburn you've ever, ever had.
Absolutely the worst day ever.
Absolutely the worst day ever.
It was the worst day, obviously.
Fuck Bob.
Fuck X.
Stop the X torture.
I am beaten.
It is over.
University is over.
Why do you X torture me, Bob?
It was obviously the worst day.
Something special has been given to those people that lost faith.
You know, those people have been given a gift.
A gift called suspicion and disbelief.
You know, anytime any of those people that have walked away from the church and the sub-genius,
anytime they go to another religion or another spirituality or another form of self-indulgent,
you know, self-gratification that we like to think of as religion,
but it's just really justification for our actions.
Anytime somebody goes somewhere else to find something else somewhere inside their mind,
they're going to be thinking.
They're going to be thinking, is this just another scam?
Is this just somebody else making money off of me?
Is somebody else getting rich off of me?
Just like, just like when I gave all that money to the church of the sub-genius.
Those people have been given a gift.
It's called disbelief.
Now, once there was a little boy who wouldn't say his prayers.
And he was a little boy.
And when he went to bed at night,
away upstairs,
his mammy heard him holler.
And his daddy heard him bawl.
And when they turned the covers down,
he wasn't there at all.
And they searched him in the rafter room and cubbyhole and press.
They searched him up the chimney flue and everywhere, I guess.
But all they ever found was just his pants and roundabout and the goblins.
That's where's the psyche of the age boys and broads,

They'll get you if you don't watch ot.
And we'd be apples tweets and heard ton of Europape and and sun Pat conveys them and
tell people that gof and enjoyVA Ethan and aid in life ahadetotostanechip DD-USU three

a exact shit hot boy what he wouldn't make hair when he wasn't a hundred, whatever it
be, which I don't think family didn't say, right.
Though maybe there's no gods in huis around town.
But he was a man and moving around like the word free fly hook on the sensations of freak
Black things a-standin' at her side, and they snatched her through the ceiling, for she knew what she's about.
And the goblins will get you if you don't watch out.
