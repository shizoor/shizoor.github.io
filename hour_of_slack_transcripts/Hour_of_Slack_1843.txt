��
and we did a show by phone, just like in the good old days of 2020.
Also, all of the songs in this show are by Dave,
performed with Einstein's Secret Orchestra,
with Dave singing and playing guitar in all cases.
This show is recorded August 9th.
Is Lonesome Cowboy Dave still alive?
I wonder.
Let's call him and find out.
I hope.
Hello?
Dave!
Well, I called.
You said you beat me to it.
That's right, I beat you to the pulpit.
Beat you to the pulpit.
You're praying for some pain.
After you went insane.
Well, should I start drilling in the microphone right now?
Yeah, that's part of your messed up brain.
I beat you to a pulpit after you go insane.
It's not your dirty mouth.
It's not your orals.
It's just your messed up brain.
See, that's it.
I made up a Dave type song.
Well, that's delicious.
It's like the little slices that they have at the Hungarian store of sliced up cow brains
or lamb brains, I guess.
Real thin.
It's almost like sushi and you can wear it as a hat.
Well, Dave Brains.
That's what I was going for.
Dave Brains.
Well, that's different.
You can't wear a hat to that.
The hat is already provided.
But, damn that's weird.
Well, what made you go insane you did?
in a different color and fashion.
Some people say it's too ludicrous to be held.
Well, how's your hat, Dave?
Well, I got some rain in the soup.
I had to take the potatoes out.
It was mashed up pretty good in there.
I froze up some cinnamon stick and gave it to my grandmother.
She showed me how to do the rest of it,
so I guess I could say it's all right.
Cool, man, cool.
I mean, it's cool sometimes.
It's hot here. It's so hot.
I don't want to go anywhere near the doorway or the airlock.
Yeah, it's 90-something here,
but it's 90-something humidity, too.
It's just making people just pass out like birds on a telephone wire.
Yep, yep.
That's why I'm in here calling Lonesome Cowboy Dave on the phone.
Well, you have actual...
It's a sedentary breakfast, don't you?
I mean, air conditioning.
Yeah.
Yeah, our airlock is still functional.
That's good.
Yeah, I had to repair it a lot with snot and scotch tape and stuff.
They normally work pretty good.
Scott and snot tapes.
But, yeah, yeah.
I'm sorry, I was just going to say,
I was wondering if Princess We Are Doe had her gums removed or something.
She said she had a hard time finding things
because they put some articles in there that something, I don't know.
Yeah, she did.
She had her gums removed today.
In fact, she's still not home yet from the dental mental hospital.
Ah.
Yeah, she had gum all over her hair
and, you know,
just stuck in every little crevice.
And so she had to go get her gums removed.
But they did it with lasers.
They do it with lasers now.
They don't have to surgically peel it all,
scrape it off with scalpels
and peel your skin off and everything.
They just, they shoot a laser at you.
It still peels your skin off,
but they don't have to use a knife.
It's easier for them.
It doesn't make it easier for the patient.
Oh, no, of course not.
But it's easier for the insurance company
and the...
you know, the nurses and stuff.
I noticed when you go,
when you go in the dentist's office,
everybody has to wear a face mask
except you,
the patient,
or me, the patient.
And it's not fair
because there's all these pretty dental assistant ladies
that you want to be able to recognize them
in the supermarket later.
But you won't
because they have masks on,
but they can recognize me.
Except that when I go to the supermarket,
I still wear a mask.
Even now.
Even today,
and with the Lambda Delta Beta virus going around,
I still wear the mask.
Yeah, I thought that was a fraternity
when I first heard about it.
I mainly do it just to tick off the others.
I'll refrain from using the term
ignorant rednecks.
Yeah.
Don't do that because...
Well, do do that because
it'll make it much easier later
to recognize the bodies when they're
trying to, you know,
get the motorcycles going again.
Yeah, I know.
But I...
I don't think many of these women
who have to wear a mask
wouldn't want you to see them drooling
in their pants or their
hard pickle or their, you know,
suitable escapes of whatever kind they had.
Well, you know,
I hadn't really thought about that.
I guess that just like those pretty ladies,
I could drool all I wanted behind my mask
and nobody would be the wiser or the wetter.
Yeah.
I retrograded mine.
I put, like, a bunch of fur on it.
Pasted some fur on there.
It's like a portable beard and mask.
It works both ways.
That's what I...
Because I've been feeling kind of...
Funny, you know, I have this goatee
and the mask doesn't quite cover it.
And I figured, well, the germs are crawling in
through the hairs underneath the mask.
And if I glued more hair onto the inside of the mask,
that would form a sort of a baleen type of barrier.
Yeah, and then you would know...
Keep the bad germs out,
but I could still eat the good germs.
Yeah.
That I live on, the phytoplankton,
if there's any left after this heat wave
in the ocean.
So you think he's going to...
Until the phytoplankton in the oceans
is going to be so bad?
Oh, they've already...
They've announced that they've already done the funerals.
Billions and billions of tiny funerals
have already been enacted
because all the microbes in the ocean are...
They died yesterday,
and now the slightly larger krill are hungry.
And then the fish and whales are going to get hungry.
And then pretty soon,
the fishermen are going to get hungry.
And then the landlubbers
will have to spend a lot more
for a can of tuna fish with dolphin in it.
Yeah.
And, you know, I'm glad that we're both so old that...
Well, actually, you know, the funny thing is,
I thought that I was going to die before the planet did,
but now I'm not so sure.
It's...
Yep.
The snowball's kind of rolling through hell all over again.
It's melting fast.
Yeah.
I was wondering when the calling hours are going to be.
Or if anybody's going to call them anyway.
Well, the Lord's going to call us all home.
To call them B.
I just want to...
I was hoping to avoid seeing the whole rest of the ecosystem
get called home at the same time.
Yeah, that's going to be another very pretty sight, I'm afraid.
Right.
I was thinking, well, too bad about my grandsons
and possibly my children.
But now I'm starting to...
Damn.
I'm probably going to live to see that stuff.
Darn it.
What they're probably going to do is a retrofusion
on the last 500 years.
And you know they're going to charge double for tickets.
Oh, amazing.
Yeah, to watch yourself die.
Because that's the way them are.
That's they for you.
Thame.
Thame.
Hate Thame.
Yep.
But it doesn't do you any good to hate.
It doesn't do you any good at all.
But it's a tasty word still that you can use
in many elaborate situations.
Like if you want to impress the congressman,
get some money to clean up the phytoplankton.
You can't just...
You can't just...
Whatever I just said.
Right.
Whatever you said, you can't do that anymore.
No.
It's verboten.
Yep.
Oh, boy.
Actually, the funny thing is,
where I am in North Texas,
well, we're under a heat advisory,
but that's normal here for this time of year.
It's everybody else in the country
that's getting the really, really strange,
bizarre Texas weather.
Well, they were saying you can see the stuff in the sky
from the wildfires and stuff
as far east as New Jersey.
And I thought that was silly
until I looked out and asked,
the skies look all hazy.
Oh, yeah.
And I asked somebody if that's it.
And they said, that's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
When I look at the hills,
they're very, very hazy now,
kind of orangey.
The sunsets are pretty,
and my lungs are infected
with the toxins from the burning appliances
and homes of the Californians.
Yeah.
I mean, I've really noticed my...
I get...
I get bad enough allergies
living in this cedar forest,
but now it's pollen plus burning plastic
in minute quantities,
but it doesn't take much.
Hell no.
You know, to make you snot and sneeze
and hock up loogies, lungers, and bungers.
Yeah.
Or not be able to and fiercely want to.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a sad thing,
but I suppose it's...
Sadder things happening all at once,
so we shouldn't have to worry about it too much.
Just get under the old pillow
and pull down the bed
and just repartee
like there was nothing going on.
You know?
That's actually a good idea.
As soon as we hang up,
I'm going to go do that.
I'm going to go to bed,
pull the covers up over my head,
shrivel up,
and cower and tremble.
Yeah.
Until I go to...
Until you go to bed.
I know.


I like the trembling part, you know?
Well, it's as close to sex
as I ever get anymore at my age,
I'll tell you.
Well...
Yeah.
You know, I mean...
It's good.
But hey, hey,
trembling beats nothing.
It's good for making milkshakes.
You just put the milk and the chocolate
and the ice cream in there
and just shake away.
Yep.
And within a few hundred hours or more,
you've got a beautiful, delightful milkshake.
Right, you can use your fear to save on electric bills.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Or your palsy, you know, fear, palsy, whatever.
All those things that make old people quiver uncontrollably and spew.
I think it's because their underpants are too tight.
You know, the people in these lounges, what do you call them, lounges?
You know, where people are kept in solitude until they get older and die?
Well, those nurses that come around and so dutifully pull down the underpants and replace them,
they don't do such a good job all the time, especially when they're paid off, you know what I mean?
Well, yes, sometimes the man pays them off to humiliate the old elders and old people, helpless.
At least the old woman just, yeah.
At least the old woman just said it for a pleasure.
Speaking of old women, the old woman just came home.
Are you making a show of these?
Yeah, I'm making a show.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now, see, here comes that box of...
Oh, and I have to make a pit stop before I can.
Remember, I've just been on the road for a while. I'll be back.
She has to make a pit stop because of her pits.
Well, you know, you live close enough to California, you're bound to get some pits once in a while.
Yeah.
Fort Pitt. Remember Fort Pitt? They named Pittsburgh after that.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Yeah.
Pittsburgh is kind of like American for Pittsburgh, isn't it?
I don't know. I didn't see an H on the end of it. I saw a couple of X's.
So I got confused and I asked the witch doctor.
Don't ask which one.
I asked the witch doctor.
At the police station, he told me everything was off until next year.
I said, man, I'm just trying to find an etymology of some snakes, some animals.
And, you know, where does the word Pittsburgh come from?
Because Detroit, we know, was formerly under French rule until the American Indian...
What's it called? Wars.
French and Indian wars.
The French Indians probably pronounced it Detroit.
Yeah, Detroit.
Because they don't use the T. They just waste it.
Yeah, it's just wasted.
And Fort Pitt, that used to be... What was the name of that place?
Oh, Duquesne, which was also a bottled beer in the 1940s.
Hey, speaking of French Indians, I heard that in Cleveland,
they changed the name of the baseball team to Guardians of the Galaxy or something like that.
Yeah, isn't that ridiculous?
They're not called the Redskins or whatever they were.
They're the Braves, the Powwows.
And the local Native American organization said,
you know, we've been doing this for a year, but there's no negative onus with it.
Why don't you just call yourself the tribe?
Because we go along with that, too, and we even play drums at halftime.
Instead, you come up with some ridiculous, you know, game-sounding name,
or maybe it sounds like a European soccer team, you know.
Yeah, but if you call yourself the tribe, then the other tribe's going to go,
no, no, we're the tribe, so we're going to have to kill you.
Because everything's tribalism now, you know.
Yeah.
If you don't have the right totem pole in front of your house,
the other tribe will probably want to set your house on fire.
Except they won't need to, because it'll already be on fire from the climate change.
And the spare change, and small change.
I heard that it actually got into the triple digits,
1-0-something.
It was even higher than 1-0-something.
It might have been like 1-10 or something.
In British Columbia.
Actually, Dave, the oceans just off the coast of western Canada are dead zones now.
Yeah, it got real hot.
They're not used to seeing asphalt melt.
You know.
And they don't even know what air conditioners are up there.
Yeah.
So basically, everybody's already dead.
You might as well just, anybody you knew up there in the northwest, U.S. or Canada,
they're probably burned up by now.
Have you spoken to anyone before they died?
Did they what?
Have you spoken to any of the western Canadians and Oregonians and Washingtonians before they died?
Well, I'm not sure.
But at least they'll die clean because the water from the glaciers will be washing over them pretty soon.
There won't be any glaciers left, but there'll be plenty of water for a little while
flooding down from where the glaciers were about 10 seconds ago.
Yeah, I was wondering if that became gigantic tuna casserole, you know.
Yeah.
Of all those.
Well, it's funny.
It's happening even faster than doomsayers like me thought it would.
And I remember when this movie came out about 20 years ago called The Day After Tomorrow, I think that was it.
Yeah, something like that.
Climate Change Horror Movie.
And at the time, I thought, oh, this is ridiculous.
Look at this.
Suddenly, there's glaciers in New York and it only took five minutes.
Yeah.
Yeah.







And then it turns out that's exactly what I think I just just before I came downstairs here, I was glancing at the news.
And I think that that was what was going on.
The air froze in Manhattan and was creeping down, you know, freezing up in New Jersey.
And meanwhile, the the water was evaporating on in the West so fast that people were just shriveled up desiccated potato chips.
One minute they're fat and happy at McDonald's.
The next minute the heat wave hits and they're just crisp, crisp, crisp.
You know, like, you know.
Yeah.
And see, we're kind of in the middle in between the coast.
So it hadn't hit us yet or whatever is going to hit us and hit.
Well, that will be the dynamic thrash point between between you and the other sides of the continent.
That will be what causes the explosion.
And eventually your suborganic demise, not yours personally, but, you know, millions of people in that area.
Oh, well, I'd probably I'd probably be in that number, too.
I mean, I'm a person and I do have an airlock, but, you know, they only they're only good up to a temperature of about one hundred and eighty degrees Fahrenheit.
That should be a lot of fun.
Yeah.
Yeah.
One hundred and eighty plus.
I think I think it's about one hundred and fifty out there today.
The last time I looked.
But we're going to have we were going to have a cool spell next week where it would get down to the hundred and thirties.
Oh, geez.
Yeah.
Real funny.
Real funny.
Yeah.
So funny.
I forgot to laugh.
I remembered to.
I remembered to.

I remembered to laugh.
I.
You said Chernobyl was so long ago, nothing to worry about.
And I hear the news is John Geisinger Department of Energy, the Defense Department to start build a budget Chernobyl across the United States.
Now you're in the news.
It's not really over.
No.
All these people are dying.
It's all the pollution, it's getting into the water, it's getting into the aquifers
Everything goes, it's all one, it's all one
It's the distance between Kiev and Cleveland, no man, we're getting in tune
You'll make hearing
You know, then I started thinking
How come my movements are getting so...
...janky?
The iodine, a one three one
Has got my thyroid on the run
And the krypton, a eighty five
Is making it hard just to stay alive
But the iodine, a one three one
The iodine, a one three one
No more runnin' through the metal man's
No more boyhood in the mud
Power, power, power
Power's in the power's hands
Shake the bony hand, shake it good
The barium, a two four eight
This baby's sterile, I can't procreate
And plutonium, a two oh seven
So long folks, I'll see you in heaven
But the iodine, a one three one
The iodine
The iodine, a one three one
No more runnin' through the metal man's
No more barefoot in the mud
Shake the bony hand of the poison man
Shake the bony hand, shake it good
Inoculate, inoculate, inoculate, inoculate, inoculate
Salt is over two million known pollutants
That can cause cancer, pancreatitis, and I do see that
Bad breathing, you know that?
Bad breath, acne, what's the use?
The iodine, a one three one
Has got my thyroid on the run
And the krypton, a eighty five
He's makin' it hard just to stay alive
But the iodine, a one three one
The iodine, a one three one
No more runnin' through the metal man's
No more barefoot in the mud
Shake the bony hand of the poison man
Shake the bony hand, shake it good
No more runnin' through the metal man's
No more barefoot in the mud
Shake the bony hand of the poison man
Shake the bony hand, shake it good
Shake it
Shake it
Shake it.
Shake it.
I'm in love with you.
I'm in love with you.
Wow.
That's so exciting sometimes.
Yeah.
And.
Well, it can be frustrating, I'm sure,
especially when you're talking about albuming
and tricks automation,
automation, different, you know,
things that happen when the world is melting.
But now that we're talking about serious things,
like we just went to the bathroom,
what's the matter with your teeth and your gums,
you know, stuff like that,
then we don't have any problems
except for when we see the guy
who committed the crime in person.
Well, I'll be able to hear this on the recording later.
I'll be able to hear everything everyone says later
when there's just me in the room.
The headphones.
So your deafness has a time shift on it?
No, it has a sort of a space shift.
If there's another headphone in the room,
my headphone loses half of its hearing.
It's cheap equipment is what it is, Dave.
It's cheap equipment.
Yeah, I've had people,
I've had erstwhile beginner podcast people
go, Stang, tell me what kind of equipment
you're using for your wonderful sound on your show.
And it's like, well, this is a 30-year-old,
$20 Radio Shack mixer,
three old microphones with rotten foam windscreens on them,
chewed up by wind and cats,
and a cassette deck,
an iPhone 6,
that has to be kept charging all the time,
and a, yeah, and a match, a little box of matches.
That's our studio.
That's Tarzan's radio station.
Oh, and the preamp is a boom box, a $50 boom box.
That's the most modern thing we have on this table.
There's actually a four-track TX recorder
right in front of me,
but it's just there for show.
It's just there because it looks cool.
It doesn't really work at all.
It's got spiders.
It's got a spider farm inside of it.
Yeah, it's got cobwebs everywhere.
It just makes it look like this is a real sound studio
and not just a table with a bunch of junk on it.
Like I said, it's for a fact.
What it really is is a table
with a bunch of really dusty old junk on it.
I mean, really, really dusty.
So dusty that there are also,
I mean, there are dinosaur footprints
within my eyesight view here.
Seriously.
There are.
That's true.
That can be considered kind of a good thing,
especially when you get in, you know,
some kind of protectionist racket
and you have to hide out there.
You pretend like it's 1987.
What?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What year is this?
1987 that I'm talking about.
Oh.
Oh, what a relief.
God, I thought for a minute there I just, you know,
had a stroke or something.
I kind of forgot the last 50 and a half years.
Right.
You had a stroke of bad luck.
That's for sure.
Well.
Especially when you were young.
Oh, no, no.
Everything was easy when I was young.
Somebody else wiped my butt for me and everything.
Pretty soon that'll probably happen again.
Not less.
Yeah, that's what I miss about, you know,
being young.
Is it not having somebody wipe my butt?
And everybody's saying, well, don't worry,
you're going to be having your butt wiped pretty soon.
Yeah, it won't be that much longer
before somebody's wiping your butt again,
if you're lucky.
Yeah.
At least they won't be using spoons now,
you know, plastic spoons anymore, I think.
Oh, those are...
We're doing there for a while in the late 1980s.
Oh, I hate those.
So wiping your butt with a plastic spoon.
I hate that.
Ew!
Yeah, can you just see, like, you know,
Ronald Reagan walking around with a bunch of,
you know, plastic spoons hanging out over his...
Unfortunately, I have actually seen that.
I went to a party once in Hollywood
just before he was elected governor.
And I saw him in that condition at the party.
But I was just a little kid.
I was only about 18 or so when Ronald Reagan was 25.
Did you get his screen legend?
I got his autograph.
Yeah.
But unfortunately, it was written with one of those spoons.
So it's...
Ew!
Yeah, it got...
In the end, the flies ate it.
Some of the vowels are hard to read.
It would have been valuable someday,
but I didn't keep it because it smelled funny.
Yeah, it reminds me of basketball or something.
Somehow.
I don't know.
I just don't know.
I just don't know.
I don't know.
I simply don't know.
I simply don't know.
I simply...
I just don't know.
I simply don't know.

Well, Dave, I'm sure the listeners will be amazed and surprised to hear that you're still alive.
I know that they're amazed every week that I remain alive.
But nobody's heard you on the show except in hail and hearty reruns.
For quite some time.
Our blessing in a damned confusion is described.
For a great long time.
So welcome back, Dave.
Yes, welcome back, Dave.
I'm feeling welcome and useless, actually.
I have a fictitious idea of what's going on in the world right now.
But you count your blessings, dude.
You don't want to know what's really going on.
Reverend Stang tells me pretty much every day that he's really glad that I don't read the news
because it's just so...
So bad.
Yeah.
Especially environmental news.
Good old Washington Post last night.
Most people don't read any of that anyway.
I looked at...
Today, I thought...
I was looking at the regular, you know, the fake news headlines.
CNN, you know, BBC, that kind of thing.
And the main headline was, world is ending.
I mean, that was the first thing.
Because there was a big conference that they released this compiled data
that was worse news than even the eggheads expected.
Then I thought, I wonder what Breitbart.com is saying about this.
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
It wasn't even mentioned.
It was all about movie stars that refuse to wipe their own butts
because they're Hollywood elites.
And the...
Oh, what was it?
The sex rapist and the...
The whisperer.
That's Cuomo and Biden.
Ah.
The sniffer.
No, the sniffer.
Yeah, the whisperer.
And he sniffs.
And that was why the world is ending,
because of Biden's sniffing and whiffing and whispering.
Ah.
And Cuomo's attempted gropes.
Apparently, he never really got anywhere.
All he did was grope and harass,
but he...
Nobody has actually said that he did anything.
But put his hand on their butt.
Which, that used to be standard operating procedure
for every 1950s male boss.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
I mean, if your boss didn't chase you around the desk like in a sitcom,
you felt like you weren't doing your job.
Those were the days.
You were missing something.
Yeah.
Nowadays, all you have to do is whisper or sniff,
and the right-wingers will come after you.
Now, you can grab them by the country,
but...
But that...
And that's okay,
because it's one of them doing it, see?
Yeah.
But if a sniffer or a whiffer even sniffs or whiffs,
much less grabs them by the country,
like the Russians and the North Koreans did to our country,
they grabbed it by the country.
I'm sorry.
I...
I...
I...
I...
I...
I...
I...





Do you think I speak of country matters?
Yes.
That's Shakespeare.
That's from him.
Seems like selective countries.
Country matters.
Country matters.
It's a rude, crude joke.
Country.
Country, yeah.
And you even hear him making these sexist remarks,
like she was a good sex otherwise,
and then they go,
and look at each other in an annoying way,
and then they go,
and look at each other in an unknowing way,
and they go,
and then,
and make it look like they're not quite sure.
And then they say it again.
They say sexitary, and then they all laugh uproariously.
Sexitary?
Yeah.
And a real good cocksuckertary to read my morning mail.
Well, see, there's one I can't use.
You did not just say that.
Yes, I did.
I quoted Dolomite in a Rudy Ray Moore imitation voice,
and I have to cut that out of the show
because if you're not woke, you're asleep,
but if you're woker than thou, that's even worse.
So they got you coming and going.
Oops, I said coming.
And you know what going means?
That's like number two.
Yeah, that's bad.
Knock, knock, knock at your back door.
Stinky.
Yeah, bad.
It's a bummer.
Well, that's, we have to.
That's probably wrong.
Murr.
I missed that.
It's a bummer.
It's a bummer.
Murr.
It's a what now?
A bummer.
Yeah, Monty Hall, let's find out what's behind door number two.
There's another door there.
I'm actually quoting the Trailer Park Boys Greasy Money phone app game,
which I'm addicted to.
Deeply addicted to.
Oops, I said addicted.
That's got an unwoke word in it.
I'm addicted.
Richard did too.
This game.
The Trailer Park Boys.
How do they get away with anything?
Canada.
Oh, that's right.
It's Canada.
They're from Canada.
They're from Canada.
They can do anything they want.
The FCC.
Those poor creatures, they have no freedoms like we in America.
Right.
So they can say anything they want on TV or radio.
They do.
Actually, Steve Rogers got kicked off the air for saying cocksucker, but I think it
was the goddamn listeners that are the cocksuckers for not letting him say cocksucker on the air.
That's true.
That's going to be fun.
That's going to be a whole bunch of meep, meep, meep, meep, meep.
That'll be the good part when you hear the meep, meep.
Yeah.
Well, that's what the Cleveland and radio broadcast audiences hear.
The internet audiences only hear that if it's funnier to put the beeps in than the curse words.
At least the curse words are in cursive now.
They're encouraging the children to learn backwards.
No, but see, that's okay.
If you say them in cursive, people under 30 or so can't hear it.
They can't.
They never learned cursive.
They can't.
To them, like the former president, the Declaration of Independence appears to be in a foreign language.
What language is this?
What language is this?
Because they don't know how.
They actually ask that question.
Because he can't read English cursive.
We can't read big words.
They typed it out for him and hand him the handwritten calligraphy of the Declaration of Independence.
But, you know, they sell at gun shows and stuff.
They sell copies of it, right?
Yes.
Replicas of the Declaration of Independence.
And kids have to ask what it is.
It's like...
They can't even read the title of it.
They can't read a clock either.
A regular clock.
They can only read digital readout numbers.
A circular clock with, you know...
With hands?
Yeah, with hands.
Yeah, that means nothing to them.
They don't...
They didn't sit at five minutes till three every weekday staring at that round thing,
waiting for that hand to hit the top.
You know?
When you could leave school.
To get out of school.
Right.
That means nothing to them.
They look at their phone, which has a countdown, and tells them when they can leave.
And also sex pictures of the kids all sitting around them.
Because that's all they do in school now is unzip their pants, take sex-ties or whatever of their privates,
and then text them to each other.
No, seriously.
I heard that on Fox News.
That's all they teach in school.
We left.
And Marxism.
That and Marxism.
And that's all there is in schools now.
Oh, I see.
You need to...
There's a microphone.
That's all there is in school now is just...
Yeah.
You know, you, Philo, and Susie have a lot in common, Princess Wee.
No memory whatsoever.
None.
Complete blank.
You can remember there's a microphone there for, what, about ten seconds?
But then your back gets tired of leaning.
Actually, Hal does that, too, to some extent.
You know?
Although usually he leans forward until his lips and nose touch the windscreen on the mic,
and then he falls asleep.
I thought he was just turning blue.
That's it.
It actually has happened.
But that's because Hal's shows are usually on at four in the morning.
I've seen Hal fall asleep on the mic.
Yeah.
I've seen him fall asleep while he was awake.
Or awoken.
Awoken.
Awoken berries.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a lot.
What's up with all the new vocabularies?
I remember when I first started doing some stuff, they'd say contact or whatever, and
now they say everybody has to reach out to somebody, and then if you're aware of something,
you're woke, and then otherwise you're gaslighting.
What does gaslighting really mean?
I'm wondering.
Is that fitting?
It basically means lying, more or less.
It's based on a movie called Gaslighting.
Gaslighting.
Yes.
Where this woman thinks she's losing her mind because she keeps thinking she turned off
that gaslight, but then it's on again, and her husband berates her and tells her she's
losing her mind, but he's the one secretly turning the light on and off to make her believe
she's crazy so she'll go crazy so he can get all the money.
That's gaslighting.
Yeah.
I don't think most people who use that term have any idea whatsoever where it came from.
Because it's a movie from the 30s.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I have not ever seen it.
I really want to see it someday.
Really?
Yeah.
Goodness.
That's what I was just going to ask you.
It was from the 1930s.
Yes.
The predictive decade before DeFiro walked the earth.
It was a famous movie, but that was over 150,000 years ago.
These creatures were thought to be extinct, and yet here they are gaslighting.
Yeah.
They're stinking the place up.
Stinking.
And everything else that we thought had gone out of fashion.
But it's all back in fashion again.
Well, they're going faster than a speedboat and they're on their way to hell.
If you ask me, but nobody did.
No, they just motorboated me.
Did you ever try and haul some bowling balls?
I'm sorry.
What was that, Dave?
I am too.
I'm sorry.
Say it again, Dave.
You're sad?
Oh, I was just wondering if they were taking canoes and putting bowling balls in them to
make sure everybody got to the right shores of the river.
You know, because if you didn't, then...
Dave, they quit doing that back in 2030.
Which was 35 years ago.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They quit making bowling balls around 2035 entirely.
Yeah.
Because bowling was outlawed.
You know, it wasn't...
I don't know.
There was something...
The right-wingers hated it because of the racks.
And the left-wingers hated it because of the balls.
Yeah, but at least the left-wingers had enough little marks on their bodies so that it wouldn't
pinch you there.
Nobody cared about pins.
The pins were fine.
You can still get bowling pins, but you can't have balls.
You can't have balls.
Not anymore.
Yeah.
It's balls pretty much kind of been outlawed on all fronts.
Both sides have outlawed balls.
Wow.
They don't like balls.
I see.
No, they're just taboo.
They're becoming more and more taboo each day.
I have balls, but don't tell the cops because they don't like balls.
Well, I've been sitting on mine lately as I've become older, like closer to 105 years
old.
I've noticed now that it's very easy to sit on that.
On your...
On your...
Troll area.
Yeah.
When I say balls, that's kind of a figure of speech in my personal case.
Well, why wouldn't you call...
Ball, ball.
It's a singular is the way it...
But let's not...
Let's not go into that.
Let's talk about something that blesses my heart.
UFOs.
They finally told the truth about UFOs.
Which is what?
They don't know anything about it.
They don't know Jack Who-y.
They finally admitted it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They finally admitted, yep.
Yep.
UFOs.
We have no idea.
Not a clue.
If you do...
Boy, wait.
If you know, tell us.
All that Roswell stuff, that was all big story.
Well, no.
We don't know.
They don't know.
They just don't know.
They just don't know.
Roswell?
Heck, who cares about that?
That's...
That's...
So, haven't they been collecting information for the last 50 years?
Well, they released the information.
It's just that it doesn't say anything.
Nobody knows.
Yeah.
It's like, well, yeah.
That's what I'm afraid of.
This thing buzzed.
All these planes, all these things buzzed all these planes and did all these crazy things,
but we don't know.
Might be Nazis from the hollow earth.
Might be aliens from out of space.
There could be Nazis from the moon.
Might be creatures of light that fly around and dart around in the sky, and they're just
some species we never heard of before that's been here this whole time, and they just like
to tease us.
Or it might be John Galt and his rich people that...
Yeah.
Withdrew from the world 500 years ago to dedicate themselves to peace and science and slack,
and now they're teasing all the rest of the suckers.
Better hands.
That's...
Honestly, that's...
To me, that's the most likely scenario for UFOs is secret geniuses that a long time ago
went, this whole thing is screwy.
Let's go find ourselves a nice hiding place in the hollow earth or somewhere that only
brilliant geniuses like us...
Yeah.
...can learn how to live in, and we'll just become advanced, like Wakanda in Africa.
That's a case of a secret civilization that's way more advanced than everybody else.
Ah.
And you don't expect it, because they're protected by holograms, and it just looks like remote
jungle.
Dave wouldn't know what I'm talking about, because he hasn't seen a movie in 45 years.
Wakanda.
Yes.
That's where Black Panther comes from.
Okay.
You know, long live Wakanda.
No, I never saw Black Panther.
What?
I heard it.
I heard it.
You've got to be kidding.
No, I've told you a hundred times I never saw it.
And you always think you have that same reaction.
What?
You didn't see Black Panther?
That's great.
No, I didn't see it.
You ranted to me about it, and I really wanted to see it, but I never saw it.
Maybe I should go rent it from the Red Box right away.
Oh, by now, it's probably free on one of those pay-per-view channels.
I've tried.
For free.
I've looked.
If you pay.
Oh, well.
Free.
Only $5.
The Subgenius movie isn't on Amazon anymore, unless you bought it.
You can watch it on Amazon if you bought it.
But it's still on Fandango, I think, and Hulu, and Apple TV, and all the other ones that
we don't have.
It's a moot point, because I have my own bootleg copies that I can reproduce any time.
And I have the official DVD.
Well, I'm glad you can reproduce any time you want.
But it makes it less...
You know what?
I bet Dave's never seen the Subgenius movie, J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.
I bet he hasn't.
Well, he's not in it, so he wouldn't care.
I tried, Dave.
I tried.
Remember I filmed you?
She didn't use anything I filmed.
I filmed G. Gordon Gordon, you, Gary Gabrogfren, and Anna Mall.
And she didn't use any of that footage.
I even went to Portugal to film G. Gordon Gordon.
It was awful.









It was a horrible trip, too.
She still didn't use the footage.
She drank a lot of blush.
She drank a lot of blush wine and smoked a lot of Tunisian arceece.
No.
No.
I didn't even get to do that when I was in Portugal.
The only fun thing I got to do was try goat in a fancy restaurant, and I didn't even like it.
He didn't like it.
No.
Well, anyway, the Subgenius movie came out pretty good, even though you're not in it.
It did.
It's really good.
It has me in it a lot.
So it's really good.


It's really good.
They interviewed Princess Wee, and they didn't use her.
No.
Not a second of it.
You can see her smiling at 7 a.m., the fake 7 a.m.
It was actually 7 p.m., but the sun was in the same position.
So I said, let's just do a fake 7 a.m. ceremony.
We'll have more people that way.
So we had almost like a dozen.
Yeah, but you didn't want to have people all the time.
People, yeah.
People, sure.
Stranger elements and people.
People.
Yeah.
You want some, you know, nice fried figs, some people from outer space.
That's right.
Not people.
We wanted people from outer space, but all we got was a small film crew.
They did use some of the footage, but I bet they felt like, man, why did we all come out here for this?
Yeah, you get paid in bars.
They didn't use much from that.
Anyway, Dave, we have to go because it's almost an hour.
Okay, well.
It's been a very pleasant hour, and I'm glad the world's not going to completely.
Oh, it is.
It is.
It is.
It is.
I know.
Yeah, by the time I get this recording upstairs to my computer, I probably won't even get a chance to copy it over.
Right.
The sky will have fallen.
Yeah, the sky will have fallen.
30 seconds left to go.
That's so sad to think of.
Seven, six, five.
Five.
Four.
Four.
Three.
Two.
Two.
One.
And it's the day called X.
Not really.
Not really.
Not really.
Okay, well, I'm going to go back to my, well, I don't want to say what I was doing.
I don't see why you wouldn't want to let everybody at least know that.
No, I don't know what the kids call it nowadays.
I don't know the vocabulary.
As you were saying, they change the words for everything.
It's hog fishing now.
At least that's the rural term.
Have you ever gone hog fishing?
Hog fishing?
Yeah.
I never have been hog fishing.
Is that a thing that girls do?
When they're allowed, yeah, they do it better than guys.
They don't like that idea.
It goes against their sexist dichotomy.
That's the way it is.
Well, I guess I'll sign off now.
The sky is turning purple again.
I can see the little children outside my window all praying.
Yeah, the pages of my script are curling up and catching on fire.
I guess we better call it quits.
The last hour of slack, number 1,843?
43?
Wow, 1843.
Holy mackerel.
That's a lot of radio shows.
That's the envisionment of a super animal.
I've actually been doing this show longer than Johnny Carson did his show
or David Letterman did his show,
but they did them every night, five days a week.
We only did them once a week, but I'm just as tired as those guys.
In fact, I'm about as tired as those guys.
Tired as Johnny Carson now.
Okay, man.
Okay, man.
Okay, man.
It's fun to make a radio show with you, Dave.
Yeah, it's good.
I just noticed the battery went down, too.
It's still working, but it wouldn't work for much longer.
Boy, they go fast now.
I know how it feels.
I know exactly how that battery feels.
Totally full one minute.
Suddenly, it seems like no time at all goes by.
There we go.
Just like my old Wi-Fi.
No energy.
Yep, that's where I'm going right now.
Okay.
Swap batteries, Dave.
See you on the flip-flop.
Set the end.
Dave?
He actually hangs up.
Even though he could fake it, you know.
He actually hangs up.
Ah, well.
So might it be.
Well, I guess I'll push the switch.
I'll push the stop button.
Stop.
But go.
Go and get Dave's book,
The Novel Neighbor World,
published by the Subgenius Foundation.
Kindle version on Amazon
and print version at subgenius.com
or Amazon.
But we make more money and I autograph it
if you buy it from us.
subgenius.com
And finally, let's go to hear live versions
of two of the songs we played earlier
recorded at the Beachland Ballroom.
in Cleveland as part of Subgenius Debunkers.
There may be time coming soon
when you will not need that dangly dingly
or that thing.
No!
That pristine juicer you can hang from yourself.
That slimy eye.
It's not good for pie in the sky.
Oh, I don't know.
Hmm.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
















So long ago.
Yeah.
Well, they said Chernobyl was so long ago.
There's nothing to worry about.
Then I hear in the news a bunch of dumb guys
in the Department of Energy and Defense Department
going to start building a bunch of Chernobyls
across the United States.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, then I hear Chernobyl's not really over.
All these people are all dying with their 250-mile radius
because all the underground aquifers are all polluted.
So now we're getting it, too.
And then I wonder, as I stare into the mirror,
why my movements are getting so jerky.
Jerky.
Yeah.
One, two, three, four.
The iodine, the 1, 3, 1
Has got my thyroid on the run
And the krypton-885
Is making it hard just to stay alive
But the iodine, the 1, 3, 1
The iodine, the 1, 3, 1
There's no more running through the metal lanes
No more barefoot in the mud
Shake the bone in hand
Of the poor man's heart
Shake the bone in hand
And shake it through
The barium, the 2, 4, 8
Has made me sterile
I can't procreate
And the plutonium, the 2, 4, 7
So long, folks
I see you in heaven
But the iodine, the 1, 3, 1
The iodine, the 1, 3, 1
There's no more running through the metal lanes
There's no more running through the metal lanes
And no more barefoot in the mud
Shake the bony hand of the poison man
Shake the bony hand, shake it through
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, my God

Oh, my God
the poison man


So, if you're over 2 million known pollutants that can cause cancer, skin lesions, brain
tumors, conjunctive lymphoma, Parsons disease, Hodgkin's lymphoma, chicken neck, acne, gingivitis,
bad breath, what's the use?
The iodine, the 1, 3, 1, has got my thyroid on the run, and the krypton, 85, is making
it hard just to stay alive.
But the iodine, 1, 3, 1, the iodine, 1, 3, 1, there's no more running through the metal
lines, no more barefoot in the body.
Power, power's in the power's hand, shake the pony hand and shake it.
No more running through the metal lines, no more barefoot in the body.
Shake the pony hand of the poison man, shake the pony hand and shake it.
Oh, beat me to a pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.
I ain't got religion, I got a damaged brain.
If I had a dollar for every licking that I took, I'd buy the pulpit and Vatican and buy
the dirty part.
Oh, beat me to a pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.
Beat me to a pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.
Beat me to a pulpit.
Oh, beat me to a pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.
Beat me to a pulpit.
Oh, beat me to a pulpit.
Beat me to a pulpit.
Oh, beat me to a pulpit.





Okay, friends, thank you, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, who also did this instrumental in the
background.
That was the end of the broadcast version of this show.
The internet version, this one, has no time constraints, so I want to share with you something
I removed from the rest of the show.
While recording, we had a little technical difficulty for about four minutes.
The kind of thing that a first-time car radio listener might not appreciate.
It might even make them hit that dial.
And yet, it's sort of funny in a sad kind of way, especially if your hearing is impaired
and your gear is really old like you.
Oh, yeah.
And yet, you're still trying to be a sound engineer.
But it's still funny.
Princess, wait, do you need headphones?
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, everything's all un-headphoneded.
Hold on.
Here, I have to fund her.
Should I do a switcheroo?
No, no, I have to do it.
No, I can't hear.
Can I hear?
What did I just do?
Well, that's what, yeah, that's my headphone.
I've put this on.
I've got this in here.
And then that, wait.
Oh, that, that goes in that little hole, yeah.
The one with the hair around it.
There you go.
There, see?
I knew that.
Can you hear it?
Yes.
I can't hear it nearly as well.
Because when you put, when you split, hello, hello.
When you split the little phone, it splits my mind.
It splits the sound.
You have to talk.
The sound is split right down the middle.
Okay.
Here you go.
Now talk some more.
Okay.
The sound is split down the middle when you split it.
You have to split it.
You don't think my microphone is on?
No, I don't think your mic is on.
It sounds like it's on to me and my ears.
Okay.
It is.
Yeah.
The bug, the bug is jumping when you talk.
See, I can't hear.
I made the bug jump.
That sounds like a bug.

















It's hard to be deaf and do a talk show.
It is.
It's fun though sometimes.
But I'm doing it anyway.
To boldly go where no deaf sound person has gone before.
Dave, are you still there?
Yeah, the grave is a difficulty.
I can't hear Dave now.
I hear Dave.
You do?
Uh-huh.
What happened?
Can you hear me?
I can hear Dave.
He said, can you hear me?
Okay.
This is so embarrassing.
Can Stain not hear me now?
Can you hear me?
No.
I can hear you.
You can't hear Dave?
No.
Well, I'm on a television remote.
This machine can't.
My problem is in this connection here.
I can hear Dave.
And I can hear me.
I can hear all you guys.
All five of you.
I can hear you muttering mumble.
What I'm hearing is just the mumble.
How about now?
Say something again, Dave.
Say something again about the terrible quality of food.
I can't hear you.
Well, that's just what it must be reckoned with.
No, I can't.
Okay, good.
Okay.
Hold on.
You finally found the one.
I'm not going to touch it.
I'm just setting it down.
I'm not touching it.
You guys are equal hearing distance.
Yes.
You know why I can hear it now?
No.
Because I didn't put the pole all the way into the hole.
Oh.
It's only a little ways into the hole.
That shows that my pole isn't working right anymore.
Yeah.
You got to have your pole in the hole at all times.
He has to know that you can't put the pole all the way into the hole.
Yours is.
You shoved your pole all the way into the hole.
I shoved my pole all the way in.
Yeah.
Well, I didn't.
I couldn't hear.
I didn't have a pole in the hole.
What does that hole have to do with my ear hole?
It's a completely different hole.
The hole, that hole is a port to sound.
Portra-skeleton.
Portra-skeleton.
I never heard that hole.
Yeah.

Is it like wavy?
Does it sound waverly or is it fruitless?
No.
It's fine.
It's fine and full and groovy.
Speak for yourself.
Today we have mushy spares and spangled dichotomies for dinner and chocolate pudding.
At least that's what my side of the wing is having.
Something for dinner and chocolate pudding.
That's all I could hear.
Oh, well, can you hear this now?
A little better, yeah.
A little better.
That means not quite good yet.
Don't worry about her.
I'm the one that's deaf.
And when I had to split my ear with her ear, strangely enough, that cuts my hearing in
half.
Think if there was a third person here in the room that had to plug into that other
port.
Oh, no.
I'd have one third of a day.
Two thirds gone.
Yeah.
Horrible.
I can only hear one third of a day if there was another person.
