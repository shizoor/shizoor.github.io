1
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:19,300
I will get straight to the point.

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,640
This episode is exactly like the last three in that it has the same elements.

3
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,920
ESO Swamp Radio from 2001,

4
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,140
Puzzling Evidence from 2012,

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,860
and Ancient Rare Firesign Theater,

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,240
plus Captain Beefheart.

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,400
Saves time, and it allowed me to get the Kindle version of our new book, Eyelash, out.

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,220
We'll start with the late Professor Chaz Smith

9
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,180
explaining the origins of Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

10
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,800
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, a lot of people don't know this,

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,660
but Lonesome Cowboy Dave was the original Mr. Jingling.

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,780
That was so long ago, Chaz.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,140
That was another life, and that was another lifestyle.

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,000
I lived then with a very, very, very dear friend of mine, still to this day.

15
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,280
Loving Mr. Horace Joris Nobo Monkey.

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,500
I was the inventor of the Betsy Wetsy doll.

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,080
Those were the days, weren't they?

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,820
I don't know, the sun never came up, but we still called them days.

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,820
That was a beautiful house.

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,060
We were feisty people then.

21
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,480
The glass was always half full, and we were always happy.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,060
Wasn't that when you originally met Bob,

23
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,760
was when you were the original Mr. Jingling,

24
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,860
and you were hanging out,

25
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,040
down in the Greenwich Village?

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,060
Everything had tassels that year.

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,560
I think it was 1963.

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,380
What bar did you run into him at?

29
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,600
Was it Santa Claus, you?

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,240
I think it was Bob.

31
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,940
We were looking for records at Bleaker Bob's one day,

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,060
and I was wearing the tutu,

33
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,000
and he recognized me as Swingin' Sam,

34
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,000
also better known as Mr. Jingling here in Cleveland Town.

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,400
He could tell by my little elf tassels

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,300
and the fact that I had the cute arms.

37
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,780
How did that paternity suit ever turn out

38
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,360
between Dobbs and Santa?

39
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,520
And who?

40
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,600
His dad.

41
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,700
Santa Dog.

42
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,460
I don't know.

43
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,260
And I don't think it was...

44
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,280
Yes, but St. Nicholas, this is fact,

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,860
St. Nicholas punched another bishop in the nose

46
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,400
and bloodied his nose.

47
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,060
And sucked him.

48
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,480
Really?

49
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,720
The historical St. Nicholas?

50
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,800
Over the Trinity of God.

51
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,020
The original St. Nicholas in Turkey?

52
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,800
I swear upon Bob...

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,880
Who the hell is God?

54
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,640
Yeah.

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:24,980
The heart.

56
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,260
The heart.

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,760
The heart.

58
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,040


59
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,220
The heart.

60
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,780
The heart.

61
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,780


62
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,780


63
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,780


64
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,780


65
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,780


66
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,780


67
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,780


68
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,780


69
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,780


70
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,780


71
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,780


72
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,780


73
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,780


74
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,940
I can tell you shit, God.

75
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,620
Who the hell is God?

76
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,300
Who the hell is God?

77
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,300
Ask Dobbs one day.

78
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,000
That's the question we should be asking.

79
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,180
Suddenly, a lightning bolt struck from nowhere

80
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,840
on that bright, sunny day.

81
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,800
Bob did a backflip,

82
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,600
and from that day on, he too was a believer.

83
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,420
And from the snow,

84
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:48,940
wouldn't you?

85
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,740
a little child bearing flowers emerged.

86
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,220
And Chip, Chip, what else was on the TV show?

87
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,220
Each one a dirty flower.

88
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,080
St. Nicholas.

89
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,500
Sip, sicken.

90
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:56,780
Chip?

91
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:08,420
The historical Santa Claus is originally lived, as the caller knows, as a bishop in, was it Constantinople?

92
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,260
Yeah, like one of those.

93
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,640
It was in ancient Byzantium.

94
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,060
Yeah, Asia Minor in general, yeah.

95
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:25,960
Yes, and he was known for sneaking into the rooms of young women and leaving gifts.

96
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,160
Life-size lumps of coal, complete with a fake beard and a CIA Wall Street credit card.

97
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,500
A saint he was, the girl said.

98
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,260
St. Nicholas invented the CIA.

99
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,860
You got it, brother.

100
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,820
He snuck into people's houses through the chimney.

101
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,940
You got it, brother.

102
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,460
They knew when they were sleeping.

103
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,380
He knew when they were awake.

104
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,180
You got it, brother.

105
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,400
But like the CIA, he was protecting them.

106
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,820
Foucault knew that St. Nick was a creeping, stinking spy.

107
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,880
He knows when you've been sleeping.

108
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,620
He knows.

109
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,380
But you've been...

110
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,320
Hey, man, my kids still believe in St. Nicholas.

111
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,320
And who keeps that belief alive in their fevered, sick little brain?

112
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,540
Madison Avenue, of course.

113
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,340
No, the surveillance community.

114
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,060
And Disney.

115
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,100
Under your direction.

116
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,040
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company.

117
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,920
Miller Beer, you know.

118
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,740
If you're bad, he punishes you.

119
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,480
If you're good, he rewards you.

120
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
He's probably the closest thing to Jesus walking the earth.

121
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,900
He's the closest thing to Big Brother there is.

122
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,640
He rewards those who knows when they are smiling when they're awake.

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,780
I think...

124
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,540
I think, really, if you want to make a deal, you have to do it with, you know...

125
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:36,640
Could Dr. Claus, in fact, be the wandering, quote, milkman rumored to have fathered our

126
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,000
savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

127
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,600
Well, we find it a very likely possibility from the falsified documents we have here.

128
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,360
And also the fluffy beard that often grew on Bob's feet.

129
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,920
And the sperm count with the glowing red nose.

130
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,280
What could this mean?

131
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,420
Often, Dobbs' early girlfriends had to actually shave.

132
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,380
His feet, especially when he was...

133
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,440
Listen, if you're going to say Indians had to have flying saucers off,

134
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,060
and he had white fluffy hair,

135
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,360
and he's off his feet,

136
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,940
it was for sure the beard, the fake beard.

137
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,440
And I want one of them new robots with the real intestinal bacteria.

138
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,860
Yeah, what about...

139
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,520
And one of those robots with a fish brain for a brain.

140
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,640
They're sold out.

141
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,980
And a new pony boy to scrub my sink.

142
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,180
Their Toys R Us has no more.

143
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,660
And world peas.

144
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,240
Pat, Pat got a pony.

145
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,320
They're on the shelves.

146
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,980
For everybody.

147
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,540
For everybody.

148
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,720
Can't get them from Amazon.com.

149
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,220
World peas.

150
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,440
Can't get them anywhere in time.

151
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,360
Care Rots, not Care Rots.

152
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,200
I say.

153
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,200
Son of Care Rots.

154
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,940
Care Rots, not Care Rots.

155
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,320
Too late for Christmas.

156
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,960
Because there's too many Care Rots out there.

157
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,620
Not Son of Care Rots.

158
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,560
Well, that really happened.

159
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:48,280
I've been discovering these potion castle something surreal prank phone calls.

160
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,840
Prank phone calls, yeah.

161
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,700
Ah, well.

162
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
I like them.

163
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,060
You still in that voice jail?

164
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,060
Yeah.

165
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,100
Help me.

166
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,940
Computer Frankenprank calls.

167
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,020
Dot com.

168
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:11,120
This guy would call up people and ask for the notorious Nimrod in the parochial.

169
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,400
This is the show where people are missing.

170
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,220
No, no, Philo.

171
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,060
No sternum.

172
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,360
And of course, in honor of Phineas, Narco, no general.

173
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,840
And you can.

174
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,420
And you can you sell yourself.

175
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,120
Sucks on the show.

176
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,240
Yes, this is.

177
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,980
I just prove it.

178
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,340
We can.

179
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,220
We're free.

180
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,420
We're not a cult.

181
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,220
We're not a cult.

182
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,900
It's it's really stern.

183
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,200
Oh, is a show that we have to be afraid of.

184
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,520
Right.

185
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,460
You are not allowed to say those words, whether you mean them or not.

186
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,580
Sapa sucks.

187
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,740
You know, most of the time I don't mean, but you are not allowed.

188
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,940
And I've been tattling on them for weeks now.

189
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,360
But that's just a private conversation.

190
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,600
You say it on like.

191
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,020
No, on the radio.

192
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:55,660
No.

193
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,820
They almost beat me up for saying it in private conversation.

194
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,300
Just the very concept.

195
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,300
Zappa sucks.

196
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,840
Upset these Zappa cultists so much.

197
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,500
I was going, look, I'm just advancing the work.

198
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
If I say these words, what will happen?

199
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,780
And they said, you'll walk home.

200
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,560
No, no.

201
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,420
And they were not kidding either.

202
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,020
I said, you're in a cult.

203
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,400
And stern.

204
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,900
I said, no, I'm in two cults.

205
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,300
That's there.

206
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,580
Now I've told it five hundred times.

207
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,100
Dancing home from the show.

208
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,480
I'm like my dad now.

209
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,360
I guess I can't remember who I've told what joke to.

210
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,960
And I just keep saying the same things over and over again.

211
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,320
And what about these same stories?

212
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,260
Mr. Smith, they they all say the same thing.

213
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,580
That's what Facebook is for.

214
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,760
You get on there and you have to make up new stuff every ten seconds.

215
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,820
That's why I've been avoiding old stuff.

216
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,560
I can't.

217
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,540
I'm tired of that.

218
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,100
I'm just tired, tired, tired.

219
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,160
Oh, it's a dream.

220
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,060
It's me tired.

221
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,640
Do you like it?

222
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,580
I know what you mean.

223
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,680
I'm tired of it.

224
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,420
I haven't done that much.

225
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,360
Well, we did it before it was around.

226
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,680
We did it by tape and U.S.

227
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:00,980
Mail.

228
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,980
And I'm glad that the Internet wasn't around then because there were some pretty embarrassing things.

229
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,100
So goodbye.

230
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,400
I'm sorry.

231
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:09,620
Hello.

232
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,240
It's true.

233
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,940
It's really funny.

234
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,820
We had the Internet, but it was it was really slow.

235
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,240
It took days and there were only 15 of us.

236
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,580
Yeah, it was.

237
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,620
It was a lot funnier until the flaming and trolling.

238
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,960
And of course, you know, I think.

239
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,100
So.

240
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,360
It's always funny until somebody gets hurt and somebody's little brother gets her eye

241
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,820
shot out.

242
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,420
I think I found out about some things through the back of a thing.

243
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,120
Gloria magazine.

244
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,480
Really?

245
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,640
Of a what magazine?

246
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,620
Saying Gloria.

247
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,340
Well, huh?

248
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,120
Yeah.

249
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,700
I think that's memory serves.

250
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,520
I might have met Dr. Onan Canobites or that.

251
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,040
You know, I was just thinking I need to put on YouTube at some point pretty soon here.

252
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,920
The the subgenius gathering in Tucson, Arizona.

253
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,080
I think I saw it.

254
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,080


255
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,080


256
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,080


257
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:05,080
The hancock broadcast, i mean, last year's so hear that Bill Anecdote site.

258
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,820
I got the picture of her lastly, right.

259
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:06,820


260
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:06,820


261
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:06,820


262
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:06,820


263
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:06,820


264
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,820
In the moment, I think I did cork start seeing of the

265
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,180
Herringbone called Les.

266
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,660
Because I was traveling around väly in takes a basis of like Anschu heinigおおg my

267
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:24,320
god in the land till I can refer to And they worked like men.

268
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,080
They made him on your way.

269
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,080


270
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,080


271
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,560
They thought, you know, the tattoos and the tats and everything got to fight now.

272
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,740
And so I had to move my car because I was worried they would beat up my poor little car.

273
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,100
And then we go to show and all the power goes out.

274
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,440
Probably because of something Chicken John did when he arrived with a bus full of folks.

275
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,380
All I remember is Nikki and her special S&M outfit.

276
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,940
Yeah, I should remember that.

277
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,280
Maybe I was too overwhelming to look.

278
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,880
That's all I can remember.

279
00:09:51,880 --> 00:10:01,060
And the giant talking flaming mouth Dobbs said, I am the great and powerful Bob Dobbs.

280
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,340
Hal was doing the voice.

281
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:12,060
And my boy had made a giant Dobbs head out of paper mache that actually belched flame and had flame coming from its pipe.

282
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:20,380
And with a really hard tug of a rope, you could pull the thing's jaws up and down.

283
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,540
And make.

284
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,580
Make it speak in Hal's voice so I could ask it questions.

285
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,600
I am the great and powerful Dobbs.

286
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,060
Yeah.

287
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,860
Yeah, I like that.

288
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,700
How later did that with the giant buttock at Burning Man, I think.

289
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,700
Or maybe it was before.

290
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,360
That was very funny.

291
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,320
Yeah, I'm not sure where it fits in the timeline.

292
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,120
I think it's later.

293
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,440
But Chicken John made a giant really.

294
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,560
You couldn't even tell it was a butt.

295
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,360
It was just a giant thing of polyester.

296
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,280
Of the trash bag polyester.

297
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,700
And then the people of the fire department came by and said.

298
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
You can't do this.

299
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,860
And so Chicken John said.

300
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,280
You're right.

301
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,060
And burn it down.

302
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,340
So they flex a little plastic flying across the playa.

303
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,860
Like a million trash cans on fire.

304
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:07,420
Now, I heard that Mongoloids talking Dobbs had that was like six or seven feet tall.

305
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:07,740
Yeah.

306
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:07,980
At least.

307
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,340
Yeah.

308
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,760
Was it ended up being left in Tucson.

309
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,900
And somebody said, I'll take it and put it on my front lawn.

310
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,420
And they live next to the main freeway through town.

311
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,340
So everybody driving to work has to look at that.

312
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,740
Horrible.

313
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,440
And they have to put their face down there on somebody's lawn.

314
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:23,780
Nice.

315
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,500
That's the way to do it.

316
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,300
See, this guy knows.

317
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:26,840
Yeah.

318
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,200
Yeah.

319
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:03,760
So didn't that to show us that watermelon or a sweet potato.

320
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,500
Pick up the mai.

321
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:04,500


322
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:04,500


323
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:04,500


324
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:04,500


325
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:04,500


326
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,600
The The Angst full, because we are unable to see Derek out of his classroom.

327
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:07,600


328
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,100
Eued C worldlys rI.

329
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,060


330
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,060


331
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,060


332
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,060


333
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,060


334
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,160
Oh.

335
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,860
Boy I'm clever.

336
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,800
TV was good this week, though.

337
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,800
Late last night, I saw a travelogue about Fiji, and I learned something really interesting about Fiji.

338
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,940
Excuse me, was that with Baxter Ward?

339
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,040
Yeah, that's what Baxter Ward was talking about.

340
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,020
Baxter was narrating it, his informal method that he has.

341
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,760
You studied the same school he did.

342
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,020
That's right.

343
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,580
A famous speaker school.

344
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,120
Yeah, me too.

345
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,120
I studied there too.

346
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,280
I went there, you know.

347
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,180
Oh, did you?

348
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,720
Yes, yes.

349
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,160
I was a 400-pound weakling, used to walk with the muscle beaches, you know, looking for

350
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,820
an angry sock.

351
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,780
Now, I'm a weakling.

352
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,220
Now, I'm on radio.

353
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,280
It's wonderful.

354
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,240
A famous speaker school.

355
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,940
That guy's 300 pounds, you know.

356
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,200
That's right.

357
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,320
He used to be in the Marines.

358
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,300
It's all in my throat now.

359
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,840
Yeah, you've got that under control.

360
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,300
You've got a good, you're a personable guy.

361
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,520
Oh, you're from there too.

362
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,100
Yeah, sure.

363
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,940
I studied there.

364
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,800
I remember hearing you were the booth next to me.

365
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,020
I didn't speak like that.

366
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,960
Yeah, I remember I was the guy who couldn't talk at all.

367
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,180
I remember.

368
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,060
Nobody understood me.

369
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,080
People used to punch me out.

370
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,460
I'd go up and I'd ask, I'd like a direction.

371
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,460
I wanted to go somewhere, I'd go, hey, hey, take a testify.

372
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,100
Boom.

373
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,360
Oh!

374
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,380
You thought I was being, you know, fresh or something.

375
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,540
Now I can communicate and believe me, I'm grateful for it.

376
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,520
Oh, you sound great.

377
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,240
I've heard you on the Top 40 show, right?

378
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,920
Yes, I've spoken in the Top 40 show, yes.

379
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,680
Yeah, it's great.

380
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,220
It's great.

381
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,260
I've spoken in some, I've spoken in 40, 50 shows.

382
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,680
Don't, you're speeding him up.

383
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,980
This boy has to take it very slowly here at the school.

384
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,100
I'm okay, teacher.

385
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:07,600
I'm okay, teacher.

386
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,620
Now you just take it easy.

387
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,440
No, no, don't get tight.

388
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,380
Loose your head.

389
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,600
Throw.

390
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,140
Ow!

391
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:14,940
Fine.

392
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,140
I'm listening.

393
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,520
I'm hearing in, being number one on the monsterny.

394
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,460
That's one of our boys.

395
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,300
I'm practicing that.

396
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:23,720
He's coming.

397
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,320
You're coming along all right.

398
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,340
Yeah, I'll have it down pretty soon.

399
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,600
Let me try one.

400
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,200
Let me try one.

401
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,620
Could I?

402
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:28,960
Right?

403
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,240
All right, here's our star student, Charlene Yakamoto.

404
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,140
Go ahead, Charlene.

405
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,680
La Cienega car wash.

406
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes, La Cienega car wash.

407
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,680
Get your car washed in an atmosphere of congenial living.

408
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:50,160
Yes, and while your car is being washed from the inside out, you'll browse in our modern

409
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,800
browsing room where car accessories are displayed.

410
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,640
That was a real swell commercial, kids.

411
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,820
I think you're ready for the big time.

412
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,100
My mother was so surprised to see me come home talking like this.

413
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,700
Oh, she was never so surprised.

414
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,640
I bought her off, though.

415
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,980
She's not unhappy about it.

416
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,300
Well, it's good you only do voiceovers, though, Henry.

417
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,900
It's all I can do.

418
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,340
They won't let him get on the bottom.

419
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,660
Well, anyway, as I was saying, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

420
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:14,660


421
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:14,660


422
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:14,660


423
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:14,660


424
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,240
Go ahead.

425
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:15,800
Go ahead.

426
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,000
I was watching this TV program about Fiji last night with Baxter Ward.

427
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,740
Oh, that.

428
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,520
Yes.

429
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,900
I haven't gotten back to any of the things I was interrupted about.

430
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,540
Oh, that's because drug usage, you see.

431
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:25,700
Very good, Phil.

432
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,340
It destroys your memory.

433
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,620
Your what?

434
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,780
It destroys your memory.

435
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,040
Your what?

436
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,960
It destroys your memory.

437
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,900
Your memory.

438
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,120
Oh.

439
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,980
I read an article about that by Dr. Shoya, right here.

440
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:35,980
What destroys your memory?

441
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,600
Oh, do you have, there was something on him in...

442
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,540
No, but what was I saying?

443
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,160
I have this life-

444
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,840
Oh, no.

445
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,600
No, no, wait a minute.

446
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,100
No, you can't confuse me.

447
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,300
No, you can't fool me, Phil.

448
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,040
No, no, I wrote it down.

449
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,240
You know.

450
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,000
I know you know.

451
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,900
I was talking about Fresno.

452
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,640
Dr.

453
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,140
Dr. Here it is.

454
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,780
Here it is.

455
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,060
Dr. Talking about Fresno.

456
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,760
Oh, you got it.

457
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,260
I got it.

458
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,760
It's right-

459
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,820
Dr. Saying about Fresno.

460
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,820
Right here.

461
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,340
I forgot to-

462
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,360
Dr. Oh, you forgot to bring it.

463
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,420
No, no, I forgot.

464
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,340
I forgot the-

465
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:01,920
Dr. The-

466
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,780
Well, I can't say no that I didn't forget to bring it because I don't remember exactly

467
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:06,800
what I-

468
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,500
Dr. Can't forget no what?

469
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,560
Will they remember?

470
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,680
Or will they forget?

471
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,080
There's no telling on the-

472
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,080


473
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,620
Dr. Dr.

474
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:18,880
Dr.

475
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:34,320
Dr. Was that one of those original Martians trying to tune in from afar?

476
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,120
Some people don't think Mars needs Connie.

477
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,000
Is it space laughter?

478
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,080
I don't know.

479
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:40,820
Dr. Mars needs Connie.

480
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,080
Earth needs Whitney.

481
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,080


482
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,440
Earth needs a hell of a lot more women.

483
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,500
I think if Earth would tip the scale the right way for us guys,

484
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,620
I think our problems would finally be all over.

485
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,560
I think if there was, instead of 1.6 women for every man,

486
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,440
what if there was like 1.9 women for every man?

487
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,620
Well, that would certainly make things easier on me.

488
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,260
There would be more women for me, too.

489
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,640
You would be more womanlike,

490
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,220
or you would be more womanly from the contrast of so much womanhood around you, too.

491
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,200
You could take it five or seven ways.

492
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,640
I take it any way I can.

493
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,880
Well, I'm sure you do.

494
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,520
Does the word lowlife...

495
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,460
Watch five or six or seven men and women doing it.

496
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,320
I'd rather be five or six or seven men and women doing it.

497
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:32,820
Yeah.

498
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,540
That's beautiful.

499
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,740
But what would a cacophonous experience like that be?

500
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,240
It would be so...

501
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:38,780
It would be so confusing.

502
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,720
You would not know your own id from your own tid.

503
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,520
Not only would you remove your own head from your own body,

504
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,940
but you would actually be forcing yourself into a situation

505
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,300
where you'd be looking at yourself from the inside.

506
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,600
There's no law against wearing such apparel on the street.

507
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,940
As long as it can be distinguished that man is man,

508
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,140
woman is woman,

509
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,060
and woman is woman.

510
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,800
I think you're just a big boy.

511
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,580
My significant other is a pre-option sexual.

512
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,700
As long as it can be distinguished that man is man,

513
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,940
woman is woman,

514
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,840
crime is woman,

515
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,640
and woman is woman.

516
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,540
It's a pleasure, isn't it?

517
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,420
Crime and giving yourself over to pleasure.

518
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:12,540
Man is man.

519
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,860
Man is man.

520
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,700
Man is man.

521
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,300
Man is man.

522
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,140
Crime and giving yourself over to pleasure.

523
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,600
Good evening.

524
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,620
This is Lewis Marshman speaking for myself

525
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,280
and my thousands of fellow professionals

526
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,320
who, like myself, are responsible for speaking to you as I am at this time.

527
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,100
We are all involved in a national news emergency of such magnitude

528
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,720
that only now can we pause for a moment,

529
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,040
to distort its proportions back to our own limited perspective.

530
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,440
The credibility gap now stretches beyond the international dateline,

531
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,680
so that lies fabricated in the foreign press are repudiated in our local papers

532
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,640
the day before they appear in the country of their origin.

533
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,740
The advance of science now allows us to bounce our information off the planet Saturn,

534
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,580
but none of it has returned,

535
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,720
leaving our global home bereft of news.

536
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,320
And so, concerned citizens like myself sit here tonight,

537
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,660
with absolutely nothing of any importance to say.

538
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,520
Then let it be said,

539
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,300
not to enlighten,

540
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,560
but to inform.

541
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,780
Our generation has achieved failure at the cost of its own success,

542
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,260
and our great-great-grandchildren are paying for that powerful failure.

543
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,940
But they're too young to work in the dark,

544
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,140
so we must lend them the little immense energy left

545
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,140
to help them shoulder that impossible load.

546
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,140
Yet debt has never frightened us.

547
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,000
It is, after all, the currency of fear,

548
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,380
and fear is where we're rich.

549
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,240
We have learned to hoard despair and make it pay great dividends.

550
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,880
The shadow of a chicken in every pot.

551
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,520
The freeways jammed with empty holiday cars.

552
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,660
One hundred million television sets turned to face the wall.

553
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,380
Yes, a rich land with cream in the coffee bread lines in their palms.

554
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,340
But the memory banks are closing,

555
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,400
because our youth and the young at heart refuse to gossip the good talk,

556
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,700
refuse to dance on the grid,

557
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,840
refuse to even pretend to be duped,

558
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,820
and a nation that can't be duped can't be made fun of itself.

559
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,080
I, and every other mind sewn together in this great circle of world thought,

560
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,160
gave up the declining years of their boyhood,

561
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,020
beat off every desire and phantom lover

562
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,780
to conjure up all the little people on the billboards you've loved,

563
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,740
and to be the first to eat so much.

564
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:46,860
Crunchy Caramel, Mr. Peanut, Captain Crunch, Snappy Tom, Little Bite-Sized Godzilla.

565
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,640
They're the children of my career.

566
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,180
Throw them in the gutter, and you drown my breakfast.

567
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,920
So come on, let's be kids again.

568
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,960
Let's listen to the radio and spoil our appetites.

569
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,860
Let's put on daddy's shoes and invent the atom bomb.

570
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,000
Or at least let's say we did it.

571
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,920
Or at very least, let's start storyboarding.

572
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,160
I'm sure I've got a few more things to say.

573
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,540
But I'm not going to be boring up some respect for the people

574
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,280
whose job it is to tell us about it.

575
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,380
Actors and soldiers are people too, you know.

576
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,400
There's one at your door right now, reading your number.

577
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,720
Let him in.

578
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,580
Just because he's got a snappy uniform on doesn't mean he isn't a cripple.

579
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,020
Just because I'm talking to millions of you doesn't mean I'm not lonely.

580
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,660
So give us a dime, or give us a call, but for God's sake, don't give us away.

581
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,240
Thank you.

582
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,680
And now back to the news.

583
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,880
Important editorial from the management of this radio station.

584
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,040
That was the late Peter Bergman of the Firesign Theater.

585
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,580
And now this, my theme song on bad days.

586

The Fire Sign Theater

587
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,480
I am the man of constant sorrow through his day.

588
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,920
I am the man of constant sorrow.

589
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,560
I've seen trouble all my day.

590
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:33,900
I bid farewell to old Kentucky,

591
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,900
the place where I lived.

592
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,640
I was born in gray.

593
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,400

595
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,780
For six long years,

596
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,240
I've been in trouble.

597
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,780
No pleasure here on earth I find.

598
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,660
For in this world I'm bound to ramble.

599
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,040
I had no friends to help me now.

600
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,680
He has no friends to help me now.

601
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,720
He has no friends to help me now.

602
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:35,760
He has no friends to help me now.

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:35,760


604
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,740
He has no friends to help me now.

605
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:52,740


606
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:52,740


607
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,560
Fare thee well,

608
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,060
my old,

609
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,300
true lover.

610
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,900
Dare yon go.

00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,900

00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,660
I'm bound to ride

00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,520
behind that northern railroad

615
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,140
Perhaps I'll die

616
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,060
upon that train

617
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,960
Perhaps you'll die

618
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,800
upon this train

619
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,560
You can bury me

620
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,480
in Sunday Valley

621
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,260
For many years

622
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,260
where I may play

623
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:55,960
And you may learn

624
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,580
to love another

625
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,620
While I am sleeping

631
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,840
Maybe your friends think

632
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,880
I'm just a stranger

633
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,260
My face you know

634
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:35,760
I'm just a stranger

635
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,280
I can see no more

636
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,140
But there is one promise

637
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,860
Promise that is given

638
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,560
I'll meet you on

639
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,360
God's golden shore

640
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,500

644
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:17,280
That was not actually the fictional Soggy Bottom Boys from Oh Brother Where Art Thou, but a musician named Dan Tyminski singing an old song by Dick Burnett, a blind fiddler from Kentucky.

645
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:33,280
Now we'll go back to the Puzzling Evidence show, which becomes a bit star-studded later on as the callers include Reverend Bleepo Abernathy, Bishop Joey from the First Church of the Last Laugh, and the great visionary and slob Michael Pepe.

646
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,580
But in this one, it's just two Dougs and Phineas Norco.

647
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,440
I just remember wandering around naked.

648
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
What? Somebody said naked? What?

649
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,140
Oh, was that you that I saw wandering around naked at Burning Man?

650
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,600
Well, that must have been me.

651
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,100
Are you like 80 years old? Because that's how you looked at the time.

652
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,620
Did you ever see Trash Humpers?

653
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,280
Which?

654
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,840
Trash Humpers.

655
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,300
No.

656
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,500
Oh, you must see Trash Humpers.

657
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,960
I just saw a movie called Pig that Legume.

658
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,360
It gave me a link to. You can only download it. It's so violent and horrible.

659
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,820
It makes everything look clean and nice.

660
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,140
Trash Humpers is very so genius.

661
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,400
But it's shot on videotape.

662
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,640
Like old VHS videotape.

663
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,360
Huh.

664
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,440
I beat the socks off of that.

665
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,740
Trash Humpers.

666
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,420
Yes, you must see that.

667
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,040
Another must see on the endless list.

668
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,760
Endless must sees.

669
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,080
Keeps growing.

670
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,800
The sea of must sees.

671
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,940
A veritable ocean.

672
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,960
Longer than our lives.

673
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,980
More must sees.

674
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,800
Must see.

675
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,500
Typing them in now.

676
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,360
We must see.

677
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,200
The must see sea of must see movies.

678
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,260
And, uh.

679
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,020
TV.

680
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,640
Yes.

681
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:55,960
Yes.

682
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,380
Sé la finque.

683
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,080
Are the steel barbw innocence.

684
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,080


685
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,920
Is or fucking wild?

686
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:20,920


687
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:20,920


688
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,760
You're going to be left out.

689
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:22,760


690
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:22,760


691
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,140
That's so drunk.

692
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,140


693
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,140


694
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,140


695
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,520
You will get a delivery to work.

696
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:24,520


697
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:24,520


698
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:24,520


699
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,120
Okay.

700
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,120


701
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:25,500


702
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:25,500


703
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:25,500


704
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,800
They're continually my.

705
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,760
Love.

706
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,260
Me

707
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:33,260


708
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:33,260


709
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,120
You.

710
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,400
Thank you.

711
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,420
Thank you.

712
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,720
That was Captain Beefheart,

713
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,840
an unusual instrumental from Doc at the Radar Station

714
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,420
called,

715
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,220
A carrot is as close as a rabbit gets to a diamond.

716
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,460
We'll now go to the ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland

717
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,220
just after the presidential election of 2000,

718
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,800
a clip in which a caller complains

719
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,900
that after 300 years as governor of Arkansas,

720
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,360
Bill Clinton didn't do anything about Doctors for Bob,

721
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,740
the infamous Little Rock subgenius band.

722
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,120
However, the caller was misinformed.

723
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,880
Bill Clinton was governor for 300 years

724
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,400
and our government was in the wrong.

725
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:02,720
He was in Arkansas

726
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,800
and he never did anything about Doctors for Bob.

727
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,720
Clinton actually, he did.

728
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,980
He married one of Doctors for Bob

729
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,980
in the governor's mansion.

730
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,940
Hey, so what about Bush's daughters?

731
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,020
Hot little things there, huh?

732
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,200
Little coke heads a bit, huh?

733
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,480
She's cute.

734
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,120
I bet they all get their coke from daddy.

735
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,980
Wouldn't that be terrible?

736
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,040
They would call him the Michael Corleone

737
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,100
of the Michael Corleones in the New York Times.

738
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,680
One guy, I forget if he was a guy or not.

739
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,240
Those are hired daughters.

740
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,480
Those aren't the real daughters.

741
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,180
That's what I thought.

742
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,220
They were like actresses.

743
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:35,720
Yeah, dancers.

744
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,500
They've been groomed for a long time.

745
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,740
Remember the old Soviet programs?

746
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,200
They all spoke Russian, too,

747
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,160
from an earlier program.

748
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:41,900
Crazy horse or something like that.

749
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,040
At least with Chelsea.

750
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,200
No, they used those for the jeans.

751
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,920
She was definitely the kid of both of them.

752
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,040
Of regular people.

753
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,900
Yeah, regular people.

754
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,140
These were especially bred and fed,

755
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,820
the Bush children,

756
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,160
each to resemble something in Elan

757
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,940
or a teen magazine or something like that.

758
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,680
And also to give...

759
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,120
They're perfectly normal looking

760
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,580
and attractive.

761
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,300
Very.

762
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,160
And if you're like...

763
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,900
Logical looking.

764
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,040
If you're a young, flushy or some person

765
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,120
that can only ditto an agreement to many things,

766
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,580
you get a look at that

767
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,240
and you stop thinking even more so

768
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,100
as your members swell.

769
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:13,960
Your group gets bigger.

770
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,180
Finally, normality has returned.

771
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,560
We can all be proud to be normal

772
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,540
and serve the...

773
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,720
You know, whoever.

774
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,260
Someone better and more important.

775
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,420
Someone is taking care of...

776
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,060
Someone who's got more money than...

777
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,580
Even me!

778
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,700
A master!

779
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,680
A true master!

780
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,100
Someone superior!

781
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,880
It's going to be just fine.

782
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,640
Someone I can work for.

783
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,440
Someone I can serve.

784
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,000
That's right, you'll find a new life in Bush Haven,

785
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:49,360
where everyone gets a special voucher

786
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,740
worth 29 cents towards the advancement of their career

787
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,620
or enrichment as a human being.

788
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,840
Everyone will also receive 45 cents

789
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,480
as transportation passage for one year.

790
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,720
Thanks to the...

791
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:06,520
Everyone will receive 40 acres and a mule!

792
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,280
It's our...

793
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,700
It's...

794
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,700
Welcome to the new New Deal

795
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,880
in the new old age.

796
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,340
Yes, 40 acres and a mule from hell.

797
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,540
Jesus is back with a...

798
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,240
coat hanger.

799
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,120
A rusty coat hanger.

800
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,920
Yes, Jesus.

801
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:29,020
Yes, the Lord has returned with a rusty coat hanger.

802
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,240
I think that says more than it wants to.

803
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:31,880
That says it.

804
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,400
Uh-huh.

805
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:32,880
Uh-huh.

806
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,320
Bop-bop.

807
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:35,880
Bop-bop.

808
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,640
We should make bumper stickers.

809
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,420
Sterno was going to make a bumper sticker.

810
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,480
Oh, if the Lord will...

811
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,720
20 years ago,

812
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,580
Curious.

813
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,120
when they were trying to outlaw any kind of abortion

814
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,100
that just had a picture of a coat hanger

815
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,240
and it said, welcome back.

816
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,260
Okay, here's a thought.

817
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,860
I don't want to be shot or procrastinated

818
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,120
or even put in the broadcast too late for the next 45 minutes.

819
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,760
What if instead of doing away with a lot of these things,

820
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,880
they want to do away with...

821
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,300
We did away with Jesus.

822
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:03,920
Bop.

823
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,440
Okay, forget about that.

824
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,300
That was a bad idea.

825
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,020
Bop.

826
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,920
Do you think anything would change?

827
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,560
I mean, it was just like an errant thought that came in there

828
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,280
and put a little mushroom cloud and left.

829
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,780
Do away with Jesus.

830
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,720
That's a...

831
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,620
Where do you...

832
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,720
How do you think we got...

833
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,320
That's what...

834
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,680
That's where they made the mistake the first time.

835
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,220
Ah.

836
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,420
Let's do away with Jesus.

837
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,300
That's how this started.

838
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:25,920
Ah.

839
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,520
Now, by the same token,

840
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,720
they decided they'd do away with Martin Luther King.

841
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,700
Well, this token is no longer valid.

842
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,080
So, let's just see what happens with that one.

843
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:35,920
This token is no longer valid.

844
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,480
They decided they'd do away with Mr. David Coray.

845
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,960
Now, you're going to need a transfer here.

846
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,520
Now, let's just see what happens now.

847
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,920
Besides, this token is no longer valid.

848
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:41,940
Oh, yeah.

849
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,540
They said they'd just do away with all those people in Bhopal, India.

850
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,000
Well, let's just see what happens now.

851
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,200
It's going to be a bummer, my friends.

852
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,580
It's going to be a total bummer, baby.

853
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,980
Down there on the south end of the flats,

854
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,680
I have to go to work every day.

855
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,420
Let's do away with all those people

856
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,860
that have to put meat on the table.

857
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,700
And potatoes and bread on both sides of the butter.

858
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,100
Let's do away with all those people

859
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,840
that have to do away with people.

860
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,140
Or at least have a way with poople.

861
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,720
Because those are the real pooples.

862
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,260
The pooples that we're trying to reel.

863
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Mr. Sinoff, it's time to reel in.

864
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,380
Could you please sit down here, please?

865
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:22,860
Thank you.

866
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,600
Okay, just take this clipboard and put it on your knees.

867
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,760
You're going to feel a tingling in a few short minutes.

868
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,760
Just put your...

869
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,480
You'll let your eyes roll back in your head.

870
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,740
That's right, you're going to see a lot of silly things.

871
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,080
Have a little laugh before we go.

872
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,520
Ready to go?

873
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,860
Kill me, Bob.

874
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,200
I want to die for Bob.

875
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,080
I want to die for Bob.

876
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,800
They're signing off throughout the land.

877
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,340
People of America, people of the United Snakes,

878
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,440
please, please, if you can,

879
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,320
stay tuned to your radios, your appliances.

880
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,320
Stay close to your mixmats.

881
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:01,920
There are no DJs.

882
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,600
Or perhaps even your microwave if it has.

883
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,960
We're going to have to sign off the air.

884
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,280
It's going to be very special.

885
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,280
I don't want to sign off the air.

886
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,120
Why?

887
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,140
Stang, you stay here all night and stay on the air.

888
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,860
Stay away from your windows if you can.

889
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,060
I've got to do an hour of slack.

890
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,620
I'm going to get home.

891
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,660
Just do it live on the air.

892
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,980
Record it and dub them off when you get home.

893
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,340
Only two minutes.

894
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:31,300
So next week we'll be deciphering the secrets of the...

895
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:31,300


896
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,420
The secret of the Knights Templar and the Holy Grail.

897
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,720
Again?

898
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,960
Well, next week.

899
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,620
Yuck.

900
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,840
Not again.

901
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,900
This is a new spin on an old subject.

902
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,940
They're all based on satirical pamphlets written by young men

903
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,480
making fun of the occult trends of their day.

904
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,160
All religions were started that way.

905
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,000
Don't say that.

906
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,560
We're going to talk about it next week.

907
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,100
I'm covering it ahead of time.

908
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,260
That covers all male-order cults.

909
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,920
We're going to talk about how hog-raising is a dirty business.

910
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,100
You have to get rid of all that hog stuff.

911
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,000
You have to just hold the grass down.

912
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,100
Hog-raising ends in only one thing.

913
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,380
Hog killing.

914
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,040
And you've got to do your hog killing in the right kind of weather.

915
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,300
You can't sell...

916
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,480
That's why your hog will go bad before you get it down in there.

917
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,900
You can't sell a single quarter pound of bacon without killing a hog.

918
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,480
You've got to kill that hog sooner or later.

919
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,380
There's only one way to kill that hog.

920
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,840
That's with this knife here.

921
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,200
This one right here.

922
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,940
That my grandpappy gave me.

923
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,720
You're going to have to use this to prove you're man.

924
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,040
Get in there and kill that hog.

925
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:50,140
My granddaddy and his granddaddy before him and his granddaddy before him

926
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:55,980
passed this knife down to the ages just for the killing of the hog.

927
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,540
There's a hog snorting right there.

928
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,440
It's hog killing day.

929
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,520
Get down in there and kill me that hog.

930
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,560
Now do it.

931
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,860
Now do it or you ain't coming back to this family anymore.

932
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,380
You've got to kill the hog just like I did.

933
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,940
Cold blood.

934
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,140
Rassle with it.

935
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,480
Slit its throat.

936
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,460
String it up.

937
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,800
Strang it up.

938
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,640
Strang it up by its heels.

939
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,280
By its hind heels.

940
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,000
That's how...

941
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,320
They've got a bucking ham there.

942
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,340
Cut little sleeves around his little...

943
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,140
Listen to that bucking ham bucking up there.

944
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,360
Next to that buck board.

945
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,220
Its heels just a kicking at that buck board.

946
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,200
It's a bucking ham.

947
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:40,540
Now carefully slice down the middle there and you'll be able to get them guts out without making a big mess.

948
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:45,140
You know that hog operation you got is devastating to the environment.

949
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,880
On warm nights I sit up with my children and I wake up and I vomit from the smell.

950
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:59,440
I put my wife and my two sons and my daughter in my beat up old pickup truck and I drive away from the farm as far as we could.

951
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:00,800
Just to get away.

952
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,520
To get a cliff.

953
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,520
To get a breath without getting sick and puking.

954
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,000
It's horrible horrible smell coming from your hog farm.

955
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,260
Then we stop at the Amish restaurant and order scrapple.

956
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,180
To make us forget our problems.

957
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,380
Scrapple, pork chops, spam.

958
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,320
Might of good.

959
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,420
Thick sliced bacon they got there too.

960
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,160
Not bacon.

961
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,880
No not bacon.

962
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,560
Scrapple.

963
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,360
Then I drop back to my hog farm operation where it's just a smell bad.

964
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,140
That guy's a true subgenius.

965
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,320
What's better than one me a thousand me's.

966
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,460
My family just have projectile vomiting all day long.

967
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,100
We can't keep nothing down from the smell of my hog farm.

968
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:48,340
My hog farm's so nasty I can't even go on it without projectile vomiting.

969
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,660
That's what I'm walking through.

970
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,900
Hit it slashing around by my feet right now.

971
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,760
Sounds like the waves of a mighty lake.

972
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,880
Cooked up.

973
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,920
The tubular nerds album.

974
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
My song.

975
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,440
As sung by Merrill Womack.

976
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,120
Over and over again.

977
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,940
It's the same guy.

978
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:21,260
In this album Merrill Womack has utilized the modern miracle of hi-fi sound and multiple recording techniques to produce a full voice male chorus with as many as 42 different voices all done by one and the same person.

979
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:21,820
Merrill?

980
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,200
Produced in a way that leaves you wondering yet thrilled with the range, precision, emphasis and impact of the Merrill.

981
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:26,560
Merrill did that?

982
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,500
The message in the song.

983
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,540
Oh, it has a message.

984
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,180
When I remember little Merrill from when he was just a little scamper.

985
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,120
Yeah, but you gotta play the back whippersnapper.

986
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,480
So this guy would multitrack along with himself like tubular bells.

987
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,980
He's a one man band.

988
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,080
He could play every instrument.

989
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,640
He's a company.

990
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,200
Employingly. Forever and ever and ever.

991
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,900
Company by Dean Kincaid.

992
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,340
Give me some scrapple.

993
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,140
I need scrapple.

994
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,520
You know, you hog killers.

995
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,480
You got to give away some scrapple and some jerky and some grits.

996
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,880
Give them.

997
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,360
Unless you got a PCP.

998
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,280
We're just giving.

999
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,020
We sell our scrapple.

1000
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:11,560
We don't have enough money to buy food for our children unless we sell our scrapple.

1001
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,960
We have to sell scrapple in order to buy hot dogs, which are a step up.

1002
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,700
Is that like bacon with eyeballs and penis?

1003
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:24,740
Okay, now hot dogs are made out of rectums and penises, right?

1004
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,000
Okay.

1005
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:25,980
Lips.

1006
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,500
Okay.

1007
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:33,640
Scrapple is made out of what's left after they've already taken out the stuff for the hot dogs.

1008
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,360
It's just stuff so gross that they don't even want to talk about it.

1009
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,520
And mix it with corn and hair and cook it up real.

1010
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,580
It smells faintly like hair.

1011
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,880
Smells a little like hair.

1012
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,100
A little bit like bacon.

1013
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,400
A little bit like fried spam.

1014
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,940
It's got a lot of protein, though.

1015
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,960
That's the important thing.

1016
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,360
And a lot of pink slime.

1017
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,280
Yes.

1018
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,040
Yes, scrapple.

1019
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,980
And also the hairs on the inside.

1020
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,480
Pink slime.

1021
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,420
Pink slime.

1022
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,600
That's what I'm talking about.

1023
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,460
Scrapple is the official breakfast of the X Day World Committee.

1024
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,660
Yeah, the X Day X Committee.

1025
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,460
Are you going to play a little?

1026
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,180
We do, actually.

1027
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:16,900
We usually, you can usually get free scrapple at subgenius official X Day events in Ohio.

1028
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,400
Free scrapple, if you know the right people.

1029
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,060
Give me some scrapple.

1030
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,180
Are you going to play a little?

1031
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,260
Give me some scrapple.

1032
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,060
I guess I should.

1033
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:34,060
But, you know, you can eat the insides of people's, you know, intestines and liver and

1034
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,920
kidneys and stuff.

1035
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,380
It's got a lot of vitamins.

1036
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,420
You've got to clean them.

1037
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,660
You've got to wash them out.

1038
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,960
Is that Michael Pepe?

1039
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,460
Oh, yeah.

1040
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,380
You wash them out.

1041
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:41,680
Yep.

1042
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:50,560
And, you know, if you pluck the hairs from people's nostrils and fry them, you get a

1043
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,860
nice little kind of a buzz light.

1044
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,040
Once again, we return to the show.

1045
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,040


1046
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,040


1047
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,040


1048
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,040


1049
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,040


1050
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,040


1051
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,040


1052
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,040


1053
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,900
We're going to turn to that subject of nostril hair.

1054
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,380
Yes.

1055
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,140
Well, nostrils are vital.

1056
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,420
What is it about the theme of this show that has suddenly become an honor?

1057
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,960
Fried nostril hairs on top of it.

1058
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,580
Fried nostril pubic hairs.

1059
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,260
This is a creepy, creepy, creepy subject.

1060
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,440
And you can cook and eat the dirt under your nose.

1061
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,920
A lot of people don't know this.

1062
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,160
If you're starving, just clean out your toenails, set them on fire, cook them up, you know,

1063
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,140
sterilize them, and you can eat them.

1064
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,020
And it's a great way to get rid of the bad stuff.

1065
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,020


1066
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,020


1067
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,020


1068
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,020


1069
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,400
And you can save off, you won't have to eat your companion's buttocks.

1070
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,160
Why wait until you're starving?

1071
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:33,580
But your companion's buttocks seem like they're a lot more palatable than your toenails.

1072
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:33,800
Well, that depends on your...

1073
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,440
There's more protein in a buttock than the average toenail.

1074
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:44,100
Actually, we teach you about this protein in step number four of the patented 13 steps

1075
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,900
to super sexy sales success.

1076
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,020
Oh, not that again.

1077
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,260
The 13th step.

1078
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,800
The 13th step.

1079
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:49,820
You get to say 8% extra steps.

1080
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,500
Dr. Drummond's patented 13 steps to super sexy sales success.

1081
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,220
8% extra steps.

1082
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,000
Dr. Drummond's patented 13 steps to super sexy sales success.

1083
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:54,680
Wow.

1084
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:00,840
With our 8% more steps than your average 12-step course.

1085
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,100
Yeah, 8% extra steps.

1086
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,100


1087
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,200
You know, I don't even need the extra 12 steps.

1088
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,100
I'm already too sexy.

1089
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,820
You're too sexy.

1090
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,140
Yeah.

1091
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:11,700
Well, good thing about Dr. Drummond's patented 13 steps in step number four...

1092
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,520
Six.

1093
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,560
Six.

1094
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:13,660
Six.

1095
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:13,860
Step back.

1096
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,120
Yes, step number six.

1097
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:21,040
We teach you how to detone your super sexy self into a less super sexy sex self.

1098
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,940
Oh, just so the people are more comfortable.

1099
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,000
Yeah.

1100
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,000


1101
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,000


1102
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,000


1103
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,000


1104
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,000


1105
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,000


1106
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,500
I'm not comfortable with you.

1107
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,080
Well, there's sexiness, right?

1108
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,300
Yeah, because people just can't handle the full on total sexiness.

1109
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,100
Right.

1110
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,800
We let, we help you tone down your sexiness.

1111
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,020
Yeah.

1112
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,880
But not in a way that's demeaning to you.

1113
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,180
Right.

1114
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:35,640
What about...

1115
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,720
Dr. Drummondian pheromones simply overcome all inhibitions.

1116
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,940
Everybody thinks we should...

1117
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,720
That's in step six too.

1118
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,620
We cover that fully in step six.

1119
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,280
We spend about six weeks on it in step six.

1120
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,360
Six weeks to a new sexy?

1121
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:51,800
Six.

1122
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,680
Six weeks.

1123
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:52,740
Yes.

1124
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:52,980
Six weeks.

1125
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:52,980


1126
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:52,980


1127
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:52,980


1128
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:52,980


1129
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:52,980


1130
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:52,980


1131
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:52,980


1132
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,240
Well, we can't do that in step six.

1133
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:53,240


1134
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,300
In step six.

1135
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,800
You know, you'll be moving on to other, like other subjects in step seven, you'll be learning

1136
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,440
the secrets to radio technology.

1137
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,880
So you'll stay there at step seven, your whole life.

1138
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:08,500
Oh!

1139
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:08,500


1140
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,700
So you can plug your nostril hairs into the radio.

1141
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,700
You just stay there.

1142
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,300
You're just there all the time.

1143
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,140
Step seven.

1144
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:22,000
Step seven in radio repair, you may be, you may get into the expanding, the mind expanding

1145
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,660
and the...

1146
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,960
Huge, fast-growing market of radio repair.

1147
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,480
The nostrils are the center of the soul.

1148
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,260
People know this.

1149
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,220
People are listening to their radios smarter than they should.

1150
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,320
They're listening really, really hard, and it wears the radio out.

1151
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:37,920
That's right.

1152
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,820
You have to take your radio in and get it fixed.

1153
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,460
The nostril is like the sunroof of the soul.

1154
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,580
I know.

1155
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,140
And people wear their hair out too much.

1156
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,240
The sunroof of the soul.

1157
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,720
It rubs it down.

1158
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,020
Well, that begs the question, Reverend Stan.

1159
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:57,120
If the nostril is the sunroof of the soul, what is the moonroof of the soul?

1160
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,160
That hole that they drilled at the top of your head in Dogstown, Dr. Drummond?

1161
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:04,680
Yeah.

1162
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,540
Ah, yes.

1163
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,360
Oh.

1164
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,440
And it's so much cooler inside.

1165
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:08,760
Yeah.

1166
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,760
I just felt really so much tension when that happened to me, when that was done.

1167
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,140
I just didn't have thoughts anymore.

1168
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,660
I wasn't burdened by thinking.

1169
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:25,220
The heat of the thinking rises out the top.

1170
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:25,740
Yeah.

1171
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,380
You're so much cooler.

1172
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:27,800
Yeah.

1173
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,740
You're a cooler person, and the chicks did.

1174
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,200
Exactly, because they know you're not thinking.

1175
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,220
They know you're rocks.

1176
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:39,860
You're not going to notice how pathetic they are, because you're mindless.

1177
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:45,040
You've given up that thing that held you back in society.

1178
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,140
Yeah.

1179
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:46,820
It just happened.

1180
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,620
So, Michael, what's going on over there in the city by the bay?

1181
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:56,820
Oh, well, you know, we're fighting the use of computers to try to get my internet access.

1182
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:57,860
Oh, yeah?

1183
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:02,920
I'm trying to get Mac on dial-up, which is from a 20-year-old dream.

1184
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:08,140
You've got like a modem that's like a 9,600-baud modem, though.

1185
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,500
A 2,400-baud modem.

1186
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,120
I just bought a modem.

1187
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:16,800
I even have the modem so I can have dial-up.

1188
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,180
I have dial-up for my Mac, but I tried it today, and you can't even get video.

1189
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,740
You can't get the foreign videos I want.

1190
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,840
Not on dial-up.

1191
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:26,300
No.

1192
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,060
Not on dial-up.

1193
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:27,480
No.

1194
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,120
No.

1195
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,080
Not on AOL.

1196
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,100
It's kind of like that time we went to the all-you-can-eat place.

1197
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,140
Yeah.

1198
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:34,540
Oh.

1199
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:39,840
You could only dial-up a sip of mashed potatoes at a time.

1200
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,480
I know.

1201
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,080
Those days of Shoney's.

1202
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:42,640
Yeah.

1203
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,440
I just don't want to pay $20 a month.

1204
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:45,880
That's all.

1205
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,220
I'm trying to get it.

1206
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:46,560
Oh, God.

1207
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,560
You had to wait an hour just for one strip of bacon to come through.

1208
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,200
Yeah, but we paid $20 for all the lobster you could eat.

1209
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,080
Yum.

1210
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,300
But then, you know, we went years ago.

1211
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,440
I went to one.

1212
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,680
They were called Yellow Houses down by LA.

1213
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,220
A series of all-you-can-eat.

1214
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,080
And they came in and said we couldn't eat anymore.

1215
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:03,940
Wow.

1216
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,580
Because you were eating all-you-can-eat.

1217
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,500
We were food monsters in those days.

1218
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,780
Tis a remorseless eating machine.

1219
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,440
It was an all-we-care.

1220
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,180
All-we-care.

1221
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,080
All-we-care for you to eat.

1222
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,420
Try it and have all-we-care for you to eat.

1223
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,140
Yeah.

1224
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,340
All we want to eat for you to eat.

1225
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,040
All we think is good for you to eat.

1226
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,640
This is all making me hungry for Scrapple.

1227
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,740
Didn't they have a Scrapple shop in Berkeley?

1228
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,680
What about a Scrapple donut?

1229
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,340
We'll go to the 24-hour Scrapple shop.

1230
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,740
Actually, the people that...

1231
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,920
When I used to go into Scrapple donuts as a child,

1232
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,500
because my grandmother lived just a block away from here,

1233
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,280
and it had Scrapple-eating Minnesotan.

1234
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,280
Big, two-round, big, white,

1235
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,880
blonde Minnesotans who ran that place.

1236
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,440
It was slightly different in its configuration.

1237
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,340
And they loved Scrapple.

1238
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,600
And they were chunky and...

1239
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,160
They were happy, happy people.

1240
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:55,820
They said, eh.

1241
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:56,540
They said, eh.

1242
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,480
They said, eh.

1243
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:57,880
Yeah.

1244
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,180
They were Minnesotan.

1245
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,060
But I was looking up...

1246
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:00,740
Is that Bishop Joey?

1247
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,740
Canadians from Canada.

1248
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,120
Are you Bishop Joey or am I Bishop Joey?

1249
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,100
Oh, my God.

1250
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,780
It's Mr. Shipping Pants.

1251
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,020
It's Mr. Shipping Pants.

1252
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,580
You must be on the bus somewhere.

1253
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,620
Are you on the bus?

1254
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,120
No, that's Dick Cheney.

1255
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:14,800
I didn't know.

1256
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,440
I didn't know he was listening.

1257
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,120
Oh, my God.

1258
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:20,060
We're headed for Los Angeles to take over Los Angeles.

1259
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:20,960
Oh, my God.

1260
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:21,800
That's right.

1261
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,860
Bishop Joey is doing it for you.

1262
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,620
He's going to sacrifice for you.

1263
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,540
Take over.

1264
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,060
He's always been that way.

1265
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,480
So magnanimous in his benevolence.

1266
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:32,980
He's humble, too.

1267
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:33,960
He's very humble.

1268
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:34,780
Don't forget humble.

1269
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,140
I learned everything I know about humility from Bishop Joey.

1270
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,020
When you look in the dictionary, you know,

1271
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,380
the O-E-D, there's a picture of Bishop Joey.

1272
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:43,960
It's humble.

1273
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:44,600
Under humble.

1274
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,980
We'll see Bishop Joey.

1275
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Under humiliation.

1276
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,200
I mean, humility.

1277
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,940
That guy that you think is George Washington, that's Bishop Joey.

1278
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,120
Yeah, yeah.

1279
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,160
Yeah, they put it under the wrong spot there.

1280
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:55,520
That's right.

1281
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,900
Now, what is this for?

1282
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,640
Some sort of crash phony movie?

1283
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,240
It's a movie.

1284
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:10,420
It's an in-depth emotional documentary about the decadent events that led up to Bishop

1285
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,040
Joey going down to L.A.

1286
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:13,460
Wow.

1287
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,660
No, I want to see that.

1288
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,040
It's just now climaxing.

1289
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,360
I'd pay 50 bucks to see that.

1290
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:17,540
It's a historical moment.

1291
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,440
I have a film.

1292
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:18,860
Yeah.

1293
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,900
I'm going to pay 50 bucks to it.

1294
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:21,780
I'm going to.

1295
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,100
I'm on KG.

1296
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:23,920
Yeah.

1297
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,880
A big donut.

1298
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,440
The film crew is following me right now, and the film crew is shooting the last scene.

1299
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,000
Big effect donut.

1300
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:28,660
They will edit.

1301
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,360
Oh, my God.

1302
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,860
Oh, your God is right.

1303
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,500
Before it goes on.

1304
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,020
Okay.

1305
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,700
It's like the History Channel.

1306
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:34,100
Oh.

1307
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:35,300
Oh.

1308
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:36,960
Oh.

1309
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,140
Oh.

1310
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:39,500
Oh.

1311
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:40,700
Oh.

1312
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:40,840


1313
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:43,440
Oh.

1314
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:44,640
Oh.

1315
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:44,640


1316
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:44,640


1317
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:44,640


1318
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:44,640


1319
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:44,640


1320
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:44,640


1321
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:44,640


1322
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,980
Oh.

1323
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,780
exclusives.

1324
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:07,780


1325
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:07,780


1326
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:07,940
allegedly was no perilous vacay and took another knee shot.

1327
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:07,940


1328
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,180
Oh, boy.

1329
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:14,640
. . . . it's . . . . yes . . . . . . . the doctor beanbags—and everything was fine for the在人之間,

1330
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,980
Bernard Beanbag, the locally renowned and internationally beloved radio psychiatrist,

1331
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:27,960
is out again to answer your craziest questions with utter candor.

1332
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,720
Thank you, Ted.

1333
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:36,200
Tonight's first letter comes to us all the way from Amousis Hole, Nebraska.

1334
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:41,820
Dear Dr. Beanbag, please tell me what to do.

1335
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:49,340
Our pretty little 13-year-old daughter, Liza, has started to hang around our local service station.

1336
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,340
And when I say hang around, I mean just that.

1337
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:58,100
She's a frankly precocious and well-built girl for her tender years, and doctor, we're worried.

1338
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:05,860
You see, she has developed a crush all over her body for a sleazy 19-year-old boy who works the pumps.

1339
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,520
And believe me, he's a bad scout.

1340
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,420
We told her she was not to see him again.

1341
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:11,760
And...

1342
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,020
Although she skulked for several days and would not come out from under the couch, she seemed to be behaving.

1343
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:22,320
On a hunch, I checked the couch at 11.30 one night and found she was not under it.

1344
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:29,660
I sent my husband down to the service station, and sure enough, he returned with a full tank on, some blue chip stamps, and our daughter.

1345
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,560
Last week, the boy's picture was in the paper in connection with a holdup.

1346
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,420
We feel relieved because we know now he's in jail.

1347
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,040
But Liza's taking it so hard we don't know how to deal with her.

1348
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,700
The girl refuses to...

1349
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,780
She's not going to eat and looks like the wrath of God.

1350
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:51,180
Furthermore, she insists on sleeping in the dress she was wearing last time she saw him because she says it smells like him.

1351
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,440
It smells like gasoline.

1352
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,840
And we're afraid to smoke in the house, which is driving us crazy.

1353
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,360
Thank God we're an all-electric family.

1354
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,060
Are we wrong?

1355
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,000
Signed, Flameless.

1356
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,000
Dear Mrs. Flameless,

1357
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,640
Wrong isn't exactly right.

1358
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:17,900
Your little Liza sounds like a normal, rambunctious child to me, considering her youthful age.

1359
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,460
And after all, don't you want your daughter to marry someone with this picture in the paper?

1360
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:26,200
Besides, as a youngster, I myself loved the aroma of gasoline.

1361
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:34,440
And for quite a few years, until college at least, I used to carry a small hanky soaked in Premium 66, my favorite brand.

1362
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:39,900
As a matter of fact, Liza sounds like any somewhat disturbed, normal teenager

1363
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,740
undergoing the first beautiful and gifted life.

1364
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,200
I don't think she's a woman.

1365
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:46,580
I think she's a woman.

1366
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:51,820
All she really needs is a little professional understanding from an understanding professional adult.

1367
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:55,420
Why not have her give me a call next time she's down this way?

1368
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:01,360
A trip might do her all the good in the world, and once out of the home environment, you'll be able to smoke again.

1369
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,360
And perhaps I can pump her for some further information.

1370
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,940
And now, Dr. Beanbag,

1371
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:18,720
an interesting inquiry from a troubled listener living in Mixville, Channel City, New Jersey.

1372
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,320
Hi there, Dr. Beanbag.

1373
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,700
I'm a carefree bachelor, 42 years old.

1374
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,760
I live in a hut with my Hawaiian stepmother.

1375
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:32,640
I support myself by repairing stolen color TV sets and throwing Stanley parties for parolees on weekend leave.

1376
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,740
Now, hear about it.

1377
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,020
It's not an exciting life, but at least it keeps the grass up over our heads.

1378
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,840
Anyway, I...

1379
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,440
I've recently developed a nagging problem, and I hope you can help us about it.

1380
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,880
My stepmother, Laverne, is suffering from strange behavior.

1381
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,620
She... well, she barks like a dog late at night.

1382
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:54,540
She sleeps under my bed, howls when they test the air raid warden's sirens,

1383
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,700
and acts as though she's never been housebroken whenever we have those unwanted guests.

1384
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:05,280
My friends all say she's sick, but, you know, she is my mother, and I love her.

1385
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,040
What should I do?

1386
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,740
Signed, hopelessly perplexed.

1387
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,020
Dear Hopelessly,

1388
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:19,120
Too many old-fashioned people believe that slightly eccentric behavior is an excuse to shunt our loved ones off to mental institutions, and there's an end to it.

1389
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:26,700
Well, today, with our asylums packed to overloading with hardcore addicts, hard-nosed political prisoners, and smart-alecky schizophrenics,

1390
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,400
who, by the way, take up twice as much room,

1391
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,360
it's no wonder you're perplexed, Hopelessly.

1392
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:37,800
Those of us left in society must now learn to cope without expensive professional help.

1393
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,820
After all, we all know that we're not alone.

1394
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:44,180
We all know that mental illness is a popular national disease, and we must all play our parts.

1395
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,900
So I advise you to humor your stepmother.

1396
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,020
Stock up on doggy donuts.

1397
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,720
Train her to a leash and take her out on a regular basis.

1398
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,060
Praise her when she rolls over.

1399
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:02,120
And speaking of that, a rolled-up newspaper slapped against your thigh will keep her in line, and perhaps even stop her from howling.

1400
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,120
Count your blessings, Hopelessly. Just think.

1401
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,140
You've got a swell companion, a good guard dog,

1402
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:11,800
and if you come across an equally eccentric male friend of good stock,

1403
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,640
you might consider raising puppies for fun and profits in your spare time.

1404
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:22,780
After all, she's adding color, suspense, and excitement to an otherwise dull and desperate existence.

1405
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,760
Get out of that rut, Perplexed.

1406
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,880
Thank you very much for that one, Doctor.

1407
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,420
Our next communication is postmarked simply,

1408
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:31,740
Bismarck.

1409
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:36,720
Dear Doctor,

1410
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,740
This letter may be hard to read because I am writing it in invisible ink.

1411
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,720
But it is unfortunately the only way I can do anything around here anymore.

1412
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:56,900
Furthermore, I am writing it in the dark, so please excuse me if the words don't conform to the lines on the paper.

1413
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,480
I really have a serious problem that you need my help on.

1414
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,040
My family is trying to drive me crazy.

1415
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,120
I know you're lying.

1416
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:19,080
I know you're not stupid and screwy.

1417
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,360
You give a damn message to my sister on the phone all the time

1418
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:20,420
and I don't spend a damn day47

1419
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:23,820
and I just let you do what always notice to do.

1420
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:24,720
Never again!

1421
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:24,840
We've done it, if you wouldn't mind,

1422
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,420
This was a video for Mr. The Wolf.

1423
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:37,140
In what way is this a video for Mr. The Wolf?

1424
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,340
So, dang-dong, dang-dong, dang-dong, romantic interludes and stiff wet nights.

1425
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,540
Come on, you all-day suckers, you all-night fakers.

1426
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:50,580
Give me a break, give me a break, give me a break, give me a break, or I'll break, or I'll break, or I'll break, or I'll break, or I'll break, or I'll break.

1427
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,480
Yours truly.

1428
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,160
P.S.

1429
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,860
Come on, Doc, cut it out.

1430
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,920
No, don't turn around.

1431
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,640
Just tell me, please, what is narcolepsy?

1432
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,400
Is it punishable under law?

1433
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,500
Someone told me what I meant, but I forgot.

1434
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:18,300
If you help me, believe me, I'll never forgive it.

1435
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,260
I'm listening, I'm literate.

1436
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,660
Signed, George Papoon.

1437
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,640
Not insane.

1438
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:30,800
Well, no, you're not insane, George.

1439
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,260
Narcolepsy refers to automatic,

1440
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,580
or robot behavior,

1441
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,060
robot behavior,

1442
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,340
known to be a symptom of

1443
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,220
Kraffner's disease,

1444
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,080
or creeping epilepsy,

1445
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,700
whichever comes first.

1446
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,080
Both characterized by spiking,

1447
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,860
Croft's ego-discontrol, amnesia, and confabulation,

1448
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,720
although not necessarily.

1449
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,060
Order that in.

1450
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,280
Or verse vice.

1451
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,660
Please, Mr. Papoon, don't lose any sleep over it.

1452
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,760
They're just trying to scare you

1453
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,820
like they do on television.

1454
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,840
And remember, it takes two to play the game.

1455
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,360
And after all, a little adrenaline

1456
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,680
never really hurt anyone.

1457
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:11,740
Well, that's all the time we have tonight like every night,

1458
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,280
so please, if you are suffering,

1459
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,400
write to Dr. Beanbag.

1460
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,820
Send me your inquiries, no matter how queer.

1461
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:22,100
Remember, a healthy mind is full of excuses.

1462
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,440
Excuse me, and good night.

1463
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,060
Tonight's Dr. Beanbag show was brought to you

1464
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,940

1465

Of our Best Buy Best Book Club warehouse,

1468
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,340
which also carries the book of the subgenius,

1469
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,540

1470
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:45,900
Eyelash and Neighbor World,

00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,260

My email is stang at subgenius.com.

1475
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,880
And now this for you 40-year-old boys out there

1476
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,280
my son's age.

1477
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,840
It's just the time.

1478
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,420
Now we've made a stand.

1479
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,240
And for now the powers of darkness

1480
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,140
have been driven from the land.

1481
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:18,900
The battle's over but the war has just begun.

1482
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,020
And this wait will remain

1483
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,400
till the day when all the world

1484
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:29,980
transforms.

1485
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:33,960
Oh, the peace,

1486
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:34,300
the peace,

1487
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:34,300


1488
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:34,660
the peace,

1489
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:35,600


1490
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,020
the peace,

1491
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:40,680
the peace,
