1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,380
It's a super placebo, so only take half of it if you're unsure whether you can handle it or not.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,560
Alright, doctor, go ahead.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,840
First paranoia. Intense. Terrible. Unreasoning terror.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,920
What then?

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:13,760
Then...

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,260
I see.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,000
You know that one man is responsible for it all.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:21,720
Yes.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,580
The man who lied when the truth would have cleared you.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,460
Phase two.

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,740
The man who called himself...

12
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,120
Bob.

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,500
...is in an induced psychotic state.

14
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,820
Uncontrollably happy.

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,660
He's at large somewhere in the city and is potentially dangerous to others and to himself.

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:36,840
Stand by.

17
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,520
Shut up.

18
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,060
Five.

19
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:38,980
Four.

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,160
Three.

21
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,280
Two.

22
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:42,440
One.

23
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,720
Zero.

24
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,820
Stand by.

25
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,580
Just shut up.

26
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,540
In any event, I'd better be with you to administer the antidote.

27
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,660
This will cut short the effect and...

28
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,440
Shut up.

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,980
...greatly ease any after effects.

30
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,540
F

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,000
It's futuristic

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,940
Which is why I've never recorded out of this

33
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,480
This is the first time for me

34
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,060
And the last time I was in this station

35
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,180
It was in another time and place

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,300
Another world

37
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,900
A lost world

38
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,220
Lost in banned stickers and posters

39
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,280
You don't want to know what I had to do

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,740
To consecrate this station

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,740
Oh but I thought this was your first time

42
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,080
Oh yeah

43
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,640
It's my first time in this studio

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,460
But this is where I come and slip the show

45
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,240
Into automation

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,860
For later

47
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,020
So it's sort of a

48
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,120
Robotic sort of show

49
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,920
Yeah kind of like sex

50
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,940
Yeah

51
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,540
They don't let us do that

52
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,160
In Cleveland

53
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,660
The sex

54
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,180
Are you sure?

55
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,260
Or the robots

56
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,740
We can't use robots

57
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,020
Some person has to be there

58
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,680
To run the robot

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,880
It runs

60
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,220
They

61
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,400
They

62
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,440
They

63
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,900
Have to sit at a sort of a bicycle looking thing

64
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,380
And pedal

65
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,780
To run the robot

66
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,500
That explains your incredibly

67
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,980
Incredibly attractive legs

68
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,780
Why thank you

69
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,800
You like my stockings too?

70
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,340
Yes

71
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,880
We dressed up special for Dragon Con

72
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,160
We're in town

73
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,100
You're the only man I know who can wear heels like that

74
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,940
Listen to that

75
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,480
Swinging jazzy music

76
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,200
In the background

77
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,960
Oh it's perfect

78
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,740
It's perfect

79
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,320
It's sort of

80
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,940
Tickling

81
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,160
Sort of like tickling

82
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,180
The three suns

83
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,260
Ah

84
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,940
Big fever

85
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,600
The three suns

86
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,480
Oh I really

87
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,060
I thought it was

88
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,280
Giant walrus swim

89
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,440
Not my three suns

90
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,060
Susie Staifert's song

91
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,960
Where's she going?

92
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,940
She said the elephants were hot

93
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,320
She's gone to take them for a swim

94
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,480
Come on baby

95
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,540
Dumbo

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,300
Well go get a gun

97
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,060
And follow her

98
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,640
And see that you

99
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't think I can go fast enough

100
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,540
Big wanna

101
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,780
Now by the way

102
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,900
Station rules say

103
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,700
Do not gripe about station equipment

104
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,900
While on the air

105
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,220
Now I don't know that that's this station rules

106
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,060
And it's certainly not WCSB station rules

107
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,800
But I know it's KPFA station rules

108
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,920
Cause Filer

109
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,120
Deliberately reads that rule all the time

110
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,900
While griping

111
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,460
About the equipment

112
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,300
Shall we sing a song of complaint

113
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,720
Complaint

114
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,660
About KPFA?

115
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,360
Well

116
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,380
It wouldn't be applicable would it?

117
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,280
No

118
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,740
You're not listening to KPFA

119
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,000
In Berkeley

120
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,040
You want to be abducted by a large

121
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,800
A large male

122
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,040
A large flying machine comes down

123
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,540
Frozen oat eskimo pops right?

124
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,680
Oat pops

125
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,300
Yeah oat pops

126
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,520
They are

127
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,160
That place I'm trying to

128
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,500
On the way on 14

129
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,360
On the way to Broadway

130
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,900
Just throw your trash in there

131
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,440
Okay

132
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,260
It's so close

133
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,580
It's a Korean place on the north side of the street

134
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,580
You know you just want to

135
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,580
Two blocks from Broadway

136
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,740
Right here right here

137
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,860
And he's a nice little caller

138
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,440
All clean and friendly

139
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,740
Blowing my ears out

140
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,060
All praise

141
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,320
What are you doing awake at this hour sir?

142
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,100
I'm doing a change here

143
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,920
Uh-huh

144
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,360
Uh-huh

145
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,120
Right here

146
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,520
How it do?

147
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,000
I hate the way it does that

148
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,700
When you don't intend for it to

149
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,740
Have to go now

150
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,500
Ok

151
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:14,920
Ok

152
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,440
Deniable plausibility

153
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,860
Implausible undeniability

154
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,360
Is more like what you have

155
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,820
I have

156
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,040
Now I can hear your

157
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,300
Your dulcet tones real well Susie

158
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,200
My dulcet tones are going to crap out by tomorrow night.

159
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,020
Everyone at the Divival we're doing at Dragon Con tomorrow night

160
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,740
is going to hear Reverend Ivan Stang reading my rant

161
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,600
because my voice is going to fail.

162
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,840
And he swears he's going to do it in his girly voice.

163
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,500
I'll do it in my girl voice.

164
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,340
I'll sound just like Boogie Boy.

165
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,320
Well, Mr. Stang there, I've got to tell you, you sound like Ray Stevens.

166
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,160
I don't know. I think you sound more like Ray Stevens.

167
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,080
You'll have to dress apart, though.

168
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,940
Do I have to talk like a real, real, real deep-voiced southern man, then,

169
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,480
to balance it out?

170
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,500
Yeah, yeah.

171
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,060
I can work on that. I'll certainly do.

172
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,140
Yeah, I actually could.

173
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,200
It seems like Pisces would do better with the ventriloquism of you.

174
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,100
Yeah, but I'd have to stick my head with our music.

175
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,700
Do we have to work your mouth like a sock puppet,

176
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,560
a person with his hand up a sock puppet?

177
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,380
Wow. I'd pay good money for that.

178
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,060
Some people would.

179
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,260
I will.

180
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,500
I got, I recently had someone pay me to not do that.

181
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,580
Yeah.

182
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,000
I got, I got $60, which is the amount of two memberships,

183
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,300
to not do that.

184
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,200
And thus, I will leave you now,

185
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,760
and make way for the beautiful Priestess Pisces.

186
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,300
Here we are.

187
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,800
She may have a surprise for you. I don't know.

188
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,180
But in the meantime, there's one thing I want to leave you with,

189
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,980
and that is that,

190
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,080
one rule of Bob, the one rule of the Church of the Subgenius,

191
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,340
fuck them if they can't take a joke.

192
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,020
Praise Bob, praise Princess Pisces, praise Dragon Con,

193
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,520
and all you fucked up weirdos on drugs.

194
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,580
Let's see here.

195
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,220
Years ago, I found out that I had a dog's head in my eyeball.

196
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,920
Which is not something you want to find out.

197
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,980
I am the party!

198
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,300
The party!

199
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,240
The party!

200
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,100
The party!

201
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,400
The party!

202
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,300
Where's the party?

203
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,440
Where's the cup?

204
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,180
You know what?

205
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll tell you what's gonna happen to you, boy.

206
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,260
Because if you don't find yourself some salvation,

207
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,060
there's going to be some saucers coming on July 5th,

208
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,400
and they're gonna burn you, boy.

209
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,200
They will burn you to a crisp.

210
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,060
We're not talking about some

211
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,720
monotheistic hell kind of burning here.

212
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,180
Because you see, these aliens,

213
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,600
they thrive off your pain.

214
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,420
They thrive off your suffering.

215
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,380
And all they want to do is come to Earth

216
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,760
and kill each and every one of you

217
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,680
in the slowest, most painful possible way ever.

218
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,460
You're gonna have to go through this.

219
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,880
I think I'm having a flashback.

220
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,440
It's a flash-forward, but you're sitting in the wrong direction.

221
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,740
I think I'm finally coming down from that stuff.

222
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,600
Oh, yeah.

223
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,400
Wow.

224
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,640
It was Pup Torb.

225
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,940
We've been doing a lot of Pup Torb.

226
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,320
And the jinkum.

227
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,940
Yeah, the jinkum's good.

228
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,540
You know, DragonCon actually has some great jinkum.

229
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,420
Yeah, they're having jinkum room parties.

230
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,860
And I'd hate to be the housekeeping staff.

231
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,240
Yes.

232
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,040
In fact, when we're done here, we've got a lot of them.

233
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,180
I've been invited to a jinkum room party, I believe.

234
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,260
On good quality jinkum.

235
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:55,620
BYOB.

236
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,340
Right.

237
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,360
Bring your own bathroom.

238
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:57,980
Right.

239
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,680
Right.

240
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,640
God, this music makes me feel like I'm in a psychedelic supermarket.

241
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,520
We are, aren't we?

242
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,360
Is that a bad thing?

243
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,740
I mean, look, they have a jinkum coffee.

244
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,900
I'm not getting any.

245
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,940
I'm being dry-gulched with the music.

246
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,800
I bet I'm not even going out on this.

247
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,860
You're going out.

248
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,540
No, you're going out.

249
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,560
You're going down, baby.

250
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,680
No, not putting out.

251
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,620
Not putting out.

252
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,060
Not going down.

253
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,680
Not putting out.

254
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,800
No, you're going out just fine.

255
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,800
I can hear you crying.

256
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,020
I'm going down.

257
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,160
Ladies and gentlemen, I may be the only person in this room who can hear out of a ear.

258
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,420
Yeah, that's true.

259
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,860
She doesn't have the cicadas.

260
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,160
No, no.

261
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,620
I have fogginess in one and clear in the other.

262
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:42,980
And I can hear you clear as a church bell if this church of some genius had such bells.

263
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,180
A church bell with a knob that goes all the way up to 11.

264
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,180
Exactly.

265
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,620
My vision is going.

266
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,780
My hearing is working.

267
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,380
My sense of smell is getting worse, but my sense of smell is getting more finely owned.

268
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,180
This stinking world.

269
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,120
That's really a shame.

270
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:57,840
That is.

271
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,520
It sucks.

272
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,640
You would think there would be some other compensation.

273
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,360
Yeah.

274
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,580
Some dispensation, like increase in tactile sensation.

275
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,960
Well, I thought it might be a side effect of the third nostril.

276
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,080
I can plug two with the third one.

277
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,340
Well, you feel, you do, as you age, you do get an increase in tactile sensations in your

278
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:17,920
joints.

279
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,760
Ah.

280
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,900
Your knees, your ankles, your elbows.

281
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:27,140
I've also heard that the only things that actually don't stop growing in your body with

282
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,200
age are your nose and your ears.

283
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,620
That's increasingly obvious from what I'm looking at right now, St. Mariner.

284
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,260
My Virginia Dentata.

285
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,180
Wasn't that going to be a new subgenius church name for somebody?

286
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,340
Reverend Virginia Dentata.

287
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,740
It sounds good.

288
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,180
It's available.

289
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,140
It needs to be.

290
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,280
It needs to be.

291
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,740
A girl with a nose.

292
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,320
I feel like Virginia Dentata is going to be available all the time.

293
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,960
It's up on eBay.

294
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,420
I think somebody owns the name.

295
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,020
It's kind of something.

296
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,680
Yeah, by now.

297
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,480
It's been a jazzy, squatted name.

298
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,700
She's a toothsome lass.

299
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,420
In fact, maybe we should name squat and then I can sell the names and that's an idea.

300
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,120
Yeah.

301
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,720
I mean, it should work.

302
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,220
Yeah, they do it with domains.

303
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:14,300
This music is making me feel like I'm at Woodstock or smoking, what do they call that stuff?

304
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,140
Marijuana.

305
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:16,960
Or...

306
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,160
I never...

307
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,320
I never actually did that.

308
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,060
You know, it's funny.

309
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:26,060
I've had several people at that science fiction convention would walk up to me and go, Reverend

310
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,520
Stank, do you smoke pot, right?

311
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,940
And I'd look at them and go, do I look like somebody who would smoke pot?

312
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,900
I ask you, radio listeners.

313
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,520
You know, I mean, give me a break.

314
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,480
Let's see.

315
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,140
You look like you've got long hair and you've got them goatees like...

316
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,480
Like them hippies seem to have.

317
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,600
Pot smokers have to hide so they wouldn't want to look like pot smokers.

318
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,900
And that hip-to-roach clip that you hold up in front of you looking pitiful.

319
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,980
Oh, and that...

320
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,020
You said that was a UFO detector, but it's...

321
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,080
No, it's actually a UFO deflector.

322
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,640
Oh.

323
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,520
You misheard me.

324
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,380
I have never...

325
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,460
Is that why they haven't shown up, Stank?

326
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,820
Stank has been stank.

327
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,200
No, UFOs.

328
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,320
I'm not talking about excess.

329
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,140
I'm talking about excess.

330
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,940
I'm talking about unidentified flying oddities.

331
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,680
Well, I suppose that would be right.

332
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:28,200
You know, no account greys and your silly little zeta reticulans and your pathetic saucer

333
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,900
crashers, those little Roswellian creatures that can't even fly right.

334
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,820
Give me a break.

335
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:41,200
You think they have some sort of screening test before they put them behind the wheel?

336
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,560
Sort of a...

337
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,800
What about this hippie music?

338
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,280
Now I'm being...

339
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:51,500
For some reason, I want to go join the Army and sit around in a draft station.

340
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,980
Sit here on the Group W bench.

341
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,060
I just sit here on the Group W bench.

342
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,640
But we're all in an Army.

343
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,900
We're in an Army for the goal of slack.

344
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,500
And we fight the anti-slack every minute of the day.

345
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,060
We march our boots, walking through the...

346
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,380
I fight anti-slack by laying in bed...

347
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,040
September, September, September, September.

348
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,340
Yes.

349
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,820
...and eating and watching TV.

350
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,060
That's how I fight.

351
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Eating at Alice's restaurant

352
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,380
Because it was private

353
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,240
I wish you guys wouldn't make fun

354
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,360
I'm going to tell Sergeant Dobbs on you

355
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,640
Sergeant Dobbs

356
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,420
Sergeant Dobbs

357
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,200
They're making fun of my privates again

358
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,100
I can't hear you

359
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,240
It's about

360
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,680
It's all about

361
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,140
Shazam Captain Dobbs

362
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,360
He's Colonel O'Truth

363
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,180
Over there

364
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,580
Colonel what?

365
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,020
Colonel O'Truth

366
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,780
I don't think he's Colonel O'Truth

367
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,000
Maybe he's

368
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,620
General Maylaise

369
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,540
Yeah maybe

370
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,060
Speaking of Maylaise

371
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,800
Did you see some of those girls tonight?

372
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,880
Sorry

373
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,080
Sorry

374
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,480
, I guess I may have noticed

375
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,140
You know

376
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,840
It's a baited field of trim over there

377
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,680
But they are all unsaved souls

378
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,880
We have to do something about this

379
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,480
I saw things wrapped in gold lame

380
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,640
That should be saved from the

381
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,460
Impending doom of the exes

382
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,260
I saw things where nothing but duct tape

383
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,160
That could use a little saving too

384
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,200
I brought some

385
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,500
But really, really

386
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,940
The word has to get out to these

387
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,420
Poor souls

388
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,600
We have to fight the good fight

389
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,840
As much as we would like to relax

390
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,940
And slack off

391
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,620
And as much as Stag would like to sit down

392
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,860
And eat submarine sandwiches

393
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,180
And lay in cushy hotel beds

394
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,240
We can't do that at all

395
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,060
We have to keep fighting

396
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,620
Yeah, I'm in the streets

397
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,800
Working for him while he lies on his duvet

398
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,460
Actually

399
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,800
It wasn't even my bed I was laying on

400
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,880
Sucking all them little bottles

401
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,520
I can barely hear these wimpy voiced girls

402
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,400
Over that music

403
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,480
Ah

404
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,660
Ah

405
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,460
Ah

406
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:18,900
Ah

407
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,520
Ah

408
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:19,920
Ah

409
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,240
Ah

410
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,220
No, seriously

411
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,400
No, no, no, Susie

412
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,120
Other way

413
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,940
Other way

414
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,540
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

415
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,580
It's your high-pitched chicken voices

416
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,900
They're the same pitch as the

417
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,840
Cicadas in my head

418
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,460
And a lot of the music

419
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,880
Cicada music

420
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Cicada music

421
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,440
That would be an interesting thing

422
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,300
An evening of cicada music

423
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,840
And an evening

424
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,780
Mature hippopotamus waddle

425
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,120
Was the name of that tune

426
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,080
Oh my god, he did that

427
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,860
Oh

428
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,380
No

429
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,600
No, he hasn't done anything

430
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,100
I've just been naming songs

431
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,720
That was Alice's Restaurant

432
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,240
That's why I got a phone in my mic

433
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,820
Where I can't hear any of the music

434
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,280
On the headphones

435
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,580
That was the supermarket

436
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,040
Or elevator version

437
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,120
Of Alice's Restaurant

438
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,060
You know, I knew that the end times

439
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,020
Were coming when I

440
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,060
When I was walking through the supermarket

441
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,560
And heard the Muzak version

442
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,340
Of the times they are a-changing

443
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,180
Oh, man

444
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,320
I've heard

445
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,200
I've also been in an elevator

446
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,000
And heard a hard rain is gonna fall

447
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,260
Turned into Muzak

448
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,920
That's good to hear

449
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,020
When you're in an elevator

450
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,820
Oh, man

451
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,100
Oh, man

452
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,100


453
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,100


454
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,100


455
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,100


456
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,100


457
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,100


458
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,100


459
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,100


460
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,100


461
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,100


462
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,780
God, I'm glad I didn't think of it at the time

463
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,560
Jeez

464
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,020
You are

465
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,680
Oh, oh

466
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,400
Oh, I see

467
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,620
I'm adjusting things

468
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,220
I got so many different layers going on

469
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,100
Layers upon layers

470
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,780
I'm wearing some lingerie

471
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,260
Now, this song that's in the background

472
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,340
Now, Kumbaya

473
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,460
Yes

474
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,320
Is the name of it

475
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,040
It was

476
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,100
It's

477
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,080
As I understand it

478
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,520
That's something kids who went to church camp

479
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,020
Had to sit around singing

480
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,600
Yeah

481
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,300
Is that so?

482
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,040
I was never at a church camp

483
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,980
Aside from Dobbs Town

484
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,140
Yeah

485
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,800
Where I'm from

486
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,120
It was what parents did with the kids in the summer

487
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,820
It didn't matter if you were religious or not

488
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,160
Your family could not even really believe in any of it

489
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,300
But they'd send you to a vacation Bible school

490
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,060
Just to get you out of the house in the summer

491
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,240
Their vacation

492
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,660
Their vacation

493
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,620
I mean, vacation

494
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,680
Bible school

495
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,020
It's, you know, and when you're a kid

496
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,440
Bummer

497
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,580
Yeah, it's an incredible bummer

498
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,580
It's like a trick within a trick within a trick

499
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,960
Why do they have Bible in school?

500
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,400
There's a red flags

501
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,020
Yeah, well, you know

502
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,180
Religion, learning, let's get out of here

503
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,240
That's just during the summer, you know

504
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,280
When kids can't wait to go learn about the Bible

505
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,540
They get out of regular school

506
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,560
And I'm sure they just flock into those Bible study classes

507
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,600
Song of Solomon was my favorite

508
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,660
Mm-hmm

509
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,960
Oh, it was such a nice, dirty, nasty little

510
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,480
Lo, my bowels are moved for thee

511
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,740
I long to see your breasts again

512
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,600
You know, that sort of thing

513
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,200
Like two twin gazelles

514
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,800
Yes

515
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,380
It sort of sounded

516
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:17,780
It was

517
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,820
I'm convinced that all the Harlequin romance writers

518
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,500
Actually get their source material from Song of Solomon

519
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:23,940
Mm

520
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,280
I'm pretty sure

521
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,240
It is really bodice-ripping, boring romance

522
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,300
Speaking of bodices

523
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,240
I was gonna say the same thing

524
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,900
There were a lot of those on view at that science fiction convention

525
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:41,520
A lot of corsets and a lot of lush melons perched and jiggling atop these contraptions

526
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,580
You know, that whole sci-fi and comedy thing is just so much fun

527
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,920
I mean, the comics field has a reputation for being a sausage fest

528
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:59,420
But I saw as much melon gobble-able bounce, bountiful, bouncing babes

529
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,300
Ain't nature grand

530
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,500
And it's nerd girls, man

531
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,920
Which, you know, nerd girls are easy

532
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,580
That's the important

533
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,260
They're desperate

534
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,040
Glasses, girls and glass

535
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,520
If they have glasses, that means they're desperate

536
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,360
Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies

537
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,560
Let me fix this for you, please

538
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:13,940
I'm gonna tell you right now

539
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,280
And I'm gonna share you a little bit of secret about the Church of the Subgenius as well

540
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,760
You know how at DragonCon, if you're a girl of that persuasion

541
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,780
And you're walking around

542
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,380
It seems to be that you can't keep the boys off of you

543
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,440
That you get invited to hundreds of room parties

544
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,620
That you just would be exhausted running around in your corset

545
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,700
From floor to floor in both the Hyatt and the Marriott

546
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,780
Trying to keep up with all your invites on your social calendar

547
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,740
Because there's a lot more men than women

548
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,220
Well, as much as Stang would like to say otherwise

549
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,940
The tilt is still a little off in the Church of the Subgenius

550
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,680
So we want to invite you to come and join us

551
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,440
Yes, ladies, please

552
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,880
Come and join the Church of the Subgenius

553
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,080
And yet, if there were no tilt, then there'd be no seasons, right?

554
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,540
It'd all just be one climate year-round

555
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,760
Uh, yeah, but it'd be different from place to place, you know?

556
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,720
I mean, it'd always be really hot right at the equator

557
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,400
Yeah, so tilting is fine

558
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,480
But we were talking about chicks, man

559
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,140
What's wrong with you?

560
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,920
The tilt of the axis, 23.5 degrees

561
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,960
Is the same as the tilt of the female pelvis

562
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,620
Mmm...

563
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,900
I bet you didn't think about that

564
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,220
That's no coincidence

565
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,220
That couldn't possibly be a coincidence

566
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,480
No, that was just signed in by the aliens who created us

567
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,200
Ten billion years ago!

568
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,660
In the Donnigan age!

569
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,400
Makes sense now when you know that

570
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,460
The Von Donnigan age, yes

571
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,740
Right, Von Donnigan

572
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,480
The Von Donnigan age

573
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,540
And you know what Jimi Hendrix had to say about bowling?

574
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,700
Axis Bowl is love

575
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,500
Oh...

576
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,240
That was his bowling name

577
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,180
Oh...

578
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,820
He actually...

579
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,620
Or another thing I remember him saying to an audience was

580
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,000
Let's make, like, toilet paper and roll

581
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,860
And he's a poet

582
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,740
Yeah, yeah

583
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,160
Yeah, Hendrix was truly a great poet

584
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,900
Right

585
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,520
Full of slack

586
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,580
Full of slack

587
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,200
Yeah

588
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,640
There's an interesting display at the...

589
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,920
Believe it or not, I've actually been to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland

590
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,480
It was free on Martin Luther King Jr. Day

591
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,540
And so therefore I went

592
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,640
And the only thing I was actually interested in

593
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,140
That I found interesting was the Hall of Equipment

594
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,380
Which made me feel really old

595
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,280
Because starting about three feet into the hall

596
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,640
I recognized every piece of those things

597
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,540
But they had Hendrix's drawings from elementary school

598
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,640
Really?

599
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,040
Like dozens of them

600
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,700
At least 30 or so

601
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,780
Of little crayon and pencil drawings

602
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,600
And they were absolutely normal

603
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,700
It was football players, dinosaurs

604
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,720
Hot rods, race cars

605
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,820
War scenes, lots of war scenes

606
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,660
And the occasional flying saucer

607
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,800
He's not a bad artist for an 11-year-old

608
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,720
The occasional flying saucer?

609
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,320
But I was quite surprised

610
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:33,020
You know, I was half expecting to see more of a psychedelic thing

611
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,940
But I guess the 11-year-old Jimi Hendrix hadn't really...

612
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,580
He was not aware of the psychedelic thing at the time

613
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,360
Gone, yeah

614
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,680
He hadn't invented that yet

615
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,720
Well, they were probably taking mescaline somewhere, you know

616
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,740
Little kids?

617
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,440
No, no, I mean like...

618
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
Smoking gypsum weed?

619
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,380
Aldous Huxley or guys like that were probably...

620
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,780
Wasn't that what that Ovaltine stuff was?

621
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,700
It sounds like some sort of powerful hallucinogen

622
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,000
It was actually a mind control device

623
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,100
But not by the good guys

624
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,020
It was the bad guys

625
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,520
Yeah, good mind control is great

626
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,140
Yeah!

627
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,540
What we're doing right now is really good!

628
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,720
Mind control

629
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,340
Mind control

630
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,080
Mind control

631
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,080
I know it just sounds like a bunch of blithering to you

632
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,540
But there's this hidden signal

633
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,520
The subconscious signal which goes out from...

634
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,840
During all subgenius broadcasts

635
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,280
On the...

636
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,400
It's the fourth or the fifth wave, I believe?

637
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,400
Or is it...

638
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,060
I don't know how they do it

639
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,360
Well, you know...

640
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,600
The ninth wave, Kate Bush said it

641
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,680
I may have known at one time, but it...

642
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,900
Erased that knowledge

643
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,360
You know, that's what it's there for

644
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,380
I gave up on mind control

645
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,680
I'm having more luck with behind control

646
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,080
Yeah, actually

647
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,660
Yeah, but well...

648
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,920
Good for you

649
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,280
I...

650
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,840
If you...

651
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,760
After we get off the air

652
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,880
If you could give me some hints

653
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,560
I probably could use some

654
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,920
Backfield and commotion, baby

655
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,680
My mind control is...

656
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,060
You know, I...

657
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,480
I've been having a little bit of trouble with it

658
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,260
You are getting sleepy

659
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,160
Sleepy

660
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,240
You got that right

661
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,760
Yes

662
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,360
Well, you need to wake up

663
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,200
You have to wake up

664
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,280
You have an important task

665
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,800
We've got to get off the air

666
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,240
We've got to get off the air

667
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,720
We've got to get off the air

668
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:14,780
We've got to get off the air

669
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,220
That's right, friends

670
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,880
We aren't just blithering away for nothing

671
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,200
We're blithering for J.R. Bob Dobbs

672
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,380
We're blithering for Bob

673
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,000
That mighty beacon of slack

674
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,380
Blithering and drooling

675
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,560
Who leads so many to...

676
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,460
Actually, you know, I had quite a few people walk up to me today and go

677
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,060
Reverend Stang, thank you

678
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,220
I'd go, I think you got me mixed up with J.R. Bob Dobbs

679
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,920
I'm just, you know, I'm the clerk

680
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,440
I'm the mail clerk, essentially

681
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,540
And...

682
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,400
He's a mail clerk

683
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,460
I do the...

684
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,720
Whoa, you ask mail

685
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,240
I do get to deposit the checks

686
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:56,620
Like I said, they don't let me go to the real hierarchy parties, you know, that Philo gets to go to and Bob goes to and so forth

687
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,400
No, I...

688
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,360
I think it was the cream of the crop

689
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,740
But I did get to go to Dragon Con

690
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,140
Yes

691
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,400
This morning we got bribed with tequila and biscotti

692
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,320
That's true

693
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,160
That was great

694
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,860
Finally get something out of this damn church

695
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,520
I'm sorry

696
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:18,060
But, uh, Susie the floozy and I, as subgenius ministers, were judges at a super villain contest

697
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,200
Who wants to be a super villain?

698
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:27,320
Remember, you're being graded on cruelty, sightism, and fiendishness, among other things

699
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:34,680
My name is the bug because I plan on using cockroaches in my evil plans because they cannot be killed

700
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,080
I would use the cockroaches to feed the hungry

701
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,680
Big above the other

702
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,960
Come here

703
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,520
Frontrence Bob, that's a...

704
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:10,520


705
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,040
I did have three and a half minions.

706
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,100
Unfortunately, I'm down to two and a half minions

707
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,980
after the beta testing of the plasma cannon.

708
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,720
So that didn't work out.

709
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,740
Then I thought about blackmail.

710
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,240
But unfortunately, I'm not certain with the churches of the subgenius

711
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,680
if there's anything dirt that I could get on you

712
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,040
that not only you would admit to, but actually be proud of.

713
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,700
So I have left a bribe.

714
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,300
Minion!

715
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,860
He's a big one, isn't he?

716
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,340
Wow.

717
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,560
All right.

718
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,000
Bribes.

719
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,980
Yes, I did bring...

720
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,180
Bribes.

721
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,320
I understand these things.

722
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,360
I am a provisional.

723
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:44,760
This is why I'm in this.

724
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:46,860
I don't drink.

725
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,140
This sucks.

726
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,400
The most evil drink.

727
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,640
Oh, my God.

728
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,680
Oh, man, this is some classy evil.

729
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,640
This is very evil.

730
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,600
Tequila Resurfa 1800 Silver.

731
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:06,860
Evil laugh.

732
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,880
Mwahahahaha!

733
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,420
I didn't have any trouble writing this.

734
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,600
Mwahahahaha!

735
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:15,780
Mwahahahaha!

736
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,680
Mwahahahaha!

737
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,560
Mwahahahaha!

738
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,540
Mwahahahaha!

739
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,240
Mwahahahaha!

740
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,520
What super villains are most influenced your particular brand of villains?

741
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:36,560
I like to think that I am an original, but I do owe a lot to earlier super villains.

742
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,360
If for no other reason, by studying their failures,

743
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,500
I will not repeat myself.

744
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500

758
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,660
Yeah, there were some pretty evil characters there.

759
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,120
They were rated on the evil laugh.

760
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:00,920
Yeah, now, of course, I gave a 10 to Dr. DNA, who had a henchman.

761
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,520
Most of these people didn't even have costumes.

762
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,120
But he had a henchman with him.

763
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,840
He had a costume.

764
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,520
And he bribed us.

765
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,460
He was evil enough to give us pretty expensive jugs of tequila.

766
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,220
Yeah, 1,800 silver stuff.

767
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:20,640
But, you know, cuteness wins in terms of evil.

768
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,280
Something about cuteness is even more evil than evil.

769
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,920
Because the final winner was this little boy, maybe about six years old,

770
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,080
who said that his evil plan, he came up with on the spot.

771
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,720
Oh, we were scared to death.

772
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,960
He comes out and says,

773
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,080
Well, it's too bad because of all your evil plans.

774
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,140
Because I'm going to say,

775
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,880
I'm going to set a bomb in every single planet.

776
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,480
Whoa!

777
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,760
That's the most evil thing I've ever heard of.

778
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,640
Not very good.

779
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,420
Sometimes going with the classics is good.

780
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,900
That's some evil stuff.

781
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,000
Thank you.

782
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,300
Glad I brought my deep parents.

783
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,360
He didn't specify in the universe, but that was assumed.

784
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,980
And that is a lot of planets.

785
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,300
I mean, we don't even know how many planets there are.

786
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:24,320
That is a lot of bombs.

787
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,440
That was the most evil thing anyone came up.

788
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,520
And he judo flipped me when I shook his hand.

789
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,140
Yeah, he had superpowers.

790
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,920
This kid wasn't more than about three feet tall.

791
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,460
And he honestly did do a judo move when she tried to...

792
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:38,860
I bent down to shake his hand.

793
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,440
He didn't want to shake my hand.

794
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,820
And when he finally put his hand out, my guard was down.

795
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,200
And that little bugger...

796
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,200
He never judo flipped me face down on the floor.

797
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,240
There was a lot of evil in that room.

798
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:49,720
I was proud.

799
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,040
I was so proud.

800
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,500
All of the contestants were evil.

801
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,960
You know, fairly evil at least.

802
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,460
Well, our winner last year was Dictator Barbie.

803
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,620
Oh, that's why she got to be a judge this time.

804
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,280
Yeah, that's why she was judging.

805
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,360
She knows her evil.

806
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,700
And the Flaming Carrot was one of the judges,

807
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,060
although I noticed he never spoke a word the whole time.

808
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,080
Neither did his creator, the evil Bob Bird.

809
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,700
He basically just sat there the whole time.

810
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,740
I don't know.

811
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,480
He didn't seem to be too evil to me today.

812
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,620
I'm just saying.

813
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,340
Here's the thing, though.

814
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,580
That's true.

815
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,360
It seems to me that the normals seem to think that slack is wrong or evil.

816
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:30,920
Oh, yes.

817
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,420
Slacker is an old insult.

818
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,440
Yeah.

819
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,200
I mean, but slack is so good.

820
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,320
Boom slackalackalackalackalack.

821
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,380
Well, where's that one been all my life?

822
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,420
What?

823
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,420
Boom slackalackalackalackalack?

824
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,800
I think it's in your head, I guess.

825
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,660
That's where it's been.

826
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,980
Well, it's spelled out now.

827
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,460
Boom slackalackalackalackalacka.

828
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:50,620
Boom.

829
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:51,840
See?

830
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,920
It works out perfect.

831
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,900
But wait, she's been abducted.

832
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,240
Oh, no.

833
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:57,820
What do we do?

834
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,320
Oh, our host.

835
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,820
Hey, she's gone.

836
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,500
Susie's gone.

837
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,400
We can do anything we want.

838
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,200
Let's see.

839
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,860
What are the four?

840
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:10,340
Let's bring food into the radio station and drinks and let's smoke in here.

841
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,480
It's Baby Elephant Walk.

842
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,800
We've got to play Baby Elephant Walk while she's out of the studio.

843
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,020
You got it.

844
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,140
Listen.

845
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,360
Let's talk it.

846
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,720
Let's just say it over and over again.

847
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,440
Baby Elephant Walk.

848
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,140
Baby Elephant Walk.

849
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:18,920
Baby Elephant Walk.

850
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,000
You can't hear us.

851
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,420
Yes.

852
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,880
I can't hear you.

853
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,600
Please, please, please.

854
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:37,880
Oh, my God.

855
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,000
I can't hear you.

856
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,000


857
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,880
Go, Stan, go.

858
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,420
Go.

859
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:08,260
She was ready to kill you every time you hummed to that little beloved Mancini tune.

860
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,060
It's too powerful.

861
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,120
It is.

862
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,560
Give up, you know.

863
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,080
Give up.

864
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,400
You're not going to win against that song.

865
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,280
Give up.

866
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,800
Give up.

867
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,580
Give up.

868
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,920
Negative laugh.

869
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,580
I thought you gave up tonight.

870
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,820
Give up.

871
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,740

872
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,920

873
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,760
Give up.

874
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,700
Communism is good.

875
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,840
The answers we need are the same.

876
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,300
They all come from being wrong.

877
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,300
It's two of three enemies still to overcome.

878
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,660
Because we know the truth.

879
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,520
Give up.

880
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,660
Communism is good.

881
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,260
It's two of three enemies still to conquer.

882
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,380
Give up.

883
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:49,920

17, 17, 17, 17 hours of pain

914
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,140
shhh

915
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,600
shop in the new world

916
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,620
and avoid

917
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,620
and avoid panic buying

918
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,600
another page

919
00:34:59,600 --> 00:34:59,600

922
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,840
let other people steal that.

923
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,980
The nerve.

924
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,260
Somebody said,

925
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,420
hey, do you think a hustler would mind if I

926
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,380
videotaped him?

927
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,640
Who?

928
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,220
The Negative Land guy. The guys are famous

929
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,100
for copyright

930
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,280
legal... I have a book about them.

931
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:17,660
Right.

932
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,240
Well,

933
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,740
a hustler said,

934
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,240
it would look kind of bad for me to tell people

935
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,160
I couldn't videotape my show, and I wouldn't.

936
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,620
Yeah, that would be bad.

937
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,420
Oh, wait, she's coming

938
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,760
back. By the way, he asked about all of you.

939
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,400
Mark Hossler

940
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,780
from Negative Land asked about all of you,

941
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,380
the listeners. All of us?

942
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,500
Yeah, not you. He didn't mention you

943
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,460
or Byron or Susie. Actually, he did mention

944
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,280
Susie. He remembered Susie

945
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,240
tromping across his back

946
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,160
in high heels. He was

947
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,220
asking for it.

948
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,640
And she was only one of three

949
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,840
dolls, three Connie ties.

950
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,120
Oh, someone from the Dharma Initiative just

951
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,320
walked in. Oh, hello, worker.

952
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,260
Isn't that bad?

953
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,400
Yeah. This is Fat Joe.

954
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,920
He's my keeper, Tender.

955
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,260
He keeps you tender?

956
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:05,820
Yeah.

957
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,340
That's a wonderful, authentic

958
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,060
Dharma Initiative suit.

959
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,040
That'll be called Adolf, then.

960
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,460
I like that. That shows.

961
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,660
4, 8, 50, 60, 20, 40.

962
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,300
9.

963
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,000
4, 8, 50, 60, 20, 40.

964
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,380
4, 8, 60, 40.

965
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,740
Incidentally.

966
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:28,920
Incidentally.

967
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,040
Incidental.

968
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,460
I'm kind of lost

969
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,320
as to where we're going with all this.

970
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,480
We were going...

971
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,280
Lost, you say?

972
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:36,860
Lost?

973
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,100
I turned into a lost nerd.

974
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,560
That's so sad.

975
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,660
Yeah, lost nerd.

976
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,300
Lost in the dust.

977
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,960
You know, if you want to replay this in 10 years,

978
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,760
it's going to sound hopelessly dated

979
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,880
because you just brought up some sort of lame

980
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,140
pop culture reference.

981
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,780
Oh, gee. Let's not do any

982
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,060
lame pop culture references on the hour.

983
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,180
Slack. Oh, Lord.

984
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,000
No. No, no.

985
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,380
That'd be as bad as Dead Air.

986
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,100
Oh, man. I got their first album.

987
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,720
It's great.

988
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,520
Dead Air?

989
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:07,880
Yeah.

990
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,980
It's only on one side of the record, I think.

991
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,740
I couldn't get anything to play on the other side.

992
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,220
Right.

993
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,980
It's a concept, man.

994
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,200
Or maybe it was a...

995
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,300
It's a conceptual concept album?

996
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,660
Maybe it was a compact disc.

997
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,900
There's nothing on the other side.

998
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,640
I hate the people that drive down the street

999
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,280
playing that side B at top volume

1000
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,060
just to irritate people.

1001
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,240
It's like Pootie Tang's new hit song,

1002
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:29,680
called...

1003
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,140
Squishy Bits.

1004
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,580
So I brought five membership packs

1005
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,520
and we're selling all five right off the bat.

1006
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,660
You are saved, young man!

1007
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,760
You are saved, son of a bitch!

1008
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,380
Thank you, Bob!

1009
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,940
Totally saved.

1010
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,000
Saved up one side and down the other.

1011
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,160
And you just saved,

1012
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,400
$30 right there.

1013
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,320
Oh, feel the power.

1014
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,600
I love watching you put it in your wallet.

1015
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,720
You can feel the power

1016
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,360
as the money passes from hand to hand.

1017
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,700
Oh, he's got a twofer.

1018
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,860
A twofer!

1019
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,820
That's a mating call.

1020
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,060
Do I need to marry anybody while I'm doing it?

1021
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,000
You two?

1022
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:16,560
Yes.

1023
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,980
Now feel the power as it passes into your hands

1024
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,840
because I sure felt it when I got that money.

1025
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,320
Touch me.

1026
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,920
Touch me.

1027
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,260
You healed!

1028
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,020
I'm healed.

1029
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,660
Say baby.

1030
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,080
You're making me to walk.

1031
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,320
Sir, I need to...

1032
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:29,720
Feel it.

1033
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,060
I need to feel it.

1034
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:31,160
Bob!

1035
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,460
You're saved!

1036
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,720
Now turn around!

1037
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,540
So now that we're subgenia,

1038
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,100
are y'all having a party?

1039
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,920
I know that I'm going to sell at least three memberships.

1040
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,540
No, four or five memberships.

1041
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,820
There was a whole crew of people...

1042
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,400
We got that tequila.

1043
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,760
...walked up and...

1044
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,740
We could go out and get them good and drunk

1045
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,380
so they buy.

1046
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,660
No, no, no.

1047
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,580
It's communion.

1048
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,520
Or communication.

1049
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,220
We'll hold the sacred rites of communication

1050
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,320
where we...

1051
00:38:59,320 --> 00:38:59,820
We dose them

1052
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,740
and give them a little piece of bread

1053
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,000
that's been rubber stamped with Bob's face.

1054
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:05,680
...pleaveage

1055
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,880
and they don't know that they're drinking on Sunday.

1056
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,080
They look like I'm just nursing fans.

1057
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:13,800
Yeah.

1058
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,440
You know...

1059
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,720
It's crazy enough to work.

1060
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,820
You know, Lagoon did something like that

1061
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,060
but it wasn't boobs.

1062
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,340
Yeah.

1063
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:20,840
Yeah.

1064
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,120
I fell for that one.

1065
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,200
I did too.

1066
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,180
Sorry, I got these...

1067
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,540
He didn't invite me.

1068
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,740
I always get left out.

1069
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,700
Well, Lagoon...

1070
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,920
He said something about you're no fun.

1071
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,040
Hmm.

1072
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:33,840
Hmm.

1073
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,500
Herm.

1074
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,160
Herm.

1075
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,900
Hey, how about all those...

1076
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,060
I started counting the jokers

1077
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,820
at that sci-fi convention.

1078
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,420
I got up to about 40.

1079
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,840
It was lousy.

1080
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,000
Yeah, it was lousy with jokers.

1081
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,760
It really was.

1082
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,880
And Rorschach.

1083
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,460
There's no precision involved in the makeup.

1084
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,840
That really appeals to them.

1085
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,700
I believe it was another subgenius

1086
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,180
who pointed out that probably

1087
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,300
that they're all...

1088
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,020
All Heath Ledger.

1089
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,580
Oh.

1090
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,700
I believe it was Bunny Day

1091
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,940
who pointed that out to me.

1092
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:05,980
Wow.

1093
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,540
That they were all Heath Ledger.

1094
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,600
Ooh.

1095
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,180
Or at least parts of Heath Ledger.

1096
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:10,920
Like they took like...

1097
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,380
Well, except for one.

1098
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,920
Here's Heath Ledger's colon.

1099
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,600
One of them though was Michael Jackson

1100
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,300
in Joker makeup.

1101
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,400
There were a few...

1102
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,640
I expected a lot more undead Michael Jackson.

1103
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,700
I guess there's not going to be

1104
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,280
any more Cesar Romero's.

1105
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,340
Nobody cares about the old C's.

1106
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:26,880
That's right.

1107
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,560
Yeah.

1108
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,900
I kind of...

1109
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,160
You don't need...

1110
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,620
Yeah, Heath Ledger's performance

1111
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,100
was not very informed

1112
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,700
by Cesar Romero's performance

1113
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,120
as the Joker, I guess.

1114
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,040
He didn't even reference it once, you know?

1115
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,580
I saw it.

1116
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,640
He didn't grow a mustache

1117
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,060
or refuse to shave it off

1118
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,140
or anything like that.

1119
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:47,940
No, no, no.

1120
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,200
I always wondered what that caked crap was.

1121
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,260
I thought it was like some sort of like

1122
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,360
utility belt thing

1123
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,320
that was going to do something for the Joker.

1124
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:56,860
Oh!

1125
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,960
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1126
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,500
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1127
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,480
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1128
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,620
Ha, ha.

1129
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,840
Oh, ha.

1130
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:05,720
Ha.

1131
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:06,900
Ha.

1132
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,300
Oh, ha.

1133
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,040
Ha.

1134
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,520
Ha.

1135
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:08,660
Ha.

1136
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:08,840
Ha.

1137
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,060
Ha.

1138
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,060


1139
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,060


1140
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,060


1141
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,060


1142
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,060


1143
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,060


1144
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,060


1145
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,040
I thought my jokes were bad.

1146
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,020
He comes at me with the knife.

1147
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,660
Why so serious?

1148
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,680
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

1149
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,840
Let's put a smile on that face.

1150
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,160
And...

1151
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,100
Ha.

1152
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,220
Ha.

1153
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,300
Ha.

1154
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1155
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1156
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1157
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1158
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1159
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1160
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1161
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1162
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1163
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1164
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1165
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1166
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1167
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1168
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1169
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


1170
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,600
See, I'm not a monster.

1171
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,300
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1172
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,140
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1173
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,700
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1174
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,080
And then...

1175
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,660
And then...

1176
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,240
And then...

1177
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:38,780
And then...

1178
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,280
And then...

1179
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,180
And then they'll ruin...

1180
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,100
They'll ruin another Catwoman

1181
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,120
and then they'll ruin another...

1182
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,120
They'll keep going and going and going.

1183
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,880
They don't think of it as ruining her.

1184
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,780
It's rather having her fixed.

1185
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,120
What?

1186
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,120
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1187
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,620
But yeah, it's just the way it is.

1188
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:04,680
It's sort of the thing is that when you're on the outside, you can look at this and say,

1189
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,520
why, Stang, that movie was so full of the conspiracy.

1190
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,420
Which movie?

1191
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,600
That one.

1192
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,180
Oh.

1193
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,860
You know that one?

1194
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,240
Oh, that one?

1195
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,040
That one?

1196
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,820
Well, sure.

1197
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,060
But then that other one was too.

1198
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,520
You can say that about everything because everything is full of the conspiracy.

1199
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,260
That was my point.

1200
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:22,820
Yeah.

1201
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,440
It's the truth.

1202
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,220
Everything is full.

1203
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,700
It's tainted.

1204
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,020
It has the taint.

1205
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,460
It's dripping.

1206
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,120
Even your taint has the taint.

1207
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,120
Of the conspiracy.

1208
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,260
You cannot shower enough.

1209
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,320
There ain't no taint like a tainted taint.

1210
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:34,800
No.

1211
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,680
So you have to admit that to yourself.

1212
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,820
That's the first step.

1213
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,240
Even a saint has a taint.

1214
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,140
Five times you have to admit that to yourself.

1215
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:40,440
Yeah.

1216
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,120
Five times.

1217
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,960
Real fast.

1218
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,000
And that's your first step towards slack.

1219
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,460
I am full of the conspiracy.

1220
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,520
You have now.

1221
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,120
I am full of the conspiracy.

1222
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,520
I am full of the conspiracy.

1223
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,280
Okay.

1224
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:52,740
That's enough.

1225
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,200
Faster.

1226
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:54,840
Faster.

1227
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,880
Full of the conspiracy.

1228
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,100
Then there's the cult of the living bull.

1229
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:58,720
Oh, yeah.

1230
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,280
Which gets you.

1231
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,060
Gets you to cast out all of the bull.

1232
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,600
Father Dennis Murphy.

1233
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,260
Yeah.

1234
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:03,540
Yeah.

1235
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,080
That's my favorite rival cult.

1236
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:07,640
Yeah.

1237
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,440
Mystery cult.

1238
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,260
The cult of the living bull.

1239
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:10,480


1240
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:14,720
It's nice to have a rival who isn't some insane firebrand.

1241
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,160
Right.

1242
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,580
They don't even have a P.O. box.

1243
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,240
I mean, they're more disorganized than the Discordians.

1244
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,000
Yeah.

1245
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:26,240
But way less sold out than the Church of the Subgenius.

1246
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,140
And the cult of the living bull.

1247
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:35,360
The whole initiation climaxes with the initiate and whoever else is around screaming at the

1248
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:42,020
top of their lungs the word bull to expel all of the bull that we must deal with in

1249
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,580
our lives.

1250
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:50,420
You know, having to pass for normal, having to pretend that you understand what your boss

1251
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,560
is telling you, all of that kind of bull.

1252
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,320
Right.

1253
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,580
And they just yell it.

1254
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:54,880
Yes.

1255
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,260
They just yell it and it's free.

1256
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,740
It's a free cult.

1257
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,680
That's another silly thing about it.

1258
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,180
It's cheap.

1259
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,700
It doesn't require coffee enema.

1260
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,780
He, Dennis.

1261
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,660
Not necessarily.

1262
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,560
They contributed one of my favorite slogans to us.

1263
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,800
The Church of the Subgenius.

1264
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,380
It's a no brainer.

1265
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,180
Yeah.

1266
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,840
That's a Dennis Murphy line.

1267
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,040
That's the only use of that term that I will accept.

1268
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,680
Right.

1269
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,520
The Church of the Subgenius.

1270
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,040
It's a no brainer.

1271
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,280
Truer words were never spoken.

1272
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,720
That is the subgenius.

1273
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,940
The state to which we aspire.

1274
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,160
To be like Bob.

1275
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,800
That is the very essence of it.

1276
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,600
The very nugget.

1277
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:38,700
What's in Bob's head is the same thing that's inside his pills that he sells you.

1278
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,000
Nothing at all.

1279
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,960
Or how did Onan put it?

1280
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,760
Stop thinking and you'll know what you think immediately.

1281
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,980
In his left brain, nothing is right.

1282
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,940
And in his right brain, there's nothing left.

1283
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:49,400
Hey.

1284
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:50,960
That was.

1285
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,420
That explains a lot.

1286
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,280
Yes, it does.

1287
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:53,880
Yes, it does.

1288
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,280
Right.

1289
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,880
So it's not like we're trying to be smarty pants.

1290
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:02,600
Uh, because we think that the intelligence has been misdefined.

1291
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,080
Smarty pants can hide a dumb ass.

1292
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:06,680
Right.

1293
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,840
Clean pants is something to work towards.

1294
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,940
I think you're just skirting the issue.

1295
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,140
A lot of subgeniuses are still learning.

1296
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:14,800
Right.

1297
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,160
If you're wearing clean pants, it's like you're expecting an accident.

1298
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,460
That's true.

1299
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,160
It shows a lack of confidence.

1300
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,580
I never thought of it that way.

1301
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,840
Mine are goat tracked because I'm confident.

1302
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,160
I know.

1303
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,760
I'm not going to get hit by that bus.

1304
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,920
You're confident in quite a few things, huh?

1305
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:32,660
Yeah.

1306
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:33,160
Yeah.

1307
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,700
What is the connection between being hit by a bus and the cleanliness of underwear?

1308
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:50,680
Apparently many, many people live in the fear that they're going to suddenly be in some accident and medical personnel will have to yank their britches off.

1309
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:50,960
Right.

1310
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,040
And we'll see that their underwear is not in pristine condition.

1311
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:55,880
Let me explain.

1312
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,900
This is a.

1313
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:14,320
It's it was a problem years and years ago for your grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother at the beginning of when we first wore knickers and not even underwear said as her daughter and son were leaving the house on horseback.

1314
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,360
Make sure you have unclean knickers.

1315
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:24,240
If you fall off that horse, you do not want the knights to come by to rescue you and find out that you have dirty knickers.

1316
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,160
It's that old.

1317
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:25,700
Yes.

1318
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,480
Wow.

1319
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,900
Well, I guess so.

1320
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,080
It's like a genetic memory.

1321
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,900
The fear of medical personnel checking out your knickers.

1322
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,860
It's not even genetic.

1323
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,480
It's just straight hand me down.

1324
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,860
Hand me downs.

1325
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,780
A part of the culture.

1326
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,380
It's a knicker obsession.

1327
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,420
And speaking of obsessed knickers.

1328
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,140
Oh, wait.

1329
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:47,620
No, wait.

1330
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,520
Obsessed about knickers.

1331
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,040
Bob Burden was talking about obsessive artists.

1332
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:56,560
He had.

1333
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,040
He had a term for.

1334
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:58,620
Yeah.

1335
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,500
Obsesso art or something like that.

1336
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,540
Bob can really turn a phrase.

1337
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,820
Turn it over his knee and wheel the tar out of it.

1338
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,060
Well, he's full of ideas.

1339
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,400
He's the guy who told me that.

1340
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,640
He was a guy who said nothing this morning on that panel when he was judging with us.

1341
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,780
And tonight sitting alone.

1342
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,360
Man.

1343
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:21,960
He told me that the church is so genius could get really big and go mainstream.

1344
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,980
If only we quit making fun of religion.

1345
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,320
Wow.

1346
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,640
And he meant it.

1347
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,480
He wasn't kidding.

1348
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:27,820
Right.

1349
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,940
That's very bright.

1350
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,420
It's very well thought out.

1351
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:37,040
It's very said by the man who's been making fun of carrots, which is essentially the same

1352
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:37,440
thing.

1353
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:38,840
Hey, that movie.

1354
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,600
Shoot him up.

1355
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,240
Don't they owe him?

1356
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,640
I don't know if you've seen that.

1357
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,320
No, no.

1358
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,320
I don't see movies.

1359
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:52,380
Carrots become the deadliest weapon imaginable in the hands of this over the top hero and

1360
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,340
shoot him up.

1361
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,080
It's not a chick flick.

1362
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,100
I wouldn't say.

1363
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,860
Well, although what's a chick flick?

1364
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,440
You know what I mean?

1365
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,240
The ones where it's all the mushy stuff and no monsters.

1366
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,320
Nobody flies through the air in front of a fireball.

1367
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,680
Those are chick flicks.

1368
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,860
The guy flicks are the ones where some somebody flies through the air in front of a fireball.

1369
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,300
And usually there's some kind of a monster or something or evil supervillain or something.

1370
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,140
But they always ruin the guy ones with putting like some chick in it.

1371
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,560
And and and oh, I'm the greatest superhero.

1372
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,260
I'm the greatest monster ever.

1373
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,760
But I really have a crush on that girl.

1374
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:34,540
So, you know, while I'm fighting the giant slimy thing from the hellacious underworld,

1375
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:39,060
I'm going to have to tell her I love her so that they'll know to kidnap her later.

1376
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,680
Well, yeah, that's that's it.

1377
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:47,880
When I was a kid, I did not understand why they put the mushy stuff in there.

1378
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:52,840
And now I it's it's the main thing that keeps me going.

1379
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,620
I was watching the creature from the Black Lagoon for the first time.

1380
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,940
It's very recently since I was since I was like pretty young.

1381
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:07,400
And I remember watching the creature in all the time.

1382
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,680
This time I was watching Julie Adams.

1383
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,140
Right.

1384
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,420
All the time.

1385
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,520
Oh, God, that white.

1386
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:19,440
Who, by the way, for you lost the holics was was had a small part as one of the others.

1387
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:25,060
The the Julie Adams is probably about my mom's age.

1388
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:25,780
Oh.

1389
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,760
It's just possible that this is it.

1390
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,300
Well, that's all there is to it.

1391
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,700
Now, I tell you what I believe.

1392
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:44,020
This beast mob exists because it is stronger than the thing that you call evolution.

1393
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:51,360
In it is some force of life, a demon driving it through millions of centuries.

1394
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,420
It does not surrender so easily to weaklings like you and me.

1395
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,660
This is the thing that you hunt for.

1396
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,720
Think on it.

1397
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,700
More like gentlemen.

1398
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:16,360
You know, that movie was the one that first started planting the the seeds in my brain.

1399
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:16,880
Really?

1400
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,280
Yeah.

1401
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:17,940
The Gilman.

1402
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,740
Oh, that was the one that I snuck.

1403
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,080
I was about three or four and I had a babysitter who was watching it.

1404
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,200
It came on TV and they actually had a special one.

1405
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:26,520
That was.

1406
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,060
It was 3D.

1407
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,080
Wow.

1408
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,920
3D glasses that came on television.

1409
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,040
Good Lord.

1410
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:38,660
I snuck out of the bedroom and hid behind the couch and put my little nose right on

1411
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,100
the edge of the couch pretty much and watched most of that movie.

1412
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:41,960
Great.

1413
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,680
But not in 3D.

1414
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,440
That's why you.

1415
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,920
That's why Pisces is here with us tonight.

1416
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,420
Is that the creature walks among us?

1417
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:48,580
No.

1418
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,060
The creature from the Black Lagoon.

1419
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,060
The creature from the Black Lagoon.

1420
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:56,500
Now, not to be confused with the preacher from the Black Lagoon.

1421
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:56,500


1422
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:56,500


1423
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:56,500


1424
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:56,500


1425
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:56,500


1426
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,220
Pric

1427
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:05,180
You know, you've played all this for a rainy season.

1428
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:06,920
You're here.

1429
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,940
What would you imagine on a Friday night when you're this dark?

1430
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:08,000
Why don't you introduce yourself to theati?

1431
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,640
It's a l'cha.

1432
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,840
What is it?

1433
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,900
Every Friday night.

1434
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,860
Whenever you hit Sleepn Abhishek, local Behaviorist or régimen one wants to have

1435
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:19,880
fun.

1436
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,060
Does complete BUT your.

1437
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:20,940
Of all the weis.

1438
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:21,100


1439
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:21,100


1440
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,500
gging all the way into David your superhero.

1441
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:23,660
Eh?

1442
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:24,840
Oh, what?

1443
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:24,840


1444
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:24,840


1445
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:24,840


1446
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:24,960
Yeah.

1447
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,520
But what even sir them containing a few surprised us gone forced our draw aside to

1448
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,480
say you hey hey me さ stage, which says one record that he'd since that he just

1449
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,320
Browning playing the creature. I bet it was

1450
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,720
Julie Adams for him, too.

1451
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,260
I've fallen in with the people who do the

1452
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,440
Silver Scream spook show here

1453
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,500
in town, and one of them

1454
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,700
is a real Rico Browning

1455
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,320
nut, and he got to go swim

1456
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,480
in Weeki Wachee Springs

1457
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,840
with Rico Browning.

1458
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,360
Rico Browning...

1459
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,360
Rico Browning

1460
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,280
later went on to direct.

1461
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,660
He did? Yeah.

1462
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,440
Oh, that's good.

1463
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,220
Well, I'll be. See?

1464
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,740
Directed by the creature.

1465
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:57,500
Wow.

1466
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,720
The gill man.

1467
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,540
Direction left, right, left, right.

1468
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,580
Stage right, stage left, stage...

1469
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,600
Oh, no, we should stay here, shouldn't we?

1470
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,320
Oh, my...

1471
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,840
They're so cute at this stage.

1472
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,600
Yes, yes.

1473
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,780
Everybody's talking at me.

1474
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,080
Yeah, they're talking about you.

1475
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,140
I can't hear a word they're saying.

1476
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,920
I really can't hear a word they're saying.

1477
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,700
You're making fun of me again,

1478
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,160
aren't you?

1479
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,100
I'm firing, because I'm

1480
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:24,360
beef.

1481
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,260
Won't you ever leave it

1482
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:28,720
all behind?

1483
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,500
No, no, no.

1484
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,180
I always think of the movie Midnight Cowboy,

1485
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,580
of course, when this plays.

1486
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,680
I don't know why you do that. That's weird.

1487
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,560
My grandfather

1488
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:41,720
didn't like that movie.

1489
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,100
It showed too much.

1490
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,100
Just because... Kitchen sink movie

1491
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,260
as Ray Harryhausen.

1492
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:50,080
Just because it's got a young buck, like

1493
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,000
yourself, beating up on an old guy,

1494
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,600
like him, taking his money

1495
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,200
and knocking out his plate,

1496
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,200
his upper plate.

1497
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:58,940
I don't know nothing about it.

1498
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,120
I don't know nothing.

1499
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,380
It was X-rated when it first came out.

1500
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,960
Where is that Joe Buck?

1501
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,340
What? Joe who what?

1502
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,840
That was an influential movie on me.

1503
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:12,700
I see.

1504
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:13,840
That was the beginning.

1505
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,780
That was back in the days when

1506
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,140
it wasn't cool to have got people

1507
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,060
flying through the air in front of fireballs.

1508
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,780
And it was

1509
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,840
cool to have depressing...

1510
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,900
Boy, they were lame, man.

1511
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,760
Yeah, it was...

1512
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,240
Star Wars

1513
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,740
was the one that tipped

1514
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,180
everything back into mindless escapism.

1515
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,220
Byron actually played

1516
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,620
R2-D2 in Star Wars. That's another

1517
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,020
little known fact. That's why he's here.

1518
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,440
I played him in checkers.

1519
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,960
Chinese checkers. And I won every single

1520
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,820
time. He's a robot. He's easy to beat.

1521
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:46,860
Really?

1522
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,720
I've seen a photo of you peeking out from

1523
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,400
inside the R2-D2 seat.

1524
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:51,760
Don't you?

1525
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,680
You can't deny it.

1526
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,060
Well, I can, but I won't.

1527
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,720
No, that was a different

1528
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,440
model. That was 04Q2.

1529
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,420
You know, Tom, alcohol

1530
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,640
hits some people faster than others because of

1531
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,660
metabolism. Rate of absorption and

1532
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:08,540
well, you know,

1533
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,100
change metabolism and maybe

1534
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,400
eliminate drunk drivers.

1535
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,580
Tom, we found

1536
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:25,300
the secret. Change the metabolism and man will change.

1537
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,000
Maybe.

1538
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,820
It's the interaction of heredity and environment

1539
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,840
for millions of years that makes you new species.

1540
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,580
We only change the skin,

1541
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,600
doctor, not the animal.

1542
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,640
But we can bring out the best or worst

1543
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,720
in any living thing. Environment does that.

1544
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,760
If it threatens him, if he's

1545
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,680
afraid of us, he'll revert to the wanton killer.

1546
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,560
Because we all stand between the jungle and the stars

1547
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,160
at a crossroads.

1548
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,560
I think we better discover what brings us to the end.

1549
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,640
What brings out the best in humankind

1550
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,600
and what brings out the worst.

1551
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,960
Because it's the stars

1552
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,600
or the jungle.

1553
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,120
That'll work.

1554
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,460
What did, I think it was Dr. Leguim

1555
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,320
may have said,

1556
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,360
I destroyed my

1557
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,460
credibility when I joined

1558
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,560
this UFO, the Texas

1559
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,720
UFO death cult.

1560
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,500
I think, did I leave

1561
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,320
something out? Oh, it's Texas UFO

1562
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,720
sex death cult.

1563
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,040
Yeah.

1564
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:24,080
Sex for us, death for others.

1565
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:26,240
I think that the Pope Black

1566
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,200
in Europe called it, what was it?

1567
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,200
Sex, drugs, rock and roll,

1568
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,220
alien, end of the world death cult.

1569
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,340
Well, that covers

1570
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,120
a lot of ground.

1571
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,620
Didn't he leave out bacon?

1572
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,060
Because bacon is involved

1573
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,120
somehow. I saw a man

1574
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,400
dressed as a giant strip of bacon

1575
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,040
walking around. He was awesome.

1576
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,800
He was greasy.

1577
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,520
Wow. I wanted to go up and bite him.

1578
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,480
He is going to get so lucky tonight.

1579
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,360
You know he's making

1580
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,000
pigs in a blanket somewhere.

1581
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,200
Someone's going to get porked.

1582
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,900
He was meat candy.

1583
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,360
Meat candy.

1584
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:09,180
One of my favorite costumes

1585
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,440
that I saw at the convention was a guy walking around

1586
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,580
in a towel holding a sign that said

1587
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,120
can I borrow your costume?

1588
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,160
The best thing was that later

1589
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,780
there were like five guys who said,

1590
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,440
I stole his idea.

1591
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:21,860
Figures.

1592
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,780
And then we saw girls dressed in hotel tablecloths

1593
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,840
standing on a street corner.

1594
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:28,140
Yeah, leaving the hotel.

1595
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,440
Robbing the hotel.

1596
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,360
They were stealing those tablecloths.

1597
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,800
I was trying to figure out

1598
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,000
what they were going to do with it and why they were leaving.

1599
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,980
That was the part I couldn't understand.

1600
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,560
Like maybe they had a sewing kit.

1601
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,800
They were hopped up on Jenkum.

1602
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,960
They didn't know what they were doing.

1603
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,400
There's so much Jenkum going around.

1604
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,400
It's really sad.

1605
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,200
Kids.

1606
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,140
Mouth water just thinking about it.

1607
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,040
Yes, but please.

1608
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,780
Yeah, but it'll smell that way for days.

1609
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,300
Once you start the Jenkum.

1610
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:55,520
Days.

1611
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,420
The little butt hash.

1612
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,220
Oh, man.

1613
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,280
Once you start, don't do it.

1614
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,180
This is the only time I'll tell you no.

1615
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,320
Now that's a crack pipe.

1616
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,480
Don't do it.

1617
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,520
Don't do the Jenkum.

1618
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:05,320
Once you start.

1619
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,920
Oh, don't tell me don't do that.

1620
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,080
Don't do it.

1621
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,160
Is there Jenkum in that briar patch?

1622
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,180
Oh, no.

1623
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,280
No.

1624
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:24,860
Guys and Girls High School.

1625
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:24,980
Jenkek.

1626
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,020
Aren't you?

1627
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,020


1628
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,020


1629
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,520
Your bands never see you.

1630
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,600
You.

1631
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,720
Go.

1632
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,060
Tell the girls this.

1633
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:36,060


1634
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:36,360
What are you my boss?

1635
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:36,360


1636
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:36,360


1637
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:36,360


1638
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,780
Look at the time.

1639
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,360
He-he.

1640
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,260
It's over but it's not over because

1641
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,100
we're going to be doing another

1642
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,140
hour after this right.

1643
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,380
But since this is

1644
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,780
the hour of slack. Why don't we

1645
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,540
wrap up with contact info?

1646
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,060
If you want to get a hold of Bob,

1647
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,960
how do you reach his ear?

1648
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,120
Well,

1649
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:00,860
okay,

1650
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,600
okay, I'll play that strike.

1651
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,880
Friends, you can write

1652
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,780
to the Church of the Subgenius at

1653
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,900
got that pencil ready? I know you

1654
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,360
don't have it ready, so I'll just say

1655
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,940
subgenius.com

1656
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,800
and that will tell you

1657
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,720
basically everything. By the way,

1658
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,820
every hour of slack

1659
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,220
show is archived there

1660
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,080
and you can see a log

1661
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,260
of everything that's on it and little

1662
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,720
links to all of your favorite

1663
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,280

00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,300
post office box 181-417

1665
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,320
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1666
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,660
Whoa, that's easy for you to say.

1667
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,560
Well, I get a lot of mail. There must be a

1668
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,880
prison near here where

1669
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,700
they listen to this show because I get

1670
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,700
a lot of mail from

1671
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,440
our brothers and sisters

1672
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,960
in prison, mostly brothers,

1673
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,960
in prison.

1674
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,080
You can be anywhere and need slack

1675
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,080
and when you're in prison, you really

1676
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,040
freaking need it.

1677
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,480
I don't have much money, most of them.

1678
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,660
But, you know,

1679
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,380
heck, a pamphlet only cost me

1680
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,500
a dollar to mail.

1681
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,800
Most of my fans have nothing.

1682
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,420
I kind of accept that, which is

1683
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,860
they've got more than I do.

1684
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,740
But I've got Bob.

1685
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,320
You do?

1686
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,040
What a curse.

1687
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,740
Okay, baby,

1688
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,460
let's go.

1689
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,940
Come on. Come on, baby.

1690
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,020
Come on.

1691
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:46,720
Hi.

1692
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,080
Well, and that, kiddies,

1693
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,420
is our fairy story for tonight.
