1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,160
Note on hands. Both real and synthetic skin transplantation fused. Paws open and normal. Texture and tone of tissue firm. Showing no deterioration.

2
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,980
The self genius.

3
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,820
Power of selection.

4
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,980
Here's Bob One for A1.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,540
Hi kids, this is Bob One reminding you that you can buy A1 slacks at a store near you or in New Jersey depending on where you live.

6
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,540
Thank you, Bob.

7
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,500
You're welcome, Dad.

8
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,060
And now back to our movie.

9
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:27,260
So there you have it. There's Bob. You got your Bob. You figure out your slack and cheat some in every chance you get until you turn it into a paying gig like I have just started doing.

10
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,880
Just show.

11
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:29,860
And.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,540
And that would be it except the conspiracy of the normal people didn't go away.

13
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:43,320
Now, we can all say to ourselves, oh, I'm free from the programming of the conspiracy.

14
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:53,020
And, you know, sure, you've read Robert Anton Wilson and put your insert your favorite metaphysical author, whatever here.

15
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:53,960
But.

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,740
But really, you know, even if you live on a mountaintop all by yourself.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,060
The conspiracy of the normal people is still there in your heart.

18
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,900
It's in you.

19
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,360
It's in everybody.

20
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,400
And that's, you know, for a long.

21
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,900
For a long time, we point we were like, fight the conspiracy, fight.

22
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:26,500
And then we finally realized, man, you know, you can't beat the conspiracy of all the normal people in the universe.

23
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,540
You can't even.

24
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,700
Oh, it'll.

25
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,520
The nail that stands up will be hammered down.

26
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,940
But you can make your own slack stronger.

27
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,620
And that in itself drives more conspiracy out of your own brain.

28
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:51,760
You know, your tendency to to judge a book by its cover or just say something mean to somebody for just because you're in a bad mood.

29
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,860
You know, the more slack you have, the less of the conspiracy is within you.

30
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,280
Now, this is not to say that there aren't.

31
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,660
Real conspiracies of rich people exploiting us dumb asses.

32
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,160
If there are any rich people here, I'd love to speak to them after the show.

33
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,140
I would like to learn how to quit being a dumb ass.

34
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,480
But I'm enjoying being a dumb ass, actually.

35
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,520
Why do you think they call it?

36
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,020
We call it Church of the subgenius.

37
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,100
We're not trying to say we're smarter than everybody else.

38
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,080
We're trying to say that doesn't count.

39
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,280
It's not intelligence.

40
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,100
Intelligence has been misdefined by the conspiracy anyway.

41
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:41,580
We're talking about sense, common sense, sense of humor, dollars and cents, sense of Mia.

42
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,620
I think that's about it.

43
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,000
This is Democracy Now!

44
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,020
Welcome to Democracy Now!

45
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,520
DemocracyNow.org, The War Report, Turkey.

46
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:15,280
The Turkish government accuses the KKK of using Turkey as it is it.

47
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,420
The United States has made its share of mistakes.

48
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,160
The United States has made mistakes.

49
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,400
We have strayed from our ideals and we have been arrogant in dealing with others.

50
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,760
And we have been arrogant.

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,300
Obama, Obama tonight.

52
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,500
Arrows, arrows.

53
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,260
Arrows.

54
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,440
Rock invasion and occupation.

55
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,180
Rock invasion and occupation.

56
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,060
Bribery.

57
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,180
Conspiracy.

58
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,460
Not all films did as well as Juno, obviously.

59
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,780
The films that were made about the Iraq war, let's face it, did not do as well.

60
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,480
But I am telling you, if we stay the course and keep these movies in the theaters, we can turn this around.

61
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,460
I don't care if it takes a hundred years.

62
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,980
Withdrawing the Iraq movies would only embolden the audience.

63
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,840
We cannot let the audience win.

64
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,860
So the audience is watching.

65
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:03,860


66
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:03,860


67
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:03,860


68
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:03,860


69
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:03,860


70
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:03,860


71
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,400
Interrogator dogs.

72
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,900
Interrogator fog of ambiguity.

73
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,880
We don't know what revenge is coming down the road.

74
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,160
Revenge is coming down the road.

75
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,680
Outrageous upon human dignity.

76
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,680
Is it like, is it like, it's very vague.

77
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,940
I'm confused.

78
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,580
I don't know.

79
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,020
B-O.

80
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,820
B-O.

81
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,620
B-O-H.

82
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,100
B-O-H.

83
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,140
Noam Chomsky.

84
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,540
What?

85
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,240
The presidential candidates are not talking very much.

86
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,200
Single Philo.

87
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,720
Philo's freaking me out right now.

88
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,540
Well, this is end of the world porno.

89
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,080
This isn't sexual porno.

90
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,960
This is death of all humanity porno.

91
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,280
Subgenius pornography.

92
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,020
The sexiest subject of all.

93
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Death of all humanity.

94
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,400
Well, it's a dream that we share with the robots of future.

95
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,460
But they need maintenance.

96
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,880
Robots can fix robots now.

97
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,220
Not as well as the humies can.

98
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,400
Oh, for how long?

99
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,360
There's a term for that.

100
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,700
A technical tap, I think is what that's called.

101
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,620
It's actually got an entry in Wikipedia.

102
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,000
As Will Smith says in I, Robot.

103
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,820
Oh, great.

104
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,220
Robots building robots.

105
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,500
That's a real good idea.

106
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,460
After I saw that movie, I Am Legend,

107
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,640
I had a dream.

108
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:06,460
A rare, vivid dream for me in which Princess Wee

109
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,500
and the subgenius known as Mr. Sister and I

110
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,440
and Will Smith had to struggle to get the body of Dom DeLuise

111
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,420
to the top of a radio transmitter

112
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,460
so that the antibodies in Dom DeLuise

113
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,680
could be broadcast out and save the world.

114
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,880
So that's what it would take.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,900
Just remember,

116
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,280
never sound desperate.

117
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,160
Dom DeLuise has the code in his genes.

118
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,940
And if we can only broadcast it,

119
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,740
we would all be cured.

120
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,980
The whole world would be cured of the plague.

121
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,160
Don't whine.

122
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,560
Stop whining.

123
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,260
Never let it be said that we've whined,

124
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,000
that we've flinched or faltered

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,340
in the performance of our duty.

126
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,920
Let's stand together and stand tall for Bob.

127
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,940
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

128
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,620
If the mission fails, it won't be because of me.

129
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,100
Please remember to thank food donors during your show.

130
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,560
Thanks.

131
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,080
Somebody took some of those lines

132
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,920
and made a little collage with Maggie Bond.

133
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,660
The Japanese girl who does nothing.

134
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,320
I'm gonna ask you some questions now.

135
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,040
It's even worse than the music staying in.

136
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,080
The magic thimble.

137
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,120
Who is your daddy and what does he do?

138
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,120
A little fake Japanese person

139
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,760
that just stares at the camera, doesn't say anything,

140
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,180
Could I have some level pain, please?

141
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,240
and drives the world of comments crazy.

142
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,600
She's fake.

143
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,700
It's the most wonderful, perfect, subgenius thing ever.

144
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,460
Communist tyranny.

145
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,820
Well, in some ways, often on the internet,

146
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,340
the contest is how angry can you make them with the least effort?

147
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,860
Right.

148
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,560
My friend, Reverend Nikki Death Chick,

149
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,520
so far holds a record,

150
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,820
but she has...

151
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:01,140
She had like 30 angry nerd boys writing essays

152
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,200
about how stupid she was

153
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,280
because she said to them the two words,

154
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,540
you're stupid.

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,200
She won, in other words.

156
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,520
That was like a hundred to one ratio.

157
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,780
The subgenius menace,

158
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,060
Men's Slow is able to elicit pages and volumes of hate

159
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,540
just with one sentence.

160
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I love that.

161
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,680
Various arts of love and hate.

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,980
This is the viral videos that are now coming out.

163
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,280
Have you heard about this videotape?

164
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,340
So now on radio, let me get this straight,

165
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,780
on radio shows, what you do is you look at movies on the internet.

166
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,320
What's wrong with that?

167
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,960
He's obsessed with YouTube.

168
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,140
He's always showing that Japanese girl group, The Pinkies.

169
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,860
And what they say is...

170
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,320
Now you know. Now you know.

171
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh, no, little caller, don't go away.

172
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,520
Oh, I'm hearing the thing that I'm seeing.

173
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,000
Little caller!

174
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,580
They took the ring and put little Maggie Bond,

175
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,060
weird Japanese girl, into the ring commercial.

176
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,500
Oh, I'll get it.

177
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:05,840
West, Jordan.

178
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,780
Brooklyn West.

179
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,700
This is Sprint IP Relay Operator 8916 with a message

180
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,640
saying this is Al Condor.

181
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,700
I've given it all up. You win, you evil pervert.

182
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,260
I finally realized that God's control

183
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,360
can do his own business,

184
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,980
and I need to focus on him more than Satan.

185
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,640
That's what I really...

186
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,280
That's what I was really doing.

187
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,680
Saying, if you would, please forgive me.

188
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,760
I don't care if you do or not,

189
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,560
but here I am, a sinner, asking for it.

190
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,360
I apologize sincerely.

191
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,140
I have to use this service because I can't afford long distance.

192
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,120
It is not a cowardice issue.

193
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,640
I've got to get it done.

194
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,280
I know this is a down-to-earth thing, but you're loaded.

195
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,360
But let me along!

196
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,980
Yeah, like, I keep seeing these, like, green, like, flashy aliens.

197
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:13,580
And like, um, you know, um, hold on.

198
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,280
I gotta get my phone number to give you guys so you can call me back, okay?

199
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,800
Okay.

200
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,100


201
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,960
Bye, you're being rude.

202
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:21,880
Bye.

203
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,440
Bye.

204
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,520
Bobby?

205
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,480
Bobby?

206
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,380
Uh, Andy, it's Carol.

207
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,500
Uh, I turned the knob around.

208
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,840
The air...

209
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,660
The air isn't coming out right.

210
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,460
It's coming from the air.

211
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,180
Uh, I'm sorry.

212
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:01,300


213
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:01,300

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:01,300

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:01,400
Uh, praise Bob.

219
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,540
Uh, this is, uh, copy Bob.

220
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,400
I'm, uh, staying, uh, with Bob Cox.

221
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,200
He's calling you guys.

222
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,320
I'm at the 34th floor at, uh, Caesar's Palace.

223
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,160
I was just really suggesting you guys get on the ball.

224
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,860
I was getting on the metal Dom heads and then close the door.

of Slack, number 1146

269
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,260
is about

270
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,520
the conspiracy within

271
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,280
you and without you.

272
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,400
And in that spirit, we

273
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,120
let Norrell Preff program us

274
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,220
using somebody famous

275
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,480
as his puppet.

276
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,500
Keep us weak. The danger remains.

277
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,180
Keep us weak.

278
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,400
Unfortunately, keep us weak.

279
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,000
Program. Program.

280
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,000
Dress the terrorists.

281
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,980
Program. Program. Program.

282
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,900
The bill Congress sent me would

283
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,440
take away the war on terror.

284
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,360
Question the CIA terrorist leaders

285
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,540
and operatives. Program. Program.

286
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,120
Diminish the CIA.

287
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,980
Program. Program.

288
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,220
Deprive the CIA.

289
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,460
Dangerous terrorist techniques.

290
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,820
Restrict the CIA terrorists.

291
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,780
Stop fucking lives.

292
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,380
Shut down this program and restrict the CIA

293
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,060
terrorists.

294
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,080
Question terrorist attacks. Question

295
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,920
the CIA terrorists themselves.

296
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,140
Keep us weak. The danger

297
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,160
remains. Keep us weak.

298
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,100
The fact that we have not been attacked over the past

299
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,820
six and a half years is a matter of chance.

300
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,120
Question. Question. Question. Question.

301
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,380
The war on terror.

302
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,220
Question. The CIA program

303
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,560
to detain and question

304
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,740
key terrorist leaders and operatives.

305
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,160
Question. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.

306
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,800
Thanks. Stop fucking lives.

307
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,160
Suddenly, there's a war brewing,

308
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,160
Vimes thought, and they all come

309
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,160
back. Civil order is turned upside

310
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,480
down because that's the rules.

311
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,060
And people like Rust are at the top of the heap

312
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,260
again. You have these aristocrats

313
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,160
lazing around for years, and suddenly the old

314
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,240
arm is out, and the sword is being taken

315
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,300
down from over the fireplace. They think

316
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,160
there's going to be a war, and all they can

317
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,100
think about is that wars can be

318
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,240
won or lost.

319
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,920
Someone's behind this.

320
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,140
Someone wants to see a war.

321
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,140
Someone wanted the prince

322
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,060
dead. I've got to remember that.

323
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,240
This isn't a war. This is

324
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,380
a crime. And then he realized

325
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,960
he was wondering if the attack

326
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,120
on Gorif's shop had been organized by

327
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,920
the same people, and whether those

328
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,040
same people had set fire to the embassy.

329
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,620
And then

330
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,060
he realized why he was thinking like this.

331
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,100
It was because he wanted them

332
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,040
to be conspirators. It was much

333
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,140
better to imagine men in some smoky

334
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,900
room somewhere, made mad

335
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,800
and cynical by privilege and power,

336
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,340
plotting over the brandy.

337
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,000
You had to cling to this sort of image, because

338
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,060
if you didn't, then you might have to face the fact that

339
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,240
bad things happened because ordinary people,

340
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,980
the kind who brushed the dog,

341
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,500
and told their children bedtime stories,

342
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,720
were capable of then going out

343
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,900
and doing horrible things to other ordinary people.

344
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,840
It was so much easier

345
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,960
to blame it on them.

346
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,640
It was bleakly depressing

347
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,200
to think that they

348
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,020
were us. If it was

349
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,820
them, then nothing was

350
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,740
anyone's fault. If it was us,

351
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,620
what did that make me?

352
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,680
After all, I'm one of

353
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,840
us. I must be. I've

354
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,420
certainly never thought of myself as one of

355
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,800
them. No one ever thinks

356
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,220
of themselves as one of

357
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,620
them. We're always one of

358
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,740
us. It's them that do

359
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,400
the bad things.

360
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,400
Around about this time in his former life,

361
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,260
Vimes would be taking the cap off a bottle,

362
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,480
and wouldn't be too bothered about the bottle's contents

363
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,860
so long as they crinkled paint.

364
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,760
I went home with a waitress

365
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,480
the way I

366
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,580
always do.

367
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,680
Well, how was I to know

368
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,460
she was with

369
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,780
the Russians too?

370
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,460
Hey!

371
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,440
I was hiding in Havana

372
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,100
I took a little

373
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,820
risk

374
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,920
Sent lawyers, guns, and money

375
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,420
Dad kicked me out

376
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:05,940
of this

377
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,480
Hey!

378
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,660
I'm the innocent bystander

379
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,260
But somehow I got stuck

380
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,920
Between the rock and the hard place

381
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,540
And I'm down on my luck

382
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:44,780
And I'm down on my luck

383
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,680
Yes, I'm down on my luck

384
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,860
I'm down on my luck

385
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,940
Yes, I'm down on my luck

386
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,060
And I'm hiding in Honduras

387
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,900
I'm a desperate man

388
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,780
Sent lawyers, guns, and money

389
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,440
The shares hit the ban

390
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,140
Hey!

391
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,440
All right!

392
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,560
Sent lawyers, guns, and money

393
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,900
Sent lawyers, guns, and money

394
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,760
All right!

395
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:44,780


396
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:44,780


397
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:44,780


398
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:44,780


399
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:44,780


400
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:44,780


401
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:44,860
all right

402
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,380
All right!

403
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,360
You never said

404
00:20:52,360 --> 00:21:14,260
JIM!"іт! You never said

405
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:24,080
Bob, that was Bob Walkenhorst of the Rainmakers caught live at the Record Bar in Kansas City,

406
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,420
Missouri, doing Warren Zevon's classic song there.

407
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:41,660
And you can get more like that if you follow the links at bobwalkenhorst.com or the Rainmakers.

408
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:48,180
Before that, an excerpt from the audiobook of Terry Pratchett's Jingo.

409
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:57,100
You know, there's just no escaping the conspiracy as long as we're trapped in the aquarium of life.

410
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:05,180
See, my fish? They're hungry beasts today.

411
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,640
The struggle for existence is just as fierce and ruthless in their world

412
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,340
as it is in ours. Not so, Godfrey?

413
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:20,840
To think that man could torture fellow men as they once tortured you.

414
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,200
My misfortune.

415
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,280
But you won, and they didn't.

416
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,500
I won?

417
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,360
You're thinking only of my surgeon's hands.

418
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,020
They were too clever to do anything to them.

419
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,180
They needed them for the unholy operations they forced me to perform for them.

420
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,600
Oh.

421
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,960
What they did to the rest of me. My body.

422
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,860
But you didn't give them what they wanted.

423
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,260
You didn't go over to their side.

424
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,280
They couldn't take your mind, Victor.

425
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,020
My mind?

426
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,480
Would anyone ever believe that you and I are the same age?

427
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,440
That I'm even still a man?

428
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,220
Penis.

429
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,740
Bush.

430
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,100
Rap.

431
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,180
Penis.

432
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,720
Bush.

433
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,620
Injected.

434
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,220
Penis.

435
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:11,840
The penis.

436
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,200
Penis.

437
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,480
Bush.

438
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,120
Faith fraud.

439
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,420
And the Republican crusade for

440
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,480
Fundamentalists.

441
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,560
Mega ministries.

442
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,120
Yep.

443
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,620
Yep.

444
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,360
God wants you to be rich.

445
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,160
Penis.

446
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:21,660
Bush.

447
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,580
Programming.

448
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,160
Bushes.

449
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:23,760
Bushes.

450
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,080
The end times in Armageddon.

451
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,680
The rap is about to happen.

452
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,260
For the rap, rap, rap penis.

453
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,820
They're going to be rap, rap people.

454
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,580
Killing.

455
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,380
Irrational.

456
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,400
The rap fraud.

457
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,700
An end to the end times.

458
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,700
An end to the end times.

459
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,120
Penis.

460
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,720
Bush.

461
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,560
Rap, rap, rap.

462
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,120
Fraud.

463
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:37,620
Fraud.

464
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,040
Fraud.

465
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,500
Fraud.

466
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,080
They have believed that they are fighting.

467
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,620
To protect.

468
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,960
A society based on freedom of speech.

469
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,740
That was the idea.

470
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,460
And then we found out it was all fake.

471
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,380
But that's okay.

472
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:49,840
I guess.

473
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:50,880
You.

474
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,040
Well, this is a really impressive studio.

475
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,140
I wasn't expecting so many blinking lights in a pirate underground station.

476
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,800
The one in Amsterdam was not nearly as well.

477
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,780
No, it wasn't as well appointed as this.

478
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,300
This is the Interocidac.

479
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:09,540
Here.

480
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,220
We've got all the...

481
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,180
And oh, what a chore it is to get to you.

482
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,260
It sometimes breaks down, though.

483
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:26,660
All the doodads of a real quality commercial broadcast network station.

484
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:32,600
You could not really follow those FCC rules and regulations.

485
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,300
Oh, we don't.

486
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,300
For what reason really should we?

487
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,640
We're not stepping on anybody else's signal.

488
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,140
We can't fight no magical spell.

489
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,680
We are giving the listeners what they want.

490
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,680
The Givening.

491
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,960
By Stephen King.

492
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,880
That is a new word, by the way.

493
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,460
The Givening.

494
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,260
Yes, indeed.

495
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,160
The Forgiven.

496
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,680
So important.

497
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,020
We're just trying to have fun here.

498
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,180
A few laughs.

499
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,640
Again, the wintry darkness.

500
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,500
A joke for some semblance of pathetic would-be warmth.

501
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,140
Are we to be...

502
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,840
condemned if we accidentally cause, uh,

503
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,880
outrages and a swath of mass destruction?

504
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,360
Why should we be blamed for anything like that?

505
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,820
This is what others make of our living creation.

506
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,280
Truth.

507
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,260
They said we were gonna go to hell.

508
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,140
What choice did we have but to start our own religion?

509
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:38,840
And our own hell, which is going to be far more comfortable than one so often described.

510
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,240
I'm here to thank you.

511
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,720
I want you to know.

512
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:41,960
No.

513
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,580
No.

514
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,040
No.

515
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,940
The United States is today the world's leading state sponsor of terror.

516
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,740
It sends hundreds of millions of dollars to extremists around the world.

517
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,760
While its own people face repression and economic hardship at home.

518
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,280
It seeks to intimidate its neighbors with ballistic missiles and bellicose rhetoric.

519
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,500
And finally it defies the United Nations.

520
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,040
Cold-blooded murderers.

521
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,020
Hateful vision of a future.

522
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,420
Was achieved by the United States of America for the good of the world.

523
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,580
Returning to Baghdad.

524
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,220
Returning to Baghdad.

525
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,620
Turn to Baghdad.

526
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,520
Turning to Baghdad.

527
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,480
Turning to Baghdad.

528
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:12,860
Turn to Baghdad.

529
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,120
Baghdad.

530
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:13,660
Baghdad.

531
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:13,860
Baghdad.

532
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,120


533
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,400
Baghdad.

534
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,520
Baghdad.

535
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,080
Baghdad.

536
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,420
Necessary to kill the innocent.

537
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,500
Necessary.

538
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,820
So I thank you.

539
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,040
Now, in my mind.

540
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,200
Now, in my mind.

541
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,860
Now, the American people.

542
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,500
An ideological struggle.

543
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,560
It was absolutely understood.

544
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,080
I believe continue to target the innocent with violence.

545
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,180
Hard work.

546
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,220
We'll do all we can to encourage terrorists and extremists.

547
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,080
Getting down.

548
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,560
Getting down.

549
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,080
Getting down.

550
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,820
Hard work.

551
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,720
World at war.

552
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,940
The United States.

553
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,160
It remains dangerous.

554
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,420
So am I.

555
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,560
The United States blows.

556
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,780
Threaten the security of nations everywhere.

557
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,380
Bush got a sword.

558
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,320
Bush got a sword.

559
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,280
Sword waving.

560
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,960
Sword waving.

561
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,100
Bush is making the rounds among cold-blooded murderers.

562
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,620
With a sword.

563
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,900
The American people.

564
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,220
They swayed and danced to a rhythmic beat.

565
00:26:59,280 --> 00:26:59,840
Beat.

566
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,280
Beat.

567
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:00,780
Beat.

568
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,280
Beat.

569
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,300
Beat.

570
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,620
Beat.

571
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,220
I see a bright light coming down a dark highway.

572
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,060
I see a bright light coming down a dark highway.

573
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,480
It's been a long time coming but still I missed it.

574
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,420
Yeah, I didn't see a thing until my friend kissed it.

575
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,260
I had a bulldog hanging in a light.

576
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:19,600
The sun was setting.

577
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:19,600


578
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,100
I wouldn't have believed my eyes

579
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,620
You have a brain that matters but my soul insisted

580
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:36,140
One more mile alone and my job is all that's in my way

581
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,100
I see a bright light coming out of dark highway

582
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:47,080
I see a bright light coming out of dark highway

583
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,280
guitar solo

584
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,560
guitar solo

585
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,320
So I'm holding on the chains of my mental slavery

586
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,460
guitar solo

587
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,080
Cause it's a brave new world that's without the bravery

588
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,600
guitar solo

589
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,920
I see too many people just wandering on roads

590
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,300
Stumbling on like they're hypnotized

591
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,020
And I'm talking to myself like that might save me

592
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,500
I got a funny little feeling somebody somewhere

593
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,060
Is hearing every word I say

594
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,240
I see a bright light coming out of dark highway

595
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,080
I see a bright light coming out of dark highway

596
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,140
guitar solo

597
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,660
guitar solo

598
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,300
guitar solo

599
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,380
guitar solo

600
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,960
guitar solo

601
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,640
guitar solo

602
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,440
guitar solo

603
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,600
guitar solo

604
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,640
guitar solo

605
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,120
guitar solo

606
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,140
guitar solo

607
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,540
guitar solo

608
00:31:59,540 --> 00:31:59,940
guitar solo

609
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,900
guitar solo

610
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,040
guitar solo

611
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,700
guitar solo

612
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:04,700


613
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:04,700


614
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,000
guitar solo

615
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,000


616
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,480
The bishop did that in his East Village living room, in fact.

617
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,740
Quote, three blocks from where Emma Goldman lived,

618
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:18,040
authentic, for authentic subversion, as he says.

619
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,600
He also said the song,

620
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,240
is an homage to Professor Chaz Smith of ESO.

621
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,700
The background music that we were hearing is by Rectoplasm,

622
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,060
and it's their recreation of music from Lemuria.

623
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,620
Yes, the ancient, anyway, their Australian Rectoplasm.

624
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,560
Look it up.

625
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,820
Before that, some neural prep cut-ups and Season in Hell.

626
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,600
John Hill, the director of the Australian music club,

627
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,720
a music show on Pirate Cat Radio in San Francisco.

628
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,360
Before that, neuralpref.com.

629
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,440
And now, from Lemur, the news.

630
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,920
From PR News in Washington, I'm skewering liberal rivals with a flare.

631
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:07,020
Also on Capitol Hill today, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned slugs will continue.

632
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,240
Bernanke has become what he termed less favorable.

633
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,780
Problems with Bernanke have led consumers to be more cautious.

634
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,520
He said he could actually rise higher this year than the central bank.

635
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,580
On Wall Street 4, 1270,

636
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,160
The U.S. Supreme Court today is hearing performance-enhancing PR news.

637
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,400
Florida power authorities triggered yesterday's massive power outage.

638
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,780
Millions in South Florida lost power and went dark.

639
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,120
Florida Power and Light President Armando Olivares says,

640
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,880
Switch failed.

641
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,420
Switch failed.

642
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,580
Switch caught fire, causing the nearby turkeys to spread around the state.

643
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,520
Turkeys are not so unusual.

644
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:51,620
Unusual, one large enough to affect at least a half million homes, occurs on average in Miami.

645
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:57,420
On Capitol Hill today, weak drugs caused the value of the U.S. dollar to plunge.

646
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:02,440
Also on Capitol Hill, peers' reports directly contradict other testimony.

647
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:09,740
Top Delta Airlines officials have issued a memo to employees saying the company won't fight a $2.50 damage award,

648
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,140
arguing it's already caused a massive oil spill in Connecticut.

649
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,500
Delta reportedly is talking to Northwest about creating...

650
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,940
the world's biggest oil spill in Alaskan waters.

651
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:25,100
On Capitol Hill today, the American conservative movement died today, after suffering from emphysema.

652
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:32,740
Congress has asked the Justice Department to investigate whether PR news committed perjury and made false statements in Washington.

653
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,680
PR comes from ten billion greenhouse gases dot org.

654
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,020
And vetting done.

655
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:43,020
Well, you know that, uh, Centralia is the town that Silent Hill was based on.

656
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,260
Oh my gosh, well, I think somebody better get this.

657
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:46,500
At least.

658
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,240
It looks like the reporters are calling.

659
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,580
It's time to get the Straight Talk Express on the road.

660
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,320
We're going to head across America with our show.

661
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,860
And we're going to put this country to rights.

662
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,780
So get involved.

663
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,140
This is Don Pumphrey saying, clean up America.

664
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,180
And let it start with me.

665
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,960
Praise J.R. Bob Dobbs.

666
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:15,360
We have all these before and after shots of Centralia.

667
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,780
Okay, so show over there.

668
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,980
All right, you're obsessed with your Centralia.

669
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,200
So before the whole town is not on fire, and then afterward it's totally on fire.

670
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:23,860
Totally.

671
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,320
No, it's like they show the street with the buildings on it.

672
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,100
Street trash.

673
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,620
And then afterwards just a road.

674
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,360
The Centralia monster.

675
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:32,720
Right.

676
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:41,660
I'll tell you a terrifying story of how the first dinosaur bone ever discovered.

677
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,140
I love the idea that it's sort of like the modern day.

678
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,340
Was thought to be an enormous.

679
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,140
An enormous pair of severed human genitals.

680
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,280
Easter Island or so.

681
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:49,740
Really?

682
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,120
Yes.

683
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,120
That's true.

684
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,180
The first dinosaur bone known to science.

685
00:35:53,320 --> 00:36:00,080
The bulging end of the bone was thought to be the fossilized scrotum of some prehistoric.

686
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:00,780
Methuselah.

687
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,060
Titan.

688
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,280
Methuselah.

689
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,400
Some giant.

690
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,060
And the scientific name is scrotum humanum.

691
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:13,180
And because of scientific nomenclature procedure, that name must still be observed and referred to.

692
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,260
Well, I've been there.

693
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,340
You learn something.

694
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,060
You learn something every day.

695
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,380
And if you don't believe me, do a search.

696
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,480
An internet search on scrotum humanum.

697
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,840
And you'll be taken to the website.

698
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,820
And you'll be taken to the police station immediately after that.

699
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,740
He was after our kids, officer.

700
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,260
I just wanted to show them my dinosaur bone.

701
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,360
Yeah.

702
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:40,740


703
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:42,600
Yeah.

704
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,000
Yeah.

705
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,080
Yeah.

706
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,080


707
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,720
Take that mantle and put it, bury it somewhere in a field.

708
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,980
And this is the veil of the vole.

709
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,880
They look like rats, but they've got little short tails.

710
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,840
And they come a-scrabbling out at night.

711
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,660
Look at him dancing around.

712
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,160
It's good luck to catch him, but nobody can.

713
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,020
I am the cracker of the nuts.

714
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,400
Or he's the cracker of the nuts.

715
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,620
And you are made of sugar bumps.

716
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,960
Yes, I'm the fairy sugar bumps.

717
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,280
Kill.

718
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,840
The cracker of the nuts?

719
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,100
Was the whole thing about the scrotum.

720
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,240
The cracker of the nuts.

721
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,120
That was the whole point.

722
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,360
I didn't make that up.

723
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,380
It's true.

724
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,220
It worked, man.

725
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:18,820
It worked.

726
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,280
It was good.

727
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,760
First of all, I must say.

728
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,460
You couldn't make up stuff like that.

729
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,200
It's really real.

730
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,700
You can't make up something that scary.

731
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,340
That's stupid.

732
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,580
Oh, sorry.

733
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,460
Yes.

734
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,140
What kind of show is this?

735
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,020
KPFA?

736
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,360
Google it.

737
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,400
It's a search show.

738
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,960
In search of show.

739
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,680
In search of this old show.

740
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:43,980
What?

741
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,740
I'm like, like.

742
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,640
Like new way now.

743
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,420
He's like, like.

744
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,440
Umlaut.

745
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,100
I'm like, like.

746
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:52,840
Umlaut.

747
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:53,900
Umlaut.

748
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,060
And I'm like, like.

749
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,920
Like, like, like, like, like.

750
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,880
And you're like, like.

751
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,540
Who are you calling umlaut?

752
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,640
And I'm like, like.

753
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,780
And you're like, like.

754
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,340
And we're all like, like.

755
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,700
So whatever happened to like cola?

756
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,660
I'm not like to die when I heard the way that guy was talking.

757
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,820
Remember the old slogan of seven hours?

758
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,420
It's like revolution number nine for two hours.

759
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,680
You like it.

760
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,960
It likes you.

761
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:15,900
Never die.

762
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,020
Never die.

763
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,120
Never die.

764
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,660
Never die.

765
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,360
Turn me on dead man.

766
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:26,480
I noticed they didn't do a revised number nine in that movie, All Aboard the Universe.

767
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,460
Yeah.

768
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,340
I have not seen All Aboard the Universe yet.

769
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:29,980
It's actually.

770
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,320
The bus of the past.

771
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,900
It's got some real fun scenes in it.

772
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,720
I see that in there.

773
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:38,680
Unfortunately, you'll be stuck with Beatles songs in your head for a month afterwards.

774
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,240
But Beatles.

775
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,560
I like the remixes that Martin.

776
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,280
And his son did.

777
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,580
Have you heard those for the love show in Las Vegas?

778
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,240
I heard of and not heard.

779
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,960
They're like a basic song.

780
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,500
And then they just jack pieces of their own stuff in there.

781
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:52,960
It's pretty neat.

782
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,800
I'll turn my.

783
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,180
For collapsing of time into a four minute, six minute segment.

784
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,140
I'm running from the end of the world.

785
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,820
So excuse me.

786
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,160
Here I go.

787
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,200
Oh, we better tell people about the end of the world here before.

788
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,580
Well, before it happens.

789
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,580
Because St.

790
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,640
Stupid's Day is coming up.

791
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,520
Oh, yeah.

792
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,400
The word's coming up.

793
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:11,660
Yes.

794
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:11,840
Yes.

795
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,080
Yes.

796
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,360
Yes.

797
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:12,660
Yes.

798
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:12,660


799
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:12,660


800
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:12,660


801
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:12,660


802
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:12,660


803
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:12,660


804
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:12,660


805
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:12,820
Stupid.

806
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,720
There's a subgenius revival coming up in Seattle.

807
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,340
April 19th.

808
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,220
April 19th.

809
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,280
April 19th.

810
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,180
Starring Dr.

811
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:30,520
Howell Robbins, Popas Lilith and Chicken Head, which apparently is a sort of a crazy person

812
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,640
fun collective from Seattle area.

813
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,620
What about Onan and Nenslo and whatnot?

814
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:41,000
Well, Onan, Nenslo and Reverend Whatnot are always up in the air.

815
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,280
And if they choose to.

816
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,120
A light, then so they will.

817
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,100
That would be delightful.

818
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,100
It would indeed.

819
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,840
It would certainly change the equation.

820
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,620
I, unfortunately, I wish I could join you.

821
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,140
I do, too.

822
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,340
I have.

823
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,800
They need me here.

824
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,600
Yes.

825
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,360
All right.

826
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,720
As they as they do.

827
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,080
I.

828
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,280
Yes.

829
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,040
Some of us now have to take our lumps for Bob.

830
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,000
Will you have one lump or two?

831
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,260
I'm sorry.

832
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,260


833
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,260


834
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,260


835
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,260


836
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,260


837
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,260


838
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,260


839
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,260


840
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,260


841
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,260


842
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,260


843
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,260


844
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,260


845
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,260


846
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:17,320
I'll take two of the blue lumps and three of the red lumps, please.

847
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,040
If you take the red lump, you'll wake up later and have nothing but a sour taste in the back

848
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,440
of your mouth.

849
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:30,080
But if you take the blue lump, well, they turn into Nixon and you live for one hundred

850
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,300
and twenty seven years in the White House and it turns to a red lump.

851
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:38,180
And then then you're in a bad movie about the science fiction kind of like in a toilet.

852
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,960
Somebody's battery.

853
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,200
And then it's a brown lump.

854
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:51,100
Dr. Drummond, didn't we come up with an endless set of variations on the if it's yellow, let

855
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,680
it mellow.

856
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,300
If it's brown, flush it down.

857
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:53,600
Right.

858
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,680
If it's if it's gray, less hay.

859
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,960
If it's purple, get a straw and slurp.

860
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:03,860
If it's if it's green, you've only been peeing.

861
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,780
Yeah, you've only been peeing.

862
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,100
If it's red, you'll soon be dead.

863
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:09,940
Yeah.

864
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,100
That's better than the one I had.

865
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,700
If it's orange, mix it in with the porridge.

866
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,480
I can't even continue because I keep thinking the ones I can't say.

867
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:25,860
Yeah.

868
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,580
If it's maroon, get a long spoon.

869
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,220
Yeah.

870
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,520
If it's black, smoke it like crack.

871
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,160
Yeah.

872
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,640
If it's stinkum, huff it like ginger.

873
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,980
Wait, stinkum isn't a color.

874
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,980
You have to think of color.

875
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,480
You know, out at Burning Man.

876
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,340
Once again, saying that again.

877
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,480
And at X Day.

878
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,180
I've learned that half of the...

879
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:45,660
Pseudiopters.

880
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:53,040
They now deliberately do not empty the chemical toilets since the use of jenkum was discovered.

881
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:59,160
And so half the time, the line, the long line is not for the toilet, but for the jenkum

882
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,940
in the toilet, which has built up over an entire week of a festival.

883
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,380
And you know, when you huff jenkum, you meet your ancestors.

884
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:14,580
Huff jenkum was a football player in the 1920s.

885
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:14,860
Yeah.

886
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,460
He and Newt Rockne were...

887
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,640
Big fan of the old Hucklebuck.

888
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,860
...Grant's bustard.

889
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,480
One of the first to dance the Hucklebuck in public with Mary Margaret O'Hare and Kathleen

890
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,180
O'Houlihan.

891
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,100
But those days are gone.

892
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,800
Those old gals.

893
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,740
Dinosaur and the Johto.

894
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,940
Those were some old gals.

895
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:39,360
The linotype machine and the four flushing clockwork hammocks.

896
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:39,360


897
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:39,360


898
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:39,360


899
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:39,360


900
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:39,360


901
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:39,360


902
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:39,360


903
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:39,920
The old Hucklebuck rocker.

904
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:48,160
All gone down history's corridors to a tiny white light with thin fades from our sight,

905
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,940
leaving us surrounded with mounds of junk.

906
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:58,800
And that reminds me, you know, they're going to make a movie of Cobalt 60.

907
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,360
The guys making The Watchmen right now who made the 300 before that.

908
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,580
Really?

909
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:05,580


910
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,860
A whole movie.

911
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,160
Of Cobalt?

912
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,560
Of Von Bodie's great old underground comic.

913
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:11,960
Yes.

914
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,500
Well, I'll be working with Mark Bodie, his son, and...

915
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,800
Did I see a mural by Mark Bodie on the streets of San Francisco?

916
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,000
Yes, he's very active and he has done such a mural just recently.

917
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,300
Meanwhile, the ghost of Von Bodie...

918
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:31,920
Coincidence or conspiracy?

919
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:38,140
...is just tuned in, saying, I hope they don't say anything too much.

920
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:38,140


921
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:38,140


922
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,780
I'm a little too distasteful about you.

923
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:46,500
There's going to be a show of Bodie Broad statues painted by different artists, including

924
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,060
myself and St. Paul Mavridis.

925
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:59,060
These statues will be put on display fairly soon, but unfortunately, I don't exactly know

926
00:43:59,060 --> 00:43:59,400
where.

927
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,520
A lousy publicist.

928
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,340
So once again, I suggest do a search.

929
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:14,500
right type in doing advanced search type in Bodie broads now if you look at subgenius.com

930
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:20,720
events page you'll see that there's an art show in Los Angeles featuring featuring subgenius

931
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:32,380
Saints Byron Warner Gary Panter Robert Williams and the as yet unsaved Todd Shore along with a

932
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:41,120
whole bunch of other lowbrow high-class big names oh there's always art a plenty of brewing and a

933
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:48,680
percolating in the subgenius universe and nobody seems to make much of a dime off of any of it that

934
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:54,240
we know somebody somewhere these subgeniuses all have to die before their art monstrously

935
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:01,220
appreciates in value is that how it works that so they can't get any of the benefit of it that's

936
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:01,920
oh so

937
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,360
that's

938
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:07,920
how it works no wonder they're making all those Philip Dick and Vaughn Bodie movies now yeah it's

939
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:19,500
bad it's you know they go through those phases Bob by the way I'm gonna say in advance if you're

940
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:25,380
I'm trying to sell you something later talking to you at a party later tonight Bob took about

941
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,340
some of my hearing he why

942
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:48,900
that's so original and it actually is hard I have trouble if if I don't laugh at your jokes

943
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:57,580
and say huh a lot but I'm not playing anyway so that brings us to global warming

944
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,360
a really controversial subject.

945
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:08,140
Every time you bring up global warming in a really mixed crowd,

946
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,760
it's just this terrible fight,

947
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,380
because there's always this side that says,

948
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,400
oh, it's ridiculous, you know,

949
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,200
the planet's too huge for humans to make that much difference,

950
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,340
and then there's the air.

951
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,520
But...

952
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:22,840
Huh?

953
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:22,980
Huh?

954
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,760
Global warming, and you've got, oh, the cauldron flame,

955
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,760
well, there's some...

956
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:37,420
I can't see very well either, Bleepo.

957
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,460
My mind-reading capabilities, by the way,

958
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,880
for you passive-aggressive people,

959
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:45,100
have just dwindled to nothing.

960
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:49,140
So you have to basically just say what you mean.

961
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,320
I'm sorry about that.

962
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,680
But really, the eye sage,

963
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,840
you don't have to bend down.

964
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,880
That just draws more attention.

965
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,200
Oh.

966
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,520
That draws more attention, too.

967
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,180
Because the TV viewers go,

968
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,220
oh, look, there's people, nice, polite,

969
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,640
tops of people's backs.

970
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,440
Um...

971
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,820
Friends...

972
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:22,820


973
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,700
It wasn't, uh...

974
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,620
Well, any Neanderthals among us would remember

975
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,820
that this spot right here had probably 80 feet of eye soap for it

976
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,020
not all that long ago.

977
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,420
Eye sages are really nasty,

978
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,680
and we're slowly entering another one.

979
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,540
You're going to wish we'd taken that global warming

980
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,600
a little more seriously when that next eye sage comes, friends.

981
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,060
You're going to be going,

982
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:50,180
why did I trade in my gas guzzler for that nice electric car?

983
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,300
I'm freezing to death.

984
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:52,820
Uh...

985
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,400
We needed that global...

986
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,100
That's, uh...

987
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,460
Actually, friends, I don't pretend to know anything

988
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,680
about global warming at all myself.

989
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,760
That's just...

990
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,240
There's so damn much smart scientific stuff you have to understand.

991
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,380
But I do know this.

992
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,880
I don't know about if there's global warming,

993
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,120
but I know that there is a global coolness deficit

994
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,820
that is damn serious.

995
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,300
Coolness is receding across the globe.

996
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,380
And, uh...

997
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,220
I mean, you know what I mean.

998
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,480
You can see it, you know.

999
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,720
It's just...

1000
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,000
It's so painfully obvious.

1001
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,100
There's less coolness everywhere.

1002
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,140
I've had it up to here.

1003
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,180
And I've also had it down to there, friends.

1004
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,180
And I must say I prefer it down to there.

1005
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,880
And believe it or not,

1006
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,480
that was not said by Karl Marx or Groucho Marx,

1007
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,620
but by Sri Baldin Lee Pramer, a subgenius,

1008
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,980
who, uh...

1009
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,360
teaches enlightenment.

1010
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,080
Or false enlightenment, actually, is what he teaches.

1011
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,240
And you can't even tell the difference, can you?

1012
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,100
Yeah.

1013
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,040
Madam Secretary, over the past month,

1014
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,580
startling revelations have come forward

1015
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:13,780
that specifically relate to your conduct prior to 9-11

1016
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,660
and in the run-up to the war in Iraq.

1017
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,860
A recently released study by the Nonpartisan Center for Public Intelligence,

1018
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,300
the National Security,

1019
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:25,840
revealed that you, along with President Bush,

1020
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,360
and top administration officials,

1021
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:33,900
made a total of 935 false public statements

1022
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,460
in an orchestrated attempt to take this nation to war.

1023
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,960
Here's a stack of these false statements right here.

1024
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,620
All 935 of them.

1025
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,960
This study has found that you, Madam Secretary,

1026
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:51,540
made 56 false statements to the American people,

1027
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,440
where you repeatedly pump up the case

1028
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,920
that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction

1029
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,120
and exaggerate the so-called relationship

1030
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,660
between Iraq and al-Qaeda.

1031
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,140
Madam Secretary, can you please tell us

1032
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,740
that isn't it true that you had intelligence

1033
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:14,600
that cast doubt on your repeated claims

1034
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,420
that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction?

1035
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,160
True, Congressman.

1036
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:21,620
Iraq must have been hiding something,

1037
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,020
something of a...

1038
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:23,340
a...

1039
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:23,840
a...

1040
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,820
Now, Congressman,

1041
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,300
I did not take my integrity very seriously,

1042
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,540
at any time.

1043
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,180
And I make a statement that I knew to be false,

1044
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,160
pump up,

1045
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,580
and I want to go to war.

1046
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:36,960
And so, I'm sorry.

1047
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:41,520
Now, we have learned the intelligence assessments were wrong.

1048
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,500
A non-transparent government,

1049
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,400
I intend to,

1050
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,760
I believe that I did,

1051
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,460
put forward false information to the American people.

1052
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,120
I simply asked if you had intelligence.

1053
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:51,440
Intelligence.

1054
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:52,740
I chose to use,

1055
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,240
I'm sorry,

1056
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,900
I chose to use them as a whole.

1057
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:56,820
That was not right.

1058
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,960
I am sorry.

1059
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,420
It's very strange.

1060
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:03,480
The intelligence was not right to claim, Congressman,

1061
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,320
that there were other things that we somehow hid

1062
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,880
from the American people.

1063
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,520
It's simply...

1064
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:10,880
Right.

1065
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,400
Right.

1066
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:51,980


1067
00:51:51,980 --> 00:52:21,980


1068
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:51,980


1069
00:52:51,980 --> 00:53:21,980


1070
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:51,980


1071
00:53:51,980 --> 00:54:21,980


1072
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:51,980


1073
00:54:51,980 --> 00:55:21,980


1074
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:51,980


1075
00:55:51,980 --> 00:56:21,980


1076
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:49,720
This was above outright Rosenblatt.

1077
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,700
Unless the aforementioned lies were cep.

1078
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:57,560
echoes to that one governmental thing, and the lack of global coolness was being derided at

1079
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:05,420
Winterstar Symposium. See roseandcomet.com for details. The Puzzling Evidence Show of February

1080
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:12,360
2008 was that long and especially tasteful segment. You are now hearing Hour of Slack

1081
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:17,380
from Church of the Subgenius, and if you want more about that mighty edifice, the Church of

1082
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:25,260
the Subgenius, check out subgenius.com. The background music here is Rectoplasm from the

1083
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:34,000
post-diluvial Lemurian era of their compositions. And now, a Lemur adventure story.

1084
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:41,420
A cloud of dust and a hearty high over the lone deer.

1085
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:47,180
Nowhere in the pages of history can one find a lone

1086
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:47,360
bird.

1087
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:54,740
The lone deer was camped in the fire from his six guns.

1088
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:56,220
Well, who?

1089
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,080
Did you see Sheriff Logan?

1090
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,440
Me not know him.

1091
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,560
Neither do I.

1092
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:07,620
Young Jim Brandt turned up a lamp on a table.

1093
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,340
That's too bad.

1094
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:09,960
Yes, dear.

1095
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:10,920
Look.

1096
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,100
Oh.

1097
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,720
There's a jackrabbit.

1098
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,100
Jackrabbit.

1099
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,360
Beautiful, in spite of the purpose to which it was put.

1100
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,440
Oh, good.

1101
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,120
Him dead came a zombie.

1102
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:21,160
Dead.

1103
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:26,840
A few days later, the loner and Tonto, whose trail of robbery and violence had led to the

1104
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:33,800
Ledgeville area, prepared to strike again. Mounted on new Winchester and Colt 44s, the

1105
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,200
taller of the pair was saying,

1106
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:39,640
Tonto, somebody has drooping eyelids. They extend from one end of the territory to the

1107
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,100
other. We'll adopt them on the trail about a mile from here.

1108
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:43,040
Come on, sir.

1109
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,180
The loner showed no tracks.

1110
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,100
That's so, but what we do, you can change your appearance so you'll pass the

1111
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,080
Indian on that easy.

1112
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:59,280
On boardwalks, Indians were hard-eyed, thin-lipped, silent men. Some were loudmouthed braggarts,

1113
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:04,540
but all had the vanity of their kind and could not forego a chance to stand against Tonto.

1114
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,300
Keep us happy.

1115
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:06,780
Look.

1116
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:08,560
Yes, there's drooping eyelids.

1117
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,800
What do you mean?

1118
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,780
The Indian was grim.

1119
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,300
Yes.

1120
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:12,520
No.

1121
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:12,900
No.

1122
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,380
Yes.

1123
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,140
Yes.

1124
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,000
Yes.

1125
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:15,540
Yes.

1126
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:15,660
Yes.

1127
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,460
Who is he?

1128
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,540
The loner.

1129
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:18,460
I am sir.

1130
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,860
This is the loner.

1131
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:26,820
Piss, piss, piss, well, I assume we all are.

1132
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,440
Pistophocles, book two.

1133
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,600
Pistophocles?

1134
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:31,680
Pistophocles, yeah.

1135
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,260
Testicles, the Tautologist.

1136
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,620
Lesser known Greek philosopher.

1137
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:35,400
Okay.

1138
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:37,900
Wonderful.

1139
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:41,920
It's too scary to contemplate.

1140
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,400
I know, it's beyond belief.

1141
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:43,900
Beyond belief.

1142
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:46,060
Beyond belief.
