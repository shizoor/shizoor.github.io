1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
Come here, little man.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:08,800
Here the ancient Indians blow psychedelic snuff up their nose from 45-foot pipes they make from bark of trees.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,360
They call it Yo-Ho-Bo.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,120
Yo-Ho-Bo.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,400
Yes, the mighty, mighty pipe of Bob is visible all over the Inca Empire.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,580
Wherever there is a stone, there's the pipe.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,240
Bigger than any civilization has ever pictured it before.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,360
Fantastic, but true.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,820
Well, thank you.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,560
Ah, the cooling waters of Slack.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,440
Wash over you now.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,320
Here's a bucket.

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,380
The subgenius hour of Slack.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,420
This is straight stuff.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,000
I mean, it came straight from you.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,820
Well, it gave me the riddles.

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,660
Didn't you, Jimmy?

18
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,480
Can you feel it?

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,340
I can.

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,160
That's right.

21
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,240
How much do I owe you?

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:47,620
Nothing.

23
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,280
Nothing?

24
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,080
You already paid to Bob.

25
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,780
Your girlfriend with all the hours you put in on terrible music.

26
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,860
You paid for your Slack.

27
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,340
It's coming.

28
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,320
Just sit down and wait for it.

29
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,800
It's only the first step in a new life for you.

30
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,980
How can I purchase that?

31
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,100
Go on the air.

32
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,280
Hey.

33
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,940
Just right away.

34
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,380
We don't want to go too commercial.

35
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,320
This is not a situation where we make any money.

36
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:03,820
We're not infallible.

37
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,220
This money goes into giant baskets.

38
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,260
We don't claim to be Superman.

39
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,240
We don't claim to be heroes or gods.

40
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,660
We don't claim to be heroes or gods.

41
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,680
But you guys are good.

42
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:28,560
No, some of us do not claim to be heroes or gods.

43
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,300
Dear friends, but some of us do.

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,520
Ah, yes, dear friends.

45
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,880
Friend, friend, good.

46
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,700
Friend, good.

47
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:58,140
And this is the Hour of Slack Battle Manual.

48
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,900
Manual by the Unibobber.

49
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:15,940
The Hour of Slack show is a manual for the modern rebel operating out of a conspiracy-dominated society.

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:27,760
The patriopsychotic, anarcho-materialist reasons behind military resistance against established state or occupational government are not the focus.

51
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:38,900
The show is merely instructions for those who feel the need to heed them.

52
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:45,140
You may ask, why should anyone be interested in this Slack stuff?

53
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,920
Why, this is America.

54
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,700
We are a free society and we have a powerful conspiracy to defend us.

55
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,520
To this, I reply, what are you, special?

56
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:08,040
Do you think that just because you live in America, you are immune to oppression or UFO, alien occupation?

57
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:16,100
Just how free is this society you were told was so free and for how much longer?

58
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,700
What makes you think that the conspiracy is around just to protect you anyway?

59
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,060
You cannot run away from the world.

60
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,500
All you can do...

61
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,640
Is prepare.

62
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,760
Even if...

63
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,680
Listening to this show is all you do, you'll be that much better off for it.

64
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,760
For when the time comes that the information in this show is really needed, this show will

65
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:50,060
no longer be on the air and I will be in some stinking hole of a political prison or a mental hospital.

66
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,040
Same thing.

67
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,020
The information will have to be gained after that through experimentation and trial.

68
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,120
The information will have to be gained after that through experimentation and trial.

69
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,120


70
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,980
And someone ask Okay!

71
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,840
P tard and tell

72
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,680
if you like your movie.

73
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,500
I love it.

74
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:26,140
It's amazing.

75
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:32,500
country filled to the brim with pinkness gives me the creeps. We have the senators who are planning

76
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:39,800
concentration camps for us as early as 1997. We have the ATF guys who serve search warrants with

77
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,880
hot lead instead of paper. We have the FBI which can do whatever it wants in the interest of

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,000
national security, including burglaries, electronic mutilation without warrants, and compiling lists

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,960
of people to be labeled bad credit risks during future wartime. We have the CIA which does the

80
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,980
same things even though domestic intelligence is supposed to be strictly off limits to them. Yes,

81
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:14,200
this place, America, seems great, but it is mainly because of what you don't know. The more you know,

82
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,280
the more sense the Church of the Subgenius makes, and the more sense it makes to begin to prepare

83
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,120
for the worst.

84
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:21,980
And, uh...

85
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:32,920
I don't feel the need to give a hard sell to anyone about this show. If you have even so much as heard of the Church of the Subgenius, then you are probably at least halfway slackful.

86
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:50,680
If you are halfway slackful, then you can see the need to prepare for the future. Hence the need to hear this show. Whether you feel that you will need to defend yourself in the future from our government alien occupation or your damn neighbors, this show is for you.

87
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,960
This show...

88
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,620
is pure instructional matter.

89
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:04,880
We have included no personal stories nor irrelevant information. It is simply a manual on guerrilla warfare in modern societies.

90
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:15,360
We believe that the most serious listeners will be relieved that they will not have to sift through a bunch of BS to get to the facts.

91
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,040
I know that is how Bob would want it.

92
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,280
I am...

93
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,920
the Unibobber.

94
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:31,920
And now, here they are, the cloaking device. Are they Klingons? Are they Romulans? The cloaking device keeps them invisible.

95
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,780
Now you see it. Now you don't.

96
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,480
First you feel it, but you don't really know if it's over you.

97
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,560
Something in the air

98
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,100
What's come over you

99
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,380
Something in the air

100
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,800
Destruct the senses for invisibility

101
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,060
Become adaptive

102
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,020
Stealthy stalking

103
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,060
I've got my UFO detect role

104
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,020
Jуска

105
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,020


106
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,160
Impu зрation

107
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,040
signals flash the warning

108
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,620
that it's over you

109
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,780
something again

110
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,560
and they're watching you

111
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,500
something again

112
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,600
the cloaking device

113
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,460
the cloaking device

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,380
the cloaking device

115
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,100
the cloaking device

116
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,560
I'm just a little superstitious

117
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,760
I'm looking for signs everywhere

118
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,140
I've got a feeling in my bones

119
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,440
there's something in the air

120
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,700
something in the air

121
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,380
something in the air

122
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,020
something in the air

123
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,720
something in the air

124
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,500
something in the air

125
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:36,320
something in the air

126
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,580
Scalawaves

127
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,320
new age

128
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,000
check control

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,560
check, check, check, check

130
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,080
Tesla

131
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:59,640
Star waves, space rage, shock your soul with tech, tech, tech, tech, techno.

132
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:14,380
Rainboat, lip mood, purple rain, tech, tech, tech, tech, techno.

133
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,160
Well, I'm just getting real superstitious, looking for signs everywhere.

134
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,920
I've got a feeling in my bones there's something in the air.

135
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,120
Something in the air.

136
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,580
Something in the air.

137
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,480
Something in the air.

138
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,800
Something in the air.

139
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,320
The cloaking device.

140
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,100
The cloaking device.

141
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,940
The cloaking device.

142
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,780
The cloaking device.

143
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,060
Yes, dear friends, that was the Klingons from Germany.

144
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,060
Yes, indeed, friends.

145
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,940
A classic subgenius song.

146
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:29,280
There's a song in the air called The Cloaking Device from, yes, indeed, from the Klingons at Octo Sound Studios in Berlin.

147
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,760
Brand new tape.

148
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,480
There's some more great stuff from them on this.

149
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:40,840
That's from Reverend Nancy Darnell and her boyfriend, Reverend Rocking Wanking.

150
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,800
I guess it's pronounced Rocking Wanking.

151
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,060
I kind of like those Germanic pronunciations, friends.

152
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,140
And in the background here, a statue.

153
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,440
A CD that we've just started to get free CDs in the mail, much like real radio stations do.

154
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:07,340
In this case, this is the soundtrack of a movie, an old Italian movie called Vampiros Lesbos.

155
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,420
The CD is called Sexadelic Dance Party by Vampiros Lesbos.

156
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,400
And boy, it is mod indeed.

157
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,660
Actually, I think it's from like a 1968 horror film.

158
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:32,200
And yet here it is released on CD in America today, where it costs $5 per second to live in America today.

159
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:41,500
And where there is yet not a subgenius CD, but we're hoping to, and not an official headquarters church of the subgenius CD,

160
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,800
but we're hoping to cure that and to fix a number of ills.

161
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,360
Our mail order department here is under new management by Jesus.

162
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,760
Yes, the Lord Jesus Christ.

163
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,900
In this life, his name is Jesus H. Christ Devalaqua.

164
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,540
Reverend Jesus Devalaqua.

165
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,560
He has returned from the dead again.

166
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,000
And actually about 25 years ago, he did.

167
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,780
And took a look around the state of the world and decided that really the best thing to do this time was to go to work for Bob.

168
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,360
Even though sometimes, dear friends, it seems like our church is starting to go the way of Christianity.

169
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,680
With, with, uh...

170
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,740
infighting among the apostles and so forth.

171
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:32,580
It's just disgusting sometimes to us who sit here in our high tower looking down upon the frivolous fiddlings of these ant-like creatures.

172
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,660
But, uh, yes, dear friends, yes, the church of the subgenius shall persevere.

173
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:50,140
We shall overcome all pathetic little blockades that stand in our way using, if not our nuclear weapons, at least perhaps the fire of the hate burning in Bob's pipe as he grins.

174
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,960
In, in...

175
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,200
sane merriment down upon even us.

176
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:03,620
Yes, friends, the church of the subgenius is, after all, the only thing that 20 years from now you won't think you were stupid for liking.

177
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,820
If you're still around 20 years from now, dear friends.

178
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,860
Yes, X-Day is coming up soon.

179
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,840
Uh, and we're, we're planning to have X-Day drills.

180
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,960
Now, oh, you'll, actually, this is serious.

181
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,220
I'm gonna pull that music down.

182
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,140
Friends, we are, in fact, planning to have X-Day drills.

183
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:42,760
Uh, which will take the form of insane campouts at Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman, New York, every X-Day, starting this X-Day, July 5th, and running through till the bitter end of the world a little more than two years from now.

184
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:51,140
Uh, for information about actually getting your butt to these, uh, sacred...

185
00:13:51,160 --> 00:14:13,240
gatherings of subgenius, sort of a brainbow gathering, you might call it, um, then I think what you need to do, really, is finally pick up that pen and that stamp and send a self-addressed stamped envelope to the church, whose address we will give or, and or again, um, actually we should give it, but to, to lovelier background music.

186
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,560
And where is my...

187
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:21,140
As I was saying, friends, that's Bob at Post Office.

188
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Box 140306.

189
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:31,480
That's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

190
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,800
We'll be giving that number again.

191
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:41,780
Uh, yes, our, our church is becoming high-tech, so we'll be able to take your credit card numbers all the way up through 1998, and then after that, man, we're splittin'.

192
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,800
We're splittin', and I think...

193
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,120
I will let Dr. Legume tell you of the wonders of X-Day 1998.

194
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,140
Uh, coming up...

195
00:14:51,160 --> 00:15:08,020
Coming up here, this is Dr. Legume, Dr. Katahdin Legume himself, the second greatest living or active subgenius preacher in the universe right now, um, uh, captured here live in Minneapolis, uh, during the Slack Crusades revival.

196
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:13,360
I'm sure I'll have to edit a lot of cuss words out of this for normal broadcast radio.

197
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,940
Uh, thank you.

198
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,900
Thank you.

199
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,040
Incidentally, dear friends, this is recorded at the...

200
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,080
Uh, a club called Ground Zero in Minneapolis.

201
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,000
Incredible decor.

202
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:37,720
They had a gigantic church pulpit, a real church pulpit there for us to preach from, and, uh, a decor of motorcycles and skeletons and dominatrix babes.

203
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,380
Truly, friends, well, I think Dr. Legume will tell you what time it is.

204
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,860
Praise the Lord!

205
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,420
Praise the Lord!

206
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,460
Brothers and sisters!

207
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,080
I'd like to ask you all a question.

208
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,240
Yes!

209
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,260
Only on Tuesday!

210
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,480
What time is it?

211
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,540
Four!

212
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,740
It's a little late!

213
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,540
What time is it?

214
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,480
Five!

215
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,600
What time is it?

216
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,160
Five!

217
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,280
What time is it?

218
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,820
Six!

219
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,700
Six!

220
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,020


221
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,360
Six!

222
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,160


223
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,020
Six!

224
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,300
Six!

225
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,440
Six!

226
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,160


227
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,160


228
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,380
Six!

229
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:15,380


230
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:15,380


231
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:15,460
Six!

232
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:15,460


233
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:15,460


234
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:15,460


235
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:15,460


236
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:15,460


237
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:15,460


238
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:15,460


239
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,400
Dr. Legume now takes a grandfather clock...

240
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,140
...and smacks...

241
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,540
It!

242
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,820
With a hammer.

243
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,980
A sledge hammer, the sacred sledge hammer.

244
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,180
It is the end times, brothers and sisters.

245
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,120
Mm, brothers and sisters, it is the end times.

246
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,860
Time is running out.

247
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,300
Time...is running out.

248
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,980
Mm, I want to tell you all a story!

249
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,320
Mm, I want to tell you a story about a man.

250
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,860
I want to tell you a story about a man...

251
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,720
A man whose life was hard, brothers and sisters!

252
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,140
I want to tell a story of a man whose life was hard, brothers and sisters.

253
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,140


254
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,140


255
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,140


256
00:16:51,160 --> 00:17:15,180
was hard. He didn't have no money. He didn't have no car. He was ugly. He was stupid. He

257
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:27,840
never got any pussy. And one day he was riding on the bus. I said he was riding on the bus.

258
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,480
And sitting on the seat next to him on the bus, he found a subgenius pamphlet that someone

259
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,140
had discarded on the bus.

260
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:55,720
So he sent it to the subgenius foundation and he bought himself a membership. He bought

261
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:04,640
himself a t-shirt and he wore it to ride it off his back. He memorized the book of the

262
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,120
subgenius. He could quote the book of the subgenius in your hands. He could quote the

263
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,660
subgenius in your hands. And if you asked him what was on page 69, he would tell you

264
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:24,920
what's on page 69. And if you asked him what was on page 233, he would say there is no

265
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:40,120
page 233. He met other subgeniuses. He met other subgeniuses. And he quoted the subgenius

266
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:49,460
books to them. He quoted the dogma of the church to the other subgeniuses. And he irritated

267
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:57,160
the living hell out of them because he was a sickening bobby. I said he was a sickening

268
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:05,900
bobby. Can I get a fuck the bobbies? Can I get a fuck the bobbies? That's right, brothers

269
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,100
and sisters. He thought that he would be able to fit in with the subgenius. He was a sickening

270
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,700
bobb.

271
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,540
I should have had a goobie too.

272
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,580
I should have done a cup of could scoocher like that I used to be a

273
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:25,580


274
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:25,580


275
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:25,580


276
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:25,580


277
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:25,960
And I told him I was wrong.

278
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:25,960


279
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,520
The how awesome

280
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,700
there's nothing much here.

281
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:28,700


282
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:28,700


283
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,280
He was the star of his life.

284
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:36,360
He was the have been cannot be won any changed.

285
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,020
He Bush gotta date, the boss of You Special.

286
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,100
He was like New York.

287
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,900
I said he became an alcoholic.

288
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,720
And he slept out in the streets.

289
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,100
I said he slept out in the streets.

290
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,360
He had newspapers for socks.

291
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,580
He had brown paper bags for underwear.

292
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,940
But one day,

293
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,200
but one day,

294
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,280
a group of people came up to him in the street.

295
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,020
And they helped him out.

296
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,820
They gave him a decent meal.

297
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,100
They gave him some money to go out and buy some new clothes.

298
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,360
And they told him about Jesus.

299
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,160
They told him about Jesus.

300
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,680
And they took him out of the streets.

301
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,500
And they got him a nice place to live.

302
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,100
And they took him out of the streets.

303
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,840
And they got him a good job.

304
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,940
As if there was such a thing.

305
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,000
And life was good for him as far as he knew.

306
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,100
He hated the subgeniuses.

307
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,180
He hated Bob.

308
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,920
He denied the exorcist invasion.

309
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,880
He cursed the reprobate.

310
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,700
He cursed the

311
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:14,900
He cursed the exorcist.

312
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,360
He cursed Dr. Le Guin.

313
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,440
He cursed Dr. Le Guin.

314
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,960
He spit on Jader Hypercleese.

315
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,780
He spit on Jader Hypercleese.

316
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,740
Well, let me ask you brothers and sisters.

317
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,460
What's gonna happen to this man on July 5th, 1998?

318
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,040
On July 5th, 1998.

319
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,580
You guys just got like the rest.

320
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,900
Yeah, they're using theúa.

321
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,680
You hit it straight.

322
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,900
Brother and sisters, I gotta tell you.

323
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:48,500
On July 5th, 1998, he will be on the pleasure quest of the sex goddesses.

324
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,760
Oh, God.

325
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,600
And why will he be on the pleasure quest?

326
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,540
Even though he became a heretic.

327
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,540
Even though he cursed the Church of the Subgenius.

328
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,420
You think so?

329
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,640
Or he will be on the pleasure quest.

330
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,200
Why?

331
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:09,440
he paid his $30 and he got his membership card and that's all I'm proud of.

332
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,700
Can you say the same?

333
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,360
Can you say the same?

334
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,780
Can you say the same here, friends?

335
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,420
Can you?

336
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,300
What are you going to do on that day when all your paid and filled subgenius buddies

337
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,020
suddenly disappear?

338
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,740
What will you do?

339
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,100
Do you think that your coolness is going to save you?

340
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,920
Do you think that you'll be able to slip by just because you think you're cool?

341
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,860
Do you think you'll be able to slip by because you've got your trendy black t-shirt on?

342
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:55,400
There are those among us tonight who say that the church is a subgenius organization and

343
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,360
now join us.

344
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,760
And so they say,

345
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,720
Hey, I'm not a subgenius.

346
00:22:59,720 --> 00:22:59,720


347
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,240
I'm not going to join.

348
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,620
Well, brothers and sisters, you won't be joining us on the saucers either.

349
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,360
No, you won't be joining us on the saucers either, friends.

350
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,680
Those of you, you can be a good subgenius, real good subgenius.

351
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,400
But if you ain't paid up in full to that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs, well, he's just going to be

352
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:28,740
waving goodbye to you from them saucer windows as he flies off into space accompanied by

353
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,160
the...

354
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,020
the luscious sex goddesses and gods.

355
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,280
Well, for the gals that look like gods.

356
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,680
And friends, that brings me to another subject.

357
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,240
I'm so sorry to have to cut the sacred cuss words out of Dr. Leguim's preaching, my own

358
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,640
and everybody else's.

359
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,160
But, you know, that's the FCC.

360
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:51,680
And this lovely song here from the new improved night nurses, Our Moon and the new improved

361
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,440
night nurses have a great new tape out.

362
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,120
More information on that in a minute.

363
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,040
But first, you have got to hear this.

364
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,060
Now, everybody knows that gender bias is politically incorrect.

365
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,880
Do you know what happens to you if you're caught being politically incorrect?

366
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,680
As a matter of fact, I should warn you, if you're even caught with this tape in your

367
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,460
possession, it could happen to you.

368
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,540
Here's what happens.

369
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:33,820
If someone thinks you're not PC, is that P-N-C, politically incorrect?

370
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,780
The politically correct police come for you, enforcing a gender-based class action suit

371
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,380
for politically incorrect views.

372
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,380
And do you know what they do?

373
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,540
Oh, God, do you know what they do if you're convicted?

374
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,480
And, of course, you never get a fair trial.

375
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,980
They feed you bland cereal and tell you horror stories about what it's like to be a woman

376
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,420
in society.

377
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,720
And they make you watch endless episodes of Father Knows Best and I Love Lucy and Mary

378
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,220
Tyler Moore.

379
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:58,520
And they make you watch endless episodes of Father Knows Best and I Love Lucy and Mary Tyler Moore.

380
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:58,900
And I...

381
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,300
Anyway, I know I couldn't handle it, okay?

382
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,300
I just couldn't handle it, so I'm in the closet with my gender bias.

383
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,860
But you know what puts me uptight is people who think they're right, because I think

384
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,960
I'm right, so I'm uptight.

385
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,640
But if we're going to live by somebody's prejudiced, uninformed views, let's live

386
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,160
by mine.

387
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,380
It's just that the present round of PC seems female-dominant.

388
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,300
Okay, I'm not into male dominance, but I sure don't want to trade it in for the reverse.

389
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,820
I mean, why are people so pious about gender bias?

390
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,600
People are so pious about gender bias.

391
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,480
People shouldn't be.

392
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,300
He's so pious about gender bias.

393
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,380
Why are people so pious about gender bias?

394
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,020
I'm not bothered by the fact that there's a difference between men and women.

395
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,360
I like it.

396
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,040
Well, we've been through that, haven't we?

397
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,380
I mean, some of my best friends are women.

398
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,220
I mean, I've been known to like women, you know, some more than others.

399
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,320
Well, what is it?

400
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:46,900
I don't know.

401
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,380
The packaging?

402
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,880
The xenophobic, ethnophobic?

403
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,700
God, talk about a blind date.

404
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,260
I mean, I know it's not PC to favor a woman for her appearance,

405
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,780
but is it PC to favor food for its tasters?

406
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,320
Is that the point?

407
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,820
Like, you should favor food for its taste and not for how it looks,

408
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,020
but isn't that part of the experience?

409
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,900
I mean, doesn't food that's beautifully prepared make you want to eat it more?

410
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,100
Of course, when you're really hungry, do you read through magazines,

411
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,700
look at pictures of food rubbing your stomach?

412
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,500
Maybe if you just don't think about the food, your hunger will go away.

413
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,960
I like women.

414
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,660
There's even a part of the friction between men and women I really enjoy.

415
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,100
And I've heard a lot of jokes about testosterone,

416
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,760
and some of them are funny, just like some of the blonde jokes, you know.

417
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,700
But between you and me,

418
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,720
I can't say I'm not without gender bias.

419
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,200
Now, everybody knows that gender bias is politically incorrect,

420
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,000
except you can get away with it if it's gender bias against macho.

421
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,380
Now, I suppose that comment was over the line.

422
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,300
I've just done it.

423
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,860
I'm now politically incorrect.

424
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,660
Are they going to come for me now and make me bland cereal?

425
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,900
No, God, not bland cereal.

426
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,180
I know I couldn't handle it, so I'll just go back in the closet with my gender bias.

427
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,940
You know, to be politically correct, you've got to eat bland cereal.

428
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,480
Is this a guaranteed path to planetary survival?

429
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,300
But would the...

430
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:57,600
You want.

431
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,240
Look out, you'll get it.

432
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,140
And how would you like it?

433
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,300
Men and women, women and men, who's right, everyone's uptight.

434
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,280
It cuts across all racial and religious barriers, class and creed.

435
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,820
Gender bias forever, world without the end, amen.

436
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,100
I mean, any sexual harassment isn't being leered at or bad jokes.

437
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,460
It's, well, maybe bad jokes.

438
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,000
I don't know.

439
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,860
It's having my hormones manipulated or womanipulated.

440
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,640
I mean, I don't care if she dresses like that, but then don't tell me not to stare.

441
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,740
She can't help it, the girl can't help it.

442
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,620
She can't help it, the girl won't fall in love with her.

443
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,820
I know women are jealous about their women because in spite of the women's group,

444
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,620
some women still base their value or self-worth on their ability to attract men.

445
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,600
God, how unenlightened, how enslaved.

446
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,960
I've even heard there are some men who feel the same way in reverse.

447
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,720
How effeminate.

448
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,920
How pathetic.

449
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,240
How about it?

450
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,240
People shouldn't be so pious about gender bias.

451
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:56,660
Men.

452
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:23,040

00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,320

00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,320

00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:25,340

545
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:50,540


546
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:50,540


547
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:50,540


548
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,560
just but this means that I'm still a princess

549
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,820
and of course my face isn't to be ECat

550
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:52,820


551
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,720
This might hurt a bit.

552
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,780
Attach your hands.

553
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,020
Put on the rubber gloves.

554
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,880
You may feel the pressure.

555
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,060
Attach your hands.

556
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,140
Put on the rubber gloves.

557
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,200
You may feel the pressure.

558
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,420
I am the doctor.

559
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,760
She didn't believe you.

560
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,880
And I am here to give you things.

561
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,800
There will be a room full of students watching.

562
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,720
But don't be nervous.

563
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,800
You are good at games.

564
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,400
Put on the rubber gloves.

565
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,640
Sterilize the instrument.

566
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,140
Attach your clamps.

567
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,300
My assistant has prepared you for an exam.

568
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,980
We are going to test the instrument.

569
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,660
This may feel cold.

570
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,100
It's getting cold.

571
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,740
I'm going to insert my finger now.

572
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,060
This may be uncomfortable.

573
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,780
You may feel some pressure.

574
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,660
This might hurt a bit.

575
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,160
It's going to be so.

576
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,460
You may feel it too.

577
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,260
Les jambes chaud se enfeigent.

578
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,980
You may feel some pain and Doctor's

579
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:29,980


580
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,480
You may feel도 that your breath sound is getting inflammation.

581
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,220
This is going to be increased.

582
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:34,900
Your hearing and speech PPE is further affected.

584
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,280
I feel .

585
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,060
I've started to feel more the increasing換.

586
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,520
In fact, I have the ability to look at my phone and record the poor.

587
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,720
Luckily, my hearing was lossed.

588
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,760
But I just can't get enough of that cherry blend hub of Phobosopolis he buys.

589
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,940
Ooh, it tastes so sweet.

590
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,020
Say, speaking of pipes, are you happy to see me,

591
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,460
or is that a pretty damn big pipe in your pocket?

592
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,360
Oh, I just love a man who smokes it so, I don't know, carcinogenic or something.

593
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,360
It really turns me on.

594
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:15,300
I just crave having that big fat pipe stem plug my face and fill my mouth.

595
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:20,100
Why, just thinking about it makes me, oh, I feel that itch.

596
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,960
I need it so bad.

597
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,760
Oh, now just look at my crease.

598
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,540
It's all wet.

599
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,620
Well, I guess I'll just have to take it off to dry.

600
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,120
Undo these straps here.

601
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,520
There, just zip that down.

602
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,740
Isn't this material sheer?

603
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,720
Oh, look, my nylons and heels and garter, they're just soaking.

604
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,160
I'll just have to slowly peel myself out of them.

605
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,860
Say, what's that I hear?

606
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,180
You're not...

607
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:50,700
What?

608
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,460
You couldn't be.

609
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,800
You aren't slacking off while we talk, are you?

610
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,220
Why, you naughty, naughty boy.

611
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,340
To think.

612
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,460
Wow.

613
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,440
Kind of a turn on.

614
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,880
Just thinking of you doing that sends shivers all the way up to my, you know.

615
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,020
Yeah, that's it.

616
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,220
You're doing good.

617
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,240
That's it.

618
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,380
Like that pipe.

619
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,360
Oh, your pipe's growing bigger and bigger.

620
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,980
The tip of it's so hot.

621
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,600
I can feel the heat from here.

622
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,580
Oh, I wish you could just...

623
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,060
Just cram it through the phone lines, big boy.

624
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,280
I bet it's just about long enough.

625
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,180
Say, before we go any further, you are a subgenius, aren't you?

626
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,140
Good.

627
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,440
I thought so.

628
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,700
You didn't seem like one of those wimpy little humans.

629
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,100
But I bet you're a real yeti of a man.

630
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,000
And I'm a real man's woman.

631
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,820
But I can see you haven't sent in your $20 love offering yet.

632
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,000
Or you'd have the tattoo on that thing.

633
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,480
Oh, you can't fool Connie.

634
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,020
Well, I'm sorry.

635
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,160
But I'm afraid I only do it with ordained ministers.

636
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:57,820
But I'm gonna make you come into the arms of the subgenius church by hook or by crook.

637
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,420
Maybe next phone call.

638
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,200
They don't call me the anti-virgin for nothing, you know.

639
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,120
So as soon as you get that membership card and read up those church secrets,

640
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,400
then call back any time, baby.

641
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,680
I'll be waiting day and night.

642
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,100
Hurry back.

643
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,700
Ta-ta.

00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,820

You'll hear an official Dobbs diatribe by holy roller renters

657
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,240
like Reverend Ivan Stank, Jane or Hyperclete's father, Joe Mama,

658
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,640
and anyone else insane enough to praise Bob.

659
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,460
That's what it says there, anyway, kids.

660
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:58,220
But, but, but what of your pleasures?

661
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,800
Yes, and the power of your pleasures.

662
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,600
Do you not want yet for more pleasure?

663
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,180
Do ye not?

664
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,340
Yea, friends, for the promise of X days.

665
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:25,100
Shall ye bringest thee them pleasures like you never ever dreamed.

666
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:32,900
But I believe that the evil Dr. Katayden Legume has more to tell you about.

667
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,660
That one.

668
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,660
Oh, yea, oh, yea, brothers and sisters.

669
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:44,900
True slack, by comparison, is better than getting gang-sucked by horny Nordic Valkyries.

670
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,620
But, ever since I've been here, I've been here.

671
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:55,600
The pleasures of X day make true slack seem like wearing a shit helmet with a padlocked chinstrap.

672
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,720
That's how good it's gonna be.

673
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,860
Oh, yea, brothers and sisters.

674
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,600
Maybe instead of joining our church, you'll take that thirty dollars and go out and buy yourself a Nirvana tribute album

675
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,840
with a Hootie and the Blowfish CD.

676
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,260
Oh, yea, you can sit home and listen to all that sh-teb-tv bullshit.

677
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:23,740
And, and, and, and, and, and you can crank your CD player all the way up to nine or eleven or however high it goes.

678
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,200
You'll have yourself a real good time.

679
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,180
But come X day, none of those pink toys are gonna work.

680
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,620
That's right.

681
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,320
Your CD player, your VCR, all that shit's gonna be burned.

682
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,120
It's just gonna be worthless chunks of plastic.

683
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,640
Not even good for propping up the corner of your broken sofa.

684
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,080
And the only music, the only music you're going to hear,

685
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,100
will be the screams of the dying.

686
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,920
You won't like the sound, but we'll damn well be dancing to it.

687
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,300
Amen! Can I get an amen?

688
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,260
Can I get a hallelujah?

689
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,760
Can I get a praise bar?

690
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,680
Brothers and sisters, the other day, I was in Chicago, Illinois.

691
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,920
And I was in my dressing room getting ready to go out and preach.

692
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,000
And there was a little cockroach that kind of scampered across the table.

693
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,020
I was sitting at it.

694
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,820
And I had my little ink pen out and I was chasing him around the table a little bit.

695
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,280
And then I took out my lighter when he got all tired out.

696
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,100
And I burned his little wings off and his little antenna.

697
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,940
And flipped over and his little legs were kicking and I burned them.

698
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,700
And there where I was laying there being tortured and hissing

699
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,860
and doing whatever the roach equivalent of cussing must be,

700
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,760
I took my fist and I smashed that cockroach

701
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,060
into a nasty, squished pulp on the table.

702
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,700
Well, brothers and sisters,

703
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,840
on July 5th, 1998,

704
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,120
if you don't have your subgenius membership card,

705
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,620
you'll wish to God you were that cockroach!

706
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,460
Oh yes, brothers and sisters,

707
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,680
there's a war going on and we are winning it.

708
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,120
And your will, your will will help to win it.

709
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,340
And just beneath the surface is your strength.

710
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,240
Just below your skin are your vital forms.

711
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,160
Your vital force is running like eternal springs,

712
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,320
wild and restless.

713
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,580
They will guide you and give you counsel.

714
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,740
They will guide you to destroy the conspiracy.

715
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,040
And when they call you murderer,

716
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,660
and when they judge you,

717
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,860
then you must hang them up by their lying jaws on meat hooks

718
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:49,180
until they beg for forgiveness and soil themselves.

719
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,020
The bloodlust, the bloodlust.

720
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,880
You don't, you don't think of the bloodlust.

721
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,400
You experience it, you experience it.

722
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,560
Masses of people, any people,

723
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,500
they will go anywhere, do anything,

724
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,200
as long as the ring of faith,

725
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,680
the ring of faith is in their noses.

726
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,720
Call it God, call it mother, call it country.

727
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:27,200
Then take a slim cord and string it through all those rings,

728
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,260
a million, a hundred million,

729
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,400
and lead them where you will.

730
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,220
The river is rising and you're gonna drown.

731
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,180
Tonight, I am offering you a prayer.

732
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,160
A personal flotation device in the form of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

733
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,660
Can I get a praise, Bob?

734
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,520
Praise Bob!

735
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,780
Can I get another praise, Bob?

736
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,700
Praise Bob!

737
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,560
The time has come nigh for you tonight.

738
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,980
It is no accident that you are all here.

739
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,260
You have been chosen to receive this message of Bob.

740
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,560
You are here to receive this message of SLAC.

741
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,540
You have been chosen, you are the chosen ones.

742
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:16,160
All you must do is put your faith where your wallet is.

743
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,320
Oh God, you're right!

744
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,780
Jesus, you're so right!

745
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,040
And brothers and sisters, I can guarantee you,

746
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:29,280
you'll be damn glad you put your faith in Bob's smiling face.

747
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,840
We are here to help you.

748
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,000
Trust us. Trust Bob.

749
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,500
Amen.

750
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,760
I'm going to insert my finger now.

751
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,240
This made me uncomfortable.

752
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,560
This feels so pressure.

753
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,560
This might hurt a bit.

754
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,160
I'm listening to you.

755
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,420
I'll answer everything, I swear.

756
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,280
I'm here.

757
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,020
But I haven't taken anything.

758
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,320
I couldn't.

759
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,660
I've been very sick.

760
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,660
I've been in bed all night.

761
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,980
Last night, I wanted to take a pill to sleep.

762
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,040
I said to myself that if I took more of them, I'd sleep better.

763
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,040
And then if I took all of them, I'd sleep without dreaming, without waking.

764
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,740
I'd be dead.

765
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,580
I took 12.

766
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,100
In hot water.

767
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,400
Oh, like a sledgehammer.

768
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,900
And I had a dream.

769
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,220
I dreamed of everything, just as it is.

770
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,460
I woke up with a start, so happy, because it was a dream.

771
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,780
And when I realized that it was true, that I was alone,

772
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,800
that my head wasn't on your shoulder, that we weren't close together,

773
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,200
I felt, I felt I couldn't.

774
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,100
I couldn't live.

775
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,480
Light. Light and cold.

776
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,160
And I couldn't feel my heart beating anymore.

777
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,620
It was taking so long to die.

778
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,060
I was in terrible pain.

779
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,720
After an hour of it, I called Martin.

780
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,220
I didn't have the courage to die alone.

781
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,560
Oh, darling.

782
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:26,900
Darling.

783
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,440
It was 4 o'clock in the morning.

784
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,560
She brought the doctor who lives in her apartment house.

785
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,600
I had a fever of over 101.

786
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,460
It seems it's different.

787
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,500
I thought I was going to poison myself.

788
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,700
One is never sure of the dose, you see.

789
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,560
The doctor wrote the prescription.

790
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,960
The martyr stayed waiting until tonight.

791
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,920
I begged her to leave because you said that you would call me one last time.

792
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,340
And I was afraid that she'd keep on talking.

793
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,460
Battery

794
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,440
Porclipus

795
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:36,440


796
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:40,860
Thank you.

797
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,000
Thank you.

798
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,600
Thank you.

799
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,800
Thank you.

800
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:55,380
Thank you.

801
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,500
Thank you.

802
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,000
Thank you.

803
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,600
Thank you.

804
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,040
Thank you.

805
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,440
Thank you.

806
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,140
Thank you.

807
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,360
Thank you.

808
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,000
Thank you.

809
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,060
Thank you.

810
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,120
Thank you.

811
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:01,780
Oh my goodness.

812
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:13,100
I really hated it when girls wore dresses because it would expose their sexy legs,

813
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:17,940
and I would get so fucking horny I couldn't concentrate on my schoolwork.

814
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:23,980
So I made up this little chant back then that I would always do under my breath.

815
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,720
They wear dresses, stupid dresses.

816
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,320
Why do they wear stupid dresses?

817
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,920
Sometimes I would disguise it in code form.

818
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,200
Instead of saying dresses, I would say,

819
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:45,900
Oh, these, they wear, oh, these, stupid, oh, these.

820
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,520
Why do they wear stupid, oh, these?

821
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,300
Tee-da-lee-lee-ba-dee-da-lee.

822
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,180
In the Johnnies.

823
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,420
You know what I mean by the Johnnies?

824
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,580
The underwear.

825
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,700
Maybe I should say,

826
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:06,120
about stage door Johnnies.

827
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,860
Tee-da-lee-lee-ba-dee-da-lee.

828
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,140
In the Johnnies.

829
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,820
Tee-da-lee-lee-ba-dee-da-lee.

830
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,120
In your Johnnies.

831
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,320
Tee-da-lee-lee-ba-dee-da-lee.

832
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,800
In your underwear.

833
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,880
In your wear.

834
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,020
In your wear.

835
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,960
In your little underwear.

836
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,820
Oh, man.

837
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,840
I'd love to be able.

838
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,740
Oh, God.

839
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,160
Joe.

840
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,200
Yes, Joe.

841
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:32,060
Joe.

842
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:32,420
Oops.

843
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,760
Joe Offrick there.

844
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,120
Oh, God.

845
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:42,480
Oh, it's been too long since I heard a little Joe.

846
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,560
But we have a new one here, too.

847
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:49,320
This is also a Jesus discovery.

848
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,680
Jesus brought this tape.

849
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,040
He worked at, for a short time,

850
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:55,540
Jesus worked at Normal,

851
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,780
at the hemp shop in Cleveland.

852
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,860
I forget the name of it.

853
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,560
And they were getting,

854
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,140
they were getting these calls.

855
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,480
And on their answer machine.

856
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,420
Their answer,

857
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,000
their outgoing message took five minutes

858
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,660
to listen to.

859
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,220
But this man had something to say

860
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,860
to Normal.

861
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,980
And he called all night long,

862
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,520
waiting five minutes each time

863
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,240
and then leaving a one-minute message.

864
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,400
And we'll just play little bits and pieces

865
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,680
of the legal document guy here,

866
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,080
starting with this one.

867
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,840
Yes, I have, I called yesterday.

868
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,420
I left my phone number and name.

869
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,220
I had a hearing in the front hall

870
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,340
of Euclid High School in the 70s.

871
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,520
I've had permission to basket,

872
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,220
rose and hem and stamp,

873
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,500
weave since the 60s.

874
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,080
Anyway, I had a hearing in Leonard Weisberg's room.

875
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,320
I have some legal notices in the newspaper.

876
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,160
Not to draw too much attention to the subject,

877
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,340
I have a privacy case.

878
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,820
I have an oxygen case.

879
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,280
I was supposed to have an industrial,

880
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,840
industrial use permit for whey,

881
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,300
for men's spirits and titanium production

882
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,940
from chemical and for silver.

883
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,640
An amateur scientist status.

884
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,940
I have a story, safe as the basement,

885
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,680
but safe as any room in my house.

886
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,220
I'm supposed to be allowed to grove.

887
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,460
At least I have an oxygen case.

888
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,340
I'm registered somewhat oxygen depraved.

889
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,980
I may be quite a bit older than I appear.

890
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:31,820
And I've been having

891
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,560
a few Ganglandzia Pete animal

892
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,220
quills and bakers LION's기는 appeal

893
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:45,660
Möglichkeiten.

894
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:51,120
I might make it along the way.

895
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:51,980
Wait for how the episode ends next week.

896
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:52,100
We'll have at least a lucky mother

897
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:52,100


898
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,420
No way out.

899
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:56,660
I wanted to build my own then.

900
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:56,660


901
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:56,660


902
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:56,940
That's where they put the tape Spotify itself.

903
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,800
There are индicators.

904
00:56:59,800 --> 00:56:59,800


905
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,880
He's either been cheated of his education or has a problem or deserves a second chance.

906
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:10,680
I'm also in the paper in search of genius, a district IQ champ.

907
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:16,140
And it says in my hearings, I sued a Clemency policeman that was playing games with me.

908
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,640
I'm all the way back to the 60s with the cuckoo for Cocoa Puff policeman

909
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,420
that kept telling me there was a shortage and not enough for the district IQ champ

910
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:27,440
to clear his mind to think for an oxygen case.

911
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,200
Now, I've been waiting for her. I've got some cop registered.

912
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,100
We'll just address that to Bob, why don't you?

913
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:08,680
You can spell that at P.O. Box 140306.

914
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:14,460
That's 140306 in mysterious Dallas, Texas.

915
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,340
Zip code 75214.

916
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,900
Yeah, I left my name and number yesterday.

917
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,940
So anyway, I had my legal notice in the newspaper for a grant.

918
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:35,020
And I told you I had my hearings in the 70s.

919
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:37,600
I have another legal notice.

920
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,640
Some cop was playing with my brother and I.

921
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,760
We have repeated stories.

922
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,980
They disport us at the source.

923
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,440
They registered us to 3%.

924
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:53,560
We're entitled to agricultural grade, minimum of 25, reunion 25 or 30%.

925
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:57,300
His minimum, I'm also entitled to 9-9, pain reliever.

926
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,640
Then there's a story some cop's been playing with me on the charts,

927
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,940
not letting me release my stress on a daily basis.

928
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,260
And I got backed up stress just to tease me for when I get my pain reliever.

929
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:14,140
Then I have my, I have a degree tree stolen in the 60s.

930
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:17,240
It's in my hearings and a house of evolutionary study.

931
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,500
I have one of the best trees going in the Board of Education.

932
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:21,600
The Euclid's responsible.

933
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,420
I got permission to search the board.

934
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,360
Beep.

935
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,160
Some of the...

936
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,880
It has legal notice in the paper.

937
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,420
My right to smoke a cigarette.

938
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,320
I have the oxygen case.

939
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:37,280
Then, like I said, I got the house of evolutionary tree that was stolen from me in the 60s.

940
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,200
I got permission to search the Euclid's school board.

941
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,400
Then I have the story, I think an old sheriff disguised to discover southern Albuquerque.

942
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:49,940
Then there's, I'm waiting for a seed source.

943
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:52,880
I have my address registered and what this house is about.

944
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,840
But people are trying to disturb and draw attention to my privacy.

945
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:56,660
And then...

946
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,300
I need somebody that understands what they're talking about.

947
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,280
I need to declare a center for scheduled recovery of toxins.

948
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,060
I'm interested in the oxygen, of course.

949
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,060
And then I have the Indo-Chinese case in the paper.

950
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:15,400
When the Indo-Chinese won their case, I'm allowed to put another plant in on the Indo-Chinese.

951
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,880
I'm first industrialist families of Europe and America.

952
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:25,660
I'm allowed to put in one of their first French, German in hospice, Prussian-Swedish families, Norwegian and those Norwegian...

953
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:26,400
Beep.

954
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:27,160


955
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:27,440
Beep.

956
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:27,840
Beep.

957
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:27,900
Beep.

958
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:39,240
And then, in an enormous cloud of smoke, the mob gasped as the huge face, the enormous countenance, which could not be countenance, began to appear above the seething crowd.

959
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,180
What?

960
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,460
You've got the job, Kip.
