They're bored. They want some excitement.
And after all, they come here because this is the closest thing that they can get to actually being on the planet Mars.

If we can rent that thing that drills to the center of the earth, I would rather do that.
Everyone would like to go down there because big monster.
Well, I understand there's some large dimetrodons and some big mushrooms.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Well, they live in the magma of underground.
They do swim unharmed through the magma of the underground, an astonishing being or any being.
But these large pelicasars can do it.
And I understand the thing is viewport so you can take pictures if you bring your camera.
Dave, some people think that we're evolved from whales.
Who thinks that we're evolved from whales?
Aliens.
Aliens think that they, well, you know.
They think that we are evolved from whales.
Whales.
And they've been giving Bob a hard time about that.
I don't know.
I don't understand this.
Well, even as a fructose child, with our gathered blithering as we sat and watched the cranial tube,
there was Mr. Science telling us that an early date and time, one mammal hit the road and the other one hit the swimming pool.
So there is a strong belief in our common ancestral things.
They often say that the pitches that...
um...
seals hear.
And the habits and social order of seals is very much similar to a dog.
So to call a sealistic dog is not as unusual as one might think.
It's not as perhaps...
an anomalistic dog.
Well, I think we're just about ready to take calls here on the victory line.
Now between the hours of 2.23 in the morning and 3.45 in the morning,
we're going to be receiving special gamma ray ding-dings from your gamma and gamp up there deep in the cosmic sweaty poop.
We're going to be taking them all on to our prefrontal areas and we're going to be sucking them down through the diaphragm,
shown here and given to you by Nurse Cobb and some of the other nurse helpers.
For those of you who can no longer sweat and whose pores are now closed by the duck ointments passed out earlier,
those of you who passed out,
will find themselves in a very, very safe place.
And friend, you can be safe too if you'll just give your mind, wallet and heart over to J.R. Bob Dobbs and his church of the subgenius, yes?
You too can be clean, clean, clean, clean like Dave here.
Yes, much like Dave.
All smooth and beautiful.
Vegetables cleaned and cluttered here in this CRISPR area.


Yes, and the below the fray.
Your brain doesn't need to be all wrinkled and convoluted anymore.
No.
Nay, nay, nay, nay.
It could be clean.
That's right, Dr. Logan.
It feels better that way, doesn't it?
Now, now, now that you've given over that $30 check to Bob,
you are in our care.
Clotches.
Yes, yes.
Great in our control.
Great under our control.
Well, now that we've got them, what do we do with them?
Dave?
I say we eliminate all the fat vesicles from their knees and from their calves.
We make the pores on the top of their head much bigger than the ones on their nose,
so the next time they pick a pimple, their brains explode.
I say we fry them.
I say we kick them into joy juice and poop them out later.
I say we fondle the cosmos with our own erectus.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Well, that was a prescription for greatness,
if I've heard one here on the subgenius radio network.
That was an idea whose time has come in its pants and your head.
Boom.
That's an idea whose fruition has gone smelly.

Listen, it is not my fault.
I had nothing to do with putting the opium receptors in the human nervous system.
The fact that you have a receptor in your brain and the resistance for acid is not my problem.

them in the streets. We shall never surrender, whatever the cost may be, because the conspiracy,
you see, wants us to get angry. The conspiracy, you see, wants us to lose our collective tempers
and to go out and buy guns and then to march into some public place and start blowing the
brains out of a few dozen pinks. That gives them a reason to round us up and put us away in their
prison nowhere houses. They're just waiting for some petty nitpicky excuse like mass murder to
give us hard time. They could care less that we're helping reduce world overpopulation or
decreasing the unemployment rate. They could care less that we're expressing our own individuality
and fulfilling the American dream of the ultimate personal pursuit of happiness. Oh sure, it may be
our God-given right. It may be expressly protected by the Constitution, but they could care less.
So don't get into the urge that's fallen into their trap. Resist the temptation to rid the
world of inferiors.
Their moment will come soon enough, but until then, we must bide our time. We must love our
enemy even as he drags us from our beds in the night and kicks us and beats us and batters us
black and blue. We must love our enemy despite his dumbness, even as we wait in their checkout
lines checking out all the ugly people and reaffirming our belief that there is indeed
evil in the world. We know they control our lives, that they deliberately bounce our checks and run
up our bills. We know that they take our tax dollars at gunpoint and then spend it on themselves
and their families. We know that they take our tax dollars at gunpoint and then spend it on
their parasitical freeloaders in exchange for a rigged vote. We know that they control the media,
the movies, and then try to make the rest of the world hate us for being better than they are.
But can you blame them, dear friends? As distasteful of a task as it may seem, try to switch places
with the enemy. How would you feel if you were one of them? Can you stumble a mile in their shoes?
Just imagine what it would be like without having an imagination. No talent, no intelligence,
no nothing.
Just a blithering idiot. And along comes the subgenius. And what does he have? Why, everything.
Brains, broads, and buttloads of slack. You'd be spiteful, too. You'd probably join the conspiracy
and sell your soul if they promised to give you something the subgenius didn't have. Now, remember,
you'd be too stupid to realize the subgenius didn't have what you had because he didn't want
to have it. Even if you could figure it out, you'd probably rationalize it away as sour grapes that
the subgenius didn't want the material goods that you possess only because you had them.
And if you could, you'd be a good man. And if you could, you'd be a good man. And if you could, you'd be a good man.
It would never occur to you that the conspiracy had already made the same offer to the subgenius
and he had turned them flat down. And not only that, but the conspiracy had offered the subgenius
more than it had offered you, and he still turned it down. No, you would seek solace in the false
consolation that you were better than your intellectual superiors because you drive to
work every day in a new BMW and walk the conspiracy treadmill nine to five in your
designer yippee outfit. So you see, when you look at it from their standpoint,
it's hard to hate our fellow subhumans. One could almost feel compassion for the average minded
normals and pinko mediocrities because we know, we know that there but by the grace of Bob goes us.
It was merely a fluke of nature that provided that superior mutation, that divine birthright
that destined each and every one of us to that inescapable future of the future ruling class.
We didn't ask to be more than mere mortals, but we were cast into the role by influences,
beyond their control from beyond the stars. It is a gift that we admittedly do not deserve and may
lose at any time. A so-called hunting accident or unexpected motorcycle crash. Anything with
irrevocable brain damage can make us forfeit that birthright as well. We too can find ourselves
shuffling amongst the moron majority, living the life of someone too stupid to know just how stupid
they really are. Or worse yet, conspiracy dubbed intellectual sideshow freaks, the fools who are
fooled into thinking that they're thinkers by some mere,
piece of paper or diploma issued by and for the amusement of the conspiracy. Oh, the pain, the pain.
Dear Bob, if ever we should be reduced to such mental poverty, please, please do not let us go
so far as to think we are smarter than we were before the lobotomy. Let us at least die with
dignity rather than live out our delirious duller delusion. Give us courage to do unto others as we
would have them do unto us. Somebody please, please pull the
plug. Let us die with pride instead of being the object of sarcastic derision. And in return, we make
this solemn pledge unto them to return the favor to each and every normal come judgment day. Yea,
we shall put them out of their misery despite the personal sacrifice. Come next day, we shall do unto
the normals as we would have them do unto us if we were in similar circumstances. Our formal enemy
shall become our future friends and we shall perform our errand of mercy. The ultimate sacrifice,
human sacrifice, for at long last the wait will be over and we shall overcome the normals and pull
the plugs on the pinks. We'll strangle them with their own entrails. We'll haul them up a piano
while we'll slice them and dice them and feed them to our fish because we know that deep down
it's the very least we can do. Herein is the word of our priest Bob. Amen.
There might not come a day when there'll be peace and understanding.
And there might not come a time when the world is cured of hate and crime. As long as there are
people and as long as there are fear and greed. What's the point in fighting this war?
Wars will come and wars will go. The poor and the weak will always be in need.
But there will come a day and for this I'm sure you need not pray.
Yes, there will come a day I'll shove that cell phone up your ass.
No, there won't come a day when there'll be peace and understanding.
And there won't come a time when there's no such thing as hate or crime.
As long as there are people and sad to say they're growing like weeds.
Wars will come.
And wars will stay.
Like it or not it's gonna be that way.
But there will come a day and for this I know you need not pray.
Yes, there will come a day I'll shove that cell phone up your ass.
I'll stick it deep inside your ass.
Your cell phone up your ass.
From PR News in Washington, I'm cooler than normal.
The number of people is down slightly. The number of people rose slightly.
PR's Moron reports that this is PR News in Washington.
And this should be Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
With the alien smegma pie as requested.
Thank you, thank you. We were getting pretty hungry.
Yeah, I love the flaky crust on those.
Thanks for getting that in quick.
And thanks to the Rudy Schwartz project that did that song and the one at the long instrumental at the beginning.
And thanks to Papa Joe Mama for the rant.
And miscellaneous cut-ups by Lee Murr and New Monet and Puzzling Ever.

And the evidence reorganized by yours truly.
And now this.
Which is Dave. Again.
Yay!
It's a Dave.
It's a Dave.
It's a tape? What is a tape?
It's a Dave. It's a Dave. It's a Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
It is. But is it a tape? I still don't know what the hell you're talking about.
You see, I've got these creases growing right now.
And every time I move them it makes a little squeaky noise.
Sometimes I have a hard time hearing it.
Other times I just want to ignore everything.
You ever get that feeling?
Yeah, I have trouble hearing over the sound of my own forehead.
Sometimes.
Because it gets crits and whirs and grinds.
And if there's sand in it.
That's the prosthetic forehead, right?
It's like one of those machines in Quicksilence Metropolis.
I mean, the big huge wheel type thing.
Right.
So, we thought about discussing the origins of Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
But I also have an article about the origins of Princess Wee.
So she's...
Yeah, there's...
She's been originated?
Well, apparently the Chinese have been talking about Princess Wee for a long, long time.
Yeah.
That's a mythological creature.
Yes.
There's seven arms and six vaginas and three ears and stuff like that.
Seven million years in age.
No, no, no, that's not too personal.
Besides, you're short a couple there.
A few.
But there's two ancient Chinese concepts.
Which might be our most powerful tools.
Wu Wee, pronounced Wu Wei, but I won't pronounce it that way.
And Di.
Pronounced duh.
And I will pronounce that that way.
Wu Wee literally translates as no trying or no doing.
But it's not at all about dull inaction.
In fact, it refers to the dynamic, effortless, and unselfconscious state of mind of a person who is optimally active and effective.
People in Wu Wee feel as if they were doing nothing.
While at the same time, they might be creating a brilliant work of art.
Smoothly negotiating a complex social situation.
Or...
Destroying a radio show.
And so forth.
I'm sorry.
I got that.
People in Wu Wee have Di.
Duh.
Typically translated as virtue, power, or charismatic power.
That's it.
That was the sound of Wu Wee.
The sound of Wu Wei.
But...
Yeah, it's sometimes called the wah.
The wah?
The duh.
Wu Wee.
Wu Wee.
Well, see, we got the duh, the we, the Wu Wee, the Wu Wee, and...
And the duh.
Uh-uh.
I've seen a lot of goat rodeos in my lifetime, in my short span of existence.
This has got to be...
I could just see goat riders on top of them going, Wu Wee.
Wu Wee.
Stuff like that.
Goat riders in the sky.
Why a goat?
That's them.
You know, waiting in the wings.
They're waiting to take over.
The pove and hoofed ones.
If, uh...
I thought they...
I've kind of...
Are you sure they haven't taken over?
I'm positive they have.
In fact, I'm so sure of it, I'd be willing to bet 45 cents on it.
Wow.
As a capital outlay, I could start with that and work my way up to perhaps several million dollars if the right people were to come along and have the right idea about how to live in the future.
But so many of them don't.
They just lacklusterly pass their days hoping that someone will come and save them.
There's somebody who can come along and save them right now, isn't there?
Reb, reb, reb, reb, reb.
There will come a stranger wearing one brown shoe.
There will come a stranger wearing one brown shoe.
And one brown shoe.
And he will be smoking a pipe.
And by these you shall know him.
And he shall know your daughters.
And the Hubbard slays.
All at the same time.
Yes, knowledge.
The fruit of ignorance is knowledge.
And we could pair it up like a pear or cut it up like a peach.
Or we could just slice and dice it and throw it at everything.
We have a new pineapple claim.
I'm sorry.


That's what you use as a pineapple corer.
You stick it on the top of the head, the crown of the head, and just start grinding and turning.
And it cores the center out, which then can be removed carefully and shipped in a frozen container to J.R. Bob Dobbs and his genetic engineers who can then read the DNA in your cranial sample.
It's about an inch in diameter what they take out.
So you won't miss it.
When they take out that much, you'll never know it's no longer there.
You'll never know you had it in the first place.
I think that's kind of what Papa Joe Marma was preaching on earlier in the show.
Yeah, but he still wants to be a woman.
And besides, if you're packing that much information into a small amount of space like that, there's no way that things aren't going to run out or drip once in a while.
Provided.
There's the alacrity and the alarm and the alarum to notice them.
Multiple alarums.
Yes.
But yeah, the brain juices do leak.
And to tell the truth, Dave, they smell.
Oh, thank you so much.
No, I don't mean yours.
I mean everybody's, not just yours right now.
Yours is bad right now, but everybody's gets that way.
Did you consult with Reverend Brain Leak over this?
No.
Where is old Reverend Brain Leak?
Brain Leak is in the state of Michigan where he lives.
Which is like Satori to many of the Zen devotees in the state of Michigan, but it's a very aggravated hockey-driven state.
Where people throw car licenses at you and argue with old ladies on the corner.
And then they beat them up, you know, vigorously and demand their attention.
I want to go to Michigan now.
He's also been in a state of confusion.
But, you know, that happens with young folks.
I am the capital.
I am the original and mainest city of confusion.
And if you want to come and live with me, you can.
But don't plan on doing anything because there are no plans.
Wow.
It's as tame as you were.
Oh, I can hear them now.
They're like, they're already talking in the past tense about everything.
You think the world maybe really ended and we didn't know about it again?
Right.
I think so.

I mean, to them, we're already dead.
Or gone.
They might think we're dead.
We're probably just elsewhere.
And I don't mean dead by that.
I mean on some beautiful spaceship.
Or in a vat.
But thinking that we're on a beautiful spaceship.
What's the difference, you know?
What is the difference?
Really?
Well, they're in a vat of boiling fat.
And that is a total mess.
And that is a total mess.

And that is a true thing.
That is real.
That is very material and substantial of a feeling.
But to lighten the atmosphere,
there are thousands of ukulele players wearing very bright Hawaiian shirts
surrounding the entire area
playing Aloha Hawaii
as the ship blasts off.
So there's not a lot of regret among those who are being melted down for it.
No, of course not.
Everybody looks forward to that kind of heaven.
Hawaiian shirted ukulele players.
Yeah.
Do you play in slack key Hawaiian guitar?
No.
Remember the Duke of Uke,
our ukulele playing friend
who covers heavy metal tunes with a ukulele?
who covers heavy metal tunes with a ukulele?
Oh yes, he's even
you can hear him in elevators
around the country now where they still have elevators
playing
I Want to Be Sedated by the Ramones.
That's right. That was one of his hits.
And it actually received national airtime
And it actually received national airtime
and I, well, never mind.
Yeah, what you were about to say is unlike us.
Yeah, what you were about to say is unlike us.
They received national airtime.
They received national airtime.
But you know, there's many, many reasons
why we can never be allowed
why we can never be allowed
into real radio stations
into real radio stations
or prime time or any of that.
And every time that I'm in
a real radio station,
you know, the kind that's full of crap
you know, the kind that's full of crap
all day long
24-7, I feel like
I feel like that
the hour of slack just wouldn't fit into
their format.
I was forced to listen to
commercial radio a couple of weeks ago
because I had to be on a show
and I was
and I was
reminded once again,
no way, there's no way what we do
would ever happen
on commercial radio.
Especially if you believe in reincarnation.
Just think of all the millions
and millions of people
who have gone out there to, well,
I don't want to name the big industries
that run the commercial radio business
because there's only five of them
and each one I represent with a finger of my hand
like my thumb and my forefinger.
Well, never mind, that's another story entirely.
But, um,
people who espouse
certain beliefs like
deep meditative breathing,
Arnold Schmeck,
gross misappropriation,

other devices that you can hide
in your...
Golfer head launching.
Yeah, golfer head launching and stuff like that.
You automatically, there's a little
red X right next to your name
and you have to wear the, uh,
what are they, the they live
glasses or some kind of special equipment
to see what's even going on.
So, you know, you're gonna
walk into that room, you're gonna smell the air
and you're gonna get me the
heck out of here, you know.
Well, that's just one of the problems with
reincarnation.
An even more serious problem is that
this show, The Hour of Slack, has been on
for so long that there
are people who've heard
some shows twice
in two different lives.
It's like they heard show number
51 back in
1983 and then they died and were
reborn and then now,
20 years later, or 30
years later, they hear a
rerun of Hour of Slack number 51
and go, why do I feel like
I've heard this before?
Is that what you call subgenius time control?
It's a rerun, but it hadn't been rerun since before I was born.
Now, that's like what?
That's it. It's a form of transubstantial deja vu
encountered by
some of the three-time lifer
subgenius. Sometimes they go as
many as three lifetimes as subgeniuses.
Ah.
They really get sick of Hour of Slack number 51
by then.
Well, by the time they're a baby born in
1912, already wanting to hear this
drivel in which their parents can't
supply because they give them other kinds of
drivel. So,
we have to also bring them
into the fold. I'm not like a...
Pablum and all that good stuff.
Now, I just wondered if that was a kind of subgenius
time control was my question.
Well, if you batter, dip, and deep fry them, it is.
Yes.
Time control, going out of control, street
cleaners, ball cleaners.
Oh, wait, I'm a clothing cleaner.
I can't do that.
No, we had to sell Jayner.
We had to sell
Jayner to the Canadian fake
boss.
And then they
hated each other once they actually
saw it, talked to each other. They hated
it, like everyone does.
Oh, well.
At least we got paid.
Well, you know, the thing they say about
country fried steak, you know,
it's just enough to go around.
Is that what they say about
country fried steak? Because I never
could understand what they were saying
the whole time that I was
eating it, because I was chewing too loudly.
He just dreams of it constantly.
Yes, I do.
Real chicken fried, smothered in that white
gravy. Oh, yeah.
Mmm-mmm.
I can't do a plug for Waffle
House, because
there's not one anywhere nearby.
I think it's 30 miles to the nearest Waffle
House from here. I checked.
Otherwise, I'd be there instead of
here at this
microphone. Yes, it's at the
nexus of his dreams.
The Waffle House in the sky.
Oh. This music
in the background,
old people have heard it
many times. Mmm.
Dr. Dark gave us this
recording of Superman music
from the original Superman TV
show. Not the one anyone living
can remember, but the one with George
Reeves. Mmm. Not Steve
Reeves or Christopher
Reeves. Not Christopher Reeves. But George
Reeves, the Superman who
we grew up, you know, he committed
suicide, that actor
did, shortly after
the Superman show. And of course,
those kids all were going, he thought he was
Superman, so he just jumped out the window
and he fell off of that
Daily Planet building and died.
Because he's stupid, he thought he was Superman.
But actually, it turns out
the actor was having a torrid
affair with, I think, the wife of
the producer. Mmm.
And, um,
he felt like... And he wasn't a real
Superman, so to speak. He was the
only way out was to go
back to Krypton.
Well, yeah. And it's gone. I think, you know,
he said, screw this, I'm
freaking Superman, I'm jumping out of the window.
Dr.
That's what we all like to...
Faster than a speeding bullet.
I could play that
very thing that you're quoting,
but I won't.
It's at the beginning of the CD that's on right now.
Dun-da-dun, dun-da-dun,
dun-da-dun, dun-da-dun, dun-da-dun, dun-da-dun, dun-da-dun!
Look! Up in the sky!
It's like Bela Lugosi
reading the 23rd Psalm or something
like that to children or something.
You've got... Do you have
that record? Yeah.
Bela Lugosi reading the 23rd
Psalm to children?
Yeah. Yeah.
Which one is that? I can't even
remember which one that is. Well, it
was the one that the Nazi... What's
he named? The one more criminally... He said,
he had bought all these
recordings from Hollywood
before things got frigid between
the United States and Germany during the war
and had acquired all these
semi-forbidden tapes
and he used them as propaganda
devices. Wait a minute, I've got it.
Not like chicken scratchers or
pickle grinders or any kind of
device like that, but you know, like
a rhetorical
device. It was like this.
Though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no
evil, for I
am evil.
Hey, the other day, I should have... Princess
Wei, should I have brought
my new screenplay
called Count Jesus and
read it on the radio?
Possibly you should have. No, you don't want to.
So you're working on a new
screenplay already? Well,
I kind of stole... Here's what I did,
Dave. I suddenly had this idea
and I found a... On Wikipedia,
I grabbed the synopsis
of the novel Dracula by
Bram Stoker and I had a fun
little time doing search and replace
and I replaced
Dracula with the
name Jesus
and Count with
Lord Christ
or Christ Lord or something.
And I replaced London with
Jerusalem and
Transylvania with Nazareth
and Vampire with Nazarene.
Nazarenes. Yes.
And the great part was where the
brides of Jesus who were
called the Three Sisters,
the Three Nazarenes came and attacked
Simon Peter
who I replaced Jonathan
Harker.
Who did Van Helsing
turned into Pontius
Pilate? He was
the good guy. And they had to kill.
It's like Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
and Mary Magdalene had to
kill Count Jesus
because he'd been going around
putting everybody under his telepathic
control. Turning them into
Nazarenes. Yeah, turning everybody
into everybody whose blood he drank
became Nazarenes.
It's funny, after I
had changed everything, the story was
still the New Testament
and Dracula by Bram
Stoker remained completely
interchangeable.
Wow, man. I'm glad you discovered
that for the sake of humanity.
But see, I don't want to read that on the air
because it would be offensive.
Yeah, for the sake of your career
as a
person continuing to exist in America
I...
It's funny, you can
describe the process and somehow
that's not as offensive as when you
actually read Count Jesus
at the end.
I think the last line is
and they cut off his
head and stuffed myrrh
in his mouth and
freed Mary from the
curse of Jesus.
Yeah,
it was heavy.
It was heavy.
It made me want to
run out and produce a movie.
A low budget movie
with all the cameramen dressed in
robes playing
shepherds and Jesuses.
I know a guy who made
a movie called The Rebel
Jesus. I didn't know him very
well. He was the great director Larry
Buchanan who's better known
for Mars Needs Women.
Yes.
And other hits that were made in
Dallas. But one of the movies he made in
Dallas was The Rebel Jesus.
And it was about how Jesus wasn't
crucified but went to India
and smoked hash.
And it did
indeed, but was partially
filmed behind hotels.
He did go to the Holy Land
but he had trouble finding
locations that didn't have telephone poles
or cruise ships in the background.
So they went ahead and left him in.
It's like I've got
a still somewhere of Jesus
doing the Sermon on the Mount or
fishes and loaves or something. And there's a big
cruiser on the ocean behind him.
And this is
a still. They could have
airbrushed it out.
But that was
the great Larry Buchanan.
What a filmmaker.
Isn't he the filmmaker that made all the movies
with the women with the big boobies?
No, you're thinking of Russ Meyer.
No, no, no. It was a totally different thing.
Larry Buchanan also did
Zontar Thing from Venus.
He did a movie called Down on Us
which was about
Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin
and Jim Morrison
being murdered by the CIA
because they were anti-war.
And that has some
great fake
Hendrix music and
fake Jim Morrison poetry
which ended up being
transcribed by
the Rudi Schwartz Project and read by me
and it's on a Rudi Schwartz Project album.
But it's fake Jim Morrison poetry.
It's fake Jim. It's me
reading fake Jim Morrison
written by Larry Buchanan
in a kind of a poet
voice like this.
The bacon for tomorrow's
breakfast will have the peculiar
taste of ash.
I was real proud. That's my one
of the albums I'm on.
I'm on a Rudi Schwartz album
and I'm on a Negative Land album
at the very very end of the song
called Christianity is Stupid.
That's a song title.
And you can hear me going
yai yai yai yai yai
That's Five Strikes right there.
Well the funny thing is
everybody who hears that album
assumes that the preacher
that they cut up for that song
is me.
Because this guy's going
the loudspeaker spoke up and said
the loudspeaker spoke up and said
Christianity is stupid.
Communism is good.
I can see why they would think
that was me.
Except that I think they're all stupid.
And good.
Your friend Clyde is once again
in his media barrage using
the loudspeaker spoke up and said
Oh really?
Oh so Clyde Lewis
is using Negative Land.
Yes.
Well maybe he is copying the hour of slack
from 20 years ago.
We were ahead of our time
and he's now 20 years behind our time.
But still ahead of everybody else's time.
No but you see
this is the way things are
and how far they've gone.
When you listen to his callers
and the content of his programs
he is 20 years behind the time
and so everybody else is.
But us, we went back
we screwed up somehow.
We're not hitting the right pivot points.
We're missing
We're 20 years before
Jesus' time.
We're right up to date
for the year 30 B.C.
That was a great comic strip.
30 B.C.
until that guy turned into a Christian.
He did too.
Johnny Parker went born again
and suddenly the caveman and the ants
were doing these
pious
joke killing routines
around Christmas time.
That was because that was the best comic.
When we were kids.
Yeah when we were kids.
Yeah but then he decided to save
his readers.
But he's still
his name is still on those
those damn comics are still out there.
Think how many really
talented young cartoonists there are
who gave up because they're
reprinting Peanuts.
And why aren't they reprinting
Little Abner which was actually ahead
of its time. Yeah.
And behind its time.
I like the salacious drawings
of the women that
contempt a young man.
Those are great man.
What in Peanuts? Yeah Lucy was so hot.
Not in Peanuts.
I never saw Lucy. Little Abner.
Oh yeah. Not Little Abner.
I'm talking about the Biblical
you know the Biblical cartoons you were
talking to on the other
afternoon.
I'm gonna go back to the girl
of Little Abner. Did you ever see
Wolf Girl? She was in the 40s.
Man.
I remember in Playboy there was a
Girls of Little Abner issue.
Really? They were all
truncated. Most of them were
had the dwarf Mountie syndrome
and were wearing Mountie clothes.
You know like Northwest
Mounted Police clothes and stuff like that.
They were very short women.
And they did have real sharp
looking teeth. They were burying their fangs.
No man you're thinking of Peanuts not
Little Abner.
You're all confused Dave.
You're in a state of confusion. In fact you're
the capital of the state of confusion.
Dave Town.
It doesn't have to do with cashews
or fruit mix or Peanuts
or anything like that. It has to do
with what you've been talking about when you were trying
to confuse me on purpose.
Lone Cow Dave don't you see
what they're doing to yourself?
That was Reverend Televangelo.
Who said that?
I'm supposed to make a
torrid comment
right now.
Something with a T.
A comment with a T. And then I was
supposed to fall back asleep and you were supposed to wake me up.
Wake up Dave!
I've read now.
I've read now.
That's the smartest thing
any of us has said all
night.
I've read
a lot of things.
I've read a lot of things.
I just have to say praise
Evangelista
Televangelista
for that quote.
I don't know how we would put one foot in front of the other without that quote.
It's a lot shorter to type Lone Cow
Dave than Lonesome
Cowboy Dave.
Which I do
every week. I have to type
that name out at least twice.
All the way

Swineboy is my most
popular name.
My fan club says it's Swineboy.
It's the form of endearment
most used commonly by
people in the Buffalo
to Rochester area. People out
in the far west have different
it's like calling a smoky
bar a handle bar.
Well, Yankees
can't tell the difference, half of them,
between a cow and a
pig or a horse.
Yeah, especially with the plumbing utensils
they have to use. How can you anyway?
Plumbing utensils?
I wouldn't want to try and milk
a male horse or something
like that. Try to find
the secret to happiness
just because somebody tells me
I should take more math.
I don't know.
I know exactly what you're saying.
Princess, we remember the time
we were in Dave's
supermarket. Dave's?
And a
Yankee came up to us and her daughter
and they asked us
the difference between, well basically
they had us explain what a sheep was
because they'd gone to the
butcher
and tried to get it and said
what's the difference between
lamb and veal?
What was the difference?
What were those animals?
The butcher wouldn't even talk to them.
He insulted them and
they walked up to us for some reason
and said, excuse us, could we
I can't do a Yankee accent, but
can you explain the
difference between lamb and veal?
And we go, well veal's a baby cow
and lamb is a baby
sheep. And then
they both wanted
to know what a
sheep was.
And I think I said
that's the smaller
one that's covered with
white wool.
It's not as big
as a cow, but it's bigger than a pig.
I don't think we went into
the gory details of
how veal calves are
grown.
That's one of the most beautiful stories
I ever heard you say, Stank.
I think that we intoned
the poem of
a baa baa black sheep.
Have you any wool? No?
No, but we speculated that they had never
heard that. These were people
who had apparently never
watched Sesame Street
or if they did
they weren't paying much attention.
And they didn't get
nursery rhymes or storybooks.
These folks were really
cursed. I mean, a Chinese immigrant would know those words
if they're spelled backwards.
I think they might
have been interplanetary and I think
they just let it go
just like Superman did. I'm from
Krypton, I don't know what the hell a sheep is.
What's a sheep?
Well, look Superman, whatever. Would you
please just cook it for us with your
x-ray vision? No, no, kill it first!
Imagine how
that would feel, you know,
Superman cooking a live
sheep as it was
walking along. Who would want to live with such a guy?
You know, I mean, think of... He might be like
microwaving a cat. Yeah.
Like if you were like Santa Claus or
Bruce Springsteen or somebody
and we was married to you.
Right. And any time
you got mad at you... Exactly what I was saying.
And she was like Wonder Woman or Superwoman or something.
That's just what I was thinking.
Yeah.
She's doing it right now.
What a horrid thought.
No, really, Superman could
microwave
animals while they were alive. If he
was mean, he could do that to
people. As a child
in Smallville. Do you suppose he
ever did that? Do you think he ever experimented
with small animals?
Toads, cats? If he was a teenager, he had to
have done something inordinately
cruel and not really mean it like, let's
go burn neighbor Wilson's
house down and...
Hey, hey, hey,
Clark Kent, let's go dump pig's
blood on Carrie's head.
I don't know if I want to mess with
Carrie. She's got
her own powers.
Well, he is absurd and a plane.
No, he's a superman.
Yeah, but he doesn't have
telekinetic powers like
Carrie did. He had every other kind of power.
Right. But in some ways,
Carrie, that teenage girl,
mentally disturbed teenage girl,
could possibly defeat Superman.
Now, here we're getting into,
we're getting off the subject of
the Church of the Subgenius and into
who would win, Superman or Carrie?
You know, you're Superman.
I don't know.
Who would win, Darth Vader
or Jurassic Park?
Jurassic Park is a mean dinosaur.
Yeah.
It would be great.
Half an hour of anime film, two hours
and two and stuff, and you spend like five
minutes in the beginning and the end
talking to the master. Superman has to,
because they're at a deadlock, you know?
I think
Darth Vader would beat
Jurassic Park because he has
the Death Star.
And he had the same power that Carrie did.
And I don't mean any of the
Carries that we know.
There are a lot of them.
Yes.
A lot of modern Americans
have no reason, they feel
there's no reason to wear underwear.
They're not disciplined.
They're not
inscriptable. They're not confusing
in any way. They're completely
in total, they're lost to this
world, as
Professor Franco said just last night.
They're not a part of this
world we live in anymore.
They refuse to, they think they're
freer than other people are.
And they're not.
No.
No.
Bad cheese
fragrances.
P-U.
Essence of bad cheese?
Yeah, bonfowler cheese.
That's the worst kind.
Bonfowler cheese.
Hours of symposiums
about how to make it better.
That's what I can't do.
You know what we can do, though?
We can make this show better
in about five minutes.
I'm not going to be jumping out of a window
like Superman, I suppose.
No, Dave, don't jump out of the window.
No, they won't let us. That's why, remember,
they keep the windows bolted shut here,
so you can't do that anymore.
Also, you can't smoke.
Well, there was a person who, I can't remember,
it might have been almost 20 years ago,
but there was a person who thought they could
clamber out the window. There was that one
window, do you remember?
Yes.
At WCSB's old studio.
Where they kept the record albums.
Where Dave would be sent to smoke.
Yes.
Cigarettes.
Yes.
You could smoke marijuana
all day long in the building.
Nobody ever said anything about that.
Better not smoke a cigarette.
You gotta go outside and smoke a cigarette.
You smoke your marijuana all day long.
Those days are long gone, though.
Heaven's Days is gone because of 9-11.
Ever since 9-11, you can't smoke pot
in a radio station.
You can't.
The police are still hot now.
No, sir.
And they're still forbidden from learning
the sacred rights of Ulan and the other
different temperatures we have to get into
and stuff like that. Why can't we all
just do it?
You know what the listeners are thinking right now?
What? They're not smoking pot?
Why can't we all just get along?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You're saying this show sounds this way
and they're not smoking pot in the radio station?
Actually, that is
exactly how it is. That's the way it is.
That's the way of the future.
Well, they used to remember
the old days before they got all
neo-euro over in Holland there now.
And now they're even post-neo-modern.
I mean, post-neo,
you know, whatever.
I just said, damn, I hate
when that happens. But I don't really
care that much, so I'll continue to dominate
with my stupidity.
Well, I did forget what I was talking about.
Post-modern neo.
Oh, the kabouter bars.
And the, you know,
the people who spout, who are clearly
you know,
part of the kabouter bar scene
in Amsterdam. And
they were funny to Dutch people who I don't
really believe have a true sense of
humor. I think they're kind of too
Germanic.
I'm sorry to mean that.
It's germane to the conversation
now that we start to fade you
out and play
the monster
URL end and
MH high sound effects
and maybe the
psycho-skeleton's Mars base.
Okay, I'll do my smoky Amsterdam rap.
I didn't want that. I didn't want
an evil book.
I don't know Africa.
Even a man who is pure
at heart
and thinks he has
his slack, yet
if he eats those pickles
too soon, will have pimples
on his back.
Pimples on my brains,
don't they?
Pichles in milk,
good old
Pichles in milk.
And pimples.

No!
Ah!
There's still time!
Make the wish! Quickly!
Think of the power we can have.
No!
Ah!
Ah!
Yes!
Ah!
Ah!
I know it ain't made sense!
