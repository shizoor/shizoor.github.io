1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
S is for the suckers that live all around.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,120
U is for us, they're always putting us down.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,440
B is for Bob, he gives us our bread.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,160
G is for the guns they put to your head.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,200
E is for the eunuchs they want you to become.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,740
N is for the nuts, they wish they had some.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,560
I is for that eye in the back of my head.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,020
U is for you, they wanna see you dead.

9
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,660
S is for the shit that's all around.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,380
I'm a subterraneous motherfucker and I ain't no fucking clown.

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,260
And it comes down the street like a garbage wagon.

12
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,760
So their brains may live on forever.

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,460
Fresh venison.

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,820
Or has he created another?

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,500
Suck it, monstrosity.

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,340
Suck it, monstrosity.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,980
If you wanna cast a spell, you gotta use one of the magic words.

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,720
Perhaps the most famous one is a tits.

19
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,560
It's a very old word. It first turned up in a second century poem.

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,580
Another famous one is GET THE FUCK OUT!

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,480
Which has been around since at least the 17th century.

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,140
Ts-a-neem-hoke.

23
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,740
Hoke S-s-est.

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,680
Corpus Meum.

25
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,500
Spoken during the Roman Catholic Mass.

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,640
When the lion and the wafer are said to be transformed into the

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,360
Bullshit!

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,840
Other magic words are

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,360
Bull!

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,260
Damn it!

31
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:42,600
And

32
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,540
FUUUUUCK!

33
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,400
But to me, the most magical words are

34
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,260
I'm coming!

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,700
Bom, would you have the convenience of the smoke?

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,700
And all your rank?

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,260
Anytime.

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:02:00,840

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,660
gumming lovely so many people are invalids or perhaps in their grave

40
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,580
because of this filthy dirty stinking weed

41
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:17,280
from this moment you will become anti-smoking

42
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:27,700
I hope as anti as I hate it loathe it despise this filthy weed for what it can

43
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,680
do think of it

44
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,320
horrible and dirty from this moment you are no longer a slave to that filthy weed

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,060
that you have buried mentally for good and all

46
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,800
I think the goddamn terror the fucking gods out of my nose I'm part of my

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,260
language but let the sons of God and man bear witness even in the belly of the

48
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,600
Thunderbird I've been casting out the false prophets I'm bustin I got and

never in my days have I spoke other than for my every utterance is a lie

51
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,760
including this very one you hear I say

52
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,180

53
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,260

54

57
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,860

58
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,200
devil on the seven tables I am too intense to die I am fuel of the acts of

59
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,780
God and Satan I was shagged by boneless

60
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,240
fiends and alien Jews in my corporate galaxy and got away with their hookahs

61
00:03:47,240 --> 00:04:08,360
I cannot be tracked on radar. I swear nothing uniform. I wear God no, God no, no goddamn uniform. I tell you right now, I was suckled by a tricytopsis. I gave the antivirgin a high-protein tassel wash. I'm a bacteriological weapon. I'm armed and I'm loaded. I'm a fission reactor. I fight plutonium.

62
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:35,560
Power plants are fueled by the sweat from my brow. When they plug me in, the lights go out and honk, fucking, conk. I weigh 666 pounds and zero gravity. Come and get me, motherfucker. I sign retired space baby bastards across the cosmos. I cook and eat my death. Yahoo! I am the unshaven thorn tree of the Atlantis Zoo. I pay no motherfucking taxes, goddamn.

63
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,860
Shit! Piss! Pee!

64
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,140
Yo!

65
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:55,840
Your own damn ass! The devil's hands are my ideal playground. I hold a seven-bladed windbreaker. The wheels are turned on behind me. I think backwards. I do it for fun, motherfucker. I do it for motherfucking fun. My imagination is a fucking canter. And I'll poke it before it pokes me, goddamn.

66
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:08,060
They say a godzillion is the highest number there is. Well, by God, do I do count a godzillion and one? Yes, I'm the purple flower of hell county. Give me wide berth. When I drop my drawers, mother nature.

67
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:16,140
I use a python for a prophylactic. I'm thicker, harder, and meaner than the Alaskan pipeline, and I carry more spew.

68
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,300
Yes, I'll freeze your seed before it hits the bathroom floor.

69
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,820
Yee! Yee!

70
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,780
I kidnapped the future and ransomed it for the past. I made breath wilt the tree of life.

71
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,180
I left my spore on the rock of ages.

72
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,440
Who'll tear the flesh with me? Who'll split their juice?

73
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,420
Who'll guard with me? Whose candle will I fight out?

74
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,100
Woo! Woo! I'm ready! I'm ready, daddy! Take the job, daddy! I'm ready!

75
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,540
Step aside, all you butt-limb, neurotic, insecure, bespectacled slabs of whip-meat.

76
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,460
I'm a crime-fighting master criminal. I am not insane!

77
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,240
You hear me, motherfuckers? Not insane!

78
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,180
I'm a screamer and a laugher. I make a spectacle of myself. I am a psych!

79
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,060
God damn, my physical type cannot be classified by science.

80
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,940
My familiar is a picture-exact life. I feed him dipshits.

81
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,340
I communicate with our...

82
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,060
...wiser strengths.

83
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,400
I am a thuggy. I ain't feeding the togs.

84
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,820
I have the evil eye. I carry the mojo bag.

85
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,620
I swear in the Bermuda Triangle, it didn't get wet!

86
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,620
I circumcise dinosaurs with my tips and make them leave a tip.

87
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,880
I change tires with my tongue and my tool.

88
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,640
Every night I hook up a lunger and extinguish the sun!

89
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,380
The sun goes right out of the atmosphere, you quip!

90
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,140
I'm the Big Buddha Devil of level 14.

91
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,080
Who'll come shoot me?

92
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,480
Where's the robot giant who'll try to blow me down?

93
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,400
I pack in the brownies of the guard.

94
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,480
I leak the blood from my nether pods.

95
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,480
Opiates are the mass of my religion.

96
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,460
I take drugs!

97
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,740
Yes! I'm a ripstone!

98
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,660
I cram coca leaves right into the arm veins before they print out the tree!

99
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,180
Space monsters cringe at my tread.

100
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,140
I wipe the pyramids off my shoes before I enter my house.

101
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,300
I'm fuel-injected.

102
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,440
I live forever and remember afterwards.

103
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,540
I'm immune. I'm radioactive.

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,440
Come on! Give me cancer! Give me cancer!

105
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,300
I'll spit up the tumor and butter my bread with the juice!

106
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,400
I'll spit up the tumor and butter my bread with the juice!

107
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,700
I'm supernatural!

108
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,280
I'm supernatural!

109
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,300
I've been crow-viled with my meat, axe, and thumb!

110
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,460
My eye droppings bolt through the earth

111
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,680
and erupt from kuzum-china.

112
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,620
Yes! I can drink more wine and stay sober

113
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,880
than all the heathen Hindus in Asia!

114
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,200
Yee-hoo!

115
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,640
God, blow out!

116
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,760
I am a moray eel!

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,200
I am a Komodo dragon!

118
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,760
I am a killer whale befitted of its pup!

119
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,600
I have a triple jack bone!

120
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,140
I was desired by the movement!

121
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,240
Give me all, all, all your slack!

122
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,380
I told Jesus I wouldn't go to church

123
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,640
and he shook my hand!

124
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,680
I am my own personal savior!

125
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,900
I change him every hour!

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,380
I don't give a fuck if there's life after death!

127
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,740
I want to know if there's any fucking slack after death!

128
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,840
I am a goddamn visionary!

129
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,340
I see the future and past in comic books and wine bottles!

130
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,640
I eat black holes for breakfast!

131
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,380
I bend my jeans and whittle in my DNA

132
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,200
with a shift!

133
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,040
I am the force of my mighty will!

134
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,400
I steal my own goddamn evolution!

135
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,320
I ran out of heaven and sold it to hell for a profit!

136
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,600
Goddamn it!

137
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,020
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

138
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,020
I am enlightened!

139
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,320
I achieved Nevada and took it home with me!

140
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:18,940
Yee-hoo!

141
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,060
I am so ugly this meal of light

142
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,760
can't slow me down and gravity won't

143
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,540
tug at my cuffs!

144
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,960
When the rapture comes, I'll make them wait!

145
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,700
They'll never clean my cage!

146
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,580
I'm gonna go ahead and do the credits

147
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,300
without music.

148
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,900
Oh, yes, that was

149
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,300
Brother Cleve Donut Duncan reciting

150
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,580
The Brag of the Subgenius,

151
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,060
which is by yours truly, Reverend Stein.

152
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,560
That was actually the very first thing

153
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,400
that I ever put together

154
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,160
for Bob.

155
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,840
Off the 1980s

156
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,080
Subgenius album, Bad

157
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,200
Doctors. My personal favorite.

158
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,460
That's a lot of people's personal favorites.

159
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,020
Before that,

160
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,260
the saloon

161
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,240
bar shag business, I don't know who

162
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,180
it is really, but Slackmaster

163
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,980
Castro submitted it.

164
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,320
We started also with Brother Cleve

165
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,840
doing the Subgenius alphabet.

166
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,800
Those were the days,

167
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,280
as was yesterday, come to think of it.

168
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,180
Or am I thinking of last week? I don't know.

169
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,040
I'm at Dr. Philo Drummond's

170
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,180
overhouse

171
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,980
this week.

172
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,000
And, um,

173
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,280
I still haven't listened to the Puzzling Evidence

174
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,960
show that we did.

175
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,480
It's good!

176
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,600
That's why this is Hour of Slack number

177
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,520
fourteen hundred

178
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,540
point five triple

179
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,660
X. An X-rated

180
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,760
for language.

181
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,480
Internet only special

182
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,960
show, and it's mostly

183
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,280
X-rated X-Day 15.

184
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,820
As we

185
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,320
go back to the Wisteria

186
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,100
campground in 2012

187
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,440
for some not for

188
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,520
kids jams, rants, and

189
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,480
potty poetry.

190
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,020
Oh yes.

191
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,320
I can hear that there's at least four

192
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,420
people out there, and they're all assholes.

193
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,560
So this must

194
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,540
be X-Day.

195
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,460
I fucked

196
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,620
an old gal by the graveyard.

197
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,720
God damn

198
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,480
whore per

199
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,660
soul she was dead.

200
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,140
The worms

201
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,380
crawled out of her eyeballs, and the

202
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,500
hair slid off of her head.

203
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,600
Once I'd

204
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,060
finished my business,

205
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,100
I seen I'd

206
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,260
committed a sin.

207
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,340
And so from my pocket, I pulled

208
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,340
out a straw, and sucked

209
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,500
out the load I'd shot in.

210
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,060
And I was

211
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,060


212
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,160
bit

213
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,200
more

214
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,200


215
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:25,940
a

216
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,360
little

217
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,380
girl.

218
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:28,960
I was

219
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,760
a little

220
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:29,780
bit

221
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:29,800
more

222
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:29,820
than

223
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,280
a

224
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,420
little girl.

225
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,160
Going to the mall was fabulous.

226
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,660
And Ginny said that

227
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,240
she felt that

228
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,120
boys should be nicer to her,

229
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,220
but not

230
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,240
just treat her like a piece of ass.

231
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,940
Then Betty said to me, you know,

232
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,000
I just don't understand

233
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,100
why you can't be normal like the other

234
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,080
girls. And Betty said

235
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,960
to me, you know,

236
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,160
I just wish you were

237
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,780
a little more pretty.

238
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,360
A little more

239
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,520
skinny.

240
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,180
Have you tried

241
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,840
the new Cover

242
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,340
Girl Foundation?

243
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,080
I hear there's a

244
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,360
sale on at the Gap.

245
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,200
Betty can't understand why I don't give a

246
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,040
flying fuck about

247
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,380
that.

248
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,080
Nothing

249
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
worse in this world

250
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,580
than a paint girl.

251
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,900
Nothing worse in this world

252
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,120
than a paint

253
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,420
girl.

254
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,980
Debbie said to me, she said, I don't want you

255
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,140
talking to

256
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,020
her. And

257
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,340
Debbie said to me, I don't think I like

258
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,660
the cut of your jib.

259
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,100
And Debbie said to me, I'm gonna

260
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,180
kick your ass if you start shit with

261
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,400
me.

262
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,120
But that's not

263
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,100
what Debbie did.

264
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,480
And then Jessica

265
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,320
said, you know,

266
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,380
I don't,

267
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,900
why do people get tattoos?

268
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,480
And then Jessica said to me,

269
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,480
why don't you go to church like

270
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,240
everyone else does on Sunday?

271
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,020
But I don't.

272
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,900
And neither do you.

273
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,260
And boys,

274
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,660
I've got a message for you.

275
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,820
You've got a choice in this world,

276
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,240
boys,

277
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,320
and I know there's not a lot of us

278
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,680
superfims around, but

279
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,520
if these paint girls

280
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,160
bug me,

281
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,860
even half as much as they

282
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,400
bug you,

283
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,720
they're not worth the time.

284
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,660
Do not

285
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,280
put your

286
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,820
wang in pink

287
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,620
snatch.

288
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,020
Fuck the paint girls.

289
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,340
And fuck the pink boys.

290
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,280
They're nothing more than conspiracy

291
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:51,980
toys.

292
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,680
pense a peacock

293
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:04,800
when they're

294
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,020
прис曼ah

295
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,860
addictive

296
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:07,860


297
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,680
uet

298
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:25,700

299
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,820
Sec I

300
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,200
We'll be right back.

301
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:08,660
We'll be right back.

302
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:55,660
We'll be right back.

303
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,860
This is Tranquility Base.

304
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,900
The Eagle has landed.

305
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,180
Jesus H. Christ.

306
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,000
Houston.

307
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,220
We're on the fucking move.

308
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:09,760
Over.

309
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,340
Roger, Tranquility.

310
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,540
We copy that.

311
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,260
We cannot believe you are on the fucking move.

312
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,880
Repeat, cannot fucking believe it.

313
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,120
Over.

314
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:43,440
You're cleared to hook up lunar equipment conveyor to walk, fucking walk on the moon.

315
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:43,920
Over.

316
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,580
Over.

317
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,220
Holy.

318
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,680
Holy.

319
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,340
Living.

320
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:56,920
Fuck.

321
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,120
Are you fucking believing this?

322
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,360
Over.

323
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,640
We read you.

324
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,040
Over.

325
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:18,060
I am so fucking glutely am standing on the surface of the fucking moon.

326
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,920
Am talking to you from the surface of the fucking moon.

327
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,320
Jesus.

328
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:25,420
Jesus.

329
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:25,640
Jesus.

330
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:25,800
Jesus.

331
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,160
Jesus.

332
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,560
Jesus.

333
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:26,780


334
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:26,980


335
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,220
Jesus.

336
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,160
Jesus.

337
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,420
Jesus.

338
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:33,420


339
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:33,480
Jesus.

340
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:33,480


341
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:33,480


342
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:33,480


343
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:33,480


344
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:33,840
I saw that!

345
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,540
Oh my!

346
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,440
Bye!

347
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,420
Bye!

348
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:36,960
Bye!

349
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:37,960
...

350
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,200
Fucking moon.

351
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,600
That's all I got.

352
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,240
Oh boy.

353
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,100
This one seems to be having a problem.

354
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,960
This could mean a thimbletronic leap of causing the thimbletronic radiation leak.

355
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,600
Please, I just want you to be aware for your own health and your own safety.

356
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:05,960
That was the Evolution Control Committee live at 50 next day with help from The Onion.

357
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:14,500
Before that, the Pink Girl song was Priestess Pisces improvising with Reverend Angry Larry, Suds Bishaw, and many others.

358
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,280
The first night of the festival, I believe.

359
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,720
This is a subgenius end of the world festival we're talking about.

360
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:28,220
When they know the world is ending, people tend to do and say things that they might not under normal circumstances.

361
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,200
So true.

362
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,560
Sometimes this upsets other people.

363
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:41,180
For instance, Dr. Drummond here, his presentation at 60 next day may have ruffled some feathers.

364
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:41,800
I'm sorry.

365
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,700
This is the Boys Will Be Boys.

366
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,520
They're kind of bad when they get together.

367
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,600
You're not sorry.

368
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,580
No.

369
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,120
I'm not sorry.

370
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,020
You really hope it ruffles some feathers.

371
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:54,940
Yeah.

372
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,840
That was the intent, I guess.

373
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:10,340
Now this next reading is by me and little Ivan Stang and Stern Elkekaver.

374
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,100
Back when we were just tiny little children.

375
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,820
We're supposed to snap like a bogey or something?

376
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,700
No, you could snap if you want.

377
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,180
That's fine.

378
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,800
You hear the progression of the frop enhancement.

379
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,820
As the reading goes on here.

380
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,660
This is called Boys Will Be Boys.

381
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,960
Chapter one.

382
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,540
The Mooney problem.

383
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,080
Once upon a time when the Moonies were fixing him his four sliders,

384
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:40,320
Philo accidentally shat his pants when he farted what he thought was a completely gaseous fart.

385
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,580
Ignorantly, the Moonies continued to fix the four sliders into infinity.

386
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,900
Using secret techniques developed by Lepidomane,

387
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,780
Philo maneuvered the material to the moon.

388
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,660
He then used the material back up into his own anal passage,

389
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,220
thereby storing it to further ferment,

390
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,480
somehow allowing him the opportunity to fuck it when it would be totally ready.

391
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,780
While he was vigorously disenfranchising a pile of rejected anal fissure tissue

392
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,920
and making a big deal out of wearing his new garments,

393
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,580
Philo deduced that banking his own anal squat droppings

394
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:18,740
was the most prudent and economically stabilizing move he could make in the current financial climate.

395
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,760
So who's the Mooney?

396
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,840
While half-heartedly fucking the aforementioned pile of rejected anal tissue,

397
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:30,760
as Wanda was eating their fuck in the next county over,

398
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,640
there was, after all, plenty of fuck to eat.

399
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,780
So they decided to pass on the sliders for the time being,

400
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,820
continually being offered much to the Mooney's chagrin.

401
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,460
As the loudspeaker rang out,

402
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,340
we fuck at their shit.

403
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,160
Chapter two.

404
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,360
Your mom's fat ass.

405
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,080
Two counties over.

406
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,140
While contemptuously eating their fuck,

407
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,760
he, Philo, and Wanda's illegitimate bastard son

408
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,900
dreamed in vain of someday fucking the shit out of an entire squat dropping pie festival.

409
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:12,740
But, after half-heartedly pie-fucking the neglected squat droppings,

410
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,420
the anal fissure rejection tissues just didn't seem to be worth a damn to him anymore.

411
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,540
Meanwhile, his mom continued endlessly,

412
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,280
relentlessly ringing that damn doorbell,

413
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,740
relentlessly striving to get in and sell someone some more Avon products,

414
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,900
while he was fucking the bucket full of rejected anal tissue, if possible.

415
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,420
After all, she was whipping the fuck out of the act of eating their collective fuck.

416
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:42,460
Later, Philo shat at the woman next to him in line at the fuckery about eating their fuck later on that evening.

417
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,920
Oh, don't worry, we have an ample supply of toiletries for those hard-to-reach areas, he assured her.

418
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,520
That night at the office, Philo was sitting in the back of the car, looking at the wall, and he saw a woman.

419
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:50,520


420
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:50,520


421
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:50,520


422
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:50,520


423
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,360
As he walked out to the door...

424
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,060
Philo continued to soak his butt in a bucket of anal fissure tissue,

425
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,280
while weaving a bellybutton-lint sweater,

426
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,180
when just one last thread between the spaces of the face

427
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,460
and his return lap, without the slightest twinge of pee, he re-decided again to eat his own fuck.

428
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:10,360
He still had no idea his mom was eating his fuck in the next county over.

429
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:17,760
In fact, to get the most money for his slacked-fucks, he would have to re-eat the re-shat fuck pie.

430
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,680
And not a pack of flies,

431
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,500
the panic that at this moment any of the dijakate hagumovs would want up loaves in the dirt room.

432
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:20,500


433
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,360
and was more than satiated with fuck, he murmured,

434
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,380
we fuck on their shit, as he farted shit with his dick.

435
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,980
Haphazardly removing his damn garments,

436
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,600
and absentmindedly butt-sucking the regurgitated fuck vomit pie,

437
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,340
and again utilizing the tried-and-true disenfranchised butt-split moony

438
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,800
and his fuck-sucking techniques,

439
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,060
he double-re-fucked the puke fuck that he'd eaten

440
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,460
and sucked it back up into the warm, comfortable depths of his own butt.

441
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,680
After regurgitating the fuck,

442
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,040
re-eating it and defecating on it again,

443
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,880
not necessarily in that order,

444
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,920
he elected to take another nap,

445
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,980
but not alongside random homeless guy and pee-bear himself,

446
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,560
still carrying his smelly barrel of decayed, cast-off dicks,

447
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,560
also formerly used to fuck buckets of anal fissure tissue.

448
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,040
Seemingly unkind,

449
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,180
he nevertheless ate the whole barrel of dicks.

450
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,600
Chapter 6, Disenfranchising the Rejected Anal Fissure Tissue

451
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,620
Suddenly, he remembered he had run completely out of garments.

452
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,940
Not to be dismayed,

453
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,580
Philo absentmindedly made a mental note to himself.

454
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,240
After gathering enough belly-button-blint sweat to make another sweater,

455
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,580
Philo elected instead to make a big old pair of shit pants.

456
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,800
After he had devoured the entire quantity of fuck that had been shit that day,

457
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,960
he resumed methodically fucking the rejected necrotic anal fissure tissues

458
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,600
until he puked the fuck back onto his own dick

459
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,100
and gazed dreamily into the pool of lap-fuck vomit.

460
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,520
He was struck with the realization he would simply re-re-re-eat

461
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,840
the hideous aforementioned piles with a straw,

462
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,200
while simultaneously re-re-fucking it slash them.

463
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,020
After strenuously fucking the shit out of Philo,

464
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,500
re-fucking the regurgitated fuck,

465
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,580
the fuck decided to re-eat itself,

466
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,860
thus reintroducing the fuck back through its own alimentary canal.

467
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,660
Care maggot, vomit ultrasaurus, junior butt pain,

468
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,120
and nose-hair dwarf had just joined in and were fucking

469
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,920
when Philo realized it was time to butt-suck the anus-excreted fuck

470
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,360
that he had already re-vomited back up into his own dick.

471
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,820
Butt-dicking the regurgitated shit

472
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,360
and utilizing a disimpeded butt-split Scientologist

473
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,980
and his merciless fuck-sucking techniques,

474
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,220
he unflinchingly re-fucked the dick-shit that he had so valiantly eaten

475
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,520
and sucked back up into his own nipple.

476
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,660
After vomiting up the pee, a blessed respite from his travails,

477
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,600
re-eating it and post-felching it again,

478
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,400
he elected to take a nap.

479
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,780
After the anguish of peeing those selfsame necrotic squat-fuckings,

480
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,000
the urethral fissure, and the pain of the penis,

481
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,940
Philo's fissure-rejection tissues no longer seemed worth a pee,

482
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,140
for after all the endless butt-sucking in their respective fucks,

483
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:29,020
Philo had to again, sneakily, re-shit it all into a fuck-bucket

484
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,420
already half-filled with necrotic pee-slash-tit-soakings

485
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,040
and rejected shit-fisher cum-dumps.

486
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,700
Suddenly he realized he was soaking his butt in the cum-dump of anal dick tissues.

487
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,680
When, without the slightest twinge of pee,

488
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,740
Philo's fissure-rejection tissues were completely re-declined,

489
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,080
he decided to eat his own fuck again.

490
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,160
Chapter 11

491
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,560
So what did actually happen?

492
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,560
Well, Philo shat the pee vomit that he'd previously and oh-so-carefully

493
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,160
butt-sucked back up into his own rejected booger shit-tissues,

494
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,420
and after butt-sucking their snot-fuck,

495
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:11,080
he monotonously continued to shit it discreetly into a cum-bucket,

496
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,980
already half-filled with necrotic subgenius squat-butt-fuckings.

497
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:15,980


498
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:15,980


499
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,380
He then re-declined his own cum-dumps,

500
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,100
and rejected anal urethra vaginas.

501
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,960
Though he was grooming his butt passage,

502
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,360
and simultaneously categorizing it in another room,

503
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:30,680
Voodoo Booger and Oosie Cloaca ate their own nay-nays in petulant silence.

504
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,280
Bung Monkey, nevertheless, continued to urinate on the electric guitar,

505
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,480
obliviously shocking the living pee out of himself,

506
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,700
yet even after Philo had fully devoured the fuck,

507
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,980
he pi-peed the unrejected,

508
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,600
necrotic puke-tissues,

509
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,120
even while de-pee-fucking both of them,

510
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,760
seemingly unperturbed,

511
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,560
Care-Ass's mom, Pet-Mom,

512
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,500
continued to methodically pick the peanuts out of Bung Monkey's shit

513
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,400
in order to gin out gallons of shit-peanut brittle.

514
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,120
After vomiting up the rather expensive imported fuck,

515
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,400
re-eating it again, and fucking it again,

516
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,840
Philo elected to take a nap alongside Pee-Bee

517
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,480
and his newly-arrived shipment of barrels of out-of-date Oosie Dick anuses.

518
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,080
Philo politely refused,

519
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:24,400
and turned his head to spit the fart that he'd previously held back in his own anal-mouth aperture.

520
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,260
Even his maggot-hair eco-swagger fixed him his four sliders again,

521
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:35,420
and pulling them back into her distended anus while simultaneously re-de-fucking them out again,

522
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,120
meanwhile, Philo was forced to invent a time machine, and fast.

523
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,840
Finally, after going back in time,

524
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,100
Philo, in order to obfuscate a future lawsuit,

525
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,720
while butt-fucking the Moonies as they fixed him his four sliders,

526
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,080
changed his name to Bung-Hole Hair Pie,

527
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:56,300
and shat the fart he'd previously butt-sucked back up into his own previously-rejected anal fissure tissues,

528
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,660
the whole time babbling coded messages to the woman next to him in line at the Safeway about déjà vu.

529
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,260
The end.

530
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,180
And now I think the, uh,

531
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,220
not quite yet, the amino acids will be here.

532
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,900
They're still on over Seattle or something.

533
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,480
Can we get a little bit more noise for Philo?

534
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,760
Philo!

535
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,320
Philo!

536
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,040
Philo!

537
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,260
Philo!

538
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,260
It's okay, honey.

539
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,080
I love you.

540
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,760
Now, some of you may need to change your pants.

541
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,220
I love you.

542
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,100
Anal fissure changes.

543
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,660
And I think that was a very educational lesson on anal fissures.

544
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,700
Are you okay, Mandy?

545
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,840
Anal fissure changes.

546
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,260
Something is wrong with fat Mandy, and she can't stop saying anal fissure.

547
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,860
I love you.

548
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,680
As we say in the church, you can break some of the things some of the time,

549
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,340
or the subgenius can break all of the things all of the time.

550
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,340
Philo said, Doctor, I broke my dick.

551
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,020
Doctor said, Philo, I'm gonna have to cut your dick off.

552
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,980
Philo said, then you'd better cut it down to the motherfucking bone,

553
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,760
because if you leave any meat, I'm gonna fuck right on.

554
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,060
Eh.

555
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,980
What's wrong, Suds?

556
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,740
Uh, I, I went and fucked up.

557
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,460
You fucked up?

558
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,260
Yeah, I fucked up. See?

559
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:47,520
There was, I had this whole thing planned out, and then I went and did a bad thing.

560
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:54,720
See, a few years back, uh, somebody close to me learned an important lesson.

561
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:02,060
That, uh, she, we, Monkeyhide was getting ready to do its first, uh, thing at, at X Day.

562
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:08,880
And we were backstage, you know, getting dressed, and Pisces, we'd worked out this whole number.

563
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,240
She was gonna sing a song with us, and she walks up and, uh, she's like,

564
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:17,040
uh, we're mere moments from going on, and she comes running up to me with this look of panic on her face.

565
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,960
And she goes, I, I can't go on stage with you.

566
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,300
And I'm like, why? What, what happened?

567
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,360
She goes, Philo came up to me with a bowl.

568
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,300
I said, say no more.

569
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,000
I was completely effed.

570
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:36,400
So, there's this song out there that, when she told me that story, it popped in my head,

571
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,300
and I was like, oh, I've gotta do this some X Day.

572
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:39,820
Uh.

573
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:47,480
But then, on the way up here, Philo intercepts me.

574
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,160
Suds!

575
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,840
And, well, let's see if I can actually get through this.

576
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:53,720
Hmm.

577
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,860
I always heard that his herb was top shelf.

578
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,020
I just could not wait to find out for myself.

579
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,060
Don't knock it till you tried it.

580
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,240
Well, I tried it.

581
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,040
I tried it, my friend.

582
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,380
And I'll never smoke frop with Philo again.

583
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:24,620
I learned a hard lesson at Ohio Town.

584
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,900
He fired up a frop stick and he passed it around.

585
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,500
But the last words I spoke before they talked me in,

586
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:40,780
was I'll never smoke frop with Philo again.

587
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:45,980
I'll never smoke frop with Philo again.

588
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,180
My X Day's all over before it began.

589
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,680
You could pour me some old whiskey, River, my friend.

590
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,600
I'll never smoke frop with Philo again.

591
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,940
Up at the big house after the fifth.

592
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,300
The party's just started and he rolled up a spliff.

593
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,540
Alone in the front room, just me and him.

594
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,580
With one parting puff, getting creeper set in.

595
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,760
I'll never smoke frop with Philo again.

596
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,760
My X Day's all over before it began.

597
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,920
You could pour me some old whiskey, River, my friend.

598
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,220
I'll never smoke frop with Philo again.

599
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,220
I'll never smoke frop with Philo again.

600
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,340
My X Day's all over before it began.

601
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,740
You could pour me some old whiskey, River, my friend.

602
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,620
I'll never smoke frop with Philo again.

603
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:15,960
Now we're up at the big house and passing the guitar and I'm really stoned.

604
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,080
We're passing the guitar and telling good jokes.

605
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,500
I know one's a-coming cause I'm smelling smoke.

606
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,660
No I do not partake, I just let it pass by.

607
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,900
With a smile on my face and a great smile.

608
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,660
I'll never smoke frop with Philo again.

609
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,940
I'll never smoke frop with Philo again.

610
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,820
My X Day's all over before it began.

611
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:54,260
You could pour me some old whiskey, River, my friend.

612
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,280
I'll never smoke frop with Philo again.

613
00:34:59,360 --> 00:34:59,800
Everybody!

614
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,540
I'll never smoke frop with Philo again.

615
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,880
My X Day's all over before it began.

616
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:14,360
You could pour me some old whiskey, River, my friend.

617
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,560
I'll never smoke frop with Philo again.

618
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,140
You could pour me some old whiskey, River, my friend.

619
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:25,140


620
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:30,100
In the fetal position with drool on my chin.

621
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:36,780
I fucked up and smoked frop with Philo again.

622
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,880
I'll never smoke frop with Philo again.

623
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,600
I'll never smoke frop with Philo again.

624
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,740
It's really funny because I came up here and he goes,

625
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,400
you never guessed just what happened to me

626
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,140
right before I was gonna do that song.

627
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,720
Well I don't know about you,

628
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,400
but I hope I get to smoke frop with Philo again.

629
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,580
Every now and again I find myself in this strange part of the world

630
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,440
known as the Bay Area.

631
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,980
I don't know if you've been out to the Bay Area,

632
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,280
but the Bay Area, they're different out there.

633
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:16,340
They function a little more freely than the rest of the world.

634
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,520
And it's a beautiful thing.

635
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,440
It's a beautiful thing, but every Thursday at 4 a.m. Pacific Time,

636
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:28,700
my very good friend Puzzling Evidence and Philo and Dr. Hal,

637
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:34,980
they converge on a little radio station called KPFA.

638
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:36,960
And they're all like, oh, I'm gonna smoke frop with Philo again.

639
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,280
And it's a wonderful thing.

640
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,280


641
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,280


642
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,280


643
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,280


644
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,280


645
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,780
and a Berkeley there where the hippies come from.

646
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,740
And what we do is if I'm in town, I get to join him

647
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,320
and what you do is you gotta show up to the radio station at 2.30.

648
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,620
Nobody's got a cell phone.

649
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,400
So you just have to hope that he's gonna show.

650
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,440
and eventually puzzling evidence rolls in with this giant truck

651
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,380
Dr. Hal and Philo shows up

652
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,360
and we put the hour of slack on, see

653
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,300
we put the hour of slack on for oh about an hour

654
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,060
and then we go up to the roof

655
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,820
where we frop heavily

656
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,780
with that fancy medicinal frop

657
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,420
and it's a beautiful thing

658
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,220
and then at that point it's like 4.45, 5 in the morning or something

659
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,660
and we're on the air live and people are calling in

660
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:27,640
and half the time the auxiliary vocal booth

661
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,180
doesn't have lights so I'm sitting there in the dark

662
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,740
stoned out of my ever-loving gourd

663
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:37,040
and I'm sure the shows are archived but I know I don't want to listen to them

664
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,640
because if I do I'm afraid that I too

665
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,640
will be singing I'll never smoke frop

666
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,020
with Philo again

667
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,960
I don't want that to be the case because that man has a yodeling pickle

668
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,960
so please

669
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,940
I'll give

670
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,200
I'll give

671
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:50,200


672
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:50,200


673
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,180
a big praise to Philo and his yodeling pickle

674
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,080
that hurts

675
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,860
okay thanks to Reverend Fat Man D for sharing with us

676
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,260
and to Reverend Frodus Suds Shaw

677
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,840
for that Willie inspired song

678
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,600
I'll Never Smoke Frop

679
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,340
with Philo again

680
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,680
man how I wish I could say that

681
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,960
I was so inspired by that

682
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,240
I don't have any

683
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,220
it's a good

684
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,100
it's kind of

685
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,080
a good idea that I threw this show together

686
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,180
while I was here with you

687
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,140
because this has you all over it

688
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:25,960
Dr. Drummond

689
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,440
oh thank you

690
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,420
kids you can learn to cough like Captain Drummond

691
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,140
let's see okay now

692
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,320
a truly horrible song from several fisted tales of Connie

693
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,060
the X-Day ever-changing jam band

694
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,320
I think this one has Dr. Sinister on drums and other things

695
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,960
Reverend Angry Larry on guitar and sing ranting

696
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,840
with Pisces

697
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,380
oh it's a good thing we didn't bring your daughter in here to help with this

698
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:55,620
yeah

699
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,140
because this is a piece I like to call

700
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,160
the Bob Cox song

701
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,100
oh yeah

702
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,560
Bob

703
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,200
put it with

704
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,380
promise on deck

705
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,580
Bob

706
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,600
put it with

707
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,640
promise on

708
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,240
penis

709
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,740
through his own deck

710
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:28,540
Bob

711
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,340
put it with

712
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,180
through his own deck

713
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,080
Bob

714
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,640
Bob

715
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,160
Bob

716
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,060
put it with

717
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,520
through his own

718
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,180
deck

719
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:56,980
Leila

720
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,060
and it

721
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,340
too fueled to the light by a good

722
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,240
It's aunt

723
00:39:59,240 --> 00:39:59,500
here

724
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,680
Realized and you Gordon Gordon was the only way that he can relieve himself and his own

725
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,780
Only way that he could rewrite

726
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:05,780


727
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,640
so these yeah

728
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,100
how to be ready for mistakes

729
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,300
dotta

730
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:10,920
My

731
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,440
or anything like that, like I'm talking about

732
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,640
Pony Express here.

733
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,360
G Gordon Gordon had said,

734
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,960
could you please piss for me about a month's worth?

735
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,400
You might want to flush or get the city in

736
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,240
to come on out and clean out your drains

737
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,620
because I got a big piss coming on.

738
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,720
Bob had been drinking beer that night heavy.

739
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,480
Cheap beer, he was drinking Milwaukee's Pest

740
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,200
and it was getting more and more pressure upon him.

741
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,540
He meant, G Gordon Gordon,

742
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,100
please, please release this

743
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:54,080
intense, horrible pressure building.

744
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,700
He sent out the call again and Gordon,

745
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,400
Gordon didn't answer.

746
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,120
He sent out the call again

747
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,760
and Gordon didn't answer.

748
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:21,360
G Gordon next night he got a call from Eric

749
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,560
on schedule, thought he had been

750
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,060
sent on to34BJHU, into Mt.

751
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,700
ÖK, to address.

752
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,100
Well yeshire.

753
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,100
Ah Ari.

754
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,220
RiM 쳬 Over.

755
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:38,800
At the sun

756
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,080
Get out

757
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,060
Bob

758
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:11,280
Bob finally realized that he could piss from his own dick.

759
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:17,500
So he got a hold of D. Gordon Gordon and said,

760
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,840
Hey, you know, I don't need you pissing for me anymore.

761
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,120
Because I can do it by myself.

762
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,640
Consider the penis.

763
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,300
Um, okay.

764
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,120
Penis, penis, penis, penis, bob, bob, bob.

765
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,740
Penis, penis, penis, bob, bob, bob.

766
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,060
Penis, penis, penis, penis.

767
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,080
Consider the penis.

768
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:36,900
Bob, bob, bob.

769
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,820
Penis, penis, bob.

770
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,060
Penis, bob, bob, bob, bob, bob, bob.

771
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,900
Penis, penis, penis, penis, bob, bob, bob, bob, bob.

772
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,580
It's such a large member, it just would never fit in such a small package.

773
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,780
Oh, your penis is so powerful.

774
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,500
I'm coming.

775
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,060
Okay, thanks.

776
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:48,480
Get off me now.

777
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,140
Whoa, whoa.

778
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,300
Whoa, whoa.

779
00:42:59,300 --> 00:42:59,300


780
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,720
I knew it was wrong.

781
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,500
When he tried to get my bone.

782
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,380
But he'd beg and beg and plead.

783
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,640
All the while on his knees.

784
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:22,260
I told him I preferred vagina over the producer of diarrhea.

785
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:27,320
But I don't know what to do right now.

786
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,220
Because I'm in love with a Catholic priest.

787
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,180
He's got me down on my knees.

788
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,280
Catholic has a new meaning.

789
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,380
I'm in love with a Catholic priest.

790
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,340
He's got me down on my knees.

791
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,500
Catholic has a new meaning.

792
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,480
I asked him why I had to lick his asshole.

793
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,500
He said,

794
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,800
The Bible says so.

795
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,960
He lured me in with gum.

796
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,360
Then he baptized me with his cum.

797
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,920
I'm not saying I'm complaining.

798
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:20,860
But it took a while to get the nut stains off my butt.

799
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:25,060
I scrub and scrub but the sin just won't come clean.

800
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,160
But I'm in love with a Catholic priest.

801
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,720
He's got me down on my knees.

802
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:33,720


803
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:33,720


804
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:38,220
Catholic has a new meaning.

805
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,400
I'm in love with a Catholic priest.

806
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,260
He's got me down on my knees.

807
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:52,380
Catholic has a new meaning.

808
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,440
He converted me.

809
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,600
Where it's dirty.

810
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,980
He converted me alright.

811
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,880
He converted me.

812
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,860
Where it's dirty.

813
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,160
He converted me alright.

814
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,600
He said I've been a bad boy.

815
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,140
As he punished me with ash joy.

816
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,320
He converted me alright.

817
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,340
I'm in love with a Catholic priest.

818
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,160
He's got me down on my knees.

819
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,320
Catholic has a new meaning.

820
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,440
I'm in love with a Catholic priest.

821
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,500
He's got me down on my knees.

822
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,600
Catholic has a new meaning.

823
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:23,060
He converted me.

824
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,160
Where it's dirty.

825
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,480
He converted me alright.

826
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,540
He converted me alright.

827
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,880
He converted me alright.

828
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:38,880
He converted me alright.

829
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:38,880


830
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:38,880


831
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,660
That song was by Dead Body Sex.

832
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,360
Sex spelled S-E-C-T-S.

833
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,360
And before that, a collage by Ministry of Slack.

834
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,260
Thanks to Ministry of Slack.

835
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,040
And now, for about 10 minutes, I'm going to sing a song called,

836
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:53,040


837
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,620
We'll hear an uncut recording of the amazing self and others mutilation performance at X Day

838
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:04,460
by sideshow marvel, St. Andrew the Impaled of Pittsburgh.

839
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,000
I believe that Fat Mandy is setting up a Pittsburgh revival for April, maybe,

840
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,600
with us and her and Andrew and Tommy Amoeba, I'm sure.

841
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,460
But now, Andrew.

842
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,900
I'm going to turn this stage over to a deranged young man,

843
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,360
we in Pittsburgh call him the Prince of Pierogi.

844
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,000
We call him Pittsburgh's premier pain-proof clown.

845
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,800
You may call him Andrew the Impaled.

846
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,040
Thank you Mandy, thank you. That was lovely.

847
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,920
My goodness, that was absolutely terrific.

848
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:52,880
It is an absolute thrill to be out here at X Day, umpteen times.

849
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:58,220
I'm going to use that forever since I'll never bother to remember actually what year,

850
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,520
you know, because that involves math.

851
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,940
And I was told there would be no math.

852
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,940
Give me one second. Masturbate among yourselves.

853
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,020
Put some lube on it, for fuck's sake.

854
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:18,700
I hear a lot of dry fucking masturbation out there.

855
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,700
Hey, that's an important thing that needed to be done.

856
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,800
And if it didn't be done, well, you'd fucking suffer for it.

857
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:29,100
But that is the theme of this evening's show.

858
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,780
Yes, good evening everyone. I am Andrew the Impaled,

859
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,580
Pittsburgh's premier pain-proof clown.

860
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,020
As Mandy says, the monarch of the mon, the Prince of Pierogi,

861
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,580
the Duke of Yinser.

862
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,420
Thank you, thank you.

863
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:52,500
And I have the special privilege of guaranteeing to hurt myself bad,

864
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,280
for Bob, all the fucking time.

865
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,900
It is, it is a true, a true vestige of slack,

866
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,200
what I do in my life and my day-to-day efforts.

867
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:12,180
And it absolutely is by the grace of the slaughtered corpse of Bob

868
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,580
in my garage that I'm able to do these things.

869
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,880
Don't start with me that it's not the real Bob,

870
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,020
because I don't fucking want to hear it, okay?

871
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,920
The fucking corpse I have in my body is fucking Bob,

872
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,160
and you can shut the fuck up if you don't believe me.

873
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:26,720
All right.

874
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,340
All right, now we got the show started,

875
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,420
let me introduce the star.

876
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,780
Right, right, it's not, it's not me.

877
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,800
I mean, you know, I am Andrew the Impaled,

878
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,020
you know, they made a big deal out of, you know, calling me up here,

879
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,700
whatever, you guys have plotted for some reason, or whatever.

880
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:47,020
But I am not, in fact, the star of my show.

881
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,140
So, if you'll bear with me for just one minute,

882
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,760
I will introduce to you,

883
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,180
the star of tonight's show.

884
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,060
As if you dumbasses didn't know,

885
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,280
it's the Toolbox of Death!

886
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,140
Yeah!

887
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:00,800
What?

888
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,020
Cheer for the fucking Toolbox of Death!

889
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:04,700
Yeah!

890
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:06,960
There you go.

891
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,080
People don't know shit if you don't know the Toolbox of Death,

892
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,520
for crying out loud, you can aced act like you've had some culture

893
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,100
for once in your godforsaken lives.

894
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:15,580
Yeah.

895
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,180
All right, now I'm gonna need a volunteer, the girl over here.

896
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,700
Come here. Come on.

897
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:21,700
Hurry up.

898
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:22,760
Please.

899
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:24,180
Please.

900
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:24,380
Please.

901
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:24,860
No.

902
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,000
Get the fuck up here.

903
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,160
Come on, there's the girl over here.

904
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,720
Yeah, I can't see shit, so just get your ass on up here.

905
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,360
Come on, hurry up.

906
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,160
We got a show waiting for you.

907
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,080
This is real.

908
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,300
The boy's got a chair.

909
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,040
Fuck's sake.

910
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,540
What, you just got a chair?

911
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,340
You lazy fucks.

912
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,700
Here, you person on the ground, here, come here.

913
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,780
Get your ass up here.

914
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,620
Come on, get your ass up here, I need some help.

915
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,260
I need a volunteer, and it's fucking you.

916
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,340
Yeah, I don't know what the word volunteer means.

917
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,160
No, not you, the pretty lady next to you.

918
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,540
Sit the fuck down, Janice.

919
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,560
Fuck's sake, you had your chance.

920
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,200
All right, get on up here.

921
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,120
There's a little walkway over there, and we'll hurry your ass up on here,

922
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,180
and we'll get this show underway.

923
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,460
Come on, we're already running behind.

924
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,480
All right.

925
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,480
But hey, we're running behind with excellent slack,

926
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,380
because how about fucking Tommy Amoeba?

927
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,640
Amoeba Knievel, everyone.

928
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,400
Huh?

929
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,100
That's some great shit.

930
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:15,900
How about that bass player?

931
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:16,700
He was pretty cute, huh?

932
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:17,940
Whoo!

933
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:19,220
Huh?

934
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,100
Huh?

935
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,300
Yeah, okay, fine.

936
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:21,660
All right.

937
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,320
Anyway.

938
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,220
All right, you, what's your name?

939
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:25,180
Segan.

940
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,180
Segan?

941
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,040
Carefully reach into the toolbox of death and grab me a nail.

942
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,520
All right, examine that nail carefully, make sure it is indeed a real nail.

943
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,880
Make sure it does not bend, doesn't fold, doesn't retract,

944
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:38,940
doesn't telescope inside of itself.

945
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,280
As far as you can tell, is that indeed one genuine 20-penny spike?

946
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,200
Is it real, ma'am?

947
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:45,140
Yes.

948
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:46,440
Yes!

949
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,380
Wait, wait, wait.

950
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,440
Do you have any question?

951
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,000
I'm going to ask you a question of your perception of reality at this time.

952
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,200
Yes, more or less.

953
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,240
Okay, very good.

954
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,740
I was going to say, your pupils are like this fucking big, you know.

955
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,360
They're like the saucers that didn't take me away again.

956
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,980
All right, now, if you would, hand the nail back to me.

957
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,000
Now, no offense to you, sterilization is very important.

958
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,980
If you thought the odds were bad, trust me, the teens are going to be a fuck of a lot worse.

959
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,860
Although people are not vaccinating at all.

960
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:26,780
And now, ladies and genitalia, examine carefully as I, Andrew the Impaled, attempt to take

961
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:35,500
this very real 20-penny spike and hammer it directly into my fucking face!

962
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,260
Oh my God.

963
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,380
No, God can't help you here.

964
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,540
No, no, no, no, no.

965
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,680
He won't come to any of my shows.

966
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,200
Not since an incident in 1983.

967
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,740
He won't come anywhere near me.

968
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,640
Not with a 20-foot fucking clown God pull.

969
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,260
All right, here we go.

970
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:58,020
I did say, I did say, all the way into my face.

971
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,880
And all the way is a promise that I can deliver on.

972
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,260
Yeah.

973
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,740
All the way into my fucking face!

974
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,720
Jesse, this is the part where you applaud, people.

975
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,720
This is genuine highbrow entertainment here.

976
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,440
Genuine culture.

977
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:21,840
I mean, maybe, maybe you've never seen culture before, but trust me, there is some culture

978
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,800
in Pomeroy, and unfortunately, this is it.

979
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,400
Yeah, see, you can't even laugh at that, because you guys don't even fucking know where you

980
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:28,640
are.

981
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,960
All right, let me get this thing out of my head before I fucking lose it over all of

982
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,020
you.

983
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,560
And somebody might want to watch out during the extraction.

984
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,960
I sometimes tend to spew, and you're wearing nice clothes there.

985
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,420
I've heard Paul and I.

986
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:37,980
Very nice.

987
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,580
I'm joking, I'm joking, I'm joking.

988
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,300
Those are terrible fucking clothes.

989
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,160
How do you fucking leave the house with that shit?

990
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,800
Oh, that's fucking sad.

991
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:45,780
Oh, shit.

992
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,100
I'm sorry.

993
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:46,660
I'm sorry.

994
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:46,660


995
00:53:50,800 --> 00:54:05,600
Guys, hey, I wanted to point out to everybody that's watching the video here.

996
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,560
Anybody who is out here watching this video media soリ they know there may be something

997
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,140
that is a little strange.

998
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:08,200
There you go.

999
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,700
Check out what we've got in here.

1000
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,040
We've got debido on

1001
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,440
some...

1002
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:16,440


1003
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:16,440


1004
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,460
can tell the clown what to do. Until then, I'm trying

1005
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,580
to do something here!

1006
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,160
Hair man!

1007
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:24,540
You!

1008
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,600
Reach into the toolbox of death and grab me a screwdriver.

1009
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:32,700
Fuck please. You fucking shit.

1010
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,460
Examine that screwdriver

1011
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,660
carefully. Make sure it is indeed real. Make sure it does not

1012
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,600
bend, does not fold, does not

1013
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,540
retract. You might not want to touch

1014
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,100
that end.

1015
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,660
You can just stab into the stage if you want

1016
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,720
to check its validity any further.

1017
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,640
Hey, I'm not responsible.

1018
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,200
You have a moral compass.

1019
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,020
Stab it! Stab it!

1020
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,120
Is that a real screwdriver?

1021
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,260
All right.

1022
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,360
We won't make any further assumptions about your

1023
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,120
altered state.

1024
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,280
Once again, hand the screwdriver back to me.

1025
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,560
No offense.

1026
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,400
Like I said, sterilization is very important.

1027
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,080
I see the time.

1028
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,240
That's the people with whom you associate.

1029
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,260
And by that, I mean all of you.

1030
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:17,500
Fucking subgenius.

1031
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,440
And now...

1032
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,620
Fucking the screwdriver.

1033
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,580
I'm fucking my face.

1034
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:25,700
Yeah.

1035
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:27,680
Jesus.

1036
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,620
All the way into my fucking face!

1037
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,240
This is the part where you

1038
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,940
join the pain by beating one hand against

1039
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:37,080
another in self-appreciation for what you're seeing

1040
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,300
on the stage. All right, now shut up for a second

1041
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,940
because here's the thing. All right, here's the thing.

1042
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:41,940
This is the thing.

1043
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,000
Here's the thing.

1044
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,420
This is the thing.

1045
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,380
The thing is this.

1046
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,100
This is the thing.

1047
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,880
You see, at this point in time, the tip of the screwdriver

1048
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,620
is four inches all the way back into my fucking face,

1049
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,500
brushing against the medulla oblongata at the base of my brain.

1050
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,120
At the top of my spine.

1051
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,420
At the front of the back of my head.

1052
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,160
Yeah.

1053
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,840
And when I push that very small but very important part of the brain

1054
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,780
in and out and in and out and in and out and in and out.

1055
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,560
Twist it just so

1056
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,920
I can adjust the radio stations that I pick up on my fillings.

1057
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,320
Let's see if I can get this going here.

1058
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:18,740
Here.

1059
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,060
And it got it.

1060
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:20,640
A viva

1061
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:22,780
Los Angeli!

1062
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,400
No

1063
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:24,440
sleep

1064
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:25,860
till the morning light.

1065
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,960
My father yelled.

1066
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,900
He cried more than a field into my carpet ride.

1067
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,400
Well, you

1068
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,140
shook me all I need.

1069
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,140
It's just a little red Corbin.

1070
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,260
Baby, come back.

1071
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,400
Blame it all on me.

1072
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,060
And the boys don't cry.

1073
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,920
I am over.

1074
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:42,600
All right.

1075
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,480
I got to buy it before I start losing other shit.

1076
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,520
I really fucking weird.

1077
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,540
Oh, don't smile.

1078
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,480
Don't smile.

1079
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,000
You fucking ugly enough as it is.

1080
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:49,720
You fucks.

1081
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,400
Oh, yeah.

1082
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,540
Oh, that's completely beyond the limits of good taste.

1083
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,740
I apologize for that.

1084
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,040
But you know what?

1085
00:56:59,120 --> 00:56:59,940
You know what?

1086
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:00,500
Brain goo.

1087
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,540
Brain goo tastes like.

1088
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,940
Chicken brain goo.

1089
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:09,380
Anyway, you've been a great help.

1090
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:09,880
What's your name again?

1091
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:10,700
Sigan.

1092
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,680
Hey, everybody give a warm round of applause for the toolbox of death.

1093
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,260
Get off my stage, Sigan.

1094
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,580
You've been great, lovely, and wonderful, and helpful, and all that.

1095
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,640
All right.

1096
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:22,620
Good.

1097
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:23,500
Good.

1098
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,080
Take off your knickers.

1099
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:26,760
Good.

1100
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:34,580
Slip the brassiere off of your pendulous sagging old breasts.

1101
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:35,800
Good.

1102
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,360
Good.

1103
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:37,800
Good.

1104
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:37,820
Good.

1105
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:39,480
Good.

1106
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:39,480


1107
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:39,480


1108
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:39,480


1109
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:39,480


1110
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:39,480


1111
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:39,480


1112
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,620
Let me clean your teeth with my tongue.

1113
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:42,860
Good.

1114
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,080
Let me clean your armpits with my tongue.

1115
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:47,160
Good.

1116
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:47,920
Good.

1117
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,200
Good.

1118
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:49,680


1119
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,520
Let me clean your toes with my mouth.

1120
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:53,840
Good.

1121
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:54,460
Good.

1122
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,620
That was me, Reverend Stang on Bad Doctor's CD.

1123
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:05,820
And that is a lot of people's favorite of our old stuff, because it's so awful.

1124
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:06,880
It's just awful.

1125
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,720
You're crazy.

1126
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:07,800
Yeah.

1127
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,440
We were in the height of our craziness then, I believe.

1128
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:17,240
We were really into audience elimination, but like so many things, we failed.

1129
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:22,320
When we tried to eliminate the audience, it ended up being our most popular thing.

1130
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,580
Did we do Louie Louie, Are You a Girl or a Goat Woman on that one?

1131
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:30,640
I think that was on Doctors for Wotan 2, which is no longer in distribution.

1132
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:31,960
Oh, that's too bad.

1133
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:35,900
You've got to be really cool to get a copy of either Doctors for Wotan album.

1134
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:36,220
Yeah.

1135
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:38,920
Although I've got a CD of it in my car, I think.

1136
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,160
Anyway, this is Hour of Slack from Church of the Subgenius.

1137
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:50,940
You can know too much by looking at subgenius.com or quiveringbrain.com.

1138
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,560
That's Dr. Drummond's website, which has all kinds of filth and also really, really good music.

1139
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:01,440
Because Dr. Drummond was in a great band called the Swinging Love Corpses.

1140
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,260
There's not a lot of filth there, really.

1141
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:03,560
Huh?

1142
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,080
There's not a lot of filth there, really.

1143
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,200
Well, there is.

1144
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,280
In spirit, there is.

1145
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,600
In spirit and in some of the song content.

1146
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,560
And you've got solo albums on there, right?

1147
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:13,500
Yeah, solo albums.

1148
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:14,500
They'll scare you.

1149
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,760
Yeah, they'll scare you.

1150
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,380
Hideous, hideous.

1151
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:24,540
Well, and now to close this long show, a long six-fisted jam from X Day.

1152
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,580
It's a phone message jam.

1153
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:33,380
Ladies and gentlemen, yet another night of the multiple fists of conning.

1154
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:43,120
With special guests, Philo Drummond on random instruments.

1155
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,240
Scotty on drums.

1156
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:50,460
Suts Bashaw on guitar.

1157
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,220
Angry Larry on bass.

1158
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,100
He just waves.

1159
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:02,720
And Trademark G on lute.

1160
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,320
Oh, my God.

1161
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,020
Electric noise?

1162
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:05,320
Yes.

1163
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:15,500
And I'll probably ruin it with vocals at some point.

1164
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,760
And I'm Bruce's license.

1165
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,480
And I'll probably ruin it with vocals at some point.

1166
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,680
And I'm Bruce's license.

1167
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:39,400
And I'll probably ruin it with vocals at some point.

1168
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:39,400


1169
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:39,480
Let's do this.

1170
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:39,540


1171
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,280
Let's do this.

1172
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,240
Let's do this.

1173
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,260
Let's do this.

1174
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,500
Let's do this.

1175
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,500
Let's do this.

1176
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,940
Let's do this.

1177
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,080
Remember men!

1178
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:06,980
I'll close the music for you tonight.

1179
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:06,980


1180
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:12,000
As you turn it into a commercial song ...

1181
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,500
But I don't even remember songs yet.

1182
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:15,580
Yeah.

1183
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:18,640
That sounds 법 Johansson.

1184
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,540
Do you remember man?

1185
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:21,580


1186
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,000
Thank you.

1187
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:58,240
Thank you.

1188
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,940
Thank you.

1189
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,900
Thank you.

1190
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:33,960
Thank you.

1191
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,720
Thank you.

1192
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,100
Thank you.

1193
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,620
Thank you.

1194
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:22,560
Thank you.

1195
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,240
Hey, baby.

1196
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:30,440
Hi, baby.

1197
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,000
I'll be coming around to get you in a minute.

1198
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,140
Okay.

1199
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:45,020
Hey, baby, we'll be back around to get you in a minute.

1200
01:05:51,580 --> 01:06:03,240
Message number four. So much for Beltrides and other things. So, I'm off to see the Wizards.

1201
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,500
Wonderful, Wizard of Oz.

1202
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,640
Hope you're home tonight.

1203
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,780
Sire, there is no more money.

1204
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,220
We gotta get some money.

1205
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:20,060
That dirty Turkish harker backflagging Wharton Philip Buckaburton percoloma Burton doesn't wash tonight at all.

1206
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:31,320
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show, and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1207
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:36,320
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1208
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:50,940
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you, you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages.

1209
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:54,260
And help out financially as best you can.

1210
01:06:54,680 --> 01:07:02,260
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty, and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1211
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,200
But some of you still have jobs.

1212
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:12,040
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1213
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,500
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1214
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:20,700
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Stevejobs.

1215
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,280
If you don't pay Dobbs.

1216
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:28,780
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1217
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:41,240
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1218
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:46,480
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1219
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:07,440
We also take checks and money orders to

1220
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,440
Is sources available on site?

1221
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:08,520
Its

1222
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:11,360
Subliminal

1223
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:11,660

Have You And her Had, Love Us Love Her More, Sadose button isHSMicheal.netate,
