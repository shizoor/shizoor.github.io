1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
From PR News in Washington, I'm following PR's reports.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:11,920
The president of Mexico's top electoral court issued a report today that says America is significantly degraded and is still dangerous.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,360
On Wall Street, 7446-367-319.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,260
This is PR News.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,260
An Indonesian man on the resort island of Bali on October 1st last year.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,940
I'm sentenced to eight years in prison for harboring PR News in Washington.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,220
PR News, Washington.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,860
The alleged mastermind is still at large.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,620
Invisible poison gas.

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:46,620
I'd like to build the world a home and furnish it with the subgenius power of sweat.

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,700
Annihilating death rays.

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,660
And you shall be my first soldiers.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,300
He'd made you forget many things.

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:00:59,940
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,280
We are the supreme race.

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,580
We have the supreme weapons.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,100
That's Bob.

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,100
What do you mean you don't know him?

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,920
You know this man.

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes, sir.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,280
I've never seen that man before in my life.

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,520
But you know something?

23
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,940
He kind of looks like somebody, doesn't he?

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,280
Mr. Gerard, you have a friend named Bob.

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,760
Bob is just about my best friend in the world.

26
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,020
That's Bob.

27
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,440
Everybody needs shoes.

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
I'm a salesman.

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,700
It's sad.

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,180
You have a friend named Bob.

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,760
Bob?

32
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,140
Bob?

33
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,780
Besides, if you haven't done anything,

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,800
why are you upset that you don't get anything?

35
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,720
Welcome to Living On Bus.

36
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,080
My name is Lynn and I am your ho-ho-ho-ho.

37
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,500
Fabulous.

38
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,460
Well, let's do it.

39
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,700
What's really going on with people?

40
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,200
Sometimes I feel like a third.

41
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,380
A lot of times I don't know what I did.

42
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,700
Dogs are jealous of my back.

43
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,400
I threw up.

44
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,460
Freaked out.

45
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,200
All the time.

46
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,300
It just lit my fire.

47
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,920
No clue.

48
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,340
I was the sexuality expert.

49
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,320
Have no clue.

50
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,120
I do entertainment.

51
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,940
I do entertainment.

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,820
I'm dead.

53
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,280
I'm dead.

54
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:20,900
Unbelievable.

55
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,800
Self-centered.

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,740
I'm flabbergasted.

57
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,480
Self-centered.

58
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:23,900
Ignorant.

59
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,380
Low IQ.

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,400
Self-centeredness.

61
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:25,860
Weakness.

62
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,860
Some people criticize me for being so wrong.

63
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,340
Wrong.

64
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,560
Wrong.

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:28,860
Wrong.

66
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,300
Crap.

67
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,980
I'll do it.

68
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,480
I'll do it.

69
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,300
Seriously, I am in a closet.

70
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,540
In the closet.

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,300
Don't mean anything.

72
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,400
Hooked on phonics.

73
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,440
So did you ever shock up?

74
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:36,900
Yeah, I did.

75
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,740
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

76
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,300
You ask something of me and I'm out of here.

77
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,320
I got condemned as hate speech, suggesting that people murder me.

78
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:42,740
The sack.

79
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,240
Yeah.

80
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,980
You got big feet.

81
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,820
I can be touched.

82
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,220
Dick, dick feelings.

83
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,420
Dick, open the door and come in, come in.

84
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:04,880
The sullen, deep, mysterious, violent, deathly, creeping, monstrous, formless character in my mind.

85
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,180
Bob?

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,920
Bob is in my mind, my friends, and in Lee Murr's mind.

87
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,580
Fernanda Dende Lee Murr did half of those previous cut-ups we've been listening to,

88
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,280
although Norell Preff did the Ann Coulter, if that's who that is.

89
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,980
Yes, he did Ann Coulter.

90
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,940
And Buddy Morrow did the Bob, Pitt, and the Pendulum business there.

91
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,160
This is Hour of Slack number 1064.

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:48,040
And we're making use of subgenius-y tracks which directly unmask the conspiracy.

93
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:55,560
But before we go into that, let's go down to the Garden of Eden with Fat Harry White.

94
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,960
Mm.

95
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,300
Aargh.

96
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,740
Aaaargh.

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,680
Aaaargh.

98
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,900
Aaaargh.

99
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,880
Aaaargh.

100
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,580
Hey, baby, you be Eve, and I'll be your Adam.

101
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,840
Together, we'll taste the forbidden fruits of love in the Garden of Eden.

102
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,040
Yeah.

103
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,640
Aye!

104
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,540
I've been talking about Garden of Eden and all that.

105
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,260
I was talking to my old mate Bob the Gardener the other day.

106
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,780
Now, Bob tends to work mainly on the sloping hills of the York, Cessna, Shire Dales, right?

107
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,740
And he's probably the most talked about uphill gardener in the area.

108
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,560
Anyway, we were talking about smoking, actually.

109
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,160
Now, Bob's a heavy smoker, but I've not smoked a fag for years.

110
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,880
I'm not kidding. Last time I had a puff was about ten years ago.

111
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,300
I'll never forget it. It was in my bedroom on New Year's Eve.

112
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,780
I remember deciding to give him up and thinking,

113
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,160
Hey, I wonder if I'll ever taste one again.

114
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,080
Tell you what, not touched one since.

115
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,600
Now, Bob mainly smokes roll-ups with the cheapest tobacco he can buy.

116
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,080
But on special occasions, he always treats himself to a good rough shag.

117
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,600
Then, you know, sometimes he'll have the occasional 20 Super Kings.

118
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,640
He said he sometimes has a sneaky one in the bath when his wife Anne is in bed.

119
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,280
He just lies back in the bubbles, gets his king size out and pulls on it slowly.

120
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,340
Oh, better.

121
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,300
Not that his wife would mind, because she's a heavy smoker too.

122
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,660
She smokes up to 60 cigarettes a day.

123
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,520
She told me about a time once, about three years ago, when Bob tried to give her one on the back of his moped.

124
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,480
Just as he was about to put it between the lips, it came off by the pelican crossing, you know.

125
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,460
Anyway, I mean, smoking is bad for you. I advise you not to do it, you know.

126
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,200
But I mean, I like talking to Bob because I'm interested in gardening, you know.

127
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,320
In fact, I was in the back garden with Fat Aria, you know, the bread knife, the other night.

128
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,760
And she suggested, you know, I'd like to have a smoke.

129
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:54,760


130
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,860
And we built an ornamental pond in our garden.

131
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,800
Well, I told her, it's a great idea, it's a great idea, it's a great idea.

132
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,980
I mean, not only would it become the main feature of our garden, but I thought it'd be handy to stick some fish in there, which we could eat.

133
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,340
You know, like a couple of dozen trout, maybe the odd school of salmon.

134
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,080
Frogs even, you know, they're a nice delicacy, aren't they?

135
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,200
Hot straight onto the barbecue.

136
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,140
Anyway, right, me old mate Fat Larry gave me the idea.

137
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,520
He keeps trout in his pond.

138
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,560
I'll never forget the last time I was in his garden.

139
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,800
I was stood by the water's edge when I asked him if he'd give me one.

140
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,420
Ooh, talk about fresh.

141
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,020
No sooner had I asked him when he thrust this nine-inch slippery specimen into me hand.

142
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,440
Tell you what, I hadn't expected him to whip it out there and then.

143
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,620
I'm worried it would leave a slimy mess on me car coat.

144
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,320
I immediately tossed it off.

145
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,180
Anyway, when it came to our pond, I had a big question for Harriet.

146
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,220
I walked round the garden with her and asked her where, you know, she wanted me to stick it.

147
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,760
She said she fancied having it in the middle of the garden.

148
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,460
I said, I'd stick it under the lawn so all the neighbours could see.

149
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,360
Now, truth be known, I thought they might think we were showing off.

150
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,220
So I suggested we have a little one behind the greenhouse.

151
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,420
Well, after a little bit of persuasion, she agreed to it.

152
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,960
She said she didn't mind it being little as long as it was good and deep, you know.

153
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,440
Well, I grabbed hold of my trusty spade and said, no problemo.

154
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,720
And promptly set about getting on the job with my old tool clutched firmly in both hands.

155
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,500
It's not a new model, but though I say so myself,

156
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,640
I'm not sure I'd be able to get it out of the way.

157
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,740
Anyway, the pond was a great success.

158
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,920
The final touch was the three-foot ornamental bird that stuck in the middle.

159
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,840
I'm not kidding.

160
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,260
Everyone who calls always comments when they see the huge stalk I have on display.

161
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,820
Oh, yeah.

162
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,260
Come on down to the Garden of Eden, God's own garden of love.

163
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,460
I am your apostle of Amore.

164
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,740
We'll see you then.

165
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,140
Bye.

166
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,620
A fat, hairy white there from his album.

167
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,380
Mmm, baby.

168
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,300
And now, lie girls.

169
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,300
Feeling lonely?

170
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,140
Terrified?

171
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,640
Isolated from the world community?

172
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,760
Call now.

173
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,740
Real girls are standing by to tell you exactly what you want to hear.

174
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,940
Major combat operations in Iraq have ended.

175
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,040
The economy is growing bigger and bigger.

176
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,220
It's so big.

177
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,600
Our girls are dirty and nasty and completely shameless.

178
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,120
America is safer.

179
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,960
Terrorists are going to kill you.

180
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,740
Call now to enter our fantasy world of spin.

181
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,680
We will leave no child behind.

182
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,340
Clear skies.

183
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,260
Healthy borders.

184
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,220
Culture of life.

185
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,480
We're the coalition of the willing.

186
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,900
Hey, you forgot Poland.

187
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,840
They'll be anything you want them to be.

188
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,880
I'm the war president.

189
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,860
I'm the peace president.

190
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,120
I'm a uniter.

191
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,340
Not a divider.

192
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,960
I'm a cowboy.

193
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,800
And they'll say just about anything.

194
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,100
The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons.

195
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,960
Mission accomplished.

196
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,360
Call now.

197
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,080
Lie Girls is where that commercial came from.

198
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,720
And you can actually download that at liegirls.com.

199
00:09:52,740 --> 00:10:01,040
Next, Norel Gref followed by Little Abner meets the Goodyear Pimps.

200
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,140
And the Rudy Schwartz Project, which is also what's heard in the background music right now.

201
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,360
Tope Mobile beats Hot Theology.

202
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,740
I'm against America.

203
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,320
Tope Mobile beats Hot Theology.

204
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,620
Who first blew this CIA operative bush visiting a school in Sarasota, Florida?

205
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,860
September 8, 2000.

206
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,460
This nation will forget.

207
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,320
Tope Mobile beats Hot Theology.

208
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,500
Just as I stood up and turned,

209
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,860
forces didn't find weapons of mass destruction.

210
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,320
The administration knew it was all bogus.

211
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,700
Team Bush found nothing.

212
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,540
President Dick Cheney says there may be no evidence.

213
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,700
Dance, dance, dance, dance on Meet the Press.

214
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,340
Tope Mobile beats Hot Theology.

215
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,300
Tope Mobile beats Hot Theology.

216
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,540
Uh, Trump.

217
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:51,600


218
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,060
Hard not, uh, think about.

219
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,580
Think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think.

220
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,840
And, uh, would like to inflict the same kind of damage again.

221
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,280
Con-con-con-con-continue to hurt.

222
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,660
Continue to hurt.

223
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,440
Thank you.

224
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,320
Tope Mobile beats Hot Theology.

225
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,340
Tope Mobile beats Hot Theology.

226
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,500
And there was just this tremendous explosion.

227
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,180
One.

228
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,140
Trouble's at home.

229
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,120
Uh, a ball of fire came from, uh, behind me.

230
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,700
Direct hit.

231
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,100
Direct hit.

232
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,880
Thank you for the great disappointments.

233
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,260
Don't show your face here.

234
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,620
The government is tipsy.

235
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,400
Significant quantities of uranium.

236
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:21,940
Huh?

237
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,420
Too Radiant.

238
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:26,420


239
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,380
Tope Mobile beats Hot Theology.

240
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,380
Tope Mobile beats Hot Theology.

241
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,940
Bob is better off today.

242
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,440
Bob is better off today.

243
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,340
Tope Mobile beats Hot Theology.

244
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,300
Tope Mobile beats Hot Theology.

245
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,720
Beats ProAN.

246
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,220
D given.

247
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,040
deceasedindian.

248
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,540
When we continue to forget.

249
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,500
We will forget.

250
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,220
Of times forget.

251
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,460
We will

252
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,280
Do touched.

253
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,180
Perfect Enchilada.

254
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,280
And my beloved constituents of Dogpatch.

255
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:03,280
I could stand here and bask in the sunshine of your warm greeting forever.

256
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,600
Bask on your own time, Fogbound.

257
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,900
Yeah, get to the point, get to the point.

258
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,840
I bet you all wonder what I've been doing down in Washington these last 18 years.

259
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,760
We didn't care just so long as you was there and we was here.

260
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,740
Why?

261
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,600
Senator, tell them what you done done for us down there in Washington.

262
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,580
I done got the United States Senate to pass the Jackass Fogbound Bill.

263
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,020
There's no jackass like our jackass.

264
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,540
Through my efforts, little old Dogpatch,

265
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,680
obscure, unknown, poverty-stricken Dogpatch is going to be world famous.

266
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,160
And just what foe is we going to be famous foe? What foe?

267
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,540
You is going to save the lifeblood.

268
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,940
Of a vigorous, thriving American industry. And that's what foe.

269
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,980
And what industry is that, Senator?

270
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,720
My boy, a glorious young industry.

271
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,200
Devoted solely to the stimulation and relaxation so necessary for the American businessman.

272
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,940
An industry known as Las Vegas.

273
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,520
And that is why the Jackass Fogbound Committee has been chosen.

274
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,200
To find a new place to test them atom bombs and guided missiles?

275
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,420
Yes, sir.

276
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,720
Some place we can blow off the face of the earth.

277
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,200
Some spot that ain't never going to be missed.

278
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,720
In fact, the most unnecessary place in the whole USA.

279
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,060
Well, I'll be darned. How about that?

280
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,260
And I now has the honor and the privilege of announcing that after a four-year government survey

281
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,680
of all the no-good, no-account, unnecessary places in this whole country,

282
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,180
you has been selected as the most unnecessary of all.

283
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,340
Now, pay attention, you lovable citizens.

284
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,660
You all is going to be moved out of here by order of the United States government.

285
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,020
And here's the fine government scientist who will supervise your evacuation.

286
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,000
Citizens, meet Dr. Rasmussen T. Finsdale.

287
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,220
Friends, friends, we intend to move you from Dogpatch to a necessary place in our society.

288
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,340
Now, the first detonation will be on Wednesday.

289
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,600
But the evacuation will start immediately.

290
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,580
So good luck and thank you.

291
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,180
Thank you.

292
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:30,620
And so, my dear constituents, as I bid you farewell, I beg you, don't let me down.

293
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:36,780
Just remember, your government is spending one million dollars on one bomb

294
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,080
just to blow your homes off the face of the earth.

295
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,860
So show your appreciation.

296
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,900
Don't let Baker drag off in a pool of youth.

297
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,720
Don't let Baker drag off in a pool of youth.

298
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,600
Don't let Baker drag off in a pool of youth.

299
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,420
Of all the very ordinary, most unloved, unnecessary places on this earth,

300
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,540
they send on yours, they send on yours,

301
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,680
that show's your bull, they send on yours.

302
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,860
Dogpatch.

303
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,200
The greatest waste in the world is what you are.

304
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,460
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.

305
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,540
I keep a close watch

306
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,480
Watch this heart of mine.

307
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,220
Frankly, I didn't contemplate it.

308
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,020
If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.

309
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,200
Frankly, I'll be honest with you, I don't have any idea.

310
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:35,320
If I wanted to kill somebody, I'd take this book and beat you to death with it, and I wouldn't feel a thing.

311
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,780
Either you take care of him, or we will.

312
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,360
I mean, I'm sick. I mean, I'm sick. I mean, I'm sick.

313
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,500
It's a comedy. It's a comedy tragedy.

314
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,980
They don't protect us from killers.

315
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,600
They hurt us again. They want to hurt us again.

316
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,140
Now you do what I say.

317
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,400
Destroyed lives and put them in mass graves and had torture rooms.

318
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,140
It's good. It's good.

319
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,920
A long time ago, being crazy meant something. Nowadays, everybody's crazy.

320
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,500
Well, tell us about Washington, son.

321
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,460
Is it run by a bunch of crooks?

322
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,940
No, sir, Pappy.

323
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,780
And Washington's a rot-purdy town.

324
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why, everything's made out of big old white marble,

325
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,800
and you can't hardly spit without your hit.

326
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,700
A national shrine.

327
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,020
Right, Sam?

328
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,260
I ought to know, because I let go of a charred tobacco in a strong wind.

329
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,140
It ricocheted around the Washington Monument,

330
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,860
flew past old Abe Lincoln, and come to rest on Jefferson's Dome.

331
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,580
Thank heaven it didn't hit none of the Confederacy.

332
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,400
Sam got a five-dollar fine.

333
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,480
They got law up there that says you can't deface a national shrine.

334
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,240
The labor-wrecking monuments of opulence

335
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,900
and their own image in your village.

336
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,620
They rape and pillage. Ain't a wrinkle in that three-piece suit.

337
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,420
They don't bang up number at a nearly around summer.

338
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,800
Hunger's not a problem unless, of course, it's you.

339
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,040
There's plenty of distractions to harness your reaction.

340
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,800
There are many little factions to keep you subdued.

341
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,500
And the lines are always long, and there's always something wrong.

342
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,240
Yeah, and they always extra smug and try to blame it on you.

343
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,080
Ooh, they do a damn good job of running things.

344
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,760
Running things.

345
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,760
I said my ooh, they do a damn good job of running things.

346
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,300
Running things.

347
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,220
I said my ooh-ooh, they do a damn good job of running things.

348
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,220


349
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,780
I said my ooh-ooh, they do a damn good job.

350
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,960
I said my ooh-ooh, they do a damn good job of running things.

351
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,800
Well, never mind about defacing no national shrine, son.

352
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,340
Tell us about the government.

353
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,000
All them crooks.

354
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,760
Well, there ain't no crooks up there, Pappy.

355
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,240
As far as I can see, there's a very nice mess of people.

356
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,880
And I can tell you all this much.

357
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,860
The country's doing just fine.

358
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,680
Right, Sam?

359
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,000
You is so right, boy.

360
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,000
Them city folks and weans are pretty much alike.

361
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,900
Oh, they ain't used to living in the sticks.

362
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,600
Politics.

363
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,660
We don't like stone or cement.

364
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,200
But we is in agreement.

365
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,860
When we gets down to talking politics,

366
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,100
the country's in the very best of hands.

367
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,360
The best of hands.

368
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,780
The best of hands.

369
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,040
The Treasury says the national debt is climbing to the sky.

370
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,540
And government expenditures have never been so high.

371
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,880
It makes a fella cry.

372
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,920
Get a gleam of pride within his eye.

373
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,560
To see how our economy expands.

374
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,800
The country's in the very best of hands.

375
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,260
They always silence voices of dissent, regardless of intent.

376
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,820
They get particularly upset with individuals who speak truth.

377
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,140
Your voice is never counted.

378
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,600
If fans are butts about it, oh, you can shout it.

379
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,260
They'll discredit or shoot you, too.

380
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,880
When they incarcerate more people than any other nation and take vacations while inflation makes it hard to buy food, clothing, and shopping.

381
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:41,880


382
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:41,880


383
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:41,880


384
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:41,880


385
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,340
They're not the only ones who are getting paid for their work.

386
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,380
There's fucking things off kilter.

387
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,340
So fuck them all.

388
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,260
I pledge allegiance to me and you.

389
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,380
They do a damn good job of running things.

390
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,080
Running things.

391
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,620
I say now.

392
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,760
They do a damn good job of running things.

393
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,420
The country's in the very best of hands.

394
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,580
The best of hands.

395
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,240
The best of hands.

396
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,860
The farm bill should be 89% of parity.

397
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,700
Parity, another fella recommends it should be 93.

398
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,080
But 80, 95 percent, who cares about degree?

399
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,900
It's parity that no one understands.

400
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,320
The country's in the very best of hands.

401
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,460
Running thanks, I say now, ooh, ooh, ooh.

402
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,160
They do a damn good job, a damn good job.

403
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,880
They do a damn good job, I say now, ooh, ooh, ooh.

404
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,460
They do a damn good job of running thanks.

405
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:38,980
Running thanks.

406
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,580
They bring the drugs into the country, smuggle, cook, and sell crack.

407
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,060
That's a fact, it's a trap, and anyone that you ask will tell you.

408
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,960
Now, if you show them your passport, some personal stash,

409
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,480
they'll make you take off your shoes and get a dog to smell you.

410
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,480
But then your doctor slash dealer peddles dope to the fiends.

411
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,420
He swears his claim, prescribes it out to the mainstream.

412
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,020
Now, if you look, it's pretty easy to see.

413
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,780
And if you listen rather close, I think you'll know what I mean.

414
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,300
Agree?

415
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,080
Us voters is connected to the nominee.

416
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,720
The nominee's connected to the treasury.

417
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:14,660
When he ain't connected to the treasury, he sits around in his thigh bones.

418
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,000
They sits around in this place they got.

419
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,660
This big congressional parking lot.

420
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,420
Just sits around in there, you know what?

421
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,140
Up there they calls it a thigh bone.

422
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:36,380
Them bones, them bones gonna rise again, gonna exercise a franchise again, gonna tax us up to our eyes again.

423
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,420
When it gets them off of their thigh bones.

424
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,620
The country's in the very best of hands.

425
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,840
The best of hands.

426
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,440
The best of hands.

427
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,240
Them GOP's and Democrats, each hates the other one.

428
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,840
They's always criticizing how the country should be run.

429
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,400
But neither tells the public what the other's gone and done.

430
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,120
As long as no one knows where no one stands.

431
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,440
As long as no one knows where no one stands.

432
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,520
The country's in the very best of hands.

433
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,140
They do a damn good job of running things.

434
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,800
Running things.

435
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,560
I said ooo Oh, they do a damn good job of running things.

436
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,160
Running things.

437
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,320
They do a damn good job, a damn good job.

438
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,820
They do a damn good job.

439
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,340
They do a damn good job of running things.

440
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,060
Running things.

441
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,040
The money that they taxes us on for that?

442
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,040


443
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,320
Taxes us!

444
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,700
us that's known as revenues.

445
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,580
They compound the collateral, subtracts the residues.

446
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,080
Don't worry about the principal and interest that accrues.

447
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,860
They're shipping all that stuff to foreign lands.

448
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,500
The country's in the very best of hands.

449
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:37,180
The country's in the very best of hands.

450
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,700
I'll take a drink.

451
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,340
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

452
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,240
Who spends Sunday morning praising in church,

453
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,340
then bans from the touchdown when he's doing God's work?

454
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,020
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

455
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,900
Lift your conlandry, won't you come out tonight?

456
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,240
With your cowboys in heat and sweet Jesus inside.

457
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,100
Scrum fish on pick-up trucks,

458
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,260
who could it be?

459
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,680
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

460
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,200
Who dance around naked with long dangling meat?

461
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,600
Down at the schoolyard, let the girls get a pee.

462
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,320
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

463
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,620
Who says he's sorry for what he's done?

464
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,840
For being pre-birded and flashing his buns?

465
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,420
He's a good ball player.

466
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,300
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

467
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,600
He has a good rod church,

468
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,160
Stavro King, the governor of the state.

469
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,220
Illegal abortions, and white bread to eat.

470
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,500
Ask Jimmy Creighton, you happen to say

471
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,620
about the Dallas Cowboys, Jesus and me.

472
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,400
I just want to kill for God.

473
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,760
I just want to kill for God.

474
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,160
I just want to kill for God.

475
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,260
I just want to kill for God.

476
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,820
I just want to kill

477
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:16,860
Who made roly-poly, roly-poly, roly-poly

478
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,740
Hot dang, it's spicy cheese ball

479
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,540
Let all them friends and neighbors come a-calling

480
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,820
Cause anything's good if it sits on a wrist

481
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,260
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus, the beast

482
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,400
What kind of thing is it what's got one head like Andrea Dworkin?

483
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,080
The other head like Bob Tilton

484
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,460
And two scoops of raisins

485
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,060
Cause that's the only way he could get it to

486
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,900
Sit up straight at the golden table

487
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,140
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus, the beast

488
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,980
Yip-de-tum-lun-dry, won't you come out tonight

489
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,460
Put your hair up in curlers before your nipple rings fly

490
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,600
Stretch your urethra around the sycamore tree

491
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,160
The Dallas Cowboys

492
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,320
The Dallas Cowboys, Jesus, the beast

493
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,800
Yip-de-tum-lun-dry, won't you come out tonight

494
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,240
Put your hair up in curlers before your nipple rings tie

495
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,380
Stretch your urethra around the sycamore tree

496
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,700

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,720
Me, Jesus, and me

499
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,540

00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,680
Dallas Cowboys, Jesus, and me.

502
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,420
That's one of my favorite songs.

503
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,680
And Rudy Schwartz music is also in the background of this

504
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,580
from his album Gunther...

505
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,880
Uh, what is it?

506
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,600
Gunther Pops a Stiffy or something like that.

507
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,640

00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,420
Welcome to America, welcome to America

528
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,880
Hey George, welcome to America

529
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,660
Hey George, welcome to America

530
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,000
We never thought you'd get here

531
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,880
Just John did that lovely song, George Allen, Welcome to America

532
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,380
You can download more of Just John's music from the website at www.justjohn.com

533
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:50,660
And now, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, working with Norell Pref.

534
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,700
Puerto Ricans are the same thing as Cubans, I mean, they are all very hot, they are all

535
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,200
very hot, hot, hot, hot.

536
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,380
They have the, you know, the black blood in them, and part of the, you know, the blood

537
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,380


538
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,240
in them, hot, hot, hot.

539
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,480
And the fact is that the, the, the, the, the, I have this kind of comments in my house by

540
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,020
my kids.

541
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,260
Hot, hot, hot.

542
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,660
Puerto Ricans are the same thing as Cubans, I mean, they are all very hot, they are all

543
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,400
very hot.

544
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,380
Womanizing.

545
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,160
Hot, hot, hot.

546
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,660
Arnold Schwarzenegger is a girly man.

547
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,080
I didn't like it any better than a fan dancer likes a wind tunnel.

548
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,060
Well, things were beginning to move like a hula dancer with a hot foot.

549
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,800
Well, the whole thing blew up like a hoop skirt in the high wind.

550
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,380
Now there were two guys with their mouths open.

551
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,660
That's not funny.

552
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,380
Well, the payoff's about the same.

553
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:56,860
It's bad.

554
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,660
That's bad.

555
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,880
What difference does it make?

556
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,160
If I wanted to know what you thought, I'd give you a rectal exam.

557
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,260
What's that?

558
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,160
Can you see any need for human beings and other such things that make for unhappiness?

559
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,340
Of course not.

560
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,800
You see, when people try to understand each other, they find it's really quarreling and

561
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,360
name calling.

562
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,240
Honest it is.

563
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,080
Well, that gives us an opportunity to sell you something that's bigger than anything

564
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,660
you can buy.

565
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,520
The Self Genius.

566
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,540
For obvious reasons.

567
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,620
Bob.

568
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,120
I'm not a genius.

569
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,120


570
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,120


571
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,120


572
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,120


573
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,120


574
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,120


575
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,120


576
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,120


577
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,120
That doesn't look like me at all.

578
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,000
If you were turned inside out, that would be...

579
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,680
Apparently, Bob came and did something with all of us.

580
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,200
Praise the Father!

581
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,280
Quiet, I'm Scovett.

582
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,880
I'm broadcasting.

583
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,620
Lay your hands on the radio!

584
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,140
Lay your hands on the radio!

585
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,280
They're in the home and they're going to look to God!

586
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,540
It's not a nightmare that's going to end.

587
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,400
It's just beginning because it's inside me.

588
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,780
You have to love Bob.

589
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,740
I've got a feeling that I'm going to be a hero.

590
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:01,740


591
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:01,740


592
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:01,740


593
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:01,740


594
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:01,740


595
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:01,740


596
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:01,740


597
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,680
He loves you, but you love Bob.

598
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,800
You have to.

599
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,540
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

600
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,480
He'll kill you.

601
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,220
He'll bob you out.

602
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,440
Right now, I will give you all my money.

603
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,200
Bob, Bob.

604
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,380
Bob, Bob.

605
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,740
Bob, Bob.

606
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,240
Bob, Bob.

607
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:29,620
Bob, Bob.

608
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,520
Bob, Bob.

609
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,140
Bob, Bob.

610
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,700
Bob, Bob.

611
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,980
Bob, Bob.

612
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,080
Bob, Bob.

613
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,340
Bob, Bob.

614
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,880
Bob, Bob.

615
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,960
Why don't you just leave me alone?

616
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,140
I never saw anything.

617
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,440
I don't know what Mars is and I was never there.

618
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,560
Stop!

619
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,400
Stop!

620
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,760
Hey, stop!

621
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,040
Shut up!

622
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,040
You shut up!

623
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,500
Hey, stop!

624
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,240
Shut up!

625
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,700
Shut up!

626
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,540
Shut up!

627
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,640
Attention.

628
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,500
attention.

629
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,700
Attention.

630
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,140
Attention.

631
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,380
Attention

632
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,600
Who are the overlords of the UFO?

633
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,360
Attention

634
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,340
Attention

635
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,540
Look, if he starts this thing, he won't be able to stop it.

636
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,740
It's immortality.

637
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,820
For the price more costly than death.

638
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:21,680
Attention

639
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,580
The world stops spinning and the clock stops moving.

640
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:33,020
But something's still ticking and wearing on the inside.

641
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,560
Attention

642
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,940
And every time you let it go like I'm doing right now,

643
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,340
you can feel the wear.

644
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,940
I know from 342 years of experience that

645
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,420
time control can only go awry.

646
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,860
The Third World War might begin any minute and we'll all be killed.

647
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,940
Why should we bother about giant turtles?

648
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,680
Yes, maybe you're right.

649
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,960
I know how much you love your turtles.

650
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,520
But there are other things in life just as important.

651
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,840
Like having friends.

652
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,100
Our ancient legends did mention fire-eating turtles.

653
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:30,940
I did that, dear friends, using Reverend Rosna's recordings of everyone at 9X Day saying the word Bob.

654
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:38,340
It also had Byron Werner's recording of all the subgeniuses in 1982 saying Bob.

655
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:42,140
And the Bobs from the movie What About Bob?

656
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,160
The music was actually put together by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

657
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,920
And before that, we heard...

658
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:47,920


659
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,440
Lots of Lee Murr.

660
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:59,340
I should mention at this point that I am teaching a course on the history of the Church of the Subgenius

661
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:05,920
and how to run your own mind control cult, Do's and Don'ts.

662
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:12,560
I'm doing this online with a group called Maybe Logic Academy.

663
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,660
And if you're interested in that, you can find the details at

664
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:17,900
MaybeLogic.com

665
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,960
MaybeLogic.org

666
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:27,860
MaybeLogic are the people that put together a really wonderful feature film about Robert Anton Wilson

667
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,800
called MaybeLogic.

668
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,900
So, just...

669
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:38,840
They have this whole academy of weird hipsters teaching online courses.

670
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:47,140
And you might want to look at what's available there online at MaybeLogic.org.

671
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,680
So, now...

672
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,000
If you have any question in the comments, leave them in the comments and I'll answer

673
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,000


674
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,320
And if you have left any comment at this time, I'll do a review of it, and then 68 Degrees

675
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:53,320


676
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:14,980
So, grab a Snuffbox.

677
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,880
If you have any questions up to this point, feel free to leave a reply to me.

678
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:22,760
Thank you.

679
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,080
Thank you.

680
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:21,740
Thank you.

681
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,220
Thank you.

682
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,060
Thank you.

683
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,960
Thank you.

684
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,740
Thank you.

685
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:18,740


686
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,220
Let it rip, boys.

687
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,160
Hey, Blackie,

688
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,380
any more babes in there?

689
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,420
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

690
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,400
Shut up!

691
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,700
From PR News in Washington, I'm trying to

692
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,680
murder former housing secretaries in

693
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,660
several states, and in Arizona

694
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,640
retiring Senator Paul Sarbanes

695
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,540
plummeted to earth.

696
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,720
Wall Street down 4 off 9.

697
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,160
This is PR News.

698
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,520
President Bush is calling on voters to intensify

699
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,580
their resistance against the United States

700
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,060
after an unclaimed black

701
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,580
backberry pack spoke to PR News in Washington.

702
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,880
Children's literature. Cult, cult, cult, cult.

703
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,500
How does it happen? Fairy kingdom, we're in

704
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,960
fairy kingdom, we're in. I think we've all had dreams.

705
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,060
And giving up is the ultimate. The power of positive thinking.

706
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,720
Focus on what you don't have. Focus on how things are not how you want them to be.

707
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,320
Nothing in the environment supports you. Pain.

708
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,340
Pleasure. Pain. Settle for mediocre

709
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,020
lives. It's so easy, isn't it?

710
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,180
Why even try? You felt so jaded? Why even try?

711
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,080
Why even do this? Watch your coffee. Pain.

712
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,280
Besides the media, what else is there? Don't get too

713
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,380
excited. Don't get too happy. Don't expect too much. Be negative.

714
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,220
Look for what's wrong. Try to find something wrong

715
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,920
in advance. Growing wild. Why even try?

716
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,520
The 80s were the years of excess. We were greedy and gluttonous.

717
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,200
And as long as we wore stark shirts, we could

718
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,800
belch at the dinner table. What a wonderful party.

719
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,840
How unbelievably egotistical. Ego. That's absurd.

720
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,020
What's the problem? What do I mean? Work, work, work, work. Hey, hey.

721
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,120
You're gonna screw up. You're gonna be negative. You're gonna

722
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,140
make poor decisions. You're gonna say things you shouldn't say, do

723
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,840
things you shouldn't do, mess up like you shouldn't mess up.

724
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,040
Develop the habit of using the F word. Fail. Fail.

725
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,840
PR. PR. Think about it.

726
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,940
Experience the mediocre. Have good reason to despair.

727
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,800
Ignorance is bliss. People are being laid off.

728
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,800
It looks like a very scary thing. You get to live in fear.

729
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,740
Work, work, work, work, work, work, work. Pretty soon you'll fear.

730
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,800
Seek out and surround yourself with fear.

731
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,080
Give up.

732
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,800
Send today at

733
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,000
235.

734
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,660
AM.

735
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,740
Really don't care about the Middle East.

736
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,600
Lebanon goes on and on.

737
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,280
Michael Jackson's strange reactions

738
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,620
interest me in the least.

739
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,280
Could care less about Jennifer Aniston.

740
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,700
Don't even know who she is.

741
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,280
Or the latest Economic Index news.

742
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,020
Or whether Gibson hates the Jews.

743
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,320
Don't worry about any impact

744
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,980
at the pump or stump speeches

745
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,380
about welfare leeches or who's being replaced

746
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,140
on The View.

747
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,120
And I'm tired of Tom Cruise

748
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,580
and how much his latest

749
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,200
blockbuster has made

750
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,760
and Johnny Depp and all the rest

751
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,200
and just who is getting laid by whom

752
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,460
and corporate copyright

753
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,940
warfare and global

754
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,720
fucking warming or

755
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,020
child molesters publicly arrested

756
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,720
to give the rest of us a warning.

757
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,620
Don't need your flag-waving

758
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,580
number one war-winning ways

759
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,520
grinning hideously

760
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,480
and fastidiously patriotic

761
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:09,940
displays.

762
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,180
Just fuck you and the vultures of your

763
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,440
hateful culture war.

764
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,640
Fuck David Letterman

765
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,340
and then again all his late-night

766
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,440
talk show whores.

767
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,700
Fuck your monkey-minded

768
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,060
war-mongering profit-based schemes.

769
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,040
Your psychology,

770
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,280
your Scientology

771
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,740
and your secret 9-11 conspiracies.

772
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,100
And the latest small studies

773
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,540
transmitting their dread.

774
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,060
And a billion anxious distractions

775
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,580
filling up my head.

776
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,280
Shiny objects of mollification

777
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,320
and the shallow-headed

778
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,900
deification of empty

779
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:44,560
and empty.

780
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:44,560


781
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:44,560


782
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,040
And hollow American idols

783
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,540
that you worship and praise

784
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,440
with your very attention.

785
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,040
Is there anything else that I forgot to mention?

786
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,480
No.

787
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,080
Just trying to keep my own little

788
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,800
mental world in line

789
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,500
just like everybody else.

790
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,560
Grateful for the soap,

791
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,700
for toothpaste and four walls

792
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,080
and a bed and a warm dry place to crap

793
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,140
and talcum powder on my balls.

794
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,340
Grateful for the pill that stops my acid reflux

795
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,520
and grateful for deodorant

796
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,580
and for friends and clothes and care.

797
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,740
Grateful I've still got my hair and nose.

798
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,080
Grateful for a functioning body.

799
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,500
Grateful for food and bones and blood.

800
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,840
Grateful for the ability to walk and talk

801
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,920
and live and move and breathe.

802
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,640
Grateful for the fact someday

803
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,900
I will finally get to leave.

804
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:51,920
of message to repeat press 1 to save press 2 to erase press 3 goodbye

805
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:03,340
there it was just like old faithful the eternal fountain of

806
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,320
i took a walk straight out of town

807
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:37,560
i was alone i looked around i heard a voice so i buckled up for safety

808
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:44,180
i saw myself there on the ground a pool of sound it showed my own reflection

809
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:44,540
i saw myself there on the ground a pool of sound it showed my own reflection

810
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,120
in a fountain of filth it was a fountain of filth

811
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,680
eternal fountain of filth

812
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,780
i tried to run i couldn't move

813
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:05,340
out of my head the fountain shot

814
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,260
found me in a serum that i couldn't put a stop to

815
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,080
it was me myself and i locked in a struggle with the talking

816
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:14,380
everything

817
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:14,540
i was alone i looked around i heard a voice so i buckled up for safety

820
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,020
i had a hunger to make me do things

821
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,700
i had a hunger to make me save me

822
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,380
i had a hunger to make me want things

823
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,100
i'm just a victim of filth

824
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,880
eternal fountain of filth

825
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,700

826

For that great Hour of Slack spooky intro

872
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:52,320
Before that, we heard Fountain of Filth

873
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,460
An early song by Devo

874
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,780
And the phone call

875
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:01,580
The sort of depressing yet inspiring phone call there

876
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,800
Was by Phineas Narco

877
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:08,140

897
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,320
Bye.

898
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:14,740
Bye.

899
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,760
Bye.

900
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,240
Bye.

901
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,320
Bye.

902
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,080
Bye.

903
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,340
Bye.

904
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,460
Bye.

905
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,000
Bye.

906
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:50,600
jumbo, a boiler plate to keep our noses clean, free and clear, and our heads off the chopping

907
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:56,600
block. Because it's a dog-eat-dog world out there, yes it is, and we're not going to pretend

908
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,860
otherwise. That's right, and if your feet smell and your nose is running, you may want

909
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:06,360
to see if you're... You're built upside down. And you have to listen to this music forever

910
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:15,960
and ever. Yeah! Because we're almost, almost... What happened to the collar? Little collar's

911
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,020
still there. They like to eat on the nickel. He loves us. We're dancing with him right

912
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:26,280
now. Let's dance, collar. Come on, let's dance. Get up. Don't be shy. It's almost 5 a.m.

913
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,260
Rock out, man.

914
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,140
Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!

915
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,000
Come on, Hal! Let's join in, man! Everybody!

916
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,700
Get up on your feet! Let's dance!

917
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,220
Oh my gosh, on stilts! Yeah, I didn't know I had to...

918
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:46,220
Look, I've got these kangaroo shoes. I'm going to dance with them on now.

919
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:50,920
Kangaroo shoes?

920
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:56,440
The collar's rocking out on the phone buttons. Did you notice that?

921
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,460
Yeah, he can.

922
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,500
He's doing all he can. All right!

923
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,080
Rocknar wouldn't do such a thing.

924
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,480
That's not Rocknar.

925
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,140
No, it's an idiot.

926
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,760
By the way, Popes Lilith did that new P.O. box in subgenius.com.

927
