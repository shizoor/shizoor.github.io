1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,840
Uh, hello Bob, and yes dear friends, it is 1997, but you're about to listen to Hour of Slack, number 75, from 1987. Praise Bob.

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:25,680
Praise Bob? Oh yes dear friends, this is Li Biqing, a Chinese subgenius, and you are listening to the Hour of Slack.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,120
Streak, streak, streak, streak, streak, streak, streak, streak, streak, streak, streak, streak, streak, streak, streak, streak, streak.

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:46,280
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius Hour of Slack.

5
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,880
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

6
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,420
Praise Bob.

7
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,560
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

8
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,860
Oh, wow.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,020
Wow.

10
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,760
Praise Bob.

11
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,460
Praise Bob.

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,240
Remember, Bob and the comrades of all people, here in China.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,080
Just like in America, the people need slack.

14
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,080
In Chinese, we call slack, le tin pan.

15
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,160
But it must be true slack, not the bad slack of the conspiracy.

16
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,620
Praise Bob, help me somebody.

17
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,900
Eternal salvation.

18
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,300
Or triple your money back.

19
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,540
Cheers.

20
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,300
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show?

21
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,180
The listener is advised to remain calm and only contact an unlisted or a listed official,

22
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,820
in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled during broadcast.

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,860
Small animals or other children becoming exposed to the ultra high or ultra low shocks and brain frequencies

24
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,160
constantly scanned throughout our program should seek shelter in an approved safety unit only.

25
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,200
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that often it's the off-the-offrtone that night releases.

26
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,980
But truth is, not everyone gets that device.

27
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,760
the picture, hoping your time is all time and all your

28
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,580
unpermissible truths are happy truths.

29
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,900
After relaxing on the lake, Bob's ready to have a great

30
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,520
time entertaining his friends.

31
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,660
Right, Bob?

32
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,440
Bob?

33
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,360
Bob?

34
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:46,600
Bob?

35
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,320
Break out of that glass box.

36
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,720
And join the Church of the Subgenius.

37
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,100
In a country where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the

38
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,700
Constitution, anything is likely to develop.

39
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,980
Enter the Church of the Subgenius, billing itself as

40
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,080
the

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,140
weirdest cult on Earth.

42
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,780
What do they believe in?

43
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,420
Everything.

44
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,980
Who do they believe in?

45
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,140
A mysterious character named Bob.

46
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,620
Bob is the culmination of that to which man has aspired

47
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,000
throughout his long and slackless history.

48
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,560
Bob is what will bring slack to planet Earth.

49
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,040
And to you, young man.

50
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,760
This is a church that does not play games.

51
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,060
The other churches talk about love and think hate.

52
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,560
The other churches do not talk about money.

53
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,100
They take your money.

54
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,060
They take your money.

55
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,060


56
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,520
You don't see the church of Bob.

57
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,560
No, that's a good point.

58
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,940
You don't see Cadillac convertibles in the church of Bob.

59
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,460
No.

60
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,720
You don't see Jensen interceptors in the parking lot of Bob.

61
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,220
You see slack-filled-

62
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,620
You see slack-filled smiling faces in the tabernacle of the Bob.

63
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,880
Bob founded the church mainly to help unmask the conspiracies.

64
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,820
We're talking about the conspiracies.

65
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,700
What next?

66
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,160
Just believe in the power of the dogs.

67
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,160
I believe.

68
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,620
Believe in Bob.

69
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,140
I believe.

70
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,620
Reach out for him.

71
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,340
I believe.

72
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:16,340


73
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:16,600
I believe.

74
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,500
I feel the healing power.

75
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,820
He� Quest is outta here.

76
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,040
Now pickups are for paying short.

77
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,080
They're going to take you back to the old Daigle었어요,

78
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,420
off into the smoke and extended and equal phase�

79
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,480
Bethanyikanакс Point, Alaska,

80
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:26,480


81
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:26,480


82
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:35,740
You should be at a conslooked daigleasy,

83
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,820
or instead of watching and allowing yourself to Angst societ.

84
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,480
You should be abe,

85
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,340
haunted men and women.

86
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,460
Our midnight ramp.

87
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,560
I know the man by Mr. Fletcher

88
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,940
in Dallas, Texas.

89
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,660
He's a good man,

90
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,800
except that he don't buy me

91
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,840
two glasses of Fletcher's beer.

92
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,140
And I said,

93
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,940
I love you, boy.

94
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,460
And I'm going to tell you,

95
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,380
if I can't whoop him,

96
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,120
I'll go down.

97
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,740
All right, man,

98
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,740
so here's your woman.

99
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,940
He's going down.

100
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,500
All right.

101
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,940
Yes, it's miracle wisdom

102
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,060
coming through from me.

103
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,700
We may find only

104
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,580
the intergalactic silences,

105
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,100
or we may encounter

106
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,420
intelligences greater than our own,

107
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,200
answers to questions

108
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,160
we cannot even formulate today,

109
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,680
or the pioneers,

110
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,100
traveling or falling

111
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,340
between fire and darkness,

112
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,800
between freezing and burning,

113
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,160
may sense that we live

114
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,100
only on the narrowest of margins.

115
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:46,940
Snowflakes,

116
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
condensed momentarily

117
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,080
out of the great snowstorms

118
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,360
and firestorms of matter in space.

119
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,080
Speaking of serious things,

120
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,540
the planet Earth

121
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,820
does not have much time left.

122
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,260
The date that Bob has set is...

123
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,840
I mean, he's not trying to do this.

124
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,140
This isn't something he wants to do.

125
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,560
But 7 o'clock in the morning,

126
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,800
July 5th,

127
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,620
well, when everybody has hangovers,

128
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,020
1998.

129
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,080
That year, you can expect the,

130
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,720
quote,

131
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,260
end of the world, unquote.

132
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,140
The Church of the Sun,

133
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,600
the subgenius is here to make sure

134
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,580
the end of the world happens correctly.

135
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,180
It can go various different ways.

136
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
People tend to think of the end of the world

137
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,880
as a sudden, you know,

138
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,780
bam, it's gone, or the rapture, you know,

139
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,080
suddenly all the Christians are in heaven,

140
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,820
happy watching all the sinners fry.

141
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,340
We don't want to get slain,

142
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,120
we'd better get by the bomb right now.

143
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,420
Basically, two factions out there right now

144
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,660
is us and them.

145
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,560
Friend, have you ever heard the expression,

146
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,400
there's no slack in this world?

147
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,680
A lot of people have to ask me what slack is.

148
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,620
And that's sad, mister.

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,640
They were born with slack.

150
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,720
Oh yeah, you were born with slack.

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,840
But the conspiracy took it away.

152
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,040
The conspiracy made you want to be normal.

153
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,660
That's what the conspiracy is all about.

154
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,120
And conspiracy is a patchwork of different things.

155
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,120
Some are nations, some are products,

156
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,060
some are hypnotic television shows,

157
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,120
some are bad people.

158
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,120


159
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,420
Some are pills.

160
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,580
You'll find unless you find Bob,

161
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,620
and you'd better find Bob right now.

162
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,140
Yeah.

163
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
And no one has ever met Bob.

164
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,480
The leader of our church, no one has ever met,

165
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,000
because as you know, all cults,

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,920
their leaders are usually pretty hard to find.

167
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,520
And Bob is no exception.

168
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,560
Bob will help you.

169
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,420
Dig your own weirdness.

170
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,020
I got a bob in my pants.

171
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,620
I got a bob in my pants.

172
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,700
Honey, I got a problem.

173
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,200
I got a bob in my pants.

174
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,500
It's right over here.

175
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,040
Look, I need some padded tweezers.

176
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,420
No, no.

177
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,020
Don't run away.

178
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,260
I got a bob in my pants.

179
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,320
That way they all run away.

180
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,280
I need help.

181
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,060
I got a bob in my pants.

182
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,720
Will somebody help me?

183
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,820
I got a bob in my pants.

184
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,820
It's not bad.

185
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,360
I'm trying to squat my bob.

186
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,980
I need to squat my bob.

187
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,940
I got to squat my bob.

188
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,280
When you got me squatting my bob.

189
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,160
I got a bob in my pants.

190
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,660
intrigued really with the meaning to this book.

191
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,980
I got a bob in my pants.

192
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,400
I got a bob in my designer jeans.

193
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,420
I got a bob in my pants.

194
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,860
It's clean, Bob

195
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,140
I got a bob in my shorts.

196
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,400
Don't smell.

197
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,480
I got a bob in my shorts.

198
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:41,480


199
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:41,480


200
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:48,760
shorts. I got a bob in my shorts. I gotta get this bob out of my pants.

201
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:08,440
This is Sister Chris, and couldn't you just whiff the isness, the slack that was inherited

202
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,060
in that collage? Truly first-rate sleazy art or tenth-rate high art that contains the

203
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,580
cheapness necessary to help you maintain faith throughout subgenius depression or alienation

204
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,960
from blessed mania in these times of no style, when no one has the guts to put their bloody

205
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,080
hearts in the line without fear of being called a weirdo. A time when people laugh at the

206
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,320
things that aren't funny and don't laugh at the ones that are. They, being the normals,

207
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,960
laugh only when there is a laugh track, because they don't, because they rather they want

208
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,680
to be accepted.

209
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,420
And they don't want to step out of line. It's gone so far I've actually heard sobbing at

210
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,020
a movie theater when the expensive cars, the Mercedes Benz and such get totaled in a car

211
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:52,260
chase. Confusion abounds and the only thing we can keep our precious insanity is by letting

212
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,660
go of the oppressive concrete weights around our necks that pull us down to the bottom

213
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,120
of the pool of normalcy, float up to the surface where the breathing is easy. Come up to freshness.

214
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,380
Try Menthol Bob. He's that refreshing voice in the back of your head that all of the nuns

215
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,420
in Catholic training and psychic torturing say,

216
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,620
called you was the voice of the devil or one of his minions urging you to step away from

217
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,380
the flock. the hurt instinct is the real diabolical notion that organized religion teaches dump

218
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:26,220
those graven images down the drain before you dump your will in a ditch for them. Yes.

219
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
The harvest.

220
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,160
I just kept hearing the word Bob, Bob body.

221
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,420
They said your mind is in this jar and then they they Chase

222
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:38,420


223
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:38,420


224
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:38,420


225
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:38,420


226
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,780
They poured it down the sink.

227
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,880
Subgeniuses are the class of people who can't be classified.

228
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,840
Bob has taken winos on the street and turned them into millionaires overnight.

229
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:56,940
By the same token, he has taken millionaires and given them the slack they always needed all along as winos.

230
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:06,320
Some of the greatest of the subgeniuses, some of the most ascended rogue subgeniuses, are complete morons.

231
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,400
Morons.

232
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,140
You know, but they perform a service.

233
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,680
You know, we need the morons of the world.

234
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
They've got me befuddled.

235
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,680
I don't even know where the hell they're coming from.

236
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,700
But thanks for letting me speak my piece.

237
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,700
Sure, sure.

238
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:27,060
Listen, if I were you, I would keep speaking your piece as much as possible because it's not going to be long before people cannot say what they mean.

239
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,360
People won't be able to express themselves in public.

240
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,880
I understand that, but, you know, that other stuff is coming down with me.

241
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,000
I just can't, you know, relate to it at all.

242
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,220
It's all too real.

243
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,360
It's all too real.

244
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,420
I want to know what gets you started in this religious cult.

245
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,320
What gets you started?

246
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,720
What got us started?

247
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,200
I didn't.

248
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,860
What got us started?

249
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,320
Yeah.

250
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,460
Actually, I was contacted one time.

251
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,940
I was driving along in my automobile.

252
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,760
You've heard about these UFO contactee stories.

253
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:21,840
I know before, but I was driving along in my automobile one day and out on some country road and was forcibly wrenched from my car and manipulated by creatures from outer space.

254
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,960
Does that appeal to you?

255
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,480
Pretty simple, really.

256
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,260
No, I don't believe it myself.

257
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:33,640
Well, what you can do, yeah, I was going to say, you probably wouldn't want to send us a dollar.

258
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,160
We don't insist that people believe.

259
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,280
They only insist that they do what we ask them to.

260
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,620
In fact, we believe that the majority of you out there won't believe us.

261
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,380
Yeah, I was wanting to talk to them too, guys.

262
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,000
Is this Rhodey?

263
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,520
Yeah, they're right here, and I'm Rhodey.

264
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:49,660
Hello?

265
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,620
Okay, I want to ask them two questions.

266
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,460
The first question is, they said they was into winning souls.

267
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,620
Who are they winning souls for, Satan or Jesus?

268
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,680
Pal, Bob and Jesus are on the same side.

269
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,500
They're just not playing.

270
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,840
They're playing quite the same game.

271
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,180
There's only, yeah, but there's only one game.

272
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,020
That's right, there's only one game.

273
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,580
That's all.

274
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,400
We're not going to be able to tell you anything.

275
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,040
So play your game and keep on playing.

276
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,960
Well, my second question is, why are you deceiving everybody?

277
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,780
We're not deceiving anyone.

278
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,700
We're not doing it for Jesus.

279
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,160
It's going to be a lot easier to deceive people once the government starts putting Valium in the water supply.

280
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,780
I probably won't even be here.

281
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,580
That's right.

282
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,300
That's probably right.

283
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,340
Let me make an important point here.

284
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:43,600
A lot of the people that are born-again Christians now are doing more to turn America against Jesus than they are for Jesus.

285
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,800
Do you understand what I'm saying?

286
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,020
Yeah, I hear you there.

287
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:51,980
But what I'm saying is, why don't y'all, why don't y'all try to turn people to Jesus?

288
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,980
We're just trying to take it from a slightly different direction.

289
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,180
Make people aware of the fact that they can make their own decisions.

290
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,940
We're going step by step.

291
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,480
Do you ever occur to you, you might be going in the wrong direction?

292
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:05,580
I don't know about that.

293
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,160
We think about that all the time.

294
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,520
Has it ever occurred to you?

295
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,140
No.

296
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,300
I got a mighty bigıyor a un gran barco.

297
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:35,380
I got a mighty bigió a un gran barco.

298
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,620
Oh, man, he's got to come out.

299
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,240
Well, he must have got in.

300
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,680
Ain't no room.

301
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,840
He's got to get out.

302
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,720
There ain't no room in my skin.

303
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,500
For there's a mighty big Bob.

304
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,920
He's inside of me.

305
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,620
He's a mighty big Bob.

306
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,980
You know, he makes me pee.

307
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,020
He's a mighty big Bob.

308
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,540
He's a mighty big Bob.

309
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,640
Man, he's really too big.

310
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,200
He's a mighty big Bob.

311
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,420
He's a mighty big Bob.

312
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,400
After a few weeks of this, I just began to feel a deep hurting in my belly,

313
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,440
way deep down in my spirit.

314
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,900
And some people say, what the top of what?

315
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,880
You mean you experience pain, too?

316
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,580
Yes, I do.

317
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,000
I hurt just like you do.

318
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,340
I feel the pain of a satanic attack just like you do.

319
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:59,520
But I really didn't even know how to pray because I didn't know exactly what was coming at me.

320
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,860
Satan was bombarding me from so many sides.

321
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,340
Actually, I felt kind of dumb.

322
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,960
Step in to the wonderful world of auto dynamics.

323
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,180
Step into the swept wing Dodge of 1957.

324
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:23,100
If the last 50 years made such a change, just imagine the New York of 1980.

325
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,420
When everyone has a number instead of a name.

326
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,800
And the government tells you whom you should marry.

327
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,760
Just imagine 1980.

328
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,480
1980.

329
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,800
Oh, my goodness.

330
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,420
Oh, are you all right, Doctor?

331
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,120
That don't work will bore you.

332
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,820
I'm healed again.

333
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,480
Right here, right in front of us, folks.

334
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,960
That ain't the highest quality slack I ever heard in my life either.

335
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,100
Well, it's better than that liquid slack we have to buy from you.

336
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Hey, there's a caller.

337
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,700
We talked to Bosco Bear today.

338
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,200
Let's see what Bosco has to say.

339
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:06,140
Well, you know, it's a little-known fact that the soul is actually located in the foot.

340
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,620
Of course, it's not physically located.

341
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,960
It's not a physical thing.

342
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,640
It doesn't die with the physical body.

343
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,120
It rots, but never actually dies.

344
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,720
It stays around.

345
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,600
Yes, the soul is the stroke drug of the spiritual realm.

346
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:26,760
It wanders around, trying to score a last bit of prop before it passes over into the before life.

347
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,180
And, you know, a normal...

348
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,940
A normal soul, it just...

349
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,920
When they get over into the before life, they all just run together into one big slurry.

350
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,720
And they get strained out and used in another normal in the next life.

351
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,720
But you couldn't really call it a next life, because it's just normal.

352
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,280
Yes, but a subgenius soul becomes a dot.

353
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,460
They're hard to catch.

354
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,600
But what happens to a business executive's soul?

355
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,360
What happens to a business executive's soul?

356
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,900
Well, those are the ones that Bob will use as the main commodity in his bargaining with the elder gods.

357
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,840
When the day of judgment arrives.

358
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,040
You should know that from looking at Prescripture 1714, Dr. Howell.

359
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,120
I presume you have been reading your prescriptures.

360
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,960
I was only making an inquiry on behalf of the many unenlightened listeners

361
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,860
who might be curious to know how vulnerable a business executive might be.

362
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,480
I've just noticed a certain lack of discipline around...

363
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,740
I mean, this whole show thing.

364
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,440
Just the fact that you call it a show...

365
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,360
Oh, don't eschew the show.

366
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,460
Don't eschew the show.

367
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,480
If the checks were bigger, the show would be better.

368
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,140
Oh, the checks, the money, I see.

369
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,100
Yes, if the checks were bigger, the balances would be greater.

370
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,340
Your love of Bob is in direct proportion to how much Bob pays you, right?

371
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,740
Oh, I think Bob's love of me is in direct proportion to how many souls I destroy.

372
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,580
Bob pays through the nose, and I've worn out many souls pounding the streets in his service.

373
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,680
That's right, and I've hurt my nostrils trying to receive those payments.

374
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,800
I had my third nostril forcibly opened by a crazed wino.

375
00:18:59,180 --> 00:18:59,860
Telegraph Avenue.

376
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,880
And that's the best way to do it.

377
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,120
That is really the best way, getting it on the street.

378
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,140
You don't have to get fancy about it.

379
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,060
You know, do it natural-like.

380
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,900
Get a, just...

381
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,240
You know, the ones that's out on the street.

382
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,700
There they are now.

383
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,220
That's probably where Bob is now.

384
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,680
He's probably walking the streets.

385
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,400
It's amazing how it's like a miracle.

386
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,580
Filling it full of money.

387
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,500
Just as we all are, he is only a delicate envelope of flesh.

388
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,360
Yeah, but he's been licked more than once.

389
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,760
He's a bag of skin filled with meat.

390
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,160
Just like...

391
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,160


392
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,240
Not like everybody, but it's special.

393
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,020
Establish justice.

394
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,140
I ain't afraid of all the gulls and altars.

395
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,260
I used to think if I died in an evil place,

396
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,640
then my soul wouldn't be able to make it to heaven.

397
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,780
But now...

398
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,880
I mean, I don't care where it goes as long as it ain't here.

399
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,560
So what do you want to do?

400
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,800
I'm going in to examine it.

401
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,520
Isn't that dangerous, even with the suit on, sir?

402
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,420
It won't take me long.

403
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,460
Very well.

404
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,660
He's reached bottom.

405
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,960
Open the lock.

406
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,260
Father.

407
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:04,640
Hold it.

408
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,240
Mary, what are you doing here in a radiation suit?

409
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,900
We are the first non-tax-exempt church around.

410
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,400
We're the first industrial church.

411
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,960
Huh?

412
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,280
And we're not disputing any of your belief systems,

413
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,000
because we believe in just about every one of them anyway.

414
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,280
Sir, I can't believe the weird things

415
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,720
that people get in their heads and start teaching.

416
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,500
J.R. Bob Dobbs, known among salesmen as the Saint of Sales.

417
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,360
It's actually a mystic sales ability.

418
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,120
Hey, man, these jokes are getting pretty stale.

419
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,320
Hey, who did you get these jokes from?

420
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,480
Hey, I don't know, man. The safety seal is broken.

421
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,240
Hey.

422
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,900
Hey, hey.

423
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,380
These jokes are getting pretty stale. Hey, who did you get these jokes from?

424
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:58,380


425
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,860
These jokes have been tampered with, man.

426
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,440
Hey, these jokes smell like bitter almonds.

427
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,200
Scott, get him out of here.

428
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,380
He's got a shame.

429
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,440
Where did these jokes come from?

430
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,720
In the sand.

431
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,440
Oh, the conspiracy's been full with our jokes.

432
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,260
We're the dirty ratin'.

433
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,460
Boy, well, let's see if this batch is any better.

434
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,340
And liberty and justice for all who believe.

435
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,540
And liberty and justice for all who believe.

436
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,640
Christ, my Lord.

437
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,200
Perhaps somehow this knowledge weighs on him more heavily than on many of us

438
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,360
who are able to bear our mortality without resorting to an elaborate trial.

439
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,540
Who is the first to be

440
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,220
Well, I haven't figured that one out myself yet.

441
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,160
Perhaps after the show you could show me how, Hal.

442
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,540
Well, how else can you explain the avoidance of humanity itself,

443
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,540
of simple human charity, of the fact of connection?

444
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,740
Well, it can be explained. It's a simple explanation.

445
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,780
The explanation for practically everything is available at your fingertips,

446
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,200
and it seems most of you in this room have forgotten it.

447
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:58,360
Now, what happened to the old, the old, you know, kill or kill me philosophy of some sort?

448
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,540
Hey, what happened to this, I mean, Bob was supposed to kill you, and you turn it around.

449
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,540
I died a thousand times.

450
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:11,520
All I want is a little crumb of bread, Ivan, just a tiny, just one bite of bread, and I'll come back to the church.

451
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,020
Throw him a face.

452
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,020
Just one, just one crumb of nourishment for one of the old faithful.

453
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,400
Oh, man does not live by bread alone. There's other things besides food that nourish you, Gary.

454
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
But just one crumb.

455
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,360
You had your crumb.

456
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,240
More tears.

457
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,120
I dropped my crumb.

458
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,080
Hey, hey, you want to buy some show?

459
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:39,060
Our show is scientifically engineered to reduce stress and fatigue, the world's most successful show,

460
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,360
and superb performance is only half the story. It's a legend in its own time.

461
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,480
However, improper listening techniques may lead some persons to dependency, seizures, cranial fits,

462
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:57,420
priapic conditions, micturition, sternutation, subtle glandular mutations, and in some territories, legal arrest.

463
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:05,540
Listen to the definitive, authoritative, informative, eye-opening, thorough, insightful, useful, complete, and original subgenius hour and a half of Slack.

Neither forces.

468
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,140
We found out there's some things you don't play games with.

00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,520
You don't...

471
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,700
People you say, you don't mess around with somebody else's religion.

472
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,980
The unprofitable servant will be in the judgment.

473
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,660
Call the next defendant.

474
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,060
Scott Camp to the bar.

475
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,300
Scott Camp, I sentence you to hell.

476
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,520
No, I have been saved.

477
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,420
I've been in church practically all my life.

478
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:15,920
Yes, you have grown up in church, and you have certainly had an experience with your God.

479
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,380
But the record reveals that you have been unprofitable.

480
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,220
And the word decrees that the unprofitable servant must be cast into outer darkness.

481
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,280
But when have I been unprofitable?

482
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,660
You have rebelled against my word, and you have stolen your Lord's money.

483
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,200
While you lived upon the earth, I permitted you to earn a good living.

484
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,080
As my servant, I gave you power and health to earn money.

485
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,420
And in return for this, I decreed in my word that a tenth part of those earnings were mine.

486
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:55,020
I left that 10% in your care, charging you to invest it for me into my church.

487
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,380
That the gospel might be preached.

488
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,500
But you, Scott, have rebelled against my word.

489
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,300
You have not only taken 90% which I freely gave you,

490
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,640
but you have been so covetous as to take the 10% also.

491
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,060
Did you know that rebellion is a sin of witchcraft,

492
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,860
and that no covetous person shall enter the kingdom of God?

493
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,160
Oh, sir, I tell you, I didn't realize it was so serious.

494
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,520
And if you don't want that to happen to you,

495
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,280
if you don't want the judgment in Dobbstown,

496
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,400
a recording of which you just heard,

497
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,600
to go against you like that poor Pobucker there,

498
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,380
Bob was mad at him because he was unprofitable.

499
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,260
And he didn't want us to be unprofitable either.

500
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,860
You can write for information, not about this station,

501
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,140
but about the church of the subject matter.

502
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,440
And I'm a genius, which so many of you hate.

503
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,480
You got that pencil or pen or tattoo needle ready, dear friends?

504
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,900
That's P.O. Box 140306.

505
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,540
It's got a nice ring to it.

506
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,600
140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

507
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,520
And just drop us a postcards with your address.

508
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:18,700
And...

509
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,220
Oh, yes, the harvest.

510
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,020
And we've gotten a lot of calls tonight.

511
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,600
Lots of great hate calls.

512
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,000
You know, I played some recordings of old hate calls,

513
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,040
and it's funny how they'll just follow that cue.

514
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,600
It just brings it out.

515
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,360
So keep calling and keep listening.

516
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:48,580
We love to know that you keep listening to something you hate.

517
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,720
That tells us a lot.

518
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,300
Thank you.

519
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:30,860
Anyway, we are gonna take a look

520
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:37,380
at theseusi AD's in acquired collection.

521
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,000
They must have beengies.

522
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,020
Here we go.

523
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,800
There we are.

524
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,200
And I'm a tool never to touch the jars

525
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,140
But sometimes I talk to the grains

526
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,720
When nobody's home

527
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,880
Electric static noises, lightning bolts

528
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,920
Well, you know, lightning bolts and ions jump out

529
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,720
Like a circus in a fireplace

530
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,540
My daddy has seven brains

531
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,720
Six he keeps on the shelf

532
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,940
And one that he keeps in his head that he doesn't tell anybody about

533
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,780
And he uses to play along with those TV game shows

534
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,360
Hold my hotmail, bitch

535
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,560
Hey, I'd like to make a reservation for tonight

536
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,240
At the Hallmark House Hotel

537
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,140
Tonight?

538
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,980
Yeah, you got vacancies?

539
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,020
We got lots of it

540
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,360
Oh, man, that's great

541
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,600
Because I'm just new in town

542
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,280
We just got to get a place to rest, you know what I mean?

543
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,140
For one person?

544
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,620
No, this is for two

545
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,260
For two, you want two beds or one bed?

546
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,420
One bed

547
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:01,920
One bed

548
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,480
32 plus tax

549
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,360
222 plus tax?

550
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:05,900
32

551
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,820
Oh, that's great

552
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,300
Now, do you have mirrors on the ceilings?

553
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,920
Because I know some of these fancy, whoop-de-doo Hollywood hotels

554
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,480
Have mirrors

555
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,040
No, we don't

556
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,880
Oh, no, I don't know if I want to do it

557
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,980
We don't like that kind of place

558
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,100
Oh, you're not that kind of place?

559
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,880
No, we don't like that kind of place

560
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,120
Well, wait a minute

561
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:29,760
3222?

562
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,220
What's that mean?

563
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,500
Now, let me ask you this

564
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,260
You got color TV?

565
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,660
Color TV and telephone

566
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,240
Oh, man, okay

567
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,560
Can I give you the reservation?

568
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,140
No reservation needed

569
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,540
When you drop by, what do you need?

570
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:42,960
Your ID

571
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,880
Oh, you'll have the vacancy, though

572
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah, we got lots of it

573
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,120
Okay, let me ask you this

574
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,660
Is adult photography allowed in the rooms also?

575
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,860
Sir, you've been asking me a lot of questions like that, okay?

576
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,040
I think you better go to other hotels

577
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,960
Well, if I pee on the floor

578
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,400
Can I drink it out of a Dixie cup if I can scoop it up with a straw?

579
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,240
No, you can't

580
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,880
Why not?

581
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,360
I don't know what kind of question you're asking

582
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,320
Well, if the bullfrogs were gagging on

583
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,260
This is a decent hotel

584
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,980
If you want that kind of a, you know, those kind of a hotel

585
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,560
You better go across the street

586
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,540
400, they got me on it

587
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,640
They got x-rays

588
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,740
Oh, man, oh, man

589
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,600
It's all an illusion

590
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,240
Yes, these were the old days, dear friends

591
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:30,000
We're listening to a 10-year-old hour of slack

592
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,620
What a trip down memory lane for me

593
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,120
And what a confusing mess for you

594
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,020
But that's all right

595
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:41,760
You don't want to know why I didn't do an original show this week

596
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,300
I don't want to know either

597
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,380
Praise Bob

598
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,120
It's all an illusion

599
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,880
It's all a lie

600
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,580
The one who flashed the badge

601
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,740
Calls your name and says

602
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,340
I am Special Agent Arnold Palmer

603
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,620
Acting under authority of Executive Order

604
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,260
Camp X-Day 666

605
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,860
BOM for your own good

606
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,140
And the security of the nation

607
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,740
We are taking you into the world

608
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,160
To protective custody

609
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,700
You need to know these facts

610
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,920
One, we are in a war to the death

611
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,040
In large means

612
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,680
The average subgenius doesn't even realize

613
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,020
The anti-Bob is fanatically lusting to destroy

614
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,100
Every last subgenius patriot

615
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,380
Even as they have done to our kindred

616
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,300
In Dobstown, in Bolivia

617
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,040
In any war

618
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,880
The most vital element is slack

619
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,480
Positive mental slack

620
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,640
This includes courage

621
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,420
The willingness to sacrifice oneself

622
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,740
For the good of will

623
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,060
Knowing one's own identity

624
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,400
Knowing who and what

625
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,200
The pink enemy is

626
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,760
Your plans

627
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,380
And your foe's plans

628
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,320
The pink boys

629
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,540
Although fifty times as many as they'll admit

630
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,580
Are still a ridiculously small minority

631
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,440
Compared to the Axists

632
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,680
Able to dominate a world because they're organized

633
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,280
They control communications

634
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,860
And thus are able to keep billions of victims

635
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,960
Misled, disorganized, demoralized

636
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,900
The lord of laughs

637
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,420
His highness of humbleness

638
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:33,060
Yea, let my humbleness rule the world

639
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,340
Nay, the universe

640
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,620
May my humiliation become a force

641
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,420
Greater than the gods'

642
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,580
Themselves

643
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,860
Hell yeah, I'm more humble

644
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,140
I've won humbleness contests

645
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,560
In ten galaxies around here

646
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,220
Hell, I can crawl over in a snake

647
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,440
Hell, I'm humbler than

648
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,620
Fifteen of them dudes out there

649
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,480
Hell, I out-humbled that guy over there

650
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,460
He came up and just

651
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,940
Threw some humiliation laughs

652
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,500
But then I just humbled him up the face

653
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,780
And then I humbled him in that

654
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,360
That I'm humbler than

655
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,580
Half the people you've ever met

656
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,380
Hell

657
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,980
He was humbler than half

658
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,700
Hell

659
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,000
Enlarge me

660
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,580
And then after that a pretty girl came up to me

661
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,320
A reporter for a famous newspaper

662
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,440
And asked me

663
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,680
Reverend Sterno

664
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,740
How did you find out about

665
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,000
The pink attack

666
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,120
Pardon my language but yee-haw

667
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,640
I said well, it happened

668
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,780
In the fifties

669
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,800
When Bob uncovered that rock

670
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,140
And she said the fifties

671
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,640
Dogstown will be saved

672
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,840
But not through me

673
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,360
It can't be newsword back then

674
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,160
Back in the fifties

675
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,240
Well, we want to know what happened two minutes ago

676
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,380
She said

677
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,600
In a Jack Daniels bottle

678
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,500
Leaving it for three weeks under her porch

679
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,780
Selling it to Kregger

680
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,260
Kregger mutating it

681
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,420
Kregger, of course

682
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,320
Functioning discombobulation ray

683
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,020
Selling it coast to coast

684
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,560
In the truck that was the actual drum kit

685
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,840
Used in the fourteenth Doctors for Bob show

686
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,900
When they required

687
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,960
That their drummer be not

688
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,100
And then they realized the conspiracy plot

689
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,980
Was actually not a conspiracy plot at all

690
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,560
But a conspiracy plot

691
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,460
To make people think there was a conspiracy plot

692
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,280
Why is there a limit of herb

693
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,880
And I've written up what Bob has all I think of me

694
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,360
And I know

695
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,500
Pardon me, what was that again, Dr. Howell?

696
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,340
Maybe our listeners would like to hear that the new edition of the Book of the Subgenius is coming out soon.

697
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:39,340


698
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:39,340


699
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,120
So you'll have to buy that extra copy

700
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,700
New cover?

701
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,880
Yes, and a different power shell code

702
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,040
Cross the threshold of reality and enter a fantastic imaginary universe

703
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,980
Who wouldn't you like to know?

704
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,300
Visit lands filled with mystery and magic

705
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,480
Splendid palaces where powerful dragons soar through the sky

706
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,420
Mystical unicorns comfort the pure of heart

707
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,560
And sprightly elves cavort in moonlit forests

708
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,680
Hey, Stang, we want our show to stay the same

709
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,160
If you bother messing with it, your plane won't land

710
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,520
And you'll go straight to your Bob

711
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,500
Peer over the edge of darkness

712
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,340
Well, hold on

713
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,980
Let Bob take my soul

714
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,260
Oh, so you like this, this, uh, this hodgepodge

715
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,480
I like the number nine

716
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,600
Nine is amazing

717
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,700
Satisfying

718
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,140
It's not stodgy, it's satisfying

719
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,880
The most satisfying number is nine

720
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,960
Four is not so hot

721
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,160
Four and eight are not that great

722
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,060
Oh, come on, yeah

723
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,940
Purely

724
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,560
New beyond

725
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,480
Cloud into cloud

726
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:06,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

727
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,140
And you'll fall for it

728
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,100
And you'll fall for it

729
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,780
And you'll fall for it

730
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,360
And you'll fall for it

731
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,180
And you'll fall for it

732
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,180


733
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,980
Come on

734
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,440
I heard my town

735
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,720
Hi, I'm interested in, uh, reserving a room for tonight

736
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,580
Do you have vacancies?

737
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,420
Yeah

738
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,560
Oh, that's great

739
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
And let me ask you this

740
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,940
How much does it cost for a room for two people?

741
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:26,940
Overnight

742
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,360
Oh, yeah, overnight

743
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,600
Nineteen dollar

744
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,300
Oh, that's a great bargain

745
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:31,860
That's a great

746
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,840
You know, you have the best bargain in town about?

747
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,020
Yes

748
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,680
About, for that?

749
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,880
Now let me ask you this, for single bed, right?

750
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,160
Yeah, just single bed.

751
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,940
Okay, now let me ask you this.

752
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:47,220
When they get the Delvecchio method interred within, did the youngsters do it?

753
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,900
I can't hear you.

754
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:55,300
Well, when the youngsters did it with the Delvecchio method, they didn't have it.

755
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,020
Have what?

756
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:03,020
Well, they had the salami meat with the cervix menstruating barners.

757
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:13,240
Now, at the Hi-Hat Hotel, do you allow youngsters to urinate on the floor if they smash bullfrogs on the head with sledgehammers?

758
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,240
No, I don't know.

759
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:22,080
Now, if I went to the bathroom and I found 11 bullfrogs gagging on cloves of hair,

760
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,080
do you think that I could desiccate them and eat the vital organs?

761
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,140
If I wouldn't be breaking the law, that is.

762
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,240
Yeah.

763
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,940
Would that be acceptable to the morals of your decency?

764
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:48,420
You know, the legless eunuch banded together and clumped with the corn stalks reproduced from all over 90 cases.

765
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,980
Yes, absolutely. Can you take my name?

766
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,880
Perry Strump?

767
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,300
Perry Strump.

768
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,820
It rhymes with hump.

769
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,180
Okay, what time do you come here?

770
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,800
About two o'clock.

771
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,760
Two o'clock?

772
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:23,300
And we're coming from another dimension, beyond the beams of electrons, beyond that which is known.

773
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:28,360
We are vibrating very rapidly at a higher energy level, but we plan to be with you.

774
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,860
Will you accept us?

775
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,440
You'll come to here, okay?

776
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,020
One more last information.

777
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,200
Tell me what they did with the youngsters.

778
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,780
Did the youngsters do it?

779
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:44,980
What?

780
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,760
Did the youngsters meet the salami unit?

781
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,140
I don't understand what you're saying.

782
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,140
Well, did the youngsters do it with the salami unit which they had?

783
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,480
I was trying to find out.

784
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,320
I talked to Karen.

785
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,400
I talked to Sarah.

786
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,220
I talked to...

787
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:02,540
I talked to Barry.

788
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,960
They didn't have any of the information that I wanted.

789
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,560
Please, please let me know, else I can't come to the Hi-Hat Hotel.

790
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,280
Yeah, okay.

791
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,900
Anyway, you'll come here and...

792
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,620
Barry had the plexiglass.

793
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,660
Do you got the tubes that were inserted into the nasal passages?

794
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,260
Yes, I did.

795
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:22,700
Hello?

796
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,160
Hello?

797
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:25,960
Hello?

798
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:26,600
Hello?

799
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:27,760
Hello?

800
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:27,960
Hello?

801
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,180
Hello?

802
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:28,360


803
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:28,520


804
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:28,780
Hello?

805
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:28,980
Hello?

806
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,520
Hello?

807
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:30,900
Hello?

808
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,200
Hello?

809
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:32,200


810
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,600
Hello?

811
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:34,600


812
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:34,600


813
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:34,600


814
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:34,600


815
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:34,940
Yeah, watering and changing.

816
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,340
Yeah, that's that.

817
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:39,980
Get that paper.

818
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,840
Oh, remember that one?

819
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:41,960
We can share that!

820
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,240
Oh!

821
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,620
Those were the funnier things.

822
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:46,280
Bye-bye.

823
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:46,620
Bye-bye.

824
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:46,680
Good night, Prozent.

825
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,320
Yeah, hey, darkness.

826
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,600
Good-night, Matt.

827
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:50,600


828
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:50,600


829
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:50,600


830
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:50,720
Good-night, Matt.

831
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,420
That's one of the best紥R posts I ever haven't seen.

832
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:58,440
Good-night.

833
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:58,460
Good-night.

834
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,300
You've been working on it a lot, eh?

835
00:39:59,680 --> 00:39:59,720
Yeah.

836
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,100
Go look at theütfen box, is he racing, Heove L suficiente, and Run seben Gutruf.

837
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,100


838
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,100


839
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,200
Good-night.

840
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:08,960
group of crazies there. Truby at one point answered one of those ads that you

841
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,520
see in comic books and men's magazines that say, send in your lyrics and

842
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,600
we'll turn it into a country western song, you know, for ten bucks. You get a

843
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:25,460
cassette back and they'd have put your lyrics to music. Well, he sent in a

844
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:32,860
pretty surrealistic poem and sure enough they made it into a song.

845
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:49,500
I got high last night on LSD. My mind was beautiful and I was free.

846
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,280
Warts love my nipples because they are pink.

847
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


848
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


849
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,840
Vomit on me, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah.

850
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:08,200
A blind man's penis is a wreck because he is blind. It's a wreck because he is blind.

851
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:17,420
A blind man's penis is a wreck because he's blind. It's a wreck because he's blind.

852
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,040
Let's make love under stars.

853
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,960
Watch for nipples.

854
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:37,780
Suddenly everything's going wrong. And what you gonna do about it, huh? What you gonna do to get straight, huh?

855
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:46,520
Ain't much you can do if you set all, set everything all, all messed up, out of balance.

856
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,560
You kind of get everything, feel like nothing's gonna work right. Get it, like, why'd you ever get out of bed in the morning?

857
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,440
It's worse.

858
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,940
You buying li Cross Travel.

859
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,020
But how did they do it then?

860
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,060
One seem to get like this.

861
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,560
Why, me, under a crossed rock and forest

862
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:13,520
Peace my makin', and Mr Cross is

863
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:13,520


864
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:22,960
make fun. Yeah. Oh, let's go. Let's go spray paint the graveyard. That's a good idea. Why

865
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,880
don't you go try that? Oh, let's go mess around. Let's go make a fake bleeding head

866
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:34,320
Arnold Palmer launch it. Oh, let's go set up our Bob altar and worship for aliens. Hey,

867
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:40,760
you just go ahead and do it. Hey, you just go ahead. Hell, we're in it as deep as you.

868
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:48,660
We took money for it, but we know our souls are damned. Not much we can do now, but try

869
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:58,340
to stay so fropped up. We don't think about it. And I frankly suggest that you may be

870
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:06,920
in it too deep to do otherwise yourself. Bobby, you used to Bobby ancient. Hey, you wanted

871
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,640
to be cool. You thought you'd get in with the cool set.

872
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:18,540
There was a cool set. It wouldn't let you. You just a Bobby, aren't you? We laughing at

873
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:27,620
you, boy. You just say, Hey, we, you kind of, we make fun of what's the matter. Don't

874
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:36,520
like to think about it. Huh? Don't like to think about it. She thought it'd be a good

875
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,520
idea to take acid and listen to a subgenius tape.

876
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:48,100
Hey, well, I hope you're having fun now. Pink boy. Shut up. Pink boy. That's what I said.

877
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,020
The zebra spills plastic on Venus and the gels and fingers.

878
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,540
Who's elected?

879
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:06,640
Marvis Ramona's died in hell and the Nazis want to kill the kill everyone.

880
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,520
Hey,

881
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:32,640
I'm blinded by any light. Been buried at the bottom of the dung heap so long that my

882
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:40,740
eyes are dead to any hope for a better tomorrow. Like a hideous deep sea fish. I'm going to

883
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:40,740


884
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:40,740


885
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:40,740


886
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:40,760


887
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:47,600
I have adapted to the blackest depths imaginable. Please forgive me if I perceive no light.

888
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:53,880
Been in hell so long that I'm accustomed to being berated by assholes.

889
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:07,380
I'm accustomed to being penniless and powerless forever. I'm accustomed to doing mob for mob

890
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,320
hicks.

891
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,740
I'm accustomed to being a toe-nit.

892
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:10,740


893
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,700
for incompetent dildos

894
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,660
and living on loose change

895
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,600
until Friday.

896
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,820
I am so accustomed to eating s***

897
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,280
that I am unaware of any other kind of nourishment

898
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,340
been in hell so long

899
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,620
that any escape routes are invisible to me.

900
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,580
Due to my adapted blindness

901
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:45,040
from dying in hell for so long

902
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,660
which was actually a conspiracy plot

903
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,360
which was actually a subgenius plot

904
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,860
which was actually a front for another conspiracy plot

905
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:57,060
which had been created by conspiracy robots

906
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,240
which had been created by subgenius robots

907
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,480
which in turn had been created by

908
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,600
subgenius robots

909
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,320
subgenius androids

910
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,100
which in turn had been created by

911
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,600
glowingly dark brain aliens

912
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,280
which had been created by the nine inch worm androids

913
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,300
which had been created by Kastner heads

914
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,540
which had been created by Mission Impossible team.

915
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,960
Good evening, Kilmartel.

916
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,580
Yeah, I'd like to make a reservation. Is that okay?

917
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:24,760
Reservation?

918
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:25,260
Yeah.

919
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:25,860
Okay.

920
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,480
For, uh, for what day?

921
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,980
Uh, for tonight. I'd like it.

922
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:32,740
For tonight?

923
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,180
Yes.

924
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:33,860
Okay.

925
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,100
Okay. Uh, this is for certain tribes and races of people

926
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,680
who have characteristic odors.

927
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,300
Pardon me?

928
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,900
Um, this is for certain tribes and races of people

929
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,280
who have characteristic odors.

930
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,760
Now, let me ask you this.

931
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,680
At the, um, uh, Cloud Motel, uh,

932
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,460
did the youngsters, uh, uh, find the plexiglass?

933
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,640
Uh, sir, uh, could you please, uh,

934
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,480
a little louder? I cannot hear you well.

935
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,960
Okay. Uh, let me ask you this.

936
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:00,240
Let me ask you this.

937
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,600
Uh, when you had the glassy and patchy glasses,

938
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:08,500
uh, enveloped over the retinas, uh, uh, the odor after coitus, uh,

939
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,680
was, was overwhelming.

940
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,680
Now, is that allowed at the Cloud Motel?

941
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:15,760
I don't know. Well, it's, uh, I cannot just hear you, but because it's, uh...

942
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,960
Uh, Terry, Barry, and Linda, uh, informed me that we could have had it done, uh, without surgery.

943
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,680
Is that correct?

944
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,040
That's correct.

945
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,680
Sorry, excuse me. Stay on.

946
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,040
Oops.

947
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,560
Yeah.

948
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:30,560
Yeah.

949
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:31,460
Yeah.

950
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:31,580


951
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,400
Yeah.

952
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,460
Yeah.

953
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


954
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


955
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


956
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


957
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


958
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


959
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


960
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


961
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


962
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


963
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


964
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


965
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


966
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


967
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


968
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,160
And it can be done while you sleep.

969
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,460
Yes, while you sleep.

970
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,260
One hour of positive, constructive repetition while you sleep

971
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,920
is equivalent to nine hours while you are awake.

972
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,460
Bob?

973
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,540
The message is now part of, in registers,

974
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,340
in your subconscious mind.

975
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,400
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

976
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:11,380
Bob?

977
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,160
That's your key phrase.

978
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,940
It will trigger the entire message

979
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,920
without your being aware of it.

980
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,500
Wait, wait, wait.

981
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,200
I think.

982
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:23,220
Has that happened recently, do you know?

983
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,840
All the time.

984
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,280
All the time.

985
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,840
They have to have a source of supply.

986
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,480
But where do you people get these boxes?

987
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,380
In the ground.

988
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,180
On gathering nights, all come from boxes.

989
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,960
Clothes, wood, food, all from boxes.

990
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,480
When I'm born, she be put into boxes,

991
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,680
then dug up for great eating.

992
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,440
Do you know whether they ever come out

993
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,080
into the subway tunnels of the city?

994
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,380
I think so.

995
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,040
Right on underground?

996
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,340
Underground.

997
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,600
What do you know about the underground?

998
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,440
The elders say there is much good eating underground.

999
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,140
From the far horizons of the unknown

1000
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:24,120
come transcribed tales of new dimensions in time and space.

1001
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,960
These are stories of the future, adventures

1002
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:28,820
in which you'll learn.

1003
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,580
And the future will live in a million,

1004
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:32,280
could be years, on a thousand maybe worlds.

1005
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:36,760
X minus one.

1006
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,860
Robot has landed at the foot of the tube, sir.

1007
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,460
Switch on the intercom.

1008
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,560
Robot.

1009
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,560
Robot N71.

1010
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:56,360
Identify this idea or goal and picture it clearly in your mind.

1011
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,920
Don't forget to use your drift meter.

1012
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,160
The music has gone and the mucus is up.

1013
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:01,680
Oh no.

1014
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:02,540
Hello.

1015
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,300
We're really testing colors this morning.

1016
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:04,580
Good morning.

1017
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,180
Good morning.

1018
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,020
Are you man or woman enough to take the church?

1019
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:08,500
No man has ever oppressed me.

1020
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:08,880
Yes.

1021
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,680
As a matter of fact, we're planning the overthrow of the convention.

1022
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,960
Ah, that's what we like to hear.

1023
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:14,660
That's what we hear.

1024
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,020
Ah, true.

1025
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:15,640
Yes, yes.

1026
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,360
Kill Bob.

1027
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,580
Meanwhile, they are yours to inspect in the privacy of your own home, shop, office,

1028
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,020
den for 20 years or express permission already withdrawn by the Polk, McKinley, Harding,

1029
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:25,800
Dobbs, Coolidge, Mint.

1030
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,340
They will be returned to the convention in a few days.

1031
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:26,340


1032
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,960
We only may authorize stamp your application with its own seal.

1033
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,260
Looks easy, doesn't it?

1034
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,400
But it won't come off.

1035
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,720
Yeah, exactly.

1036
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,520
We were right the day we started this thing.

1037
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,740
Yes, that's why they shot it on your right because, uh...

1038
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:36,940
Yes.

1039
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,180
How long are you guys going to be on?

1040
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,200
Uh, we're going to be on until they throw us out.

1041
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,200
Or kill me!

1042
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,040
Or kill me!

1043
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,800
But there it went.

1044
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,280
The owl.

1045
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,720
The wallow in our intellectual omnipotence.

1046
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,820
Doug shorted the show out and spent the whole thing in one little three second buzz.

1047
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,820
Sorry, I didn't use up all of our tangible effects.

1048
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,320
Stay there until you find the right place.

1049
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:56,320


1050
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:56,320


1051
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:56,320


1052
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:56,320


1053
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,540
When you fall asleep, that means we're off the air.

1054
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,600
When you quit listening to us, we'll no longer be there.

1055
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,840
You have to make the primordial matter of nature stand up and salute.

1056
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:14,960
Hey, Bob.

1057
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:15,860
Woo!

1058
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:18,780
Yeah!

1059
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,500
Give me some of that.

1060
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:21,720
Yes!

1061
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,480
Yeah!

1062
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,200
Yeah!

1063
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:24,800
Yeah!

1064
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:25,600
Yeah!

1065
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,260
Yeah!

1066
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:26,260


1067
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:26,260


1068
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:26,280


1069
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:26,280


1070
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:26,280


1071
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:26,280


1072
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:26,280


1073
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:26,280


1074
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:26,280


1075
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:26,280


1076
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,560

00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:40,260


1082
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,800
Do you want to talk to him?

1083
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,540
I still want to talk to him!

1084
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:49,240

1085
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:49,240


1086
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,400

somebody

1136
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,700
In a moment, even now, reciting.

1137
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,160
I play it for my friends.

1138
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,360
They all think I'm cool.

1139
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,580
In the mind you've convinced yourself you possess.

1140
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,500
Soon to be replaced.

1141
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,700
At your request.

1142
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,880
Was it worth it?

1143
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,640
Was it really worth it in the end?

1144
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,600
Oh.

1145
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,880
This soul water we squeezed out of you tastes real good.

1146
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:36,900
Even at this moment, your consciousness is sending emissaries.

1147
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:40,880
Fugitives.

1148
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,720
Listen to them souls flying by.

1149
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,360
Arguing this very moment.

1150
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,500
You're going to end up like that, boy.

1151
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,820
Arguing with sweetie.

1152
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,440
The elder gods.

1153
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,060
They think they're civilized.

1154
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:00,780
They think their civilized sciences can explain away the forces.

1155
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,620
The parchment is signed.

1156
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,200
By your willingness to participate.

1157
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,080
In keeping us afloat.

1158
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:14,900
Just a little bit longer.

1159
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,800
You did sign the application.

1160
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:21,480
People say that life is good.

1161
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,280
Yeah, thanks for what you have.

1162
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,540
When all you have is nothing.

1163
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,800
Nothing makes you glad.

1164
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,040
People say that life is fun.

1165
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,480
But I don't know why.

1166
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:41,020
As far as I can tell.

1167
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,860
Life sucks.

1168
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:44,460
Then you die.

1169
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,760
It's the man in the White House.

1170
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,620
The man under the steeple.

1171
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,320
Passing out drugs.

1172
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,320
To the American people.

1173
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,480
I don't believe in anything.

1174
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,120
Nothing is free.

1175
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,100
They're feeding our people that government cheese.

1176
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,560
Turn to the 80's, idiot.

1177
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,720
Idiot, idiot.

1178
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,480
What you see is what you get.

1179
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:08,780
What you get, what you get.

1180
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,060
Listen to 80's good things.

1181
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:12,860
Don't forget the golden rule.

1182
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,580
What you see is what you get.

1183
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,800
What you get, what you get.

1184
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,160
What the hell you do is fat.

1185
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,240
What you get, what you get.

1186
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,580
Richie Redrose.

1187
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:20,940
Richie Redrose.

1188
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:21,280
Richie Redrose.

1189
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,620
White puppy noses.

1190
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:24,880
Richie Redrose.

1191
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,160
Men with rubber hoses.

1192
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,080
Go from here.

1193
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,280
Or if you obey society's rules.

1194
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:31,420
Or if you obey society's rules.

1195
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,760
You will be society's fools.

1196
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,680
You will be society's fools.

1197
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:35,680


1198
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,120
You will obey.

1199
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,220
And then disobey.

1200
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:37,840
And then disobey.

1201
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,640
You'll disobey, but then you'll obey.

1202
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,340
You'll disobey, but then you'll obey.

1203
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,040
It's a beautiful world we live in.

1204
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,680
A sweet romantic place

1205
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,760
Beautiful people everywhere

1206
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:59,320
The way they show they care

1207
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,460
Makes me want to say

1208
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:04,280
Hey, we can't really be dumb

1209
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,060
If we're just following God's orders

1210
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,580
Let's get serious

1211
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,320
God knows what he's doing

1212
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,760
He wrote this book here

1213
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,960
And the book says

1214
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:15,360
He made us all to be just like him

1215
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,080
So if we're dumb

1216
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,180
Then God is dumb

1217
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:22,440
And maybe even a little ugly on the side

1218
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:26,740
Dumb all over

1219
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:29,220
A little ugly on the side

1220
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,860
Who makes the rules?

1221
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,820
If someone else

1222
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,340
Who makes the rules?

1223
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,220
Someone else

1224
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,540
I see them go to work

1225
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,080
I see them go to sleep

1226
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,360
I see them on TV

1227
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,100
I see them laugh and cry

1228
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,460
I'm on the outside

1229
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,020
I'm on the outside

1230
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,380
I'm on the outside

1231
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,500
Manic depression

1232
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,940
Is touching my soul

1233
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:00,760
I know what I want

1234
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,120
But I just don't know

1235
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,720
How to go about getting

1236
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,120
Declined and fall

1237
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,500
Fall down and be there

1238
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,060
Declined and fall

1239
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,480
I said fall way down there

1240
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,660
I've been caught inside a deep sleep

1241
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,160
See me fall down and be there

1242
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:19,160


1243
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:20,660
Thinking deeper after I forgot

1244
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:21,940
That a smile

1245
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,560
Is just a frown

1246
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,920
Turned around

1247
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,380
On the face of a clown

1248
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:28,480
With a mean sleep

1249
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,660
In my deep sleep

1250
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,320
A very deep sleep

1251
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,480
Sleepwalking as I watch myself

1252
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,900
In a deep sleep

1253
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,500
An endless deep sleep

1254
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,880
I keep pretending that it's someone else

1255
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,040
I'm on the outside

1256
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,740
I'm on the outside

1257
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:49,120
Now

1258
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,100
This is where it all begins

1259
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,200
Life sucks
