1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,400
It's on every station. Get a trace on that signal. Now!

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,600
The other officers quickly take up the slack.

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,280
That's how big it was. It could be seen for miles and miles around.

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, here's the king's command.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,440
I'm going to command all these musicians to start playing their musical instruments,

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:32,260
and as soon as they start playing the music, you are to fall down and bow down in front of that great image, 90 feet high, and pray to it.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:46,220
I'm not giving in to a smile or a grin on a face I might never see again.

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,800
I'm not going to fly in some big, phony sky.

9
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:01,060
On a life that I know just can't win.

10
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,720
Yes, Bob, you rang?

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,200
Am I a lousy picker?

12
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,040
Whatever.

13
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:15,380
I analyze it and assess it thoroughly, and then I make my prediction on the air, and I pick the opposite.

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:15,940
Me too.

15
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,640
I stand on my record.

16
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,420
But one thing I shared with you this afternoon is that Bobby didn't listen.

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,000
And I'm thankful now that he didn't.

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,860
And hopefully, if you've got a negative spouse, you're not listening to them either, because he didn't listen to me.

19
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,240
And he went about and built the business, because he saw something in it.

20
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,400
A friend of his or an acquaintance of his had shown him the plan, and I won't bust his bubble.

21
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,360
That's his part of the story.

22
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,060
Well, Mr. Stang, it was an almost foolproof plan.

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,780
But let us look to the next paragraph of prophecy, which says,

24
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,440
Dateline for Dominance, 1991, first paragraph.

25
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,500
And I quote,

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,180
World War III.

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,920
Church of the subgenius shifts into Operation Removal.

28
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,580
End quote.

29
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,980
Now, admittedly, dear friends, that leaves open some room for interpretation.

30
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,720
And just what is Operation Removal designated to remove?

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:25,300
Well, knowing Bob, he'd want to remove the very concept of removal.

32
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,700
I suppose Bob told you that his plan has been approved, and recruiting is about to open.

33
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,340
You once offered to help us find the right sort of recruits.

34
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,320
How many men do you need?

35
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,320
I thought you'd say that.

36
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
We'll need 1,100 men to begin with.

37
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,660
I'm in this thing any way you can use me.

38
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,540
Looking forward to it, Mr. Stang.

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,400
The Pharaohs

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,580
The Pharaohs

41
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:46,680
The Pharaohs

42
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,680


43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,680


44
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,680


45
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,680


46
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,680


47
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,680


48
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,680


49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,680


50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,680


51
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,680


52
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,060
And now the little numbers are counting up again.

53
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,360
Ah.

54
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,600
And we are back with another hour of slack.

55
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,760
This one sounds lively.

56
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,680
Fill in your lack.

57
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,020
Because it's the kind men lack.

58
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,740
The kind that renews one's vital strength.

59
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,860
So, yes, we're back still at Wisteria.

60
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,820
Campground.

61
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,620
They're broadcasting from a picnic table.

62
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,060
But it's no picnic, ladies and gentlemen, although there are plenty of Argentine ants.

63
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,360
Is that what kind of ants those are?

64
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,900
Yes, they are the small soldiers that migrate through this region at this time.

65
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,960
The Shemimedons of the Argentine ant group.

66
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,340
But they're one or Parker?

67
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,760
Some nests are larger than entire U.S. states.

68
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,060
Wow.

69
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,700
I'm not sure.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,460
I'm not sure.

71
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,040
I'm not sure.

72
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,780
Really?

73
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,340
Yes.

74
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,580
Argentina ants.

75
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,160
Montana or Rhode Island?

76
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,020
That's like a brain.

77
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,800
That's like a hive mind on the side of Rhode Island.

78
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,200
Yeah, you don't want to mess with those ants, mister.

79
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,980
Or else my...

80
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,860
Off-brand Dawn dishwashing liquid.

81
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,040
That kills the hell out of them suckers.

82
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,400
Plenty more where they came from.

83
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,780
I go out there and I go to Dollar Tree.

84
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,700
I get a bunch of that off-brand...

85
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,380
I-Dollar Tree.

86
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:08,780
Dollar Tree?

87
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,640
You heard it.

88
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,240
Dollar Tree, Dollar Tree.

89
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,320
I take that and I just pour it on the ant hills.

90
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,840
And then I hit it with my...

91
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,360
With the hose, nice and slow.

92
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,200
And it's genocide.

93
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,260
That's how I get my kicks.

94
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,860
I'd rather be killing pinks, but they got laws.

95
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,760
You know, that's funny because I rescued a June bug this morning.

96
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,500
Yes, Dr. Stang is Buddhistical and respects all life.

97
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,880
Well, until X-Day.

98
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,700
Until this coming Sunday morning when I'll try to remember

99
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,280
to exterminate most life, or at least human life.

100
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,080
I don't mind most of the ant.

101
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,820
To scour the planet clean to make it ready for what is to come.

102
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,660
We're going to de-bride it, essentially.

103
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,580
Oh, I like that word, de-bride the planet.

104
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,020
Yeah.

105
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,240
It seems like that would hurt.

106
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,200
Oh, yeah.

107
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,620
Scraping...

108
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,700
We're going to scrape that first few...

109
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,240
That's like scaling a fish.

110
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,420
Like scraping below the gum line.

111
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,360
It's kind of like de-clawing a cat, but through the skin.

112
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,520
So we just scrape everything off down to the mantle.

113
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,500
Yeah.

114
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,340
Dermabrasion.

115
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,300
Is that the right word?

116
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,660
It might be.

117
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,920
Anyway, our hostess, Charlene, told me that this area, also known as the outback of Ohio,

118
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:38,320
I learned, is higher in animal and plant diversity than most places in the whole world.

119
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,760
Outside, of course, the Amazon jungle.

120
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,420
How high is the animal and plant life here?

121
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,620
I know the raccoons must be ripped because they, oh, don't leave any food out.

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,880
Those suckers will eat anything when they're stoned.

123
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,460
There are more kinds of poisonous ants, spiders, and reptiles in this area than you'll ever

124
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,860
get to be stung by again.

125
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,200
Oh, they promise.

126
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,160
So enjoy it while you're here.

127
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,820
Of course, maybe on Planet X we'll be exposed to all new varmints, critters, and parasites.

128
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:12,960
Yes.

129
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,260
Not the French.

130
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,300
And we will have to adapt to its biota.

131
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:26,980
There will be some cross-species pollination, but frankly, the odds are in their favor,

132
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,720
not ours.

133
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,080
But we represent all of Earth that we brought with us.

134
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,160
All that's in our bodies is the substance of the Earth.

135
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,880
Now, the fact is, no one's really ever sent anyone to Mars or off Earth.

136
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,300
Well, nobody who's talking.

137
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,280
For a significantly long period.

138
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,660
But every time they try to create something like a biosphere, it always turns into a puddle

139
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,300
of glup.

140
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,860
Yeah.

141
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,760
Because we can't keep that going.

142
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,540
And it's not certain that if you took a human off Earth, the human could survive being away

143
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,320
from the rest of the biosphere.

144
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,180
Didn't they, like, let that Pauly Shore guy in that one?

145
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,600
Well, that was, uh, he's hardly human, but it at least examined the idea.

146
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,680
He's microbial.

147
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,780
The thing is, we need to figure out how to create a terrarium for humans to live in.

148
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,360
Then we can go into outer space.

149
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,640
We can't let the terrariums win.

150
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,420
The terrariums will lose, is the problem, because they don't have the special ingredients

151
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,800
that we don't know how to put in.

152
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,780
Right.

153
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,080
Not paying on the plants?

154
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,860
And this affects off Earth travel to a significant degree.

155
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,080
Well, think of those poor sumbitches up in the International Space Station right now.

156
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,040
They...

157
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,220
They missed the last two deliveries, supply deliveries.

158
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:44,880
Whoa.

159
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,940
Blew up on the launch pad.

160
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,540
Yes, that Russian spaceship went out of control.

161
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,420
It rolled.

162
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,780
It, uh...

163
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,280
Yawned and pitching.

164
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,540
They're eating each other yet?

165
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,680
But yeah, those guys haven't had a new playboy in, like, six months.

166
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,980
They haven't been able to think of the...

167
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,060
Well, I understand the space station just stinks to high heaven.

168
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,840
It is like the inside of a submarine.

169
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,060
No body...

170
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,400
No body emission, uh, ever goes away.

171
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:19,560
But, uh, the thing about it is that they are being supplied by the nearby Earth.

172
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,180
They're in low Earth orbit.

173
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,720
And when you go farther away, you're really going to have to have some other method of

174
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,140
supply.

175
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,260
And those supplies have to be essential.

176
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:37,500
It can't just be your little hydroponic garden in the, uh, side room there.

177
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,780
It's going to have to be fairly major.

178
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,100
Just a word to the wise.

179
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,300
So everyone get ready.

180
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,980
At least we allow you to take more than one suitcase, unlike, uh, certain other groups.

181
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,000
Are there cults that only let you take one suitcase?

182
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,360
Well, you know that one.

183
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,780
When the world ends?

184
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,760
The, uh...

185
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
The Roller Quarters.

186
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,020
Who were the...

187
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,820
Who was that group that let you take one suitcase that you put at the foot of your bed?

188
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,500
Um, um...

189
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:06,980
Heaven's Gate?

190
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,860
No, I don't think they had a suitcase.

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,120
The Jarvis Witnesses?

192
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,020
No, they had a Roller Quarters and a Furry Nikes.

193
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,680
The ones with...

194
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,980
Abnorm Nihil has entered the campground.

195
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:14,860
Woohoo!

196
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,200
I just saw the truck of Reverend Abnorm.

197
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,200


198
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,080
They called themselves Me and My or something?

199
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,160
Uh, the leader of the cult, uh...

200
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,960
Bo and Peep?

201
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,120
Bo and Peep, perhaps.

202
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,160
That became, uh...

203
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,560
Dove?

204
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,180
Heaven's Gate.

205
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,700
Bo was the same as Dove.

206
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,780
Well, they allowed...

207
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,100
He wanted to be like Bob Dobbs, but he was so cheap, he could only be Bo Dove.

208
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,540
Oh, Dove.

209
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:43,620
They let them take one suitcase of, uh, undergarments with them into the next world.

210
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,860
Wow, were they Mormons?

211
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:52,740
No, these cultists for the movement to restore the Ten Commandments of Bob, or whatever it was.

212
00:09:52,760 --> 00:10:00,600
Now, when I heard that a saucer cult in San Diego had gone toes up, I was so sure it was Ruth Norman and Unarius.

213
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,460
It wasn't the Unarians.

214
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,680
Uh, we got a lot of phone calls when the Heaven's Gate thing happened.

215
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,640
I could just imagine those two people...

216
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,300
I thought, I thought, subgeniuses killed themselves.

217
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,540
...running into each other.

218
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,800
If they'd been wearing Bob shirts, now that, everything would be different.

219
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,280
Those Bob shirts would have repelled.

220
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,400
But instead, Nike gets all the credit.

221
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:14,660
Yeah.

222
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,840
Just do it.

223
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,700
They did it all right.

224
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,480
Oh, God.

225
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,880
Yeah, I think, aren't you all lucky that we, that Bob got to you before Heaven's Gate?

226
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,680
Now, think about it.

227
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,020
Yeah.

228
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,680
That was just...

229
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,320
There was one subgenius I actually talked out of joining them.

230
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,560
Well, the year before X Day.

231
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,380
Or was it just before X Day?

232
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,760
Uh...

233
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,480
Was it 97 or 98?

234
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:36,620
I don't know.

235
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:36,620


236
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:36,620


237
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:36,620


238
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:36,620


239
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:36,620


240
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:45,200
Well, I know it was just before a, uh, Survival Research Lab's performance in Austin, the

241
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,300
next day, which...

242
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,460
Wow.

243
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,940
...I went to to sell swag, but I was miserable because I'd been up the entire night before

244
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,840
making a takeoff on the Heaven's Gate website.

245
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:04,320
The Heaven's Gate people all hit the news, and within about three hours, Fernanda and

246
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,300
Andy Lemire...

247
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:05,880
Oh, yes.

248
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,860
and bobbed up their main artwork.

249
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,620
And I then took that and put it on our website.

250
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,720
So we had the first Heaven's Gate parody site up within one day.

251
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,260
And that actually helped our business quite a bit.

252
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,720
When you Googled Heaven's Gate,

253
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,620
suddenly there was something subgenius in the mix.

254
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,640
If only they'd known, that would be the entire result of their activity.

255
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,280
So friends, you can see what you all obviously need to do

256
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,960
to help the church get more PR.

257
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,080
Convince somebody to kill themselves,

258
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,160
a whole bunch of people, preferably,

259
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,280
in such a way that it makes the news.

260
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,460
I remember Pope S. Lilith used to suggest

261
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,020
jumping off of a highway overpass onto a truck

262
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,440
with a bob shirt on,

263
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,520
so that when you hit the windshield and died,

264
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,620
the driver would have the...

265
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,080
Great, you know, smashed bob shirt chest facing him.

266
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,080
Product placement.

267
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,340
And it would sound good, you know, on the news soundbite.

268
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,880
Oh my God, it was so horrible.

269
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,660
He hit my truck and all I could see was that scary pipe man

270
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,680
grinning head staring at me.

271
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,640
Too many variables.

272
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,660
With bones poking out through it

273
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,480
and spurting blood out the pipe.

274
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,240
Not an easily achievable plan.

275
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,800
Here is the image of the...

276
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,880
There has been a rash of suicides on highways.

277
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,200
All people wearing a silly shirt.

278
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,120
With a comfortable itchy rash behind.

279
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,260
We can't figure out what the beaver's dad has to do with this.

280
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,800
Except that he must be responsible in some way.

281
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,740
As his entire clade of heterosexual,

282
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,840
white, male, republican pipe smoking.

283
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,380
Pipe smoking.

284
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,080
Pipe smoking is significant.

285
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,320
He's in the lost continent with Cesar Romero,

286
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,680
John Hoyt, Sid Melton,

287
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,860
Whit Bissell, Aquanetta.

288
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,020
Is it really healthy that you're able to reel out

289
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,920
the entire cast of a movie like that?

290
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,760
Is that good or is that bad?

291
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,160
Not an insignificant movie.

292
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,460
And he's not autistic, right?

293
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,360
Remember, they are searching for a rocket

294
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,780
full of a special atomic load

295
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,540
which just happened to crash on top of a mountain

296
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,980
populated by badly animated dinosaurs.

297
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:32,980
Hmm.

298
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,180
Hey, but at least it's dinosaurs.

299
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:35,860
Yeah.

300
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,640
Yes, that's right.

301
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,840
So it's caused me to drag myself to it again and again.

302
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,860
Even badly animated dinosaurs are excellent.

303
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,300
They are.

304
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,820
Well, they're badly animated,

305
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,400
but they have their moments over there.

306
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,760
They're charming.

307
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,460
Moments are few.

308
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,840
Well, they're charming, yes, in their own way.

309
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,860
So at least the Triceratops eats Sid Melton.

310
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:53,780
Mm.

311
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,360
And he deserves it.

312
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,740
Now, which is the movie that has people in dinosaur suits?

313
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,720
Is that The Land Unknown?

314
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,120
The Land Unknown.

315
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,720
The Land Unknown Island.

316
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,760
More than Land Unknown, but yes, there is the terrible dinosaur suit in The Land Unknown.

317
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,980
Is that the one later that used the head for under the stairs for Spot on the monsters?

318
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,800
That was The Land Unknown.

319
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,460
That was Spot.

320
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:22,240
The Land Unknown Tyrannosaurus became Spot on the monsters under the stairway.

321
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,440
Bimbo knew something.

322
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,660
It was the head of that monster, which Universal owned.

323
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,860
I love my monsters.

324
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,320
So how about the thing that was a disembodied hand?

325
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,440
Whose hand was that?

326
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,780
Was that part of The Beast with Five Fingers, or...?

327
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,600
I think they borrowed that from Dr. T.

328
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,320
It was a different one.

329
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,900
He wouldn't miss it.

330
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,880
A different hand.

331
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,140
The Beast with Five Fingers.

332
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,900
Well, there was a famous British horror story,

333
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:57,080
but the whole movie is the hand bothering Peter Lorre and making him sweat and his eyes pop out.

334
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,120
Wasn't that him?

335
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,540
The hideous hand.

336
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,520
The hand.

337
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,200
Creeping.

338
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:01,540


339
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:01,880
Creeping.

340
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,300
Creeping.

341
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,300


342
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,300


343
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,300


344
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,300


345
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,300


346
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,300


347
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,300


348
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,300


349
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,300


350
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,300


351
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,300


352
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,300


353
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,300


354
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,300


355
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,300


356
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,600
I'll play a piano sonata for the left hand.

357
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
But, uh, yeah.

358
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,600
The Beast with Five Fingers is a horror story many people should read.

359
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:17,080
People ought to read those horror tales that were the basis for so many movies later on.

360
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,760
Some have never been filmed, and they are among the most horrendous of all.

361
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,580
Like the hideous ash tree of M.R. James.

362
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:32,300
Was there ever, like, a gay porno version of The Beast with Five Fingers?

363
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,340
I'm trying not to go there, Sam.

364
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,720
Get Clive Barker to work on it.

365
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,740
I'm trying to show some resolve here.

366
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,920
The Beast.

367
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,760
The Beast.

368
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,940
The Beast with Five Fingers.

369
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,080
Keep telling yourself it couldn't be real.

370
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,440
Or could it?

371
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,000
Could it?

372
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,620
Could it?

373
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,060
Could it?

374
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,100
Here it comes.

375
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,020
The crawling hand.

376
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,320
Closer and closer.

377
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,160
It's getting into your...

378
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,760
And snow!

379
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:09,940
A similar crawling ambulatory hand was seen in the movie Doctor Terror's House of Horrors,

380
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,640
where it tormented Christopher Lee.

381
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,320
One night, he was driving along the road, and it got on the windshield.

382
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,160
That's hardcore.

383
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,420
Dodging the windshield wiper as it tossed back and forth,

384
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,160
causing him to react in horror and go off the road.

385
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
Urging you to let go.

386
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,280
Yes.

387
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,240
Well, you know, back of the wheel.

388
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,300
I've got a cool idea for Joseph and Polly.

389
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:40,680
When the rupture comes, we could trick Christians into thinking it was the rapture gone wrong.

390
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:47,240
If we play our cards right, for instance, we get up into our escape vessels and orient ourselves,

391
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,820
and then tell Mom, okay, take us back in time a little bit.

392
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,580
Okay, that's easy so far.

393
00:16:53,580 --> 00:17:00,660
We hover over cities full of pinks and program the thing to disintegrate all the pinks below,

394
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,060
except for their hands.

395
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,720
Which stay alive and go crawling around.

396
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,680
So, we'd have to leave...

397
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,140
Okay, you disintegrate...

398
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,180
I don't know about this one.

399
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,760
You leave a certain percentage of Christians alive.

400
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,580
The excess computers can do that.

401
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,540
Leave the noses.

402
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,440
Hands and noses.

403
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:18,920
So that...

404
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,720
No, not the hands.

405
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,900
Only if...

406
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,180
It's like maybe one out of every ten Christians is still around.

407
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,540
Don't want to jerk off.

408
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,520
They're standing in a shopping mall.

409
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,260
Suddenly, all these people are screaming and bursting into flames and rising up to heaven.

410
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,220
But their hands and noses...

411
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,120
Are still laying scattered all over the shopping mall.

412
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,300
What a...

413
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,400
And God, that would freak them out.

414
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,980
They'd be so...

415
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,420
Conflicted, you know?

416
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,100
Am I sorry I didn't get taken up?

417
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,440
Or am I glad I didn't get taken up?

418
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,820
They can still pick their noses.

419
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,300
There you go.

420
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,340
You can pick your friends and you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friends' nose.

421
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,660
They can't pick the apocalypse.

422
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,480
The nose picker will be at the judgment.

423
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,460
Mmm.

424
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,640
Not the nose picker.

425
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,380
The disgusting spectacle.

426
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,620
Starring Lance Hendrickson.

427
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,560
And Ken Tobey.

428
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,920
Yes, Ken Tobey.

429
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,880
As the gruff guy.

430
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,800
He's always the gruff guy.

431
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,480
You know, there's a scene in Inner Space where he comes into the bathroom and...

432
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,120
Wow.

433
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
Martin Short is trying to relieve himself.

434
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:27,900
Wait a minute.

435
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,940
Did you see this?

436
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,900
Ancient Tobey.

437
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,980
Yeah, well, he comes in and he's...

438
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,180
Martin Short is addressing himself and he thinks he's talking to his penis,

439
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:42,440
but he's talking to the tiny submarine inside his veins containing Dennis Quaid.

440
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,820
Whoa.

441
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,560
You know, I've noticed something about subgenius radio conversations.

442
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,960
One minute you're talking about huge worldwide events and history in the making,

443
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,060
and then the next five minutes you're talking about some totally obscure crappy movie.

444
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,300
It's like a trip down the rabbit hole, but we shoot...

445
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,820
We shoot our own holes in the rabbit and go through those, so...

446
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,640
To which I would reply that all language is metaphorical,

447
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:17,780
and these Bulldada-esque movies do accurately prefigure our own predicament to an astonishing degree.

448
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:25,900
Could we only understand and interpret them instead of dismissing them like the Pinks do?

449
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,880
Those who can't remember old movies repeat their history.

450
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,240
Yeah, that's what we think.

451
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,220
How about you?

452
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,220
You know, your opinions are important to us.

453
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,760
Let us hear from you about the contents of this broadcast.

454
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,720
We love to read your letters.

455
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,160
Aloud, on the air, and sneer at them.

456
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,680
I actually rarely get any kind of letters,

457
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,200
but I did get a letter sent in the mail from a guy in Cleveland who'd been listening to the Hour of Slack broadcast.

458
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,520
For the first time, and it was such a good letter that I read it on the air.

459
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,440
Uh-huh. Well, that's what you do.

460
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,200
If you get a letter, you read it on the air by George, especially if they enclose a check in...

461
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,900
Well, they were jacking me off like crazy, so of course.

462
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,540
Yeah, sure. But naturally, you want to give them back something to respond to.

463
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,120
I kind of ignore that. I try to distance myself from it.

464
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,120
I think of doing the show as like...

465
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,760
You don't bring everything to a screeching halt and say,

466
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,020
and now it's time for Susie's mailbag.

467
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,340
Well, diddling with the curtains open.

468
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,880
And if people want to stop by and look in, if I don't know they're out there,

469
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,200
I'll be doing a better job of it.

470
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,180
I'll be putting a little English on it.

471
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,260
You know, everyone will get a treat.

472
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,920
Well, now, when you leave the radio...

473
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,020
Don't make noises when you're out there in the bushes.

474
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,520
That's all I ask.

475
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,800
When you leave the radio station, aren't there a whole bunch of cars parked out there

476
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,400
with creepy guys inside eyeballing you?

477
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,740
That's not normal.

478
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,960
Then following you home to your...

479
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,640
Oh, they're the ones I see all over.

480
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,900
Those are your only friends.

481
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:57,780
Yep.

482
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,260
Just Susie stalkers.

483
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,480
They're anxious to carry your trousseau.

484
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,620
Mm-hmm.

485
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,320
Maybe to go home and clean up your bathroom.

486
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:13,260
You know, I get letters asking for pictures of Susie.

487
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,560
You used to.

488
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,780
No, I still do.

489
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,800
But there's these mentally ill guys that have been asking for pictures of Susie for 20 years now.

490
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,900
Well, now, when Jesus was running things,

491
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,320
he used to write love letters back to guys at the Atlanta Pen in my name

492
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,840
and send them pictures I seem to recall.

493
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,080
No.

494
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:32,300
No.

495
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,400
No.

496
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,920
Because I had quite the following out there I found out after the fact.

497
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,260
Well, I imagine so.

498
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,520
But who else needs more slack?

499
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,300
I mean, imagine these poor guys, they haven't seen a woman in five years

500
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,600
except for that one blonde that's trying to help them escape,

501
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,800
the one that gives every prisoner a handjob.

502
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,420
I'm kind of scary to be, you know, the focus.

503
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,320
It's like it's warping.

504
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,640
Wait until those guys are let out of the pen.

505
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,420
It's cruel and unusual masturbatory punishment.

506
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,240
Why?

507
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,400
They'll make a beeline for your place.

508
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:04,900
Yeah, they're going to go ahead.

509
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,580
They're going to look up the address of WREK Atlanta.

510
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,400
They're one of the greatest stations in the universe, by the way.

511
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,220
It is.

512
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,740
Among the last of the great college stations.

513
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,900
It's just, it's, damn.

514
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,960
People don't recognize how important it is to have college radio

515
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,120
because it's the last place where you can hear good stuff

516
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,060
that wasn't being forced onto the airways.

517
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,240
It's the last place where you can hear good stuff that wasn't being forced onto the airways

518
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,780
by the conspiracy.

519
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,120
WCSB and WRUW in Cleveland, you know, our friends in Germany,

520
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,420
that's all they listen to is our college radio stations.

521
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,260
And it's getting suborned right and left.

522
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,900
Because even in Germany, the conspiracy took over.

523
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,840
Yes, everywhere.

524
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,920
It makes it more precious.

525
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,400
And most college stations are just imitations of conspiracy stations.

526
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,720
They don't let people go wild like they do at our wonderful stations.

527
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,940
And fire.

528
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,680
Find WORT in Madison.

529
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,780
Even though I've been told they sometimes talk over the hour of slack.

530
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,920
Well, that would be a terrible solecism.

531
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,720
They're tattling on you.

532
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,540
They seem to feel that it's all background shatter.

533
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,360
The background noise of the universe.

534
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,160
In which a small signal may sometimes be found.

535
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,420
And now at your station, KPFA, which is not a college station,

536
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,640
but one of the biggest.

537
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,180
The biggest, oldest community stations.

538
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:40,100
But there are envious ears who covet our wavelength and our strong signal.

539
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,940
KPFA got the patty first communiques.

540
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,360
And perhaps they might.

541
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Because despite our history of innovation,

542
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:58,380
who can resist that non-existent, invisible, supernatural force known as money?

543
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,260
Or Jesus.

544
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,440
In Dallas, it was the Christians that wanted to take our airwaves.

545
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,480
And so we had to really be careful about cussing and naughty rap songs and stuff.

546
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,180
Because we had people listening and wanting to report us.

547
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,180
Because Aunt Bertha would give you a bad review.

548
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,860
It just makes you more insidious.

549
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,500
Not unlike the saying.

550
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,480
You become worse, but better at it.

551
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,920
I thrive in an atmosphere of repression.

552
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,260
Well, where do you think the church is?

553
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:31,620
Subjects?

554
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,580
Where did that genius come from?

555
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:32,960
Yeah.

556
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,740
You know.

557
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,360
I haven't done anything worth beans in the latest regime.

558
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,660
It's like, you know, Bill Clinton was president.

559
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,640
It was like punching a drunk who was laughing at you while you were doing it.

560
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,040
There's just no sport in it.

561
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,420
Somebody like George Bush.

562
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,820
Oh, my God.

563
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,880
What a character.

564
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,060
Yes, I still have your giant George Bush joke.

565
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,080
Think if Mike Huckabee or Rick Santorum was our next president.

566
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,620
We'd be in high cotton.

567
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,800
We would.

568
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,980
We'd be so repressed.

569
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,620
We'd rip.

570
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:01,620


571
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:01,620


572
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,180
We'd really be good.

573
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,180
We would have an enemy worth fighting again.

574
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,340
Mike Huckabee said that he wanted to make it illegal for men to go topless

575
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,360
because he's so worried about women going topless.

576
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,240
Damn straight.

577
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,060
What if that guy became president?

578
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,020
Not that he will.

579
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,540
Well, our shows would become funnier.

580
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,600
Then you guys can feel as dirty when you take it off as we do.

581
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,280
And so you're going to vote for Huckabee then?

582
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:25,900
You bet.

583
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,480
Give me that repression.

584
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,860
I want to break some laws, damn it.

585
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:37,420
But what about all the Bible belting and religious mumbling that comes along with Huckabee?

586
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,720
She's already in Atlanta.

587
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:39,720
Yeah.

588
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,000
Well, there is that.

589
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,200
The birthplace of Coca-Cola in 1886.

590
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,080
And Waffle House.

591
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,600
It first flowed forth from the fountains in Atlanta.

592
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,280
Some Pemberton guy.

593
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,340
Yes.

594
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,920
Atlanta is the birthplace of Waffle House also.

595
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,780
Waffles.

596
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,220
Wow.

597
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,780
There's more Waffle Houses per square mile in that area.

598
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,780
Than anywhere else.

599
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,500
Potter Nostril found a map.

600
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,300
Hundreds.

601
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,000
Do you remember that?

602
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,280
Hundreds in Atlanta.

603
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,980
Waffle House clusters that pack a wallop in the culinary world.

604
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,900
It's like a pattern of disease vectors that the CDC would release.

605
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,200
They're so close together.

606
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,720
And this is true all the way down the coast in Mississippi.

607
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:25,760
The Waffle Houses are so close together that from every Waffle House you can see the next Waffle House.

608
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,460
And just follow them like a dotted line.

609
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,300
That must be reassuring.

610
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,080
To perdition.

611
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:38,360
That is helpful to soothe the restless spirits of those who patronize waffle establishments.

612
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,980
And when you don't see the Waffle Houses, you are at the ends of the earth.

613
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:51,400
And then after consuming a large mass of waffles with syrup and so forth, they come and they ask you if you want dessert.

614
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,200
Pah.

615
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,780
P-A-H.

616
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,820
I had to defend Waffle House to you.

617
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:05,180
You hadn't been in one for so long that you were mixing them up with some thin coffee cup shelled cafe.

618
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:05,780
Yeah, yeah.

619
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,020
Well, they used to have thin coffee cups.

620
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,380
Those white glass things.

621
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,740
No, they're unbreakable now.

622
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,480
You could kill a policeman with them.

623
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,800
I like those big mugs.

624
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,480
Yeah.

625
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,680
There's an idea.

626
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,220
And they didn't have the gum-snapping waitress in most of them.

627
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,380
Only now her gum-snapping is no longer friendly.

628
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,840
I like the world-weary, tough-talking waitress.

629
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:25,820
Yes.

630
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,900
I miss the chain-smoking waitresses.

631
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,560
Oh, God.

632
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,540
They were eloquent.

633
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,320
So I kind of have Stockholm Syndrome about Waffle House, and it's partly your fault.

634
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,100
Duh.

635
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,120
Everybody flames it on me.

636
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,220
Some guy with money flew me and Jesus into Atlanta.

637
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,760
Yeah, James Charnitsky.

638
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,320
Okay.

639
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:52,120
Well, he put us in a motel that we didn't have a car, and we were in a motel in the middle of nowhere, and the only place to eat was Waffle House, and we were there for four or five days.

640
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,460
So I memorized the menu.

641
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,940
I can tell.

642
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,280
I can rattle off smothers.

643
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,380
Smothered scones.

644
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,220
Yeah, right.

645
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:07,100
It was made up that way memorably because a lot of the people that they hired were illiterate.

646
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:08,900
Yeah.

647
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:15,380
And so, yeah, a lot of the lingo came from that to make it more memorable since they weren't able to write it down.

648
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,320
They could remember it scattered pretty easily.

649
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,900
Oh, at McDonald's and stuff, they just have pictures of the food.

650
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,120
It's like the hospital in Idiocracy.

651
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,540
I'm going to lie to you.

652
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,040
No, but seriously.

653
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,280
Waffle House.

654
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:35,880
Actually, it has gone downhill terribly in the last year and a half because they raised their prices by a dollar.

655
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:47,280
It used to be, okay, sure, it was crappy diner food, but they're always open, there always was one, and it was always five bucks for a really sizable breakfast.

656
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,060
Well, now it's $6.50.

657
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,060
Sorry, just lost me.

658
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,500
I can only go there on special occasions now.

659
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,640
The future is now.

660
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,900
The future is now.

661
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,580
Well, for a half penny worth of ingredients, they turn an enormous profit.

662
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:14,680
Well, see, we covered Waffle House, the presidency of Mike Huckabee.

663
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,300
Yes, not a waffling candidate.

664
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,920
And the movie Lost Continent.

665
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,480
Yes, the movie Lost Continent was a Lippert production.

666
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,620
God.

667
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,480
And it might have been the first race.

668
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:34,280
It was a Ray Harryhausen movie, but Lippert was rude and mean to Mr. Harryhausen.

669
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,540
Really?

670
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:47,080
And his friend Ray Bradbury, when they went there, with a reel of film, as described in Ray Bradbury's short story, Tyrannosaurus Rex, if you've ever read it, about the stop motion animator.

671
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

672
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:55,160
I read that when I was really young, and I thought, wow, this is just like a Ray Harryhausen type of guy that they're talking about.

673
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:55,920
Yes, it was.

674
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,540
I love the description of the little rubber monster.

675
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:04,220
The little rubber monster and the nasty, nasty producer.

676
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,000
Exactly.

677
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:12,940
Well, that producer was not actually Irwin Allen, but Robert Lippert instead, although it could have been Irwin Allen just as much.

678
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:20,100
And then there was Reverend Mike Jitlove, who made a movie about a filmmaker being ripped off by a producer.

679
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,640
The Wizard of Speed and Time.

680
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,540
And it came literally true in every way.

681
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,380
The Wizard of Speed and Time is that great subgenius movie.

682
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,000
Yes.

683
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,120
Yes.

684
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,020
It actually has Dobbs heads in it.

685
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,420
Oh, it's got Dobbs heads, stop motion animation, all kinds of stuff.

686
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:39,960
Yeah, Wizard of Speed and Time, if you ever get a chance to get a bootleg of it, Jitlove's never going to see a penny from it, ever.

687
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,180
Yeah, yeah.

688
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,620
He got so totally reamed, that was horrible.

689
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,560
Friday Jones had a Laserdisc of that movie from Japan.

690
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,460
Wow.

691
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,600
It was sold in Japan on Laserdisc.

692
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,380
I think for a brief time, you could find a VHS copy.

693
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:57,960
Why?

694
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,700
Because I think I have that VHS copy.

695
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,920
I have my own VHS copy labeled by Jitlove.

696
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,540
Well, that certainly trumps anything I've got.

697
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,640
He got Kelly Freese to do the poster for it.

698
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,460
But none of this helped.

699
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,220
And that poster is in the bedroom of Princess Wee and me.

700
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,400
It's in Lamar's office.

701
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,820
Well, it's not the same poster.

702
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,660
Jitlove doesn't get to see you fucking.

703
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:27,820
But yeah, Princess Wee and I can't escape the weird grin of Mike Jitlove on that movie.

704
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:27,940
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

705
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:27,940


706
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:27,940


707
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,200
Because the TV posts are staring at us.

708
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,160
Most intriguing, Stang.

709
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,220
Well, let me put it this way.

710
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,620
We don't have any Dobbs heads in the bedroom.

711
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
Thank heavens for that.

712
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:44,520
But I've heard it said by pediatric specialists that if you put a Dobbs head by the toilet,

713
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:51,180
it helps children who are having trouble with toilet training just to let go when they see that face.

714
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,340
Toilet training.

715
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,920
Bill Cates, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy,

716
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:03,160
was the first person to stumble upon that with his little girl, Reverend Baz Otherwise,

717
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,840
who's now grown up.

718
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,740
A grown-up subgenius.

719
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,140
Wow.

720
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,720
From birth to...

721
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,020
Princess Wee and I took her to Starwood.

722
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,700
You've seen him come and you've seen him go.

723
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,760
She was born on my birthday.

724
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,940
She and I had the same birthday.

725
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,720
Ah, how do you explain that?

726
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,120
Yes, the personal story.

727
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,080
Everyone's interested in the human drama.

728
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,900
But for that same reason, they can intuit it and do not need it.

729
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,040
We'll let someone else talk about that.

730
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:29,620
Human?

731
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,760
What are we doing talking about human drama?

732
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,900
Well, the alien drama takes a classical education to understand.

733
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:44,300
One must speak extraplanetary languages and be adept in understanding alien posture,

734
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,480
vocal intonation, and electric signal.

735
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,900
It would be great if everybody was an expert, and they will be soon.

736
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,580
If only those aliens had used sound as a communication.

737
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,120
Instead of driving their vessel.

738
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,340
But instead, they have their colors on their bodies and they're contorted physically.

739
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:02,980
The smells.

740
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,000
The smells.

741
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,480
Yeah.

742
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,480
Emitting, you know, one word is a smell, the next word is a gesture.

743
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,300
Synesthesia, a rare affliction in humans.

744
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,560
The next one is a kind of fart.

745
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,220
The ones who fart and tap dance.

746
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,100
Yeah, the farting, tap dancing aliens from Planet C.

747
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,180
Those are the ones predicted by Kurt Vonnegut.

748
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:21,040
The ones who got killed by a guy with a golf club when they landed and tried to communicate

749
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,820
by farting and tap dancing.

750
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,560
He was afraid with a golf club.

751
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,060
That was very poignant.

752
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,240
Got killed, right?

753
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:26,500
Yeah.

754
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:26,880
Yeah.

755
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,020
Brained.

756
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,640
Brained with a golf club means killed, I believe.

757
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,620
That was, I never really experienced brained as a verb.

758
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,980
These aliens who communicated by farting and tap dancing unfortunately approached the wrong

759
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,180
human, and though they farted and tap danced, they were brained with a golf club.

760
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,400
Wanted to tell the guy whose house was on fire.

761
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,200
Yeah, they were trying to help, as often they do.

762
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:46,400
Yeah.

763
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,120
But we react first and then consider the matter later.

764
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,820
Sometimes, if you're really tap dancing hard, you can't help but fart.

765
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,860
And vice versa.

766
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:56,860


767
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,620
Sometimes you get those little string of pearls farts.

768
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,820
Just getting up and walking across the room is all it takes for me.

769
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,080
Just go for it.

770
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,600
I'm already at the age that I used to laugh at my grandfather.

771
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:12,340
Go from horizontal to vertical and the hydraulic proposition within becomes an alternative

772
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:12,880
one.

773
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:20,280
But aren't we all just squirming bags of unfulfilled appetites?

774
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:20,580
No.

775
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,720
No, no.

776
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,940
We're God's creation.

777
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,900
We're the paragon of something.

778
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,440
We're, you know.

779
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,700
We are stars.

780
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,700
The best of all possible worlds.

781
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,360
The paragon of animals.

782
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,560
The seat of reason.

783
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,140
Yes, all of that.

784
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,300
So, I won't deny it.

785
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,680
And remember.

786
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,960
We're the fly off from a great industrial furnace that's burning garbage.

787
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,940
Hey, I like it when you guys get cosmic and we aren't talking about comic books or old

788
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,660
monster movies.

789
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,440
No, I'm lying.

790
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,540
I prefer the comic books to the old monster movies.

791
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:51,620
Yeah.

792
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:51,640


793
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,120
Well, I brought that copy of.

794
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,920
Screw the prophecy.

795
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,200
Who cares about prophecy?

796
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,160
I'm into nostalgia.

797
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:56,420
I'm into the old monster movies.

798
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:56,420


799
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:56,420


800
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:56,420


801
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:56,420


802
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:56,420


803
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:56,580
I'm into the old monster movies.

804
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:56,580


805
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,240
I took that copy of giant sized Batman and Superman, along with me to Ex Day

806
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,520
because it was so profound.

807
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:12,180
Especially the part that was drawn by Wayne Boring and Bob Kane together on the page.

808
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,620
Maybe.

809
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,180
It was some zap jam.

810
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,960
Boring Kane.

811
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,800
When Batman is on deck, it's Bob Kane and the weird distorted Bob Kane world.

812
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,180
And then it switches over to bland Superman.

813
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,880
Wow.

814
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,700
You know, with every detail drawn there.

815
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,000
God.

816
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,940
And sometimes the two of them are on the same page.

817
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,840
The side views of people with glasses?

818
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,940
Oh, those always kill me.

819
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,160
Or the sort of brutish rendition of the human physiognomy

820
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,960
where eyeballs themselves disappear,

821
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,760
as do individual differentiations between teeth.

822
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,640
Superman's waist was like, what the hell?

823
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,200
There was never a bulge over the top of his trunks,

824
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,580
which made you wonder whether they were trunks.

825
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,100
It looked like he was hiding a Greek column in there

826
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,840
with those horizontal lines.

827
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:03,480
And how does the cage attach to the top part of the Kryptonian blouse?

828
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,300
It looked like Elvis' impacted colon was underneath it.

829
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,400
Maybe that's Superman's utility belt that we don't hear about.

830
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,420
And then these vertical lines on the side

831
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,360
that looked like maybe it was a fluted Greek column

832
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,320
that he jammed in there as, like, you know, falsies.

833
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,580
Well, it's alien couture, not to be judged by human standards.

834
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,120
Remember, he is an alien.

835
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,020
I think you guys studied this.

836
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,600
This comic's closer than I did.

837
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,340
Oh, God.

838
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:32,820
Well, I always appreciated it when superheroes didn't have a fancy getup,

839
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,720
like Dr. Solar, Man of the Atom, for the first ten issues or so.

840
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,080
Then they finally put him in a super suit.

841
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,680
But I liked him when he was a greenish radioactive scientist

842
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,900
in a lab coat just hovering and performing his exploits.

843
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,540
Dr. Manhattan had the best costume ever.

844
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,940
I was just thinking to myself,

845
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,100
if I was a superhero,

846
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,420
I'd be Rorschach.

847
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:55,960
Oh.

848
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,980
He's cool.

849
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,560
He's so cool.

850
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,300
He was cuddly.

851
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,280
He's dreamy.

852
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,800
How about Herbie Popnecker?

853
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,680
Tiger Beat.

854
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,900
Herbie Popnecker didn't get a super suit.

855
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,480
I'm not trapped in here with you.

856
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,160
For quite some time.

857
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,680
You're stuck in here with me.

858
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,600
Walked through the sky wearing his short tie and glasses.

859
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,420
That would be a cool superhero to be.

860
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,060
But how many people remember Herbie Popnecker?

861
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:22,900
A lot of people.

862
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,800
Dr. Hal has a...

863
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,500
A model of Herbie Popnecker.

864
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:25,880
Wow.

865
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,740
This is a really obscure,

866
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,680
but highly surreal and bulldada comic book from the 60s.

867
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,000
Yes, it was from the 60s.

868
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,260
Very, very, very bizarre and surreal.

869
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,200
Of course, it was rare and hard to find.

870
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,820
Another very bizarre comic for its original first three issues

871
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,140
was Kona, Monarch of Monster Isle.

872
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,000
Yes, I think that was her.

873
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,820
Which I'm pretty sure was written by a psychologist.

874
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,040
But it was a Carlton comic.

875
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,260
It was part of the Carlton line.

876
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,260
It went normal after the first three issues.

877
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,300
But the first three were certainly bizarre.

878
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,720
Not only does he, a blonde-haired muscle man,

879
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,080
live on a secret dinosaur-haunted island,

880
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,320
but this island is invaded by giant insects and giant sharks.

881
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,500
And they spread a virus that causes everything to grow giant.

882
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,060
Even the dinosaurs that were already giant.

883
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,140
Giant dinosaurs.

884
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,940
The dinosaurs giant...

885
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:23,960
Oh, wow.

886
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,620
Then it has to...

887
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,540
The dinosaurs have...

888
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,820
Normal-sized dinosaurs have to fight giant insects.

889
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,760
They get infected and then they become giant giants.

890
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,160
Oh, my God.

891
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,140
And at the...

892
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,200
I feel like Mrs. Joy Boy.

893
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,940
Dr. Dodd, the hero,

894
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,920
invents a serum that will attract all of these monsters.

895
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,520
And he somehow...

896
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,560
He gets Kona to carve his way through the flesh of the monsters

897
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,860
to the top of Dinosaur Island

898
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,940
with the serum that lures all the monsters.

899
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,140
So it was an excuse for the artist to draw a caveman

900
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:05,160
literally hacking and carving his way through mountains of monsters of all kinds.

901
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,180
It might happen.

902
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,940
They're falling off the cliffs right and left.

903
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,540
And then...

904
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,820
Tell me it's a Jay Dizbro.

905
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,300
Somehow he ends...

906
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,320
Let's see.

907
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,900
The underground ocean breaks in.

908
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,560
It pours in.

909
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,040
Yes, now there's a tidal wave.

910
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,320
And then the cave of mutants.

911
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,400
Not only are there dinosaurs, but there are mutants.

912
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,780
They lose the mutants at this point.

913
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,760
And the mutants grow huge.

914
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,780
The mutants grow huge and they ravage what's left of Dinosaur Island.

915
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,820
But these aren't the kind of mutants you normally think about.

916
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,860
These are mutants like the top half is a gorilla

917
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,980
and the bottom half is an ostrich.

918
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,220
You know what they are?

919
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,560
They're mutants like used to bother Mighty Samson in New York.

920
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,680
Yeah, a grasshopper crossed with a chimpanzee.

921
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,780
Watch out, the gorilla squid is heading this way.

922
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,600
Mad lib, animal parts.

923
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,740
The whale vacuum cleaner is sucking most of Manhattan in.

924
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,760
Really, this comic is that...

925
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,000
That weird.

926
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,260
And the fact that it...

927
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,600
There's not a...

928
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,380
Well, there might be a Facebook page.

929
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,140
Yes, you haven't looked, have you?

930
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,280
Maybe somebody likes Kuna, monarch of Monster Isle,

931
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,320
enough to give him his own Facebook page.

932
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,580
Maybe that's what I should do.

933
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,600
Maybe so.

934
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,220
As soon as I'm on my escape vessel.

935
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,900
That would be a perfect use of your special talents.

936
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,000
Yeah, after I've stolen the Grand Canyon,

937
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,120
the Smithsonian, the British Museum, the Rijksmuseum.

938
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,900
Yeah, they forget the comic books start building Monster Isle.

939
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,500
Then I'll start my Facebook.

940
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,140
Oh, yeah.

941
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,880
Build Monster Isle in life, you see.

942
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,820
Now, Kuna was one of these air crash surviving infants

943
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:36,840
who somehow survived to become a brutish monosyllabic caveman

944
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,280
with long blonde hair and big muscles.

945
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,100
I didn't know that.

946
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,560
I thought he just evolved on Monster Isle.

947
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:46,120
No, he was a normie human, the son of a scientist

948
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:51,000
who perished on an expedition when a small plane crashed and so forth.

949
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,340
He should meet Tarzan.

950
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,980
Well, he was like Tarzan.

951
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:59,320
And recently, just this year, I read one of the later Tarzan novels

952
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,080
that I'd never read.

953
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,960
And it was late in Tarzan's career.

954
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,240
In fact, it was in World War II in the Philippines.

955
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,800
And Colonel John Clayton, otherwise Tarzan,

956
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,340
crashes with a bunch of people,

957
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,860
a sort of World War II bomber crew of different ethnicities.

958
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,560
And at one point, he goes to see some American fighters

959
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,640
who were in the jungle.

960
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,800
And he comes walking and says,

961
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,380
I'm Colonel.

962
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,580
Clayton and we're camped about 20 miles down the river.

963
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,520
Well, then how come you're walking around like bloody Tarzan?

964
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,420
Well, because I am Tarzan.

965
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:33,620
What?

966
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,840
Yeah, but when I was a kid, I used to read about your adventures.

967
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,340
And you're just like you were then.

968
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,900
You look like you're about 20 years old.

969
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,980
Well, if you read my fourth adventure,

970
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,200
you find that a witch doctor gave me this immortality potion.

971
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,120
It's all in there.

972
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,820
I don't have time to get in it now.

973
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,820
Right now, we have to save our friends from the Japs

974
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,020
who are over the next rise.

975
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,500
And so forth and so on.

976
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,680
It was incredibly enjoyable.

977
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,380
I didn't believe how much I enjoyed this book.

978
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,600
You know, he just said,

979
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,040
OK, I look like Tarzan because I am Tarzan.

980
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,700
And why am I always young?

981
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,120
Well, I took this stuff.

982
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,020
I'll tell you about it.

983
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,800
It's a long procedure.

984
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,480
Not comfortable.

985
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,160
In that farmer novel, A Quest Unknown,

986
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,740
Tarzan and Doc Savage fight over the right to be,

987
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,300
there can only be one.

988
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,680
And they rip off each other's genitals.

989
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,280
Yes.

990
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,240
That's beautiful.

991
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,100
In that book, yes.

992
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,040
I remember it, yes.

993
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,180
But they grow back.

994
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:26,900
That's a fight.

995
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,700
Because they're that manly.

996
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,740
They're super manly.

997
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,380
And they have that elixir.

998
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,100
Yes, but Tarzan can talk to the apes,

999
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,300
which Doc Savage can.

1000
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,800
Also, he can talk to the New World monkeys

1001
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,540
and baboons and lemurs.

1002
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,400
That doesn't make any sense at all.

1003
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,540
I know, it doesn't.

1004
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,200
But Tarzan himself remarked on it.

1005
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,040
Any primate, even shrews?

1006
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,440
They all seem to have the same basic syntax.

1007
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,780
What about the old world monkeys?

1008
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,140
They have to have the prehensile tail?

1009
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:51,800
But as Philip was a farmer,

1010
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,420
pointed out,

1011
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,720
the original apes that Tarzan is of,

1012
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,000
Tarzan of the apes,

1013
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,560
are not a species that's known to science.

1014
00:42:59,680 --> 00:42:59,840
Right.

1015
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,780
And are, in fact, a relic population,

1016
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,300
or were at the time,

1017
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,380
of early hominids who lived in the jungle

1018
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,300
and were very ape-like.

1019
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,860
But they were not gorillas,

1020
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,740
nor were they chimpanzees,

1021
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,280
nor the pygmy chimps known as bonobos.

1022
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,680
They were the Gomangani,

1023
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,380
that special tribe

1024
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,760
which raised Tarzan from an infant.

1025
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:21,660
Creepy!

1026
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:21,800


1027
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,420
Bundolo!

1028
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,160
Yes.

1029
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,480
What did that mean?

1030
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,000
I hate you, I will kill you?

1031
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,860
Creepy means attack.

1032
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:30,540
Something low-int district.

1033
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,740
I forget about Bundolo,

1034
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,080
but then there's always Ungawa,

1035
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,360
which I even...

1036
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,640
But that was in the movies, though.

1037
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,360
It was in the books, too,

1038
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,360
and I recently...

1039
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:39,900
Oh, it was?

1040
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,480
...featured on my radio show.

1041
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,680
You know, Wellman comes in

1042
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,600
and we watch some horrible old movie

1043
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,380
and comment on it,

1044
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,600
so we watched Jungle Moon Men.

1045
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,580
And at one point,

1046
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:49,880
Wow.

1047
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:50,620
Johnny Weissmuller

1048
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,240
is trying to get everybody moving,

1049
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,060
you know, and he's bored.

1050
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:54,420
That's so high concept.

1051
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,620
He's been in these movies a million times.

1052
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,260
He says, Ungawa, you know.

1053
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,460
It doesn't belong, but, you know, come on.

1054
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,800
Let's get this show on the road.

1055
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,780
So it is expressive.

1056
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,780
Anyway, the jungle is our friend,

1057
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,060
and we're surrounded here

1058
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,180
in this pocket of tropical Ohio

1059
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,600
containing more species in proportion

1060
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,500
per acre than other places on Earth.

1061
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,720
Somebody said than any other place on Earth.

1062
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,660
That could occur.

1063
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:21,040
I'm afraid this

1064
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:21,960
is about to happen.

1065
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,980
Hey, games,

1066
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,140
I am Mercian.

1067
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,080
Enjoy Godhead.

1068
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,920
Enjoy Godhead.

1069
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,140
And I thought,

1070
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,100
I don't know,

1071
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,940
the אתs of the monsters

1072
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:46,480
like I gave myself

1073
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,380
to drive into this different universe

1074
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:47,480
where my mind is always

1075
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:47,520
pushed into it,

1076
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,760
not toounding like replaced.

1077
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,380
Him five finger man.

1078
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:53,900
Quadruped.

1079
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,380
Five finger.

1080
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,320
You five finger man.

1081
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,920
Like me.

1082
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,620
Like me.

1083
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,980
Me five finger man too.

1084
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,760
Hey, we've only got ten more minutes.

1085
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,700
Well, it seems like an eternity.

1086
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,500
No kidding.

1087
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,460
Now, this is where we could cut to another collage by Suzy the Flusy.

1088
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:14,700
Hi.

1089
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,820
I'm Bob.

1090
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:16,440
Hi.

1091
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,260
Are you famous?

1092
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:17,860
Yeah.

1093
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,220
See, I saw this program that I'm talking about tonight from seven years ago.

1094
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:30,700
Seven years ago when I saw this program, I folded my arms across my chest.

1095
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,160
I crossed my legs.

1096
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,000
And then I looked at that guy that was talking about this program.

1097
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,980
And I said, no way.

1098
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,900
Whoever this joker is, whoever's up there, he's always grinning.

1099
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,720
I thought, why was he always grinning?

1100
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,660
It never dawned on me because he is so doggone rich.

1101
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,060
Being broke is not a good deal.

1102
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,620
But he looked at me and he says, Al, whatever you do, you're going to like area three.

1103
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:02,960
He says, as a matter of fact, judging from the first two areas, you'll probably want to be involved in area three.

1104
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,480
And I was committed and convinced that area three looked good.

1105
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,860
And then he spelled it out to me.

1106
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,700
D-E-A-D.

1107
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:12,640
Dead.

1108
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:14,820
Fantastic.

1109
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,860
I'll talk like this.

1110
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,020
Bob's your uncle, mate.

1111
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,300
That really doesn't help.

1112
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:20,600
Bye.

1113
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:22,880
Bye.

1114
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,900
You get the slack and all, you get the back slim.

1115
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,000
Well, that would have to have been last Fourth of July.

1116
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,840
It was very hot out.

1117
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,460
Oh, so hot.

1118
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,700
It was just blazing.

1119
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,180
And I was at the youth group picnic.

1120
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,280
Minister Bob was there in his Bermuda pants.

1121
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,280
They cover more legs than his Bermuda shorts.

1122
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:50,800
You see.

1123
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,280
And they're just a little bit tighter in the back.

1124
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,280
They just hug his buns in the cutest way.

1125
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:55,660
But anyway.

1126
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:00,680
I was slicing some Rice Krispies squares I had made.

1127
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:03,660
And Minister Bob was filling cups of the punch bowl with his ladle.

1128
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,980
It was the biggest ladle I'd ever seen.

1129
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,060
I wanted to touch it, but I was afraid to because it was so abnormally large.

1130
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,180
And as I watched him with that ladle, he kept dipping it into the bowl and pouring punches.

1131
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:26,360
And dipping and pouring and dipping and pouring and dipping until all the cups were filled.

1132
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,960
And it didn't take long because that was some big ladle.

1133
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:33,000
And then suddenly, violently, there was a shudder.

1134
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,880
My buttocks were tingling.

1135
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,060
I was alone, lost in space.

1136
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,000
I saw him toss that ladle aside, his arm exhausted.

1137
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,660
I must have passed out because that's all I remember.

1138
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,840
You may call me Connie.

1139
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,340
You did what was doing the storm, remember?

1140
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,760
You said, all right, Connie.

1141
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,480
We might as well go down together.

1142
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,740
I liked the way you said Connie.

1143
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,980
It was like a punch in the door.

1144
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,540
Now, what's going to happen?

1145
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,060
Do you know that's breaking the second commandment?

1146
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,720
Because Babylon was the head of witchcraft, sorcery, fortune tellers.

1147
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,220
Notice that.

1148
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,100
When the music starts playing, you're to bow down and worship the great image.

1149
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,800
Night and day, you are the one.

1150
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,400
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun.

1151
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,660
Whether near to me or far.

1152
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,740
It's no matter where you are.

1153
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:31,300
I think of you night and day.

1154
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:38,340
And I won't tell you, I jumped in with both feet and started listening to tapes and reading books because I didn't.

1155
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,800
I had to read lots of books, lots and lots of books.

1156
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,820
And sometimes you're going to pick up a book in the beginning and you're going to read it and you're going to think,

1157
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:44,900
I can't finish this.

1158
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,940
This book is too heavy.

1159
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,620
And you're going to put it down and a couple of years later, a couple of months later, you're going to pick up that book.

1160
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,160
And all of a sudden, you're going to think, I can't finish this.

1161
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,260
And it's going to slap you in the face.

1162
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:58,180
Now, this is where we could cut to another collage by Susie the Flusie later.

1163
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,460
From George Bush's Hurricane Katrina moment.

1164
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,600
Oh, I am about to rerun that whole thing.

1165
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,520
How many episodes?

1166
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,280
How many one hour long?

1167
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,580
17 hours.

1168
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:14,200
18 if you count Inauguramus, where I realized he's not going to be in office.

1169
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,920
If you haven't heard these George Bush verses.

1170
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:19,960
The 17.

1171
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,740
The 17 hour saga of George Bush versus.

1172
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,340
I dropped him into the hurricane.

1173
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,660
Versus Susie the Flusie.

1174
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:29,040
Where he was shot, stabbed, strangled, set on fire.

1175
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,260
Episode five is an all sodomy episode.

1176
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,760
These are marvelously entertaining.

1177
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,640
I had such an embarrassment of sodomy.

1178
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:43,920
I had to go back in and add the deliverance squeal like a pig part because it fell through the cracks of that much sodomy.

1179
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:47,520
Have you ever heard the medieval legend of the apple of Sodom?

1180
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,500
Ooh.

1181
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,140
The apple that grew.

1182
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,660
The apple that grew on the remains of the city that was destroyed.

1183
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,780
The cities of the plain.

1184
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,940
I'm sorry you had to see this sodomy.

1185
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:04,140
Well, the apple grows up and you can pick it, but then it all turns into horrible wormy dust, right?

1186
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,120
While you're holding it.

1187
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,380
So it does no good to anyone.

1188
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:20,140
So they say, according to this primitive superstition, believed by early simple people, not by us in our modern world of atomic bombs, moon rockets, and so on.

1189
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:24,820
And micro ships, not unlike the searing flash that announced the beginning of the atomic age.

1190
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:33,560
But we here, we are only enduring our final moments until the rupture occurs.

1191
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:38,880
So you think you thought you saw some kind of monster.

1192
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:45,380
Many people think that, especially as time grows short and all life centers on a point.

1193
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,460
We all want to see the monsters, so.

1194
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,860
We would rather see them.

1195
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,940
And not see them, especially if they're there.

1196
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,160
And so, just look harder, is my observation.

1197
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,820
Perhaps you are aware that.

1198
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,080
They're out there, they're out there all right.

1199
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,720
Scorpions are fluorescent.

1200
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:15,380
So if you take a black light and point it over the camp where you thought you were perfectly safe, you'll see you'll be surrounded by millions of venomous fluorescent day glow scorpions.

1201
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:19,860
Well, in the same way, the monsters make themselves inconspicuous.

1202
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,540
Until they need to be seen.

1203
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,120
Maybe to them.

1204
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,360
Where are the monsters?

1205
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:28,960
Unquestionably.

1206
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:29,160
Oh.

1207
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:36,920
Because our behavior to them is worth worse than any individual monster controversy or atrocity.

1208
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,580
It's Dr. Dark.

1209
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:46,820
Speaking of monsters, remember Dr. Dark's monster movies have been the highlight of X-Day up to now.

1210
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,240
And starting tonight.

1211
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,040
The Grindhouse begins.

1212
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,120
It's Monster Matinee.

1213
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,060
And friends, come on.

1214
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,500
Let's admit it.

1215
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,560
We're all monsters here.

1216
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,080
Or else.

1217
00:51:59,160 --> 00:51:59,480
Well.

1218
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,300
As they say.

1219
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:01,740
We're monsters crazy.

1220
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,220
You're either monster or you're monster hunter.

1221
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:11,780
And as the swing version of the monster hunter game theme plays in the background.

1222
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:16,260
I am going to end this discussion.

1223
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:16,520
Yes.

1224
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,020
Stang will come galloping off to go play monster hunting.

1225
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:20,020


1226
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:20,020


1227
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:23,260
And go charge up my game platform.

1228
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,100
Here on Subgenius After Dark.

1229
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:26,400
Yes.

1230
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:32,780
The Subgenius Afterbirth now lies dimly and damply here.

1231
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:36,020
Now that we have finished our devoirs on the air.

1232
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,800
But remember, there will be another similar broadcast.

1233
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:46,620
One which even accomplished experts could not tell from this one tomorrow at this time from this location.

1234
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,880
We defy them to tell the difference.

1235
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,160
Remember to pick up a copy of the schedule.

1236
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,600
Which has this and all other events in it.

1237
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,800
As well as amusing works of art and unusual suggestions.

1238
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:04,000
You don't want to be the subgenius that walks up to Reverend Stang or Priestess Pisces.

1239
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:09,200
Holding this in your hand and saying, what happens next, preacher?

1240
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,600
Well, you could.

1241
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,220
As if you couldn't read.

1242
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,900
What it says you're supposed to do next is eat food.

1243
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,940
Scream real loud.

1244
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,760
Froop and drink.

1245
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:20,580
Yes.

1246
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:21,560
Simple as that.

1247
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:21,940
Yes.

1248
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,540
Some people need it spelled out for them.

1249
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:36,100
And tonight, remember, at 9 o'clock, we are going to have Reverend Andrew Genis performing right here at Caffeina's, on our Caffeina's stage.

1250
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,700
With special guests.

1251
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,720
Dr. Hal, Princess Wee, and I don't know who else.

1252
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,300
That's right.

1253
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,720
Yes, the fun never stops.

1254
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,780
We should get her up here to help us do shows.

1255
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:48,360
Oh, sometime.

1256
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,000
Yes.

1257
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:49,540
Sure.

1258
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,180
Why not?

1259
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,820
But she's not going to be around forever.

1260
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:53,680
That's so.

1261
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:54,520
Hmm.

1262
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:59,000
Now, we only have a few more minutes, but we might request that she would join us.

1263
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,760
But I don't know.

1264
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,240
I have a feeling we've frittered away the entire.

1265
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,380
We only have three mics.

1266
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,120
And, well, plus that guy.

1267
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,320
Well, I don't know how many mics you took.

1268
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,540
I can only, you know, I only took the three.

1269
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,460
Oh, okay.

1270
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,340
That's not, you hardly feel it.

1271
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,220
Microdosing.

1272
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,960
That's the new thing.

1273
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:18,860
The new hip thing.

1274
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,700
I discovered that years ago.

1275
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:26,700
But LSD can be like coffee if you only take one sixty-second of the hit.

1276
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,820
You just take a little tiny piece.

1277
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:28,800
Sixty-fourth of the hit.

1278
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,440
It sounds like that homoerotic medicine stuff.

1279
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,400
Worked for me for a long time.

1280
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,380
Of course, tolerance sets in.

1281
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,220
Pretty soon, you need more than sixty-fourth.

1282
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:41,500
You're upping the dose.

1283
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,700
You need a thirty-second.

1284
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,500
Then you need a sixteenth of a hit.

1285
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,320
Then an eighth of a hit.

1286
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:45,900
Then a quarter.

1287
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:46,200
Then a quarter.

1288
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,200


1289
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,200


1290
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,200


1291
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,200


1292
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,200


1293
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,200


1294
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,200


1295
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,200


1296
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,200


1297
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,900
Next thing you know, you're just popping those sugar cubes like they were sugar cubes.

1298
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,620
Just throwing them in your coffee.

1299
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,360
Just slicing your arms open and cramming it in the veins.

1300
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:55,660
But it doesn't do any good.

1301
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,060
It won't do anything after that.

1302
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:57,540
No.

1303
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:57,720
No.

1304
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,560
Won't give you that whole shiz.

1305
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,900
Eighteen thousandth of a mic.

1306
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,400
So.

1307
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:08,140
Well, that about wraps it up for another episode of the Hour of Slack with a pharmaceutical

1308
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,940
discussion, which we assure you is thoroughly theoretical.

1309
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,120
Not to be imitated by red-faced freckled people.

1310
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:13,880
It's a metaphor.

1311
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:14,600
We're just.

1312
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:19,600
We're just going to let the red-faced freckled-faced children who might through some strange amalgam

1313
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:26,960
of oddity and anomaly be listening to this special copyrighted material.

1314
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:32,320
For more information about the Church of the Subgenius, X-Day, or the movie The Land Unknown,

1315
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,040
see subgenius.com.

1316
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,180
Good night, seekers.

1317
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:41,520
You know, The Land Unknown was supposed to be made in color, but then Universal got cold

1318
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,800
feet and they downgraded it to black and white.

1319
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:48,380
Hey, yesterday we had Baby Bear do her sign-off live.

1320
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,680
You know, I end a lot of shows whenever I forget to do the P.O.

1321
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:51,920
Box.

1322
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,380
I tack on the Baby Bear ending.

1323
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,520
And she did it right in front of us live.

1324
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,300
It's like watching a Jimi Hendrix concert.

1325
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:58,380
It was so cool.

1326
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,260
That'll confuse future generations of listeners.

1327
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,380
Wow.

1328
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,300
As it confuses me.

1329
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,060
We got to see Baby Bear do her outro in real life.

1330
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,060
Yes, you never know.

1331
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,480
It's just like a real subgenius show.

1332
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,780
What you'll see when you hang around here, you might even see a dragon in a black dress.

1333
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:13,780


1334
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:13,780


1335
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:13,780


1336
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:13,780


1337
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:13,780


1338
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:13,780


1339
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:13,780


1340
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:13,780


1341
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,920
Or a baby in a bathtub bathing up.

1342
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,300
Or a flying saucer that is looking for its co.

1343
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,580
I look looking more like how sausage is made.

1344
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:25,240
Well, you might even see a sausage in a...

1345
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,160
Oh, well.

1346
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,780
I never sausage a thing.

1347
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,520
I knew that one was coming.

1348
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,820
Why don't you and Dr. Dart get married?

1349
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,300
Have little punish kids.

1350
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:36,280
Ooh.

1351
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,480
It would be punishing.

1352
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:40,780
Cool and unusual.

1353
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,740
You got the show ending.

1354
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:43,760


1355
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:43,760


1356
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:43,760


1357
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:43,760


1358
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:43,760


1359
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:43,760


1360
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:43,760


1361
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:43,760


1362
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:43,760


1363
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,660
It ended seven minutes ago and we're still talking.

1364
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,500
We did that yesterday.

1365
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:46,960
All right.

1366
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:46,960


1367
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,500
It's not still recording, is it?

1368
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,680
Oh, sure.

1369
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,520
Oh, well, everything's going fine.

1370
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,280
Well, you can patch it with crap.

1371
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:54,900
Oh, yeah.

1372
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,460
Here we go.

1373
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,140
Look.

1374
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,880
The professional radio sound effects.

1375
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,260
We got a million of them, folks.

1376
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:08,820
Yes, the morning zoo here on listener-censored radio wisteria.

1377
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,120
Hey, do you have to do PSAs?

1378
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,180
No.

1379
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:13,760
I don't.

1380
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:13,760


1381
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:13,760


1382
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:13,760


1383
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:13,760


1384
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:13,760


1385
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:13,760


1386
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:13,760


1387
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:13,760


1388
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:13,760


1389
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:13,760


1390
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:13,760


1391
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:13,760


1392
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:13,980
I'm very glad.

1393
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:14,760
At that time of the month?

1394
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,760
When I do a PSA, it's a horrible, horrible joke.

1395
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:24,680
Sometimes, they're making us do them at KPFA.

1396
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:28,860
They're making us interrupt our program with reputable announcements.

1397
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:29,700
Any time you make us do something...

1398
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,700
Now, you know how Sterno got around that on his radio show, which is unfortunately

1399
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:38,260
not a subgenius show, but a Frank Zappa sucks show.

1400
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,240
They just play all of the PSAs at once.

1401
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,600
They get it out of the way.

1402
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:50,040
They have to play five or six of them during the hour, and they just play them all at once.

1403
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,160
Don't they lose viewers or listeners or whatever you call them?

1404
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,000
No, it's a Frank Zappa show.

1405
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:54,960
They're sarcastic.

1406
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,560
They're mean.

1407
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,180
They're mean.

1408
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:04,100
And the reason I sometimes say every chance I get the phrase, Zappa sucks, it's not that

1409
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,900
Zappa always sucks by any means.

1410
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,920
It's that Sterno told me I couldn't say that.

1411
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,040
We were driving with him to the station.

1412
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,920
He goes, now, you know, this isn't a subgenius show, you guys.

1413
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:17,900
Oh, yeah, I know.

1414
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,480
It's all Zappa.

1415
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:20,980
That's it.

1416
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,080
I said, can I say Zappa sucks?

1417
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,380
And both him and his co-host said, no.

1418
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,140
They were not amused at all.

1419
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:31,440
They literally just about stopped the car and kicked me out.

1420
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:35,060
I said, Sterno, you're the guy that invented Kill Bob.

1421
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,260
You're where the disrespect for Bob even came from.

1422
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,460
You know as well as anybody.

1423
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,840
You tell a subgenius not to do something.

1424
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:43,200
I said, Sterno, you're the guy that invented Kill Bob.

1425
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,340
That's their marching orders to do it.

1426
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,380
And he goes, well, you can't say Zappa sucks on my show.

1427
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,600
So I didn't.

1428
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:55,560
But I say it on every other person's show that I possibly can.

1429
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,380
Including this one.

1430
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,800
Nothing against Zappa.

1431
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,640
But frankly, I think I'm doing what Zappa would want me to do.

1432
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,440
He'd go, I like the guy that says Zappa sucks.

1433
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,240
I like that old redneck.

1434
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:07,760
He's OK.

1435
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,280
It's all right, Stang.

1436
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,000
It's OK.

1437
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:10,520
OK.

1438
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,300
It's all right.

1439
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,440
It's all right.

1440
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:13,320
He's OK.

1441
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:13,820
He sucks sometimes.

1442
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,780
Yes, exactly.

1443
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:20,440
And that's why we should bring this broadcast to a close now and hope that we have better

1444
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:27,220
fortune on another day when inspiration may indeed strike with its lightning flash.

1445
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,780
Holy head.

1446
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:33,580
Goodbye.

1447
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:35,300
Goodbye.

1448
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,340
Goodbye.
