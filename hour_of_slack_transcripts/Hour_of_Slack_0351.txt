It's time for some signs and wonders, and if you bunch of skeptics don't like it, you might as well get out of the way, because you're about to get run over.
The Holy Ghost is come, the Holy Ghost is here, and Holy Ghost power is covering the earth like the waters cover the sea.
Somebody has to be unafraid and unashamed to use the word repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand.
I want to say it's time somebody came along against the forces of darkness and gave the devil the only thing he understands,
and that is a striking, deadening blow from a bigger stick than he presents.
Sizzle as God's word burns true, calling the devil to attention.
I think it's time somebody stood up, put their foot down, pushed their plate back, pointed their finger under the devil's nose,
and said,
Let us entong the church of Jesus Christ is here, and we intend on the kingdom coming.
Find out why it doesn't get any hotter than this.
We could talk about those things until the cows come home.
I'm not talking about religion, I'm not talking about going to church, I'm not talking about praying or reading your Bible.
Well, friend, that's not the truth.
That is not the truth, and if the truth could ever dawn on you how Jesus Christ feels toward police officers,
you'd know.
It would never be the same.
When are you going to give your fear to me?
Catch me, baby.
Catch me.
I'm going out for a pass.
And it's the war.
War.
I've been trying to help you out, get through that, Red.
I've been trying to help you out, see you in September or something.
But it's in your programming.
Your programmers were programmed.
And it's just like you.
And it's just like you.
It's easy to be here in the now.
It's like I've been...
We're all falling in the same submarine of a solar system forever.
When are you going to give your fear to me?
Catch me, girls.
I'm going out for a pass.
And it's...
I'm going out for a pass.





I've been trying to help you out, get through that, Red.
I've been trying to help you out, see you in September or something.
But it's in your programming.
Your programmers were programmed.
And it's just like you.
And it's just like you.
It's easy to be here in the now.
Now, it's like I've been...
We're all falling in the same submarine of a solar system forever.
Is that okay by you?
If the planet spins, is that a fair deal?
Huh?
Huh?
Hey Earth, just don't check.
What in God's name is happening here?
Will, I know that must have looked kind of funny to you, but...
Funny?
Now, wait a minute, Will. You see that kid back there? The kid's a genius. A space-age genius.
Well, what's he doing here?
Well, that's it, Will. You see, the kid wanted his own lab.
Well, he started in taking stuff home from school. Radar sets, jet engines, that kind of thing.
Then he went after their atomic reactor.
Ah, a radar.
A braving lunatic.
I tell you, Will, he can put them in orbit.
He can what?
He can put them in orbit, Will.
He can put them into orbit.
He can put them into an orbit of eternal grace.
Keep those eyes closed. You don't even want to try to open them.
You can hear everything that's going on around you.
And you are now in a very relaxed state of mind.
Like being stoned.
Such a far-out stoned feeling.
Feeling higher than you have ever felt before.
Tell me, Buck, what about clearance from the space agency? Think we'll have any trouble there?
Well, I'll tell you frankly, Will.
I don't trust those civilian eggheads.
Too much of the old pink old pre-bird in force to suit me.
Ah, I think I'll go straight to Mr. Big with this one.
Good idea, Buck.
But enough of this palaver.
Let's get the show on the road.
Fantastic women, fantastic dancers, featuring the world's loveliest Bucs addicts.
You've only dreamed there were women like these until now.
But they're real.
Unbelievably real.
Stand by for blastoff.
Ladies and gentlemen, stand by for blastoff has just been called.
And in just a few seconds, we'll have this historic countdown.
Now let me present to you the man of the hour.
Without whom, none of this would have been possible.
The blessed reverend.
Too long in earthly bondage.
So it is written.
And so it has come to pass.
Resurrection.
24, 23, 22.
To soar in celestial serenity in large measure.
And as always, this nation is beholden to the genius of its children for this great moment.
Yes, China may brainwash.
Ten, nine.
Russia may educate.
Six, five.
But America breeds its genius.
Blastoff!
And now, the subgenius hour of slack.
It gets up and kills.
The people it kills get up and kill.
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station.
And only in the city of...
and only in the city of...

You host.
A man whose mind is distorted by hatred.
This man is dangerous.
He carries no gun, no knife, no dynamite.
Locked in his brain is a power stronger than a load of dynamite.
The power to read men's minds and corrupt their women.
This is the Will O' Dobbs, the only man on earth who can force things to happen.
This woman has never known what it means to be controlled by a man.
Girls barely out of their teens watched without really knowing what they saw.
Here was a power that could have changed the world.
Instead, it led him down wild and abnormal adventures that could only happen to...
...Guerilla Dobs!
I love you.
I love you.
The whole world acclaimed his strange talent.
But as his powers grew, his lust included every woman who crossed his path.
It made no difference who they were.
The highest society glamour girls, aloof and distant from most men, were his to claim.
And there were others who fell into his arms and awoke later...
...horrified and ashamed of the unnatural acts they performed under the power of...
...me?
Yes, the will of Dobbs.
Welcome, welcome to the show, such as it is.
And what is it going to be tonight?
What is tonight's show?
You got me.
I'll tell you what I did this weekend, listeners.
I took the advice of my own spiritual guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs, and I slacked off today.
I spent yesterday and today playing with my...
...my niece.
Eight-month-old niece.
She's already a subgenius, I can just tell it.
So that's what I did.
Hello, India.
Hope you're listening.
So that's what I did.
Did that leave much time to put together a show?
No. No, it didn't.
But it is done anyway.
I worked in super dynamic overdrive tonight.
And there is a show here, and it's about to get started.
Boy, it took a long time to get started.
It started tonight, didn't it?
But you all know how that is.
So welcome to all old, new listeners tonight.
I think we have some new listeners tonight, from my understanding.
It's always good to hear from you.
And I know...
Congratulations to you listeners in Athens, Georgia.
Our latest addition.
We get more requests for free information.
No memberships, really, yet.
But hello to Athens, Georgia.
It's good to have you.
Good to have you aboard.
And to the rest of you, too.
Always glad to hear all of you.
So the...
Maybe we should just play this all night.
Okay, I'll tell you one thing you are going to hear at least two times tonight,
are those wonderful, beautiful, and swinging love corpses.
We're going to hear a couple of tracks from them tonight.
We've been neglectful of them.
In fact, without any further ado,
stay tuned for the swinging love corpses on the subgenius radio ministry.
Hour of Slack.
With your host tonight, The Will of Doms.
Thank you.
The Vortex took them.
Just...
Just took them away.
Just took them away.
Oh, Daddy said, shake your head.
Oh, it's freaking really hot out there.
We didn't lie.
We didn't care.
We were stoking on the fine things that come in our hair.
The six pack was iced down in the backseat.
Was a stole grill.
Couldn't be beat.

The Vortex took them.
The Vortex took them.
How many of you know what movie that's from?
I bet a lot of you, actually, if I know our listeners.
And I had to stop that tape real fast because if I were to play,
as with most of our tapes that we have here,
if I were to play one more second, you'd hear,
actually, you'd hear my most favorite Swinging Love Corpses song
that you'll never, ever, ever, ever hear on this radio program.
Maybe the last show. It certainly would be the last show.
And you know what else?
Every time I reach this point, I get, well, I don't know,
I get all choked up.
Here it is, the great statue of the Blessed Reverend Wilbur.
This world-famous statue was executed by the internationally known
artist and sculptorist Tina Tube.
And is available in handsome reproductions
at the gift shop near the West Gate.
They're really quite marvelous, those little reproductions.
Now, look at the book
containing the creed of the Blessed Reverend.
This book is carved of the finest Carrara marble.
The letters on the pages, they're 18-carat gold.
And they're worth at least $30 a piece.
And now, I want you to hear something.
I want you to hear the Blessed Reverend himself
speak the words of the creed.
This is the actual voice of the Blessed Reverend himself.
Now, my friends, my old buddy God was a weird cat.
He really was. He was into everything.
Cranked out quite a number of them years ago,
and supposedly he's still at it.
I don't know if it was really an infinite number of universes.
I mean, you've got to stop somewhere.
But old God, he had this deal where you'd go from one universe to another
every time you died.
They'd start you off in the before life,
which was sort of like an eternal paradise
to kind of get you off on the right foot.
And then all of a sudden, you'd lose your memory
and get born here on Earth.
And then when you got old and died,
you'd pass on to the...
etheric universe next door.
And why, after you died there,
you'd be born into the angelic universe.
So once there, friend, you'd find out
there were dozens and dozens of them,
each one better than the last.
In fact, each one incomprehensibly better than the last.
And as long as you didn't screw up too bad,
you could keep on traveling up through the universes,
getting ever closer to the bob head.
But right when you thought the next level would be the last
and the ultimate goal,
the ultimate peak experience of eternal slackness, friends,
why, instead, right then, you'd get reborn on Earth
with your memory wiped out again,
just a few years after you died there the last time
and you'd have to start all over again.
And that's how it all keeps going on infinitely.
Friends, you know, sooner or later,
you run out of infinity, even infinity.
But see, here's the thing.
Usually, these facts are never announced.
Friends, and we do it on this show,
where we know it won't be believed.
But see, if you die bad, friend,
or if you're a messed-up person,
you might leave behind a part of your soul,
the lower soul, or what we call the nental eye.
And that becomes a poltergeist, friend,
or a wandering shade,
an Earth-bound spirit doomed to roam the Earth,
pathetically repeating its sad loop of behavior
that made it so hard for you to get out of it.
And that's how you get split from the higher soul
in the first place.
Can you imagine a ghost trying to buy a pack of cigarettes
for eternity, friends?
No, I can't.
Well, what have we been listening to mostly here?
That was, of course, Swinging Love Corpses
with The Vortex Took'Em.
A little bit of a movie I like called The Loved One,
and that was Reverend Stang just there just a second ago
talking about, you know, his old buddy God.
And, you know, stay tuned.
Stay tuned for even more of what all's going on here,
whatever that may be.

Before the office invite to go
A shooting in the rectangle
Shooting on a pedestal
So make sure I'm capable
Be Believer!

Seems that remember's in the past
Contortions that he can't recall
The torso on a trampoline
The happiness felt in to be
To talk, to touch, to get to see
To taste, to smell, to breathe
The grace of the past
The love that you had
Is the one that you have
And time replaces emotion
One thought at last, someday
In darkness
The dark way most likely
Loops free
Is a butterfly
To hum out with anxiety
To talk, to touch, to get to see
To talk, to touch, to get to see
To feel
Maybe the same
If only I don't see
And you've gone





And back it up
To behind the chней
Can we try
And check the beauty
He's got blood in the nose
He is taking us along
He's got a net
But not the thing that depicts
The toast-cast reaction
So we get away
With his mouth shut
His mouth shut
He still shakes his butt
Cause he's struggling
And sweating and chomping
Trafalgar
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Your Honor, the people...
May I question him, Your Honor?
No, you may not.

You know, I'm going to defend myself one way or another.
I'd like to do it with words.
If you insist on interrupting this court, I'll have no choice but to have you removed.

Do you think I'm good?
Yes!
Silence! Silence!

Yeah!
South Indian film music, don't you see? Because as the liner notes helpfully point out, India is
the film capital of the world. Why, they make more movies there, almost four times as many as
Hollywood per year, and attract more moviegoers than anywhere else in the universe. The two largest
buildings in many small villages are the temple and the cinema. And to top it all off, many of
the most popular politicians are former movie stars, just like in the United States. So it's
really strange, this whole CD is basically the work of one guy, and I'm gonna play at least one
track from it for you tonight, and in the future perhaps. So I like it, I hope you will too. This
is a little piece called Nahani Maharaja, or I Am the Emperor. Thank you.

That was, again, South Indian film music.
And the album is called, again, Dance, Raja Dance.
South Indian film music.
And what sort of music now, I wonder, for this?
That's pretty, isn't it?
The horror.
Some of us haven't forgotten.
Some of you long, well, not even necessarily long-time listeners,
just even short, even you short-timers out there,
perhaps remember a show that we did not too awful long ago.
Hope it was not too awful.
And in which virtually the entire show is taken up with a long reading
from the wonderful magazine Murder Can Be Fun,
and the subject was, I'm sure those of you who heard it will remember always,
was the hideous deaths that have occurred at Disneyland.
And apparently the author got a fair number of responses to that one,
and I hope a lot of subscriptions because the new one has just come out.
The new issue of Murder Can Be Fun, stand by for the address.
And I think the redoubtable Mr. John Marr has outdone himself,
with this issue's feature piece.
It's a good one, my dear listeners.
And I'm not going, we're not going to read you the whole essay this time,
because we want you to send for this information on how to get this.
But it's, we're going to read a little bit of it.
The title alone, I think, should pique your curiosity.
The title of this issue's feature essay is,
Please, Mr. Postman, Don't Shoot.
It begins,
Pity the poor postal worker.
Nobly they make their appointed rounds,
in spite of the tacky polyester blend blue shorts they are forced to wear,
and the horrible conditions ranging from snow to sleet to the gloom of night that await them.
Nonetheless, they are universal targets of abuse.
Blue-haired widows upset over a 24-hour delay,
in the delivery of their social security checks.
Sick their ill-mannered poodles on innocent letter carriers.
Poorly applied staples and occasional used hypodermic syringes,
quote, found loose in the mails, rip at the flesh of mail handlers.
Frenzied SSI recipients lunge at general delivery counter clerks,
quivering behind barriers of bulletproof glass.
And everyone, from the most senior senator in Washington,
to the drunk at the corner bar, rants and raves over paying a few pennies more,
for a first-class stamp.
Yet these threats from outside pale,
pale next to the dangers that lurk on the other side of the counter.
For all the excitement, nothing serious happens after a rate increase.
A few high-level scapegoats are terminated,
the counter staff is abused when the supply of four-cent stamps gives out,
the octogenarians' poodles may have sharp teeth, but they aren't rabid,
and the street schizophrenics are seldom armed with more than their own delusions.
The same, however, cannot be said of the postal workers themselves.
Over the last twelve years, United States postal employees have taken to packing every manner of gun,
from .22 pistols to AK-47s, as well as bombs, hand grenades, and samurai swords.
And their targets aren't vicious dogs or irate customers.
Rather, they are their poplin-clad brethren,
as USPS mailrooms have turned into the killing fields of American industry.
Bullets have flown in post offices from New Orleans to Boston.
Blood has soaked the mails from San Diego to Manhattan,
as berserk postal workers seek vengeance for personal and professional slights, real or imagined.
Listeners, this whole long article is nothing but...
very long, it's a multitude of ten, twelve pages of nothing but...
postmen going nuts and killing their fellow workers.
This is scrupulously detailed.
Also in this issue, there's a lot of talk about the police.
There's an issue, Riot On.
A quick look back at twelve of the most memorable riots in US history,
with illustrations.
It's amazing, I mean, we have nothing to compare with it these days.
Oh, and here's a map to a future national monument.
It's official directions to the site of George Henard's record-setting
1991-22 victim shooting spree at Luby's in Killeen.
The Nashville train wreck.
Reviews of awful books, like the Indiana Torture Slaying.
Women Who Love Men Who Kill.
The Milwaukee Murders.
You know, Jeffrey Dahmer.
As he points out here, they're arrested in July.
The books came out in October.
So, there you go.
Galapagos Affair.
Beverly Hills, Anatomy of a Nightclub Fire.
So, it's a...
it's a heck of a magazine, dear friends.
And every, every, uh...
well, I don't know, as he points out, it's published on an irregular and erratic basis.
By John Marr.
And if you'd like information on how to get this or any other, you know, issue or what,
and, or his fabulous, fabulous date book, which I recommend more than highly,
write for that free information to John Marr, M-A-R-R,
at P.O. Box 640-111
in San Francisco, California, 94109.
Don't forget to do that.
Address for Subgenius, coming later.
In the last few, we've been listening to a tune called Travolta by Mr. Bungle
and more of the sweet Manson Family Opera.
And this thing is by a guy named Moby.
I like it for some reason.
Can't quite put my finger on it.
But I'm not sure this is the right thing to do.

We'll see.



Have a good one.
Bye bye.
Bye to you too.
Bye.













Bye.
that will peel the skin off your back.
There was no Miranda rule back then.
Everybody was guilty, and punishment was swift and terrible.
There was no place to hide or even run.
It was the end of the world, the time of the final judgment.
And in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it,
and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
That is Revelation 9, 6, one of the milder and more forgiving verses,
and one of Ronald Reagan's favorites.
The president is very keen on the book of Revelation.
I love it for the sharp and terrible power of the language,
but Dutch really believes it.
Sometime around Christmas in 1985, he told a reporter from People magazine that,
quote, this generation may be the one that will face the end of the world.
Indeed, that's you and me, sport, buried in fire and ripped to shreds like lizards.
Out of the valley, out of the valley, out of the valley.

Are you a boy or a girl?
I used to think that you got born and then you turned into a girl or a boy.
And if you're a girl, you were born a girl.
And if you're a girl, you were born a girl.
You're just the way you're supposed to be.
Baby girls grow up to be big girls and then ladies.
And if you're a girl, you were born a girl.
Baby girls grow up to be big girls and then ladies.
Big girls and then ladies.
Baby girls, big girls, and then ladies.
Baby girls, big girls, and then ladies.
Big girls and then ladies.
Baby boys grow up to be big girls and then ladies.
I used to think that you got born and then you turned into a girl.
But now I know that if you're a boy, you were born a girl.
It's a strange world where you can never be sure of what is around the corner.
Boys don't never, but never, make fun of no cripples.
Somebody called and giggled at you.
That's a violation of your civil rights, Gumpit.
That's what the world is full of.
That's what it's based on.
That's what this economy is based on.
Are you telling me that you don't see the connection between government and laughing at people?
Well, let me tell you one thing, son.
Nobody ever lends money to a man with a sense of humor.
You're all invited to a centennial celebration.
What they were celebrating wasn't important.
And it sounded like a heap of fun until...
2000 maniacs, crazed for time, started bathing an entire town in pulsing human blood.
You'll see six young strangers doomed to slaughter by an ancient curse.
From his lips there came an awful sound.
And from his lips there came an awful sound.
Brutal, evil, ghastly beyond belief.
You'll see the most diabolical device ever controlled.
The most evil of the five.
Designed solely for assassination by a town of madmen.
Insane, with blood lust.
It takes all kinds to work at Junkyard Sal's.
Like Zebula, member of one of the many minority groups in small town's bubbling melting pot.
One day, his dream is to own a junkyard of his own.
Then there's Bull Badger and his faithful sidekick, Tyrone.
Bull's a redneck, lean and mean.
Tyrone is a man of his word.
Tyrone's a racist.
Crude, rude and tattooed.
Dropouts from the rat race of life.
Human flotsam.
Useless roadblocks in the avenue of progress.
Bitterly envious of the lower classes.
Rejected by the volunteer army.
Their choice in life is a sad but simple one.
The drunk tank or the scrap heap.
But at Junkyard Sal's, they can find at last a useful purpose.
Because even they can be used as a weapon.
To be recycled.
To be made useful again in Sal's scheme of things.
The genetic principle.
It's very important to watch for manifestations of omnipotent control.
The genetic principle.
In particular, they is very worrisome.
The
Oh, that's a squirmy!
Oh, the first one went down easy.
But the second one was breezy.
Oh!
Just a flyin'.
Yes, sirree.
Just a flyin'.
Yes, sirree.
Shall we pray?
We recognize that in thy sovereignty,
Thou has permitted Ronald Reagan to lead us for the past eight years.
We pray that if he and his wife Nancy leave the White House
And go to the rest codes,
That thou wouldst give them many more years of help and happiness.
And now we come to a new era in our history.
In thy sovereignty thou has permitted George Bush.
George Bush to lead us in this momentous history for the next four years.
See, we have been here a hundred times.
And it is appropriate that we become the people of the world.
Man rules now where they ruled once.
They wait, patient and potent, for here they shall reign again
and rule where they once walked.
The old ones broke through of old and they shall break through again.
Stranger, enter these gates and be happy.
They told me, Francis Hensley,
they told me you were hung
with red protruding eyeballs.
And black protruding tongue.
The truth has not been in your courtroom.
Never has been in your courtroom.
All you have is confusion in your courtroom.
Why do I have to stand and take the blame for your sins again?
I've spent my life in jail.
Paying for you.
So that you could ride your bicycles.
Have your birthday parties.
Have what you call a life.
You know, I never had a life.
I don't even know what life is, you know.
I go to your desert.
I'm not even allowed to live in your desert.
I'm no good for anything except to be used
as your skin.
I'm a cape goat.
I'm used.
Every day of my life I've been used.
When I haven't been used and I have been on the street.
I've been chased, run, harassed, pushed, kicked.
My ribs have been broken, you know.
The same guy that gives you a traffic ticket is the same guy that knocks my brains out.
He figures just because he's the man, he can get away with it because nobody's gonna say anything.
My daddy's not a congressman.
Or a doctor.
Or a lawyer.
I'm sorry, I got to tell you something.
Sorry, I got to tell you something.
Sorry, I got to tell you something.

I know it sounds crazy,
but sometimes I have a dream.
I dream that I'm in the food giant supermarket,
the one on La Brea Street,
buying lobsters for Mom,
the biggest, juiciest lobsters you can imagine.
I buy them by the dozen,
just the way people buy eggs.
And then they see me coming to the market,
and they say,
here comes the lobster man.
Here he comes.
And then I know it sounds crazy,
but then I kind of,
I do this little dance,
and I sing,
Mama little joy boy want lobster, lobster.
Mama's little joy boy want lobster for Mom.
And then the whole dream changes.
I don't know, it becomes like a nightmare.
Because when I put that big darn platter of juicy lobsters
down in front of Mom,
they're still alive.
As if I haven't cooked them at all.
And suddenly I start to cry,
because I feel that I've let Mom down again.
That's all right, Laugh, she says.
I'll take them the way they are.
By golly, she tears right into those live lobsters claws and all.
But they fight back.
And they mean to claw her,
and chew her,
and eat her,
and it's...
I don't want to think about it.
But they don't stop.
They just keep on clawing and biting.
And then finally,
there's no more Mom.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Are you hurt?
Mom!
Mom!

Mom!

You faker.
Steve, you know what this is, don't you?
It's a time space warp.
I'm not sure I know exactly what that is.
How?
I don't suppose anybody really does.
We've seen some strange things tonight.
Strange creatures that we know don't belong on our planet.
God only knows where they came from.
Jenny and... and Ben!
The Vortex took them.
Just...
Just took them away.
We have seen some strange things here tonight, dear friends,
and if you want to see some more coming through your mailbox,
just write to that special P.O. box,
140306 in Dallas, Texas.
Write to Bob,
P.O. box,
140306 in Dallas, Texas,
75214.
Thanks a lot.
Stay tuned for more swinging love corpses.

You know, I was walking down the beach
Trying to get to my Woody
Well, I had my suds cold and my buds was gold
I was gonna get high and get real drunk
Woo!
Lay in the sand
With my beach bunny
With my beach bunny
But out to the side
Out of the side of my eye
I saw the ultimate wave
The super wave
It was the most stoked out stud wave
In all reality
It was 900 feet tall
And on the backside of reality too
I saw a black hole
Right in the middle of it
A vortex
I was ready to shoot through that black hole
Had my molecules rearranged
I'm gonna hang five
As I shoot through the black hole
Of the vortex of the super wave
The most god awful wave of reality
On the backside of reality
The front side
And the left side
And the right side
I was tubing
I was fixing to cut out
And then
And then
Which one would this be?
Honey, honey
How do I say this?
That is the


That is the


For me
It is
One of the willst
As much as I hate to admit it, it felt pretty good.
It felt pretty good getting sucked down in that vortex wave
all the way down to the bottom of the ocean.
But God, I hate to admit it.
But God, I hate to admit it.
It felt pretty good, but I hate to admit it.
It felt pretty good.
It felt pretty good.
I want to make sure I have some Google Books.
I want to have some Google Books.
And subs.
I want to have some Google Books.
I want to have some Google Books.
I want to have some Google Books.
