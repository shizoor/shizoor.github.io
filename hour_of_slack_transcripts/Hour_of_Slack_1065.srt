1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,200
Where's your fish?

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,300
I beg your pardon?

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,680
Where's your fish?

4
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,300
Well, I don't have one at the moment.

5
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:05,800
Okay, okay.

6
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,420
All right, mister, just hold the fish up with your right hand.

7
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,260
Yeah, that's right.

8
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:09,940
Smile.

9
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,520
Smile.

10
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:10,980
Smile.

11
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,220
Thank you very much.

12
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,480
Official report.

13
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,940
Let me tell you, you're wrong.

14
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,220
You're wrong in feeling that way about...

15
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,800
This is too genius to be a snack.

16
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:31,640
Hold it!

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,440
Dogstown.

18
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,000
Is actually nothing like this.

19
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,000
Unless you want it to be.

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,860
This is the Sakeem.

21
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,980
The Sakeem.

22
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:57,660
Yes.

23
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,100
Sakeem.

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,560
Yes.

25
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,300
Our...

26
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,140
Flack.

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,660
National present, Cheese Theater, with two of Hollywood's most distinguished citizens,

28
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,600
Bob and Bob.

29
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,480
And here is that glamorous star of radio and pictures,

30
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,080
Bob.

31
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,420
Bob, thank you, thank you.

32
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,600
It does feel wonderful, Bob.

33
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,540
Don't look now, but I think there's a plug coming.

34
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,680
May I? May I? May I?

35
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,280
Well, Bob, if it'll do you any good, I have an in with Bob.

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,920
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

37
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,000
I have a lady in the playpen, Doctor.

38
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,620
The best get, the best get, get, get, get, get, get.

39
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,640
Do you know what it means?

40
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,360
To be sure.

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,200
And make it homogenous.

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,520
Virginized.

43
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:27,760
Beauty.

44
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,160
Fussing.

45
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:28,620
And a fighting.

46
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,080
Psych.

47
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,320
Psych.

48
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,420
A great actor, ladies and gentlemen, is one whose talents range in many directions.

49
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:32,900
Pretty.

50
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,120
Brass.

51
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,520
Bob and I.

52
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:33,740
Home.

53
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,000
Home.

54
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,260
Same.

55
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:34,520
Same.

56
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,620
Bailey Howard's hot rod beaver.

57
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,100
Most kids her age go for somebody like Bob.

58
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,500
Who's he?

59
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,200
An actor.

60
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,380
Frankly, it evades me.

61
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,660
I don't think...

62
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,600
You're not supposed to, honey.

63
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,360
I'll do the thinking tonight.

64
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,080
Why, it's...

65
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:44,820
It's...

66
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,260
It's...

67
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:45,800
It's foam.

68
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,680
I thought you were...

69
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,720
You certainly are.

70
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:50,660
Really?

71
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,140
In just about a minute, you're going to hear Bob, who I'm sure will have a laugh or two

72
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,560
up his sleeve.

73
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,160
So listen.

74
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,340
A pint a day for adults and a quart a day for children.

75
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:57,760
Finzing.

76
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,080
Carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot,

77
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,400
carrot, carrot.

78
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,640
Thank you, wrecking crew.

79
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,300
And now, folks, here he is, the star of screen, radio, television, vaudeville cafes, personal

80
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,260
appearances, and fat boy for the Cleveland Indians, Bob...

81
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,940
I love that head.

82
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,980
It was a good ship lollipop.

83
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,980
Everyone aboard was a sucker.

84
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:21,660
Oh.

85
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,420
Oh.

86
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,240
I wonder what time it is.

87
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,360
My rubber sheep is afloat.

88
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,580
Dab, dab, dab, dab, dab.

89
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,380
Next Thursday night, we'll be back with Dick.

90
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,480
So try and be with us.

91
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,160
Keep listening.

92
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,560
Bob may soon be seen in the new Paramount picture, Paleface.

93
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,600
You want to join the club?

94
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,140
Sure.

95
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,560
Well, you got to get undressed up there on the diving board.

96
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,180
So everybody gets to watch.

97
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,400
I participated in the...

98
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,900
Oh!

99
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,140
...baptism ceremony for the first time this year.

100
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,320
Oh, you hit my knee with that door.

101
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,000
Just to help out Reverend Stang, if you understand.

102
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,300
In previous years, I'd been warned away from it.

103
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560
They said, don't go there.

104
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,840
Don't have anything to do with that.

105
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,480
I don't know why.

106
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,520
But this time, I thought, I really want to help.

107
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,080
For some reason, I can't remember.

108
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,500
It's all blurry.

109
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,480
I've been the Burning Man since then.

110
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:22,520
But at any rate, I went there, and we did indeed, with the total immersion, bring many

111
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,840
quivering naked bobbies.

112
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,960
To a full understanding of their new life as subgeniuses.

113
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:35,100
Many other mammals also show these patterns of aggression, especially when females live

114
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,000
in burrows that are costly to dig.

115
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,500
Edgar Rice Burrow.

116
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,560
Their housing is so valuable, they often pass it along to their daughters and will wound

117
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,940
any unrelated young females that try to establish themselves within the area.

118
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,860
They had a giant object which they continued to fling up into the sky, and as it was practically

119
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,540
isostatic in its weightlessness, they often succeeded.

120
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,920
Yet, aberrant breezes would blow it down to earth again.

121
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,860
But, at Burning Man, on the other hand, there was a perfectly formed flying saucer that

122
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,820
did the same thing.

123
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,560
If you photographed it, and unfortunately, I never had a camera with me, if you photographed

124
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,640
it, it would look like the most realistic flying saucer photo ever taken, because it

125
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,400
was actually there.

126
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,840
It was actually there.

127
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,060
A real flying saucer.

128
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:32,860
It was inflated, but it was so well-shaped that it was exactly like a science-fictional

129
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,380
flying saucer, of great size and silver, so it would float around.

130
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,260
Okay, let's get ready to leave now.

131
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,160
We've got to get in the car.

132
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,520
We're going to be taking a ride down to the docks, Dr. Howe.

133
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,620
There was a kite that looked like a computer cursor, a computer cursor which appeared to

134
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,160
move around in the sky.

135
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,060
Please ignore the movement of the vehicle.

136
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,600
Not to mention lasers, balloons.

137
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,440
You can...

138
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,700
Other objects.

139
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,120
You can remove the blindfold now.

140
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,780
And the cigarette.

141
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,740
I'll have one of those.

142
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,860
I'll have one of those, too.

143
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,200
I want the one you have, though.

144
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,860
Rewriting the Geneva Convergence.

145
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,020
Can I have the one you already have?

146
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,880
I don't want just any cigarette.

147
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,240
I want the one you have.

148
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,820
That specific one.

149
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,780
From objects which might force the soul to abate her feeling.

150
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,700
Can I have that one now?

151
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,300
Rendered more compassion.

152
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,040
Please give it to me.

153
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,520
Thank you.

154
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,600
If you don't give it to me, I'll step on your toe.

155
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,080
Because occasions rise so often that demand such sacrifice.

156
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,300
So take it.

157
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,820
Here it is.

158
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,820
Thank you.

159
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,240
Thank you.

160
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
More skillful.

161
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,120
You get it all slobbery.

162
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,240
It's all wet and slimy on the end.

163
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:39,780
What happened?

164
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,100
More able to endure.

165
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,060
You seem to...

166
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,160
Okay, look out.

167
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,200
As more endure suffering and distress than...

168
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,180
Oh, Jimmy, what have I let you in for?

169
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,600
Stay where you are.

170
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,660
Don't move, Ellen.

171
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,880
Who is it?

172
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,680
I don't know.

173
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,100
Keep quiet.

174
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,700
Ellen?

175
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,200
Who is it?

176
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,160
Conspiracy.

177
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,220
What's that?

178
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,740
We don't know.

179
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,440
Huh?

180
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,020
His head is still spinning.

181
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,220
He's not responsible for what he says.

182
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,880
Conspiracy to commit...

183
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,400
The Self-Genius.

184
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,200
Power of Swatch.

185
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,800
Right now.

186
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,380
We've got to get out of here.

187
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,580
can't wait for the night!

188
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:40,580


189
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:52,640
I love you!

190
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:52,720
We'll get you back!

191
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,820
keep it down!

192
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,500
We need to help you!

193
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:54,840
He saved

194
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,380
9-year-olds that kick you in the shin

195
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,440
Toilet bowls with droplets on the rim

196
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,440
Leisure suits with polyester trim

197
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,900
And an orange is nothing but a juicy pumpkin

198
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,700
Pepperoni pizza by the slice

199
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,760
Ronald Reagan's gonads in a vice

200
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,460
Chinese food is nice with a bowl of rice

201
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,840
And an orange is nothing but a juicy pumpkin

202
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,360
Shopping malls on Sunday afternoon

203
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,440
Watching Grandma vomit with a spoon

204
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,520
Margaret Thatcher squatting on a broom

205
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,140
And an orange is nothing but a juicy pumpkin

206
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,840
Puffy skin infections turning red

207
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,880
Making Phyllis Lafley give you head

208
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,560
Hamsters that are dead rotting in your bed

209
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,260
And an orange is nothing but a juicy pumpkin

210
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,680
Let our age equal pumpkin

211
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,700
Flim

212
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,640
Schmegma

213
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,460
Sandwiches with moldy wonder bread

214
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,420
Oral sex with Ellie Mae and James

215
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,500
Telling children that their mother's dead

216
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,940
And an orange is nothing but a juicy pumpkin

217
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,860
Scrambling on your eyeball with a pen

218
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,880
Giving gonorrhea to a friend

219
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,560
Scraping at a scab with a grill of pad

220
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,060
And an orange is nothing but

221
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,560
Yes, an orange is nothing but

222
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,140
Yes, an orange is nothing but a juicy pumpkin

223
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,040
I'm Dexy. I'll be your guide for the next half hour.

224
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,900
Divorce? Divorce?

225
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,160
Um.

226
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,960
White paper.

227
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,180
Human augmentation.

228
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,340
Flesh out this idea.

229
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,160
Excited.

230
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,700
Changing into the cat man.

231
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,700
Titillated. Titillated.

232
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,180
You know, the augmentation of human animals.

233
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,280
I'm looking at the spread.

234
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,180
Reinvent the wheel.

235
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,120
Post-humanist.

236
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,800
Post-biological.

237
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,100
Into that whole

238
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,680
Primate neural grafting.

239
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,980
It's actually out there.

240
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,500
Allow.

241
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,200
Um.

242
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,140
Bonobos.

243
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,640
Bonobo.

244
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,160
Bonobo.

245
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,940
They watch television.

246
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,560
There's a little tweak here, a little tweak there,

247
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,740
and suddenly you've got proto-humanish kind of an entity.

248
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,740
Bonobo desires.

249
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,220
So everything from increasing our, um,

250
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:16,620
Doing.

251
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,240
Wood.

252
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,780
But.

253
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,520
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

254
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,020
Veil of ignorance.

255
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,640
So there you are.

256
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,620
In the veil of ignorance.

257
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,500
A loosey-goosey.

258
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,300
Maybe even fish.

259
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,460
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

260
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,160
Loosey-goosey.

261
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,800
Loosey-goosey.

262
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,680
Uh, to Bono Persons.

263
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,160
Neural modification could be quite, uh, destructive.

264
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,260
And, and harmful.

265
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,000
Group sex.

266
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,480
Um.

267
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,980
Going to prison quite often.

268
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,920
I don't think so.

269
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,240
Because we are still very little removed from our paleo,

270
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,080
paleolithic ancestry.

271
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,300
Sexy, sexy.

272
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,020
And I hope to meet you in a sexy primate neural grafting.

273
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,820
My baby.

274
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,200
Oh.

275
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,180
Oh yeah.

276
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:51,820
Oh.

277
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,520
Oh.

278
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,640
Now that's what I want.

279
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,240
That's right.

280
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,900
Slack bangers, friends.

281
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,820
Uh, uh, well.

282
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,500
Uh, neural primate grafting, uh, was by Nor El Pref.

283
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,920
And Rudy Schwartz Project did.

284
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,620
And orange is nothing but a juicy pumpkin.

285
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,660
And now back to, uh, the 9X Day drill, which by the way,

286
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,140
is held at a campground.

287
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,740
There is a raccoon out here who is known

288
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,300
for stealing pornography and liquor.

289
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,100
Oh.

290
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,320
And cigars and things.

291
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
It'll leave the occasional sack of sugar.

292
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,160
But, uh, yeah, he's legendary around these parts.

293
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,220
Don't worry about the bears at night.

294
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,560
There are hardly any of them.

295
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,900
And unless they're rabid, they probably won't do any more

296
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,580
than sniff at your feet.

297
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,140
Your feet.

298
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:43,660
Your feet.

299
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,160
Your feet.

300
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,180
Your feet.

301
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,540
Reverend Rosna at the X Day campground,

302
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,820
recorded these, uh, bullfrogs at the camp pond.

303
00:11:53,300 --> 00:12:02,180
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,

304
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,360
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop...

305
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,580
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop...

306
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,900
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

307
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:32,720
Thank you.

308
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,360
Thank you.

309
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,360
Thank you.

310
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,160
Thank you.

311
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,620
Thank you.

312
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,440
Thank you.

313
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,300


314
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,360
How about you?

315
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,820
Yes, yes, yes, friends.

316
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,140
The Leonard Skinner Memorial

317
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,640
Tractor Pull

318
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,740
by the Rudy Schwartz Project

319
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,260
from

320
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,000
schwartztone.com

321
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,920
And before that,

322
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,160
friends, Reverend Norell Preff

323
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,860
of norellpreff.com

324
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,340
captured the Vintage Bob Show.

325
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,900
Our new intro

326
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,400
was by Popes Lilith

327
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,980
von Fraumensch.

328
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,660
Also, thanks to Just John

329
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,320
and Fernanda Nandi-Liemer

330
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,060
for the

331
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,420
openings.

332
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,460
This is Hour of Slack

333
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,800
number 1065.

334
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,660
X-Day meets Burning Man.

335
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,620
Dr. Hal was at both events

336
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,460
and has many tales to tell

337
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,840
and I have recordings to play

338
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,460
from the subgenius event,

339
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,960
the 9X Day Drill.

340
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,840
But before we go into that,

341
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,160
here's Fat Harry White.

342
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,740
Mmm, baby.

343
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,900
Slippin' into my new skin-tight

344
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,720
joppers for you, honey.

345
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,720
And dressin' up for the ladies

346
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,880
for the love.

347
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,240
Come over here, Maureen.

348
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,540
Hey!

349
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,200
I'm talking about dressing up

350
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,060
like it reminds me of when I worked

351
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,140
at Slack's R.O.'s.

352
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,740
You know, right?

353
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,240
Next to Jessop's, the grocer's.

354
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,840
It was the first time I met Foxy Fionna,

355
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,340
my very sexy lady friend.

356
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,600
Never forget it.

357
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,000
She walked up to me at the counter

358
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,780
and in a very sexy voice,

359
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,620
asked me what I had to offer

360
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,900
in the trouser department.

361
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,120
Apparently, she wanted to buy

362
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,760
some flared crimpling slacks

363
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,680
for her long-legged father's birthday.

364
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,580
Very partial to bright colours, it was.

365
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,240
Anyway, I told her I was almost certain

366
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,740
I'd have something with a good length

367
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,080
that would satisfy her

368
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,000
and asked her to follow me upstairs.

369
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,880
Well, after going through me trousers,

370
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,740
she surprised me by saying

371
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,120
that she really fancied

372
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,900
the large pink pair that I had.

373
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,620
Not only did they hang well,

374
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,760
but she thought they looked really attractive.

375
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,020
Particularly the way they swung about loosely

376
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,960
when I walked.

377
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,920
Mind you, she wasn't too sure of the size at first

378
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,700
and had me lay them out on the counter

379
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,320
so she could measure them up.

380
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,000
She also ran her fingers admiringly down the crease.

381
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,240
Well, she decided to go for it,

382
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,220
asked me how much.

383
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,460
I says three and a half quid.

384
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,120
She asked me rather cheekily

385
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,340
if I would go down.

386
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,540
Well, you know, thought about it,

387
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,240
long and hard,

388
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,040
decided to drop them for her,

389
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,540
which I did there and then.

390
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,540
What fun, backwards and forwards,

391
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,640
over the counter.

392
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,080
A good bit of haggling,

393
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,200
and no mistake.

394
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,420
And I was thinking about this, right,

395
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,880
because I've been back to that shop,

396
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,740
because the weather's beginning to change a bit,

397
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,120
getting a bit parker, isn't it?

398
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,380
Well, I tell you what,

399
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,700
I went out the other morning

400
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,380
and me buns was so cold

401
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,720
it started to change colour.

402
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,780
I'm not kidding,

403
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,660
when me very sexy lady friend,

404
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,480
sexy Sam,

405
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,080
saw me coming towards her,

406
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,000
me purple hair sticking out me coat,

407
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,180
she told me to get it covered immediately.

408
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,520
So I said,

409
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,500
I'm going to the shop

410
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,740
to buy a hat, a fur one.

411
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,520
Well, I said,

412
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,340
well, when I got there,

413
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:48,820
you know,

414
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,680
I asked sexy Salea,

415
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,460
the very sexy lady friend hat assistant,

416
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,520
to show me what she had,

417
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,860
you know, in a fur department.

418
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,480
She said she'd be only too pleased

419
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,160
to show me what she had downstairs,

420
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,000
and led me to the basement,

421
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,120
where I could see everything she had

422
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,400
on full display.

423
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,180
I tell you what,

424
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,840
you wouldn't believe how much she had.

425
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,160
She had every kind of fur

426
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,960
that you could imagine.

427
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,260
I was going to go for a fox fur,

428
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,240
but as soon as sexy Salea said

429
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,000
she had a particularly nice beaver

430
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,280
that I might be interested in,

431
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,840
immediately changed me mind.

432
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,680
Well, you know,

433
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,880
after getting it out for me,

434
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,680
I've got to say,

435
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,140
I've never seen such a big bushy one like it

436
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,740
in all my life.

437
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,100
Well, when I asked her if she could,

438
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,560
you know,

439
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,900
try it on for size,

440
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,780
she said,

441
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,540
I might find it a bit tight at first,

442
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,640
but if I buried my head deep enough,

443
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,020
then it should stretch a little

444
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,280
to accommodate me fully.

445
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,360
Tell you what,

446
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,040
she weren't wrong,

447
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,600
and when I looked at it in the mirror,

448
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,020
you know,

449
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,040
sideways on,

450
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,240
I could see it had slid in perfectly.

451
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,480
Well, you know,

452
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,020
after that,

453
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,720
she then said

454
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,780
she'd summat round the back

455
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,080
that I might be interested in,

456
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,280
led me into the storeroom

457
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,600
to show me a selection of gloves

458
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,720
that had just arrived.

459
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,880
Well, I was obviously interested,

460
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,480
but as I didn't know what size I was,

461
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,440
I had to get

462
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,860
sexist Salea to measure my hand.

463
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,000
Well, after asking me to,

464
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,500
you know,

465
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,600
give her a finger,

466
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,820
which I promptly did,

467
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,840
she then asked me to stick my thumb up,

468
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,120
no problem at all.

469
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,720
Within minutes,

470
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,480
she declared

471
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,260
that she was holding her measuring cup

472
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:15,500
and the tape

473
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,960
that I was extra,

474
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,140
extra large.

475
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,300
Well, then she had to take a phone call,

476
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,560
but while she was on the mobile,

477
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,100
I took the opportunity

478
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,760
of rummaging in her box

479
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,840
until I found the perfect fit,

480
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,240
and when I withdrew,

481
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,960
sexist Salea nodded

482
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,980
appreciatively

483
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,180
at my great big leathery pair.

484
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,900
Dressing up

485
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,740
for the ladies, yeah.

486
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,900
Am I looking in the mood for love?

487
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,580
A fat, hairy white

488
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,160
can be your friend,

489
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,240
see myspace.com

490
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,800
slash fat hairy white.

491
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,060
What a man.

492
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,240
Speaking of men,

493
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,420
Dr. Howell performed at Burning Man,

494
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,380
as he explains to Governor Rocknar

495
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,580
on Puzzling Evidence.

496
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,880
I think that was Burning Man.

497
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,900
Oh, it burned like you wouldn't believe,

498
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,420
and off went a bunch of firecrackers.

499
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,200
See, they had a special deal

500
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,360
where they built this big, fake,

501
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,740
phony upper Egyptian temple,

502
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,640
and the man was sort of half sunk in it,

503
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,140
but then when the time came,

504
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,840
he rose up on his hydraulic pedestal

505
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,980
higher and higher,

506
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,520
towering over the whole thing

507
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,760
before he burst into flame, yes.

508
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,480
Did people cheer like crazy people?

509
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,440
Cheering like crazy people,

510
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,220
or were they cheering like normal people?

511
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,920
Same crazy people walk widdershins

512
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,460
around the burning wicker man.

513
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,720
And so they were up there doing that.

514
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,220
Listening to this show tonight,

515
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,400
it makes me feel like I've been there.

516
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,460
I've been there,

517
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,780
in a precision bench lathe.

518
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,240
We've all been there.

519
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,240
We'll all be there.

520
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,440
I hope so.

521
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,020
But do you feel like you've been through

522
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,420
57 years of specializing exclusively

523
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,820
in lathe manufacturing?

524
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,240
Incredible special effect.

525
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,540
My gosh, it's incredible what they can do.

526
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,760
I just love it.

527
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,960
At Dobbsco,

528
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,520
it means more value

529
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,340
for their lathe purchasing dollars.

530
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,380
What's going on here?

531
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,180
Which end is open?

532
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,120
There we go.

533
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,220
I know we're trying to push our lathes

534
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:19,820
on everybody,

535
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,540
but we've got these two left in stock,

536
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,460
and we're trying to do a closeout.

537
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,300
What's new in metalworking,

538
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,060
you might say?

539
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,740
I'm just trying to do a show.

540
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,640
Well, a whole lot of welding.

541
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,620
In Rocknar, where did you go?

542
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,900
I'm right here.

543
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,360
Well, you're just sitting back there.

544
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,560
I'm just daydreaming

545
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,720
that I'm on the volcanic dust desert.

546
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,940
Hail Rocknar.

547
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,620
Yes.

548
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,500
It's not volcanic.

549
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,840
It's the bottom of a lake.

550
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,980
It's the bottom of a lake.

551
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,000
It's one of the worst places humans can go.

552
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yes, it's a lake bottom,

553
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,240
and the dust is diatomaceous.

554
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,620
Earth.

555
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,720
Yeah, the place is like the...

556
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:49,780
Earth.

557
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,720
But you say Earth.

558
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,200
It's so fine.

559
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,560
It's terrible for your lungs,

560
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,060
and it's terrible for your bare feet.

561
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,120
It's terrible for your machinery.

562
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,100
You're walking around in the sunlight,

563
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,000
which is being reflected almost 90% off that plane.

564
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,100
Incredibly destructive.

565
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,940
It's like being in another planet.

566
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,840
It's nice to come back.

567
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,600
That's one of the more interesting things

568
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,100
about the event.

569
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,600
It's the worst place on Earth.

570
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,240
No, it's not that bad,

571
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,760
but it's the worst place

572
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,620
you can have a huge event event.

573
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,860
You should go out there on your birthday.

574
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,980
Unlike X-Day,

575
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,900
where they put on a nice, healthy, wet bean area.

576
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,420
You know, what do you think it's worth it when you do it?

577
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,640
I must say that the ice cold cans of Ale 8,

578
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,400
which I had along with me,

579
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,820
really helped things.

580
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,020
Really came in handy.

581
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,760
Yes, they did,

582
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,240
and even Chicken drank one.

583
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,880
Oh, how did he like it?

584
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,620
I'm afraid not much, but he's a...

585
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,840
He doesn't like much of anything.

586
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,560
Well, perhaps that's so.

587
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,040
Anyway.

588
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,740
Faster than a speeding building.

589
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,920
Look, it's a bird.

590
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,980
And now, the adventures of Super Delicious Cereal.

591
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,500
Say now.

592
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,800
Well, thank God he didn't...

593
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,080
Ah, shut up!

594
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,820
Lemur and then Sawdee made those noises,

595
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,600
but now Dr. Fox,

596
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,620
the phylo-drumming describes married life.

597
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,020
Look at this.

598
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,240
It's the heaviest rack you ever saw.

599
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,120
Hubba hubba.

600
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,240
It has the greatest capacity and the smallest floor space.

601
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,680
Haven't seen a sight like that since I was weaned.

602
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,740
Stay calm now, Dr. Howell.

603
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,240
Stay calm.

604
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,140
What exists in the depths of the earth?

605
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,220
Hold yourself back.

606
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,260
In the chthonic darkness,

607
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,320
some say they come out at night

608
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,900
to wreak hideous vengeance on the living.

609
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,400
Dr. Howell permits at any angle,

610
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,180
at any height,

611
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,440
horizontally or even vertically.

612
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,940
I, Dr. Howell and Owl,

613
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,420
will exorcise these evil spirits from your body.

614
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,540
And there's Dr. Howell as he goes about.

615
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,860
He's breaking down each job into fairly simple components.

616
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:57,900
If you are a subject...

617
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,220
Yes, he's getting the requirements from all the users,

618
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,240
and he's writing down the sequence to perform the operations.

619
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,080
Each of the steps are operations that Dr. Howell is devising.

620
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,020
The worker will perform,

621
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,680
and accompany each step with a brief notation

622
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:23,480
of the essential things to be remembered about how to do that next step.

623
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,960
We'll call these key points.

624
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,440
I call them key points in your life.

625
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:38,080
Dr. Howell's development is available for all new-bile interns who...

626
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,920
And with this breakdown,

627
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,840
we will begin instruction as soon as possible.

628
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,040
Well, as soon as the...

629
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,820
Upon receipt of the appropriate funds.

630
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,340
The facilities have to be available, yes,

631
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,100
and the funds transfer must be made.

632
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,100
The resources have to be available for acquisition...

633
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,540
The waiver is necessary for mutual protection to sign...

634
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,080
Immediately upon implementation and completion...

635
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,040
It is possible that sometimes,

636
00:24:59,340 --> 00:24:59,820
after receiving the treatment...

637
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,100
Of the appropriate paperwork...

638
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,820
The patient is...

639
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,120
Once the budget is approved,

640
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,620
we'll be on our way.

641
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,740
Less than satisfied characters...

642
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,920
We have to have the appropriate signatures...

643
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,270
Mere honesty stimulates us to mention this...

644
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:17,290
And then we will dispense and implement in three hardness grades,

645
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,430
seven sizes, and two weights...

646
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,410
And thus the presence of the prenup,

647
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:24,070
or as you might call it, the waiver,

648
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:29,690
which the young subgenius ed must sign before beginning the treatment.

649
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,830
And now the drama will increase for the next 15 seconds...

650
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,810
And believe me, I had no idea that I would be forced into this role,

651
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,290
but at what you may call it...

652
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,210
Don't say it!

653
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,370
Ivanstock or Doc's Day or whatever it is,

654
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:50,630
I found that I was required to fill a role I had not thought myself to...

655
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,190
Was that one where you got first night privileges?

656
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:57,850
And first morning, and first middle of the day.

657
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,250
Ah, yes.

658
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,650
Let me ask you one thing then.

659
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,010
Is female choice of honest male advertisement adaptive

660
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,270
under conditions of promiscuous political...

661
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:08,950
...homily, polygamy, or...

662
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:09,770
Boy, I don't know.

663
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:10,330
...monogamy?

664
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,410
You're driving me crazy.

665
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,450
You're coming and going.

666
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,650
What can I say?

667
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:19,590
But at Exstock, it was an interesting time,

668
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,290
because new people were being brought in,

669
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:28,250
and certain ancient rituals had to be revised to accommodate them.

670
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:32,290
What could be the source of this bizarre sexual behavior?

671
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,570
Well, it's only human.

672
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,730
I mean, why do you call it bizarre?

673
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:41,250
Because it's like nature taking its course, kind of.

674
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:41,530
See?

675
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,690
Not bizarre at all.

676
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:48,990
Now, others, of course, require a certain amount of what we call kink,

677
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,890
because they are atrophied in their imaginations,

678
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:59,650
and they require special additions to flag their deteriorating...

679
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:03,690
Now, did you seclude these young women and feed them on raw egg,

680
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,590
eggshell, gulps of Margosa oil, and a dish of steamed rice?

681
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,890
It was a fair idea.

682
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,190
Black Graham, grated coconut and sesame oil?

683
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,510
They insisted upon it.

684
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,950
It was not anything of my doing.

685
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:22,670
But I will say that we also managed to do broadcasts,

686
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:27,670
radio broadcasts, right out of the Ex Day main meeting room.

687
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,630
Yes, it was astonishing,

688
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:36,630
because there we had generated future seeds

689
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,550
for radio shows.

690
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:46,830
So, our first questioner is asking, Dr. Howell,

691
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,730
when the saucers do come, how long will I have to wait

692
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,570
to exchange this body for another?

693
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,090
Impatient sort, apparently.

694
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:03,510
Impatient sort is the name of the questioner?

695
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,910
Well, then, in that case, I'll say...

696
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,430
It's not on here. That's an anonymous...

697
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,070
Dear Impatient... Oh, it's anonymous.

698
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,490
Yeah, well, we didn't... Did we specify that they needed to be signed?

699
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,450
No, they don't have to sign.

700
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:16,970
If they wish to remain hidden in the light of thought,

701
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,350
that is fine with us here at the Ask Dr. Howell Show.

702
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,650
When the saucers do come, how long will I have to wait

703
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,270
to exchange this body for another?

704
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,390
Are you sure you want to be so precipitate

705
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,430
in giving up your beloved fleshly vehicle,

706
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:35,890
which guided through the confusing mazes of property,

707
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,870
and the providence on this earth?

708
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:40,110
You know, your other may have more appendages,

709
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:44,550
it may have the latest in tentacles and maxillipeds,

710
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,330
but it may not have the homely familiarity

711
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:51,070
of your own anthropoidal body.

712
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:55,590
However, I think that I'm quite correct in saying

713
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:00,530
it is subgenius policy that you do go ahead and experiment

714
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,750
as much as you please in this or any other direction

715
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,630
in your endless search for slack.

716
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,310
This question came up once before,

717
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:14,910
and Governor Ratnar, I believe, said that he intended to keep

718
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,970
his present physical body because he's already used to it.

719
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,150
That is, of course, a pre-see of what I was saying,

720
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,770
but in the near future, space travelers may get to modify

721
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:32,430
their bodies so they are more comfortable on those long flights.

722
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,470
Soaring through the far reaches of outer planetary space,

723
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:44,130
fantastic headquarters of that swashbuckling cosmic highwayman

724
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,970
of the 30th century, Bob.

725
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,850
Yes, here comes the one and only Bob,

726
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:52,750
gliding through galaxies in his search for star-shattering adventure.

727
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,930
The interplanetary villains quiver in their space boots

728
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,150
when they hear the merry ring of his laughter

729
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,310
and feel the blast of his mighty

730
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:03,510
PONOCROPEC

731
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,730
fun-loving astral wave.

732
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:09,250
The happy outlaw of outer planetary space,

733
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,890
he's fast with a joyful laugh,

734
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,990
a ready jest,

735
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,550
and the clipper full of futuristic arrows

736
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,110
Bob!

737
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,770
robs from the cosmic rich.

738
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,990
He's firey.

739
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,130
He's fantastic.

740
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,630
Merriest of the merry men

741
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,230
in the astounding year 3000.

742
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,290
Bob Gibbons, the Covid veteran,

743
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:48,290


744
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:48,370
Bob Gibbons was born in the interests of America

745
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:48,570
in BBC之前

746
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:48,570


747
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:48,570


748
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,490
all he worries about is compliance with the best existing

749
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:49,490


750
00:30:49,490 --> 00:31:03,730
So we available back-to-back

751
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,250
Oh!

752
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:05,790
Oh!

753
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,830
The mind is the most powerful sex organ.

754
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,130
You're gonna like it when you get left behind on it.

755
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,550
You squeezy weasel.

756
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,410
Listen to me, mister, it's salvation I'm talking about!

757
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:27,990
Oh!

758
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,270
Oh!

759
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,490
Oh!

760
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:37,550
Oh!

761
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,070


762
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,070


763
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,070


764
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,070


765
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,090
Oh!

766
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:38,910
Oh!

767
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:43,870
Oh!

768
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,250
The blues isn't about feeling better.

769
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,830
It's about making other people feel worse.

770
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:52,810
Oh!

771
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:53,690
Oh!

772
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:57,910
I will tell you about the fiction and the facts.

773
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:02,050
This show is brought to you by the Salesmen of Salvation.

774
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:02,990
Oh!

775
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,990
That's marvelous, that is marvelous!

776
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,230
Oh!

777
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,630
Somebody help me, Faya.

778
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,730
Oh!

779
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:11,190


780
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,730
Oh!

781
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,850
Oh!

782
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,190
Oh!

783
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,530
Oh!

784
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:16,250


785
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:16,650


786
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,650
Oh!

787
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,190
ぐках?'

788
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:33,050
Because when I got sc busted it was so weird that I just didn't know how hard it was to stop making art.

789
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,730
Oh, that was сказала, no!

790
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,150
You watched the whole thing and you still want to make the whole thing more interesting but also just want to judge it you'll get hurt.

791
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:37,350
Oh!

792
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,990
Oh!

793
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:41,950
You'll get hurt, that's right!

794
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,890
Look, that's it.

795
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,070
You can't be runaways.

796
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:45,090
or no more of that.

797
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:45,270
Well we gotta get moving.

798
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,630
Karen, I hope you're okay.

799
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:46,630


800
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:46,630


801
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,650
I'll hug you.

802
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:46,830
Wow.

803
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,590
Oh, yeah.

804
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,830
Slack bang the billy.

805
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,650
Now that's what I want, that's right.

806
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,570
Slack bangers.

807
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:25,790
That's Reverend Bill T. Miller, Brother Cleve, Reverend D.K. Jones, and all of everything, friends, can be downloaded at kingofslack.com.

808
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:32,510
Except our background music, which is Joe Newman's Rudy Schwartz project from schwartz.com.

809
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,170
Schwartztone.com, that is.

810
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:41,570
And now, back to 9X Day and the subgenius nude water baptism.

811
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,090
Oh, my.

812
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:44,770
Time to turn around.

813
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,470
We pick up.

814
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,850
I turn around.

815
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,630
I see myself when I turn around too fast.

816
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,990
Oobah, oobah, oobah.

817
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,410
There I am, and I shouldn't be there in time.

818
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,390
Hey, what are you doing back there?

819
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,350
Get out from behind me.

820
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,110
Oh, I'm sorry.

821
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,630
I just was looking.

822
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,310
Get behind me, Satan.

823
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,550
It was never you, it was Hal.

824
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,930
I, uh, well, if you say so.

825
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:10,550
That is, I don't really recall because my memory isn't what it used to be.

826
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,870
Too many lacunae.

827
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,690
I think there's been.

828
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,010
Too much, uh, disc activity.

829
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,470
It's you got every time I turned around.

830
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:21,230
Too much fragmentation and not enough disc proper optimization taking place.

831
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,450
Somebody was giving me some funny kind of a pill to take.

832
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:27,070
You should remember to drink your maintenance on your hard drive.

833
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,750
Everything changed.

834
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,950
One day you wake up, you've got all your information distributed.

835
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,650
Seemed to emerge into a strange guest call.

836
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:40,490
And I couldn't tell whether I was freezing or boiling as I sat on the mobile living room.

837
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,430
And we, as I sat, moved onward through the.

838
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,810
Where do we treat this situation?

839
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,010
Whirling.

840
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:47,690
Blorp.

841
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:48,330
Oh, oh.

842
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:49,830
And then it happens.

843
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,570
Mine doesn't say blorp.

844
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,350
No, I, I.

845
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,710
Bad sectors creep in.

846
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,310
That wasn't me, that was John Elway.

847
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,710
They take over the media service.

848
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,410
He kissed the playa as it worked.

849
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:02,750
You are, I can only say you're in the state of wash.

850
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,090
And as the mobile living room went along.

851
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,910
W-A-S-S is what you'll be chanting to you and your friends over and over again.

852
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:10,590
This outriding, this wonderful guy on a special motorcycle scooter.

853
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:10,970
As you cry and moan about your hideous situation.

854
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,030
With five parallel blue lights on it.

855
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:17,230
Was sporting and moving around it like a dolphin moving around a ship.

856
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,830
Twisting and turning.

857
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:24,590
He wore an outsized fireman's hat out of which fireworks spurted and sparkled.

858
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:29,870
And he flanked us and went before us clearing our way.

859
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:34,930
And he only wiped out one time when he went through a puddle of piddle.

860
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,890
On the desert floor.

861
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,170
Which had not yet hardened.

862
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:41,570
And it caused him and his vehicle to wipe out.

863
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,010
But he was all right.

864
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,830
And back up on his feet a moment after it.

865
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,790
Yeah, you can back up your feet.

866
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,070
You can back up your feet.

867
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,330
The miracle of Burning Man.

868
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:56,070
From Dr. Howell there and Dr. Philo Drummond on KPFA in Berkeley.

869
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:00,690
And now the miracle of Reverend P. Kitty's sermon at 9X Day.

870
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,790
Friends, standing here tonight.

871
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,870
I'd like to talk to you all about love.

872
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,790
I'd like to talk to you about the love that I feel.

873
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,950
For that man Bob Dobbs.

874
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,090
I'd like to talk to you about the joy.

875
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:22,510
The love I feel for the joy that slack brings into my heart.

876
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,710
And I'd like to talk about the love.

877
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:25,790
The camaraderie.

878
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,030
The solidarity.

879
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,550
That I feel with my fellow subgenia here.

880
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,490
I'd like to talk about all those things.

881
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,070
But I can't.

882
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,290
Because I hate.

883
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,290
Yeah!

884
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,430
Yeah!

885
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,610
I hate the conspiracy.

886
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,550
And everything it's done to the world and to us.

887
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,110
Am I alone?

888
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,170
No!

889
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:45,690
No!

890
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,150
I hate.

891
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,350
I hate this world.

892
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,570
And the mazes that they've crafted in it.

893
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,830
The way they bring us down.

894
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,350
And how everything's designed to turn it around against ourselves.

895
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,330
Who's with me?

896
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,290
I am!

897
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,030
I hate the exes for not showing up.

898
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,550
And Bob for the false promises again and again.

899
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,390
Am I the only one here who hates Bob?

900
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:04,590
Kill Bob!

901
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,770
And I hate the pinks.

902
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,250
Oh God, I hate the pinks.

903
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,910
Making everything horrible in the world.

904
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,570
Turning society into a weapon against us.

905
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:21,010
Coming down against anything that stands against their interpretation of how life should be.

906
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,330
Oh God, I hate them.

907
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:27,410
My finger has more hate than a thousand Hitlers ever did.

908
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,170
Every neuron in my brain is an atom bomb.

909
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,670
Exploding into billions of nuclear blasts with every thought.

910
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,730
Leaving radioactive fallouts in a wake.

911
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,110
Miles across everywhere I go.

912
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,810
What's your point?

913
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:48,670
Some people would say that means that my hate consumes me.

914
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:49,930
But they're wrong.

915
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,530
My hate inspires me.

916
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,330
My hate lifts me up on wings of fire.

917
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,030
That I may rise above the pinks.

918
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,250
And escape the normalcy that threatens to engulf me.

919
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,430
That's what my hate does.

920
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,090
My hatred for the pinks is for their small-mindedness.

921
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,710
For their self-loathing.

922
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,070
And for their...

923
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:10,170
No imagination.

924
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,170
For their lack of imagination.

925
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,610
Oh God, we could be here all night.

926
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,990
For their petty obnoxiousnesses.

927
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,130
For their stupid shoes.

928
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,730
For their horrible shoes.

929
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,390
My God, the pink shoes.

930
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,350
Their socks.

931
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:32,430
And their complete hatred and lack of comprehension of anything and everything that doesn't fit into their particular world view.

932
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,590
Why they go.

933
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,510
And why they police themselves.

934
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:44,270
But therefore, I'm going to be magnanimous.

935
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,770
I refuse to become that which I despise.

936
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:56,370
I let my hatred bring joy to my heart.

937
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,450
Bring slack to my heart.

938
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,370
My hatred is a slackful hatred.

939
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,530
A joyous, wonderful hatred.

940
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:07,750
One which puts a smile on my face as I go through the day.

941
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:13,450
I will open the door for that old lady even as I know that she will be burning in the fires of hell afterwards.

942
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:21,330
I will help that stranded motorist on the railway even if all he deserves is a painful death.

943
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:28,230
I will wear a slackful smile and offer courtesy to those who would destroy me.

944
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:35,730
Because I know in the end that Bob will see to it that they will suffer eternal torment.

945
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,130
You're like, Jesus!

946
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:40,110
And how can I not be happy knowing that?

947
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:48,570
The conspiracy wants us to turn into what the pinks are.

948
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:54,430
They want our hatred to burn so wrong that it consumes our slack.

949
00:39:54,570 --> 00:40:05,030
That we're overwhelmed with nothing but anger, gripe, until all we can do is hate how the world is and not slack off.

950
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,870
And enjoy ourselves.

951
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,990
My hate powers my slack.

952
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:16,910
They want everything to turn into subgeniuses being like pinks pumping out more petty crap.

953
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,090
More obnoxiousness.

954
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:22,030
More flat out pink hate.

955
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,170
Petty hate.

956
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,730
Little hate.

957
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,970
Well my hate is not petty.

958
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,390
And I will not let the conspiracy turn it for their own devices.

959
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:36,830
I will use my hate to spread slack and joy to everything around me.

960
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,410
And I will not let the conspiracy be damned.

961
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,770
It's one of the things we hate about this world.

962
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:43,830
The obnoxiousness.

963
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:44,490
The stupidity.

964
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,010
The pinkness.

965
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:48,930
The complete bullshit that they spew into things.

966
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,030
So I will turn it against them.

967
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,810
I will turn my hate into slack.

968
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:58,150
Turn it into a weapon against the petty crap that they throw at me.

969
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,070
Because you need to take things into your own hands.

970
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:06,810
Sometimes no one's going to do it for you until you grab the world and fuck it into the shape that it needs to be.

971
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,130
Do you hear me?

972
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:37,810
Get me out of this one.

973
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:41,230
Little bitty from OBE called UA.

974
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,170
You seem a little nervous my friend.

975
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:01,010
You summoned me from beyond.

976
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:05,850
You'd better be ready to speak your piece.

977
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,450
You called me from beyond.

978
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:13,450
You disturbed my restful sleep.

979
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:16,090
With your childish little games.

980
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:19,790
You don't know what you're playing with.

981
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:25,290
This is not a game for little boys and girls.

982
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,050
This is your life.

983
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,110
It'd be better.

984
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,250
Listen to your music backwards and reverse.

985
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:41,470
This isn't just another stupid heavy metal band.

986
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,970
I'm from the hundreds and eight mile metal.

987
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:49,810
You thought you were going to be cool didn't you?

988
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,170
Get ready for me.

989
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:58,390
I used to be a nice guy just like you.

990
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:04,690
Then I found the taking of a soul is the truth that I want.

991
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:12,130
I will eat you alive and chew you up and spit in your face.

992
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,330
You're a beast.

993
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:25,090
You better be ready to face the consequences for the boys and girls.

994
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,070
One last chance.

995
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,610
That's all you have.

996
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:33,050
You rang for me.

997
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:34,330
Then you rang for me.

998
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:34,430
You rang for me.

999
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:34,450
You rang for me.

1000
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:37,070
There's no escaping the eyes.

1001
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:42,690
You will see them in every dream.

1002
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:44,950
You rang.

1003
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:49,790
You will never escape the eyes of dogs.

1004
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:55,570
The eyes of dogs will follow you wherever you go.

1005
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:00,570
I will not shine in those eyes again.

1006
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,930
You rang for me.

1007
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:11,490
You called me from beyond the grave.

1008
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,210
You better be ready to face the truth my friend.

1009
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,850
We're here for your soul.

1010
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,670
Sons of God.

1011
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:23,830
Kill them.

1012
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:37,890
I will stay.

1013
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,030
The demon voice of I will stay.

1014
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,570
I will stay.

1015
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:45,630
Repent.

1016
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,710
Quit your job.

1017
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:49,790
Slack off.

1018
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:55,070
You have been driven to the brink of insanity by the conspiracy.

1019
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,150
My problem will be out here.

1020
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,590
My problem will be out here.

1021
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,430
Hope you as a saint shall not die yet.

1022
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,050
Will theSenator be where you were then?

1023
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:21,210
I can't.

1024
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:21,210


1025
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:21,410
But I read books you will see in youriseance.

1026
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:22,550
Help me to live like this.

1027
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:34,430
Help me to work,

1028
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:41,890
Thank you.

1029
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:13,010
Thank you.

1030
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:42,070
Thank you.

1031
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:18,910
Thank you.

1032
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,430
Thank you.

1033
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:01,610
Everyone's heard quit your job and slack off, right?

1034
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:02,590
Hell yeah.

1035
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:03,430
Right?

1036
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:04,150
Right.

1037
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:04,850
All right.

1038
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:06,110
Well, I'd like to tell you a little something.

1039
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:09,030
I was trapped in a conspiracy job.

1040
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:10,370
Office job.

1041
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:10,990
Dilbert.

1042
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:11,730
Cubicles.

1043
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:12,710
All that crap.

1044
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:14,490
Oh, the pay was great.

1045
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:15,710
But I paid.

1046
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:17,070
Little by little.

1047
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:17,830
Bits of soul.

1048
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:18,590
Day after day.

1049
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:23,810
So, one day, I called in sick.

1050
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,890
Not because I was sick, but just because I was sick of working there.

1051
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:28,430
And it felt good.

1052
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,570
So I called in the next day.

1053
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,290
I called in the next day.

1054
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:35,190
Turned into a week.

1055
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:36,970
Weeks turned into months.

1056
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:38,950
I kept calling in.

1057
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:40,950
I was still on the books.

1058
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:51,770
And their computer was so ass backwards that it kept paying me because the people I was calling into didn't take the effort of marking me off the books.

1059
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,050
At the same time, my wife, the Reverend Venus envy.

1060
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:58,810
She was hating her job too.

1061
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:00,470
She took advantage of a layoff option.

1062
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,450
She was getting unemployment.

1063
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,310
So here we are.

1064
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:05,790
No jobs.

1065
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,510
No visible source of income.

1066
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,250
And yet the income kept coming in.

1067
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,510
The bills were getting paid.

1068
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:19,050
And we were sitting around the house doing nothing, slacking off, and enjoying ourselves and getting paid for it.

1069
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:23,470
Now, do you think someone may have had something to do with that?

1070
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,810
You think someone may be behind it?

1071
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,170
Well, I'm not saying, I'm not going to jump to conclusions here.

1072
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:30,410
No, I'm not going to jump to conclusions.

1073
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,310
Let me just say a little something though.

1074
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:35,130
Eventually the unemployment ran out, as it does.

1075
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:37,810
Things started to look a little tight.

1076
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:45,830
And right when that happened, we got a letter from the unemployment office asking us, would we like another $3,000 gratis?

1077
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,230
Of course!

1078
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,770
Yeah, we said yes.

1079
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,030
Now, I'm not saying what you think I might be saying.

1080
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,310
I'm not going to jump to conclusions here.

1081
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:55,530
I just want to say, the person who sent that letter, his initials were JR.

1082
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:56,710
Oh!

1083
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,290
So, when Bob says, quit your job and slack off.

1084
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,310
Do you think it's a joke?

1085
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,010
No!

1086
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:05,210
You think it's a lie?

1087
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:05,850
No!

1088
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:10,590
You think it's yet another false promise from the man who has betrayed us so many times?

1089
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:11,210
No!

1090
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,170
Well, actually it might be, you know.

1091
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:17,570
But the question comes down to, do you believe what Bob has to offer you?

1092
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:18,710
Do you believe in Bob?

1093
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:19,670
Yes!

1094
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:21,810
Do you believe in Bob?

1095
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:22,510
Hello!

1096
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:28,190
Do you believe that you can quit your job, you can slack off, and that Bob will be there to catch you when you fall?

1097
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,070
Do you believe in him?

1098
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:29,790
Yes!

1099
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:31,730
Well, let me tell you something.

1100
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,770
That doesn't matter.

1101
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:33,610
Yes!

1102
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,410
It doesn't matter whether you believe in Bob.

1103
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:36,730
Fuck Bob's job!

1104
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:38,070
It doesn't matter to me.

1105
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,330
Sure as hell it doesn't matter to Bob.

1106
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:44,210
All that matters in life is whether Bob believes in you.

1107
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:46,470
Bob believes in my money.

1108
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:47,710
Exactly.

1109
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:59,570
When you quit your job, when you walk away from that asshole you're with, when you leave the life behind that you had, all that matters is will Bob be there to catch you when you fall?

1110
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,050
No, probably not.

1111
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:03,810
What have you done for him?

1112
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:05,950
Why should Bob help you?

1113
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:07,090
Have you paid your dues?

1114
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:07,590
Yes!

1115
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:09,330
Have you converted the worthy?

1116
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:10,090
Yes!

1117
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,710
Have you bled for Bob?

1118
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:12,390
Yes!

1119
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:13,730
Have you died for Bob?

1120
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:14,110
No!

1121
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,390
Have you killed for Bob?

1122
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:15,870
Yes!

1123
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,690
Have you killed Bob for Bob?

1124
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:18,410
Yes!

1125
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:27,290
This joke that you call existence is nothing more than the pipe dream of the only man who actually defines reality.

1126
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:31,710
And you better pray that he remembers that you're an extra in this little game.

1127
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:31,710


1128
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:31,710


1129
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:38,650
When he lays himself to sleep at night, are you in his thoughts?

1130
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,470
Are you in his pipe?

1131
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:45,470
When he lays him down to sleep, will your soul he pray to keep?

1132
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:49,010
Think about it. How confident are you?

1133
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:50,190
Praise Bob.

1134
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:51,530
Praise Bob!

1135
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,490
For about ten minutes.

1136
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,610
Well, here's the Ask Dr. Howell column.

1137
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:06,830
That's repeated from the publication known as The Southpaw Self-Pleasure.

1138
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:13,470
He was a right-handed man surrounded by nubile willingness, but only his left hand could bring him satisfaction.

1139
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:16,330
That's so, so sad.

1140
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:18,910
Such a sad story.

1141
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:26,230
Which can be purchased right now for $5 each at subgenius.com.

1142
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,830
Which is available from the subgenius.

1143
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,230
You can go there now.

1144
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:30,970
Spend your money, see.

1145
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:31,590
These are pictures from last year.

1146
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:32,670
This is last year's X-Day.

1147
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:40,470
And here is Dr. Philodrumon and Ivan Stang and Dr. Howell sitting there at the picnic table.

1148
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:41,970
Gibbering and cabbering.

1149
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:45,810
And here is Sister Decadence in her role of

1150
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:46,610
Trottering and frittering.

1151
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:51,910
Kali, the ruthless one at the ball of gods and demons.

1152
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:56,070
This week, the ball was of robots and people in their pajamas.

1153
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:01,290
Now, you know, Quijibo, the subgenius house magazine,

1154
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:03,690
is published by Christopher Lee.

1155
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:09,690
And I have to say, Christopher Lee was the box office magic word for 2005,

1156
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:15,170
appearing in movies that earned a combined $640.1 million.

1157
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:19,190
Did you know that Christopher Lee is like the tallest of all the actors?

1158
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:20,610
That means that...

1159
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,110
He's like seven and a half feet tall.

1160
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:30,630
Christopher Lee has beat out Ewan McGregor, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Samuel Jackson, Gary Oldman,

1161
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:35,430
Vince Vaughn, Liam Neeson, Chris Rock, Ralph Fiennes, and Kerry Washington.

1162
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,950
Whoever Kerry Washington is. I don't know who he is.

1163
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:39,790
You mean in terms of earning? Earning power?

1164
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:43,250
He appeared in $341 million worth of millions.

1165
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:46,390
But Christopher Lee in movies makes more.

1166
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,650
And he's in his 80s.

1167
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:52,410
He was in Star Wars, Revenge of the Sith, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,

1168
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:58,090
The Corpse Bride, an accomplished top box office star in 2002,

1169
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:00,550
with Star Wars Episode II, Attack of the Clones,

1170
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:02,750
and Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers.

1171
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:09,490
And so, in addition to all this, he is a subgenius who publishes Cui Cheapo, the famous...

1172
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:14,330
It's amazing how he gets all that work done and still manages to come to XDAY every year.

1173
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:17,190
And he looks so different when he's in XDAY.

1174
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:22,050
You know, normally he's like 6'5", but when he gets to XDAY, he's like 5'6".

1175
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,930
Yes, he does change considerably in appearance.

1176
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:26,390
And he has glasses on at XDAY.

1177
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:30,370
And his eyes are perfect for an 89-year-old when he's not at XDAY.

1178
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:33,170
The weirdest thing, he wears a little beanie.

1179
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:36,830
When interviewed, Christopher Lee said this,

1180
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:41,170
I have the slack gene, which just means getting stuff done.

1181
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:45,610
I'm actually starting to feel an affinity for ex-president Gerald Ford.

1182
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:51,050
Through wacky circumstances, he also found himself increasingly appointed to new positions,

1183
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:55,770
inheriting the problems of the previous administrations, and facing them with character and personal decency.

1184
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:57,670
It's a great thing to do that politicians do.

1185
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:00,450
Mr. Ford gave conditional amnesty to Vietnam.

1186
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,350
Vietnam drafted Dodgers who had fled the country.

1187
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:09,470
And I rehired our Dodgers who had fled the restaurant where I work.

1188
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:14,870
A great subgenius magazine, friends, QuijiBo is.

1189
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:16,930
It's not put out by me.

1190
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:23,950
You can find out how it is put out by writing to this address,

1191
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:28,970
QuijiBo, that's Q-U-I-J-I-B-O,

1192
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:38,330
at 18 West Main, Greenfield, Indiana, 46140.

1193
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,410
Maybe a fiver.

1194
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:47,570
That's 18 West Main, Greenfield, Indiana, 46140.

1195
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:53,450
Before Hal and Dr. Philo Drummond and Puzzling Evidence were talking,

1196
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:57,470
there was Reverend Peaky Preaching Live at 9X Day,

1197
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:01,470
and some Rudy Schwartz Project, also heard in the background.

1198
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:08,130
That's from SchwartzTone.com, S-C-H-W-A-R-T-Z.

1199
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:13,950
And you rang live at the X Day 1998 drill,

1200
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:18,270
turned out to be, performed by Reverend Bill T. Miller, the King of Slack,

1201
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:20,430
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1202
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:26,470
I will be teaching a subgenius online course in November and December,

1203
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:30,430
with MaybeLogic.org.

1204
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:35,890
This, you're listening to, is the Subgenius Radio Hour of Slack,

1205
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:40,910
from the church of the subgenius, subgenius.com.

1206
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:47,910
And our mailing address is subgenius, P.O. Box 181417,

1207
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:53,270
at Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1208
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,890
And now, back to 9X Day.

1209
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:00,330
Subgenius Radio Hour.

1210
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,270
2 Beans, ladies and gentlemen.

1211
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:12,370
Around the world, thinking about that horny girl.

1212
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:16,330
Thinking about her day and night.

1213
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,130
Wishing that she was here tonight.

1214
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,850
Singing, loo-ah, loo-ah.

1215
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:25,650
Oh, baby, now we gotta blow.

1216
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:28,650
Right off this planet, baby.

1217
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:29,710
Loo-ah, loo-ah.

1218
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:33,510
Oh, Bob Bob wants us to go.

1219
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,770
X Day is here.

1220
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:36,650
Woo!

1221
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:45,210
Well, maybe they've blown a fuse.

1222
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:49,090
Or maybe a small spider crept in and created havoc.

1223
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:50,830
Doesn't take much.

1224
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:54,550
It takes a thousand million slaves to build a pyramid,

1225
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:58,890
and only one tiny little earthquake to destroy it.

1226
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:03,390
Well, we are, of course, at the mercy of our instrumentality here.

1227
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:06,270
Or a spider smeared across the original plans,

1228
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:08,990
making the number look like another number.

1229
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:12,230
Anybody could mistake a fly speck for a decimal point.

1230
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:12,970
Anybody could.

1231
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:14,110
Anyway.

1232
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,590
That's how I ended up on this planet, actually.

1233
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:18,210
But that's a long other story.

1234
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:19,450
We know about that.

1235
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:21,590
Or in this time, rather, I should say.

1236
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:27,150
And yet now we go to eat doughnuts.

1237
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,370
Yes, doughnut forsake me, oh my darlin'.

1238
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:31,350
Yum.

1239
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:32,790
Yum, little darlin'.

1240
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:33,450
So don't forget.

1241
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,470
Tomorrow is your wedding day.

1242
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,930
It's you, the caller, and the listener.

1243
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:38,290
On you.

1244
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:41,410
That make the audience.

1245
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:42,630
Yep, that make this show.

1246
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:44,530
Well, it's been fun, kid-roonies.

1247
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:47,450
And we're gonna be back with more cartoon fun next week.

1248
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,630
So tune in around this time.

1249
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:50,070
Yippee!

1250
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:52,010
And listen to the puzzling evidence show.

1251
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:53,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1252
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:57,010
And of course, the giant squitter-roonie.

1253
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:57,390
Tell your friends.

1254
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:03,510
So tell Froggy to plunk his magic twanger and keep the giant squitter-roonie at bay.

1255
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:04,570
We'll be back.

1256
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:06,870
Or you're just gonna chase him.

1257
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:07,890
Get on, little doggy.

1258
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:08,790
And marry me.

1259
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:09,550
Duh.

1260
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:13,890
Transfer of files.
