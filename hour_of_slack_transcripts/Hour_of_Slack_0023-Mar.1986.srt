1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Bio, bio, bio, bio, well, well, well...

2
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,240
You remember yesterday, nothing happened,

3
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,180
because this program hadn't started yet.

4
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,880
Well, today, having wrested Carl Morgan's gun from him

5
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,640
after making him think his shoelace was untied,

6
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,460
Julia Fairholme smiles evilly

7
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,160
as Carl attempts to dissuade her from taking his life.

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,960
Let's listen.

9
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,480
Julia!

10
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:22,940
That's right, Carl.

11
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,980
A piece of double bubble gum

12
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,140
with your thumbprint on the funny wrapper it comes in.

13
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,860
Julia, there's a bluebird on your shoulder.

14
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,640
What?

15
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,420
Take that gun now, if you don't mind.

16
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,840
Now, Julia Fairholme,

17
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,180
let's see how you like looking down the business end

18
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,920
of a .38 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver for a change.

19
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,520
Well, what's going to happen next time?

20
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,160
Don't fail to miss our next exciting episode

21
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,140
when we'll...

22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,740
You'll hear Julia say...

23
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,980
Carl, you tricked me.

24
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,740
There wasn't a bluebird on my shoulder at all.

25
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,240
It was an owl.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,340
In the expected confidence...

27
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,100
All too soon.

28
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,260
The show ends and the show begins.

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,980
Above all, we want you to be satisfied.

30
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,620
We want you to never forget.

31
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,480
That's right.

32
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,600
These awful shows.

33
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,960
The terrible wasted lives that you've spent.

34
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,000
The collective years of listening to this...

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,680
This rotten show.

36
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,380
Yes.

37
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,940
And you don't even get it.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,380
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

39
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,380
On a friendly basis.

40
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,360
Wait.

41
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,500
I don't think that's really it.

42
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,640
I think an alien has taken him over.

43
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,920
To a long and pleasant relationship with you.

44
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,640
Raining in the wings.

45
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,240
I don't mind...

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,740
Goodbye and hello again.

47
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,620
I don't know, but it's certainly worth investigating.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,000


49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,960
Why, that's crazy.

50
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:00,900
Ha!

51
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,180
Impossible.

52
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,060
Thank you for joining us.

53
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,320
We'll be with you in just one minute.

54
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,900
Wake up, puppet boy!

55
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,800
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

56
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,780
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

57
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,620
I am Buck Larkin!

58
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,760
No trouble.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,980
No trouble.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,320
Let's get set and get going.

61
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:29,820
Amen.

62
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,320
According.

63
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,840
Everything's going fine.

64
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,800
No trouble.

65
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,680
Welcome, potential initiates.

66
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,740
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

67
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,620
Bob?

68
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,940
Bob?

69
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,700
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,980
And every time you say...

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,360
I see, hear, or think.

72
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,880
What about Slack?

73
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,080
That's your key phrase.

74
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,360
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

75
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,100
Here the watch in front of us blurs and distorts time.

76
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,920
Soon we will be deep in a hypnotic trance.

77
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,380
What wonders will we see?

78
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,720
Hey kids, get some money out of your parents' wallet.

79
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,360
And send it to Bob.

80
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:29,720
Here.

81
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,720
Pull up the level.

82
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,300
There you go.

83
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,960
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Hour of Slack.

84
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,140
Boom!

85
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,880
Boom!

86
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,240
Boom!

87
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,180

Boom!

90
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,180
Boom!

91
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,420
Boom!

92
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:44,920
Boom!

93
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,220
Boom!

94
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,320
Boom!

95
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,420
Boom!

96
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:45,660
Boom!

97
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,480
Boom!

98
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:46,480


99
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:46,700
Boom!

100
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:46,700


101
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:46,700


102
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:46,700


103
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:46,700


104
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,300
Boom!

105
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,720
Boom!

106
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,120
Boom!

107
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,960
Boom!

108
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,180
Boom!

109
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:52,880
Boom!

110
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,880
Boom!

111
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,180
Boom!

112
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,540
Boom!

113
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:54,800
Boom!

114
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,140
Boom!

115
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,260
Boom!

116
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,320
Boom!

117
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,560
Boom!

118
00:04:59,720 --> 00:04:59,720


119
00:04:59,720 --> 00:04:59,720


120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,100
Boom!

121
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,440
Boom!

122
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:02,800
Boom!

123
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,040
Boom!

124
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,080
Boom!

125
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:03,280
Boom!

126
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:03,620
Boom!

127
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:03,620


128
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:03,620


129
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:03,840
Boom!

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,460
Boom!

131
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,280
Boom!

132
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:05,960
Boom!

133
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,260
Boom!

134
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,420
Boom!

135
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,640
Boom!

136
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,960
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

137
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,920
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs,

138
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,660
living avatar of Slack, and saint of sales on Planet.

139
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,040
You have to love Bob.

140
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,900
He loves you, but you love Bob.

141
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,220
You have to.

142
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,120
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

143
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,080
He'll kill you.

144
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,980
He'll bob you out.

145
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,440
He'll bob you out, folks.

146
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,420
You heard it here first.

147
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,380
If you don't love Bob, he'll bob you out.

148
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,100
Well, yes, dear friends.

149
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,520
And if you don't love Bob enough,

150
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:02,860
there won't be no more Bob on the airwaves here in Dallas, Texas, dear friends.

151
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,140
Yes, the pledge drive is going to continue.

152
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,720
And I know you love the pledge drive on this show

153
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,100
because you love Bob.

154
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,100


155
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,100


156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,920
You love to give money, don't you?

157
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,060
Friends, the blanks and Phil, that's right, Phil and the blanks are all here.

158
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:27,540
And they were disgusted with the horrible turnout last week, friends.

159
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,420
We only made $750.

160
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,000
Now, we need, there was one person pledged $740.

161
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,060
And then there were two $5 checks, and they both bounced.

162
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,220
And now this time, friends, I don't want to.

163
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,820
I don't want to have any more of that.

164
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,860
I want you to call up.

165
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,500
And I know there's some poverty-stricken subgeniuses out there,

166
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,740
but most of you are probably fantastically wealthy compared to this station.

167
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,360
You can spare that $5 for the newsletter,

168
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,560
that $25 for the newsletter bumper sticker,

169
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,460
and the $30 for T-shirt and so forth.

170
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,480
If you will but call and pledge, friends,

171
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,080
give yourself to the feeling, please,

172
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,900
and call 823.

173
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,520
823-7490.

174
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,900
That's one number.

175
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,500
Get them pencils ready.

176
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,020
If you don't pledge pretty soon,

177
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,380
if we don't raise, oh, let's say, $50 in the next, oh, 15 minutes,

178
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,260
I'm going to have to get on my Casio and play for you.

179
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,620
That's right.

180
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,420
Just like Dr. Gene.

181
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,640
That's how he raises money.

182
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,960
He plays until they call in.

183
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,700
So call 823-8883.

184
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,440
That's a great year, friends.

185
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,880
That's when peace and love will reign over the whole planet.

186
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,780
We'll all have slack.

187
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,420
Instantly.

188
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,280
In the year.

189
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,840
823-8883.

190
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:51,300
But only, friends, only if you reach deep into that,

191
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,660
into your guts, into the most holy organ in your body,

192
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,240
your wallet,

193
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,260
and call and pledge us some money

194
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,940
or send us some to K-N-O-N, box.

195
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,160
Get that pencil ready.

196
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,300
Here's the box number, friends.

197
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,380
Give yourself to the feeling.

198
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,180
It's box 141.

199
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,140
1-9-9 here in Dallas, Texas.

200
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,700
And that's 75214.

201
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,040
Praise Bob, help me somebody.

202
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,080
Johnny, what can I do?

203
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,840
Give yourself to the feeling.

204
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,880
Johnny, Johnny, what can I do?

205
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,660
Johnny.

206
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,580
Johnny.

207
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:37,860


208
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,480
Johnny.

209
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,160
Johnny.

210
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,460
Johnny, Johnny.

211
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,380
Do your duty.

212
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,040
Do your duty.

213
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,000
Do your duty.

214
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,860
Do yourself to the feeling.

215
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,360
Johnny, Johnny.

216
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,080
Do your duty.

217
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,820
Do yourself to the feeling.

218
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,180
Still not done.

219
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:07,260


220
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,020
Still not done.

221
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,860
Still not done.

222
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,620
You ought to add art.

223
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:10,880
Another one, WE.

224
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,580
This time, baby.

225
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,280
This time, baby.

226
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,200
This time, baby.

227
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,940
No, no, skip it.

228
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,500
Much of the difficulty arises from hearing too many things at once.

229
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,660
Whoops.

230
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,760
This is a tape.

231
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,340
Yes, this is not live.

232
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,180
This is a tape.

233
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,860
A tape, a tape, a tape, a tape.

234
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,800
You know, it's not real.

235
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,360
It's a tape, a tape, a tape, a tape, a tape.

236
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,340
You know, it's not real.

237
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,540
It's a tape, a tape, a tape.

238
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,440
I've seen them, you know.

239
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,980
They do it.

240
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,120
They pee down the register.

241
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,940
That's how it registers.

242
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,240
They do it, you know.

243
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,040
You just turn the register on in winter

244
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,260
and this horrible white musk-like smoke spills out of it,

245
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,520
and you know they've been at work.

246
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,920
Now, is there any objection to this argument?

247
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,840
I thought not.

248
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,940
Yes, you, listener, are living proof that God does not exist.

249
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,320
You, the listener, are proof that there is no such thing,

250
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,920
nor could there be as a supreme being.

251
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,800
For were there a God in heaven,

252
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,000
he would not permit such pernicious vermin as you listeners

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,760
to exist upon the face of this tormented planet.

254
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,860
And here we are, we're starting the show.

255
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,500
We're beginning to be funny at this hour.

256
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,780
Is this the beginning of the...

257
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:40,840
This is the beginning of the...

258
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,340
Is this the real show?

259
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,640
This is the show.

260
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,800
I have heard of a true show such as this.

261
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,260
No, that's silly.

262
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,260
Show is our worship word, too.

263
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,600
But we'll be able to use it.

264
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,280
Don't worry.

265
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,520
Is this then the show that...

266
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,480
Is this the show that...

267
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,840
This is an actual show, not a test.

268
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,120
If this had been a test,

269
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,900
you would not now be listening to the Subdivis show.

270
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,940
All I can say is...

271
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,540
All teenage kids and hip groovers in the area listen to our show.

272
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:07,780
No.

273
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,160
Yes, we are so hip, so pop.

274
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,280
So, so, so where it's at.

275
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,140
Yes, we're so hip, so pop.

276
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,900
What is happening?

277
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,020
Where it's at.

278
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,900
So groovy, friend.

279
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,640
So, so, so K-N-O-N.

280
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,320
And it's gonna dry up if you don't pledge.

281
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,600
Oh, that's right.

282
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,660
You gotta call Phil and the Blanks

283
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,480
are dying to hear your calls, friends.

284
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,620
Because it's gonna take you.

285
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,600
Only you can help us.

286
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,060
This concludes...

287
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,700
Because people like you

288
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,080
are helping us stay on the radio.

289
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,340
You can't buy a miracle.

290
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,300
But you can certainly stand behind a miracle ministry.

291
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,900
Oh, that's right, folks.

292
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,000
You can, and people are standing behind.

293
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,760
Oh, listen to those phones light up

294
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,280
while I hear the great...

295
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,340
Praise Doug DelGrosso.

296
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,200
E-I-I-I of the Hidden Circle.

297
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,700
Whose tremendous pledge just came through.

298
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,200
And friends,

299
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,780
friends, we can't keep saving the world for nothing.

300
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,140
See, that's the bottom line.

301
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,800
There's these, we call them gimme bobs out there.

302
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,080
And that's what most of y'all are.

303
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,640
If you have never given any money to this station,

304
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,740
you're just a mere gimme bob.

305
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,480
I'm no gimme bob.

306
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,300
I give credit.

307
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,600
That music we were playing during the last rant

308
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,380
was by D.K. Jones,

309
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,880
the great band D.K. Jones,

310
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,420
Reverend Dennis Kelly in New York.

311
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,080
Yes, you've heard.

312
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,020
You've heard him before on this show.

313
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,040
And also a little bit of the show show

314
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,560
from Berkeley.

315
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,700
And I just praise Bob.

316
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,080
Friends, it's that number to call.

317
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,180
823-8801,

318
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,420
823-8883,

319
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,960
or 823-7490.

320
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,060
823-8880.

321
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,880
You're on the telephone.

322
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,580
I want some money here.

323
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
Come on, you guys.

324
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,840
Get on there.

325
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,780
We need money.

326
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,580
Call 823-7490.

327
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,080
823-8883,

328
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,360
and 823-8801.

329
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,540
You're on the telephone.

330
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,180
Help Stan.

331
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,960
Help Bob.

332
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,260
We need the money.

333
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,120
That's 823-853,

334
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,220
no, 823-7490,

335
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,060
or 823-7490.

336
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,560
823-88801.

337
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,560
Or we'll never quit playing this song

338
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,840
by Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh.

339
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,480
Thank y'all.

340
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,480
Hey, Bob.

341
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,340
Hey, Bob.

342
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,040
Hey, Bob.

343
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,280
Hey, Bob.

344
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,000
Hey, Bob.

345
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,200
Hey, Bob.

346
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,860
Hey, Bob.

347
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,080
Hey, Bob.

348
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,840
Hey, Bob.

349
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:34,860
Hey, Bob.

350
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,000
Hey, Bob.

351
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,800
Hey, Bob.

352
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:36,800


353
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:36,820
Hey, Bob.

354
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,100
Hey, Bob.

355
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,760
Hey, Bob.

356
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,560
Hey, Bob.

357
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,280
Hey, Bob.

358
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,980
Hey, Bob.

359
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,580
Hey.

360
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:51,900
Hey, Bob.

361
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,540
Hey, Bob.

362
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,560
Hey, Bob.

363
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,540
Hey, Bob.

364
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:56,700
Hey, Bob.

365
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:56,740
Hey.

366
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:56,760


367
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:56,760


368
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:56,760


369
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:56,760


370
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:56,760


371
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:56,760


372
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:56,760


373
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:56,760


374
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:56,880
Hey.

375
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:56,880


376
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:57,840
Hey.

377
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:57,920
Hey.

378
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,120
Hey.

379
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,080
Welcome to Babylon, children.

380
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:03,820
Hey.

381
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,300
Oh, yeah.

382
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,780
It's great to be here in the belly of the beast

383
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,060
tonight, before we get started with our second LA Divide.

384
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:16,580
If we could all please bow our heads and have a moment of sacred traditional noise.

385
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,460
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

386
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,840
Now, friends, see?

387
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,680
Oh, yeah!

388
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:27,640
Oh, it would have been a great devival if only you'd been there spending money, but

389
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,520
you weren't.

390
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,880
You weren't.

391
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,480
You didn't do nothing to help resurrect Bob.

392
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,840
And so what are we going to do?

393
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,960
All we can do is sit here on this, doing this show for a bunch of gimme Bobs.

394
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,760
I mean, we've only gotten one major pledge.

395
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,460
Now, there's been a bunch of small, measly $50 pledges.

396
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,200
We need a...

397
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,460
This is real, actually quite serious, friends.

398
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:58,460
The status of this show depends on your pledge, and the status of this station depends on

399
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,320
your pledge.

400
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,280
Thank y'all.

401
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:08,460
But remember, the end of the world may be much worse and take much longer.

402
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:08,940
Thank you.

403
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,200
Then you've fought.

404
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:18,140
The mere act of sitting in your home watching everything fall apart on TV may be too much

405
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,800
for even the stoutest brains to take.

406
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,420
In fact, the more alert and intelligent you are, the quicker you'll likely be driven

407
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:33,700
to suicide by the sheer hideousness of what you'll be seeing.

408
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,760
Will you be ready?

409
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,940
Will you still bring good with you millones of dollars?

410
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:38,940


411
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:49,500
be sane enough to laugh when that which must come to pass comes to pass will you ever get slack

412
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:58,780
break out of that glass box and join the church of the subgenius but we won't let you in a country

413
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:04,060
freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution anything is likely to develop

414
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:10,020
enter the church of the subgenius billing itself as the weirdest cult on earth what do they believe

415
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:16,820
in everything who do they believe in a mysterious character named Bob Bob is the culmination of that

416
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:23,060
to which man has aspired throughout his long and slack less history Bob is what will bring slack to

417
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:31,160
planet earth Bob founded the church mainly to help unmask the conspiracy we're talking about

418
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,120
the conspiracy just

419
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,760
believe in the power of the dogs

420
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,100
believe in Bob

421
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,180
reach out for him

422
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,060

423
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,700
see friends you can't you can't feel the healing power there's no way unless you start to play

our

433

personal

434
00:18:59,600 --> 00:18:59,600


435
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,200
who won't

436
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,720

438
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,680
is praise Bob, Dr., let's call him Dr. Lazarus,

439
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,080
who just called in and pledged a mighty, mighty amount.

440
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,280
Praise Bob.

441
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,960
Oh, and praise Robert.

442
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:15,680
Yes.

443
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,120
We'll even praise Robert tonight, friends.

444
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:25,680
In heaven, everything's all right.

445
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,980
In heaven, everything is fine.

446
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,400
You got your money, and I got mine.

447
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:44,920
And if you don't pledge the 2-823-7490, Bob will die again, friends.

448
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,300
He'll suffer more, and it'll be all your fault,

449
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,760
and this will turn into a church of guilt and sin and hate

450
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,280
and intolerance for the weirdos because of you.

451
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,540
Sad and sickening, isn't it?

452
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,040
That's the praise.

453
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:01,840
Thank you.

454
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,820
Dr. Gross on that organ there.

455
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,560
Get on them phones.

456
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,360
Who wants some money here?

457
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,740
Right here, right now.

458
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,640
You too, Bob.

459
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,400
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

460
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,120
Bob is a rock, and Bob is a tree.

461
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,540
Bob is a bear, and Bob is a bee.

462
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,900
Bob is truth, and Bob is lies.

463
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,300
Bob is cakes, and fruits, and pies.

464
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,860
Bob's my house.

465
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,560
Bob's my watch.

466
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,400
Bob's my sandwich.

467
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,060
Bob's my crotch.

468
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,900
Bob's my toothpick.

469
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,240
Bob's my brain.

470
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,460
Bob's an ugly yellow stain.

471
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,340
Bob's a cactus.

472
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,140
Bob's an itch.

473
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,160
Bob is take off every stitch.

474
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,060
Bob's my master.

475
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,620
Bob's my slave.

476
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,560
Bob will rob me.

477
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,960
Bob will save.

478
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,820
Bob's my toaster.

479
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,280
Bob's my fridge.

480
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,880
Bob's my liquor.

481
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
No, sister, a minch.

482
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,620
Bob, Bob will cost you.

483
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,900
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob is free.

484
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,540
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob's a rock.

485
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,160
Bob's the key.

486
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,340
In short, Bob's the man.

487
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,720
Who used your leg as a frying pan?

488
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,760
If your mind is a jar.

489
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,440
You can pour down a sink.

490
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,720
The subgenus church is the missing link.

491
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,320
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob...

492
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,480
But let's leave things of this world behind.

493
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:37,740
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

494
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,680
This is Reverend Ivan Stang with the Sorry Truth.

495
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,660
Now, friend, look around you and face facts.

496
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,820
The world is composed mostly of jerks.

497
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,500
All kinds of ignorant, dangerous, thoughtless louts are in positions of power and influence

498
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,540
while some of the most deserving people you know are slugging it out

499
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,880
in a thankless cycle of brain-breaking labor and mental paralysis.

500
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,340
Checks and balances? What a joke.

501
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,140
Friend, if you want to get slack, then you better uphold the Great Covenant, yes?

502
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,460
Before you were born, you swore you'd help in the great battle against them.

503
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,660
That's right, them.

504
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,880
The normals, the mediocrities, the Barbies and Kens, the pink boys, the somnambulax,

505
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,500
the cage men, the time servers, the Philistines, the witch burners.

506
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,840
Those who have made slack?

507
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,480
Taboo.

508
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,440
That's right, friend, there's only two races in this world, us and them.

509
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,200
Whose side are you on, eh?

510
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,240
Let there be slack.

511
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,940
Ah, yes, dear friends, it's true.

512
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,560
Listen, oh, it's getting cold here in the station.

513
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,000
It's gonna get colder if we don't get more money.

514
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,700
That's right, that's all we care about, friends.

515
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,520
Praise Reverend Felix.

516
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,420
He yields out there.

517
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,320
He's an honorary subgenius now.

518
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,540
Oh, we have to play music.

519
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,400
Whew.

520
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,280
All right, well, how about that last piece of music?

521
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,320
That was by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy, yes?

522
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,340
Have we got a new total here?

523
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,040
We have a new total here.

524
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,340
Oh, praise Bob.

525
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:15,960
A new total.

526
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,280
In suspense.

527
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,180
Praise Bob.

528
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,600
$100 plus 50 that you just received from Brother Larry.

529
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,460
We now have a total for the first half hour.

530
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,620
Of about $150 for the show.

531
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,380
Oh, praise Bob.

532
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,380
Praise Bob.

533
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,460
Whew, help me somebody.

534
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,500
It's coming in our hands.

535
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,860
90.9, that is Texas.

536
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,300
Yeah.

537
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:14,840
When I was playing K&L in 90.9, I was doing all that funny stuff, but now I'm gonna do

538
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,520
some of the stuff that isn't funny.

539
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,760
I'm gonna talk about things that isn't funny, things that are not funny.

540
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,040
All right.

541
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,440
When you're finished, I'm gonna go.

542
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:27,440


543
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,120
Oh, I'm gonna do a little joke.

544
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


545
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


546
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


547
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


548
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,440
Don't throw the peel on the underground.

549
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,060
Somebody can slip.

550
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,780
That's not funny.

551
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:46,180
Also, when somebody falls on the pavement with bare legs, when they're running, and

552
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,680
they have a booboo, that's not funny.

553
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,940
They should go inside and tell their mom.

554
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,420
This is a joke about a banana.

555
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:57,420


556
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:57,420


557
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:57,420


558
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,540
This is funny thing.

559
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,220
When people,

560
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,220
when people,

561
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,260
when people get dressed up like a clown

562
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,560
and act like a clown,

563
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,840
and they do something clowny and funny,

564
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,780
that's really funny.

565
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,120
If it falls down and not hold itself

566
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,840
and bump it on the head, that's not funny.

567
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,840
That's funny.

568
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,640
Isn't it?

569
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,180
Aren't you not having fun today?

570
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,540
Because you can't play outside.

571
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,300
You can't play on your swings up because you're sick.

572
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,360
When you're sick, it's not very fun.

573
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,140
That's right.

574
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,220
This is K and O and 90.9.

575
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,100
This is K and O and 90.9.

576
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,980
This is K and O and 90.9.

577
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,400
Listen to my tale then.

578
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,080
But why, why do you call me mad?

579
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,300
Could a mad man have written songs such as these?

580
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,600
I think not.

581
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,060
I'm not mad.

582
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,660
I'm merely an ordinary person seeking life,

583
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,300
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

584
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,620
My pursuit of happiness includes machine gunning 127

585
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,880
innocent children.

586
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,820
If that's mad, go ahead, lock me up.

587
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,420
Oh!

588
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,940
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

589
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:31,180
Just because I enjoy washing my face in the blood of infants,

590
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,640
is that any reason to lock me up?

591
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,340
Oh!

592
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,360
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

593
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,700
I think not.

594
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,780
I've even got a piece of paper that says my mind is still OK.

595
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,860
Hell, I bet that guy down at the employment agency

596
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,080
wouldn't give me a job just because I've been locked up

597
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,640
one time.

598
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,940
Bet he ain't got a piece of paper that says his mind is

599
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,540
still OK.

600
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:53,700
Hell.

601
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,460
Oh.

602
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,660
I tried to tell them it was not me.

603
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,480
It was the green energy demons, but they merely laughed at me.

604
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:05,100
But now those green energy demons are ruling the planet.

605
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,000
They're not laughing, fighting so hard now, are they?

606
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,740
But that wasn't nearly as bad as that time they shocked

607
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,000
the living gee out of me.

608
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:15,820
Hey!

609
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,520
I tried to explain it was not me.

610
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,780
It was the brain, the brain of Arnold Palmer, which was

611
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,060
controlling my mind.

612
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,740
Via laser beam, via the FBI, via the CIA, via the Communist

613
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,640
Party, via satellite.

614
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,880
It was the demon, the demon that forced me to do the deed.

615
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,220
But that wasn't nearly dot, dot, dot.

616
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,020
But it wasn't.

617
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,400
I'm not insane.

618
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,900
I'm more sane than Son of Sam and Charles Madsen put

619
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,320
together.

620
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:53,020
How many people must I kill to prove I'm not insane?

621
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,260
You know what I mean?

622
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,020
I'm not insane.

623
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,020


624
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,020


625
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:01,720
That wasn't nearly as bad as that time they shocked the living

626
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,400
gee out of me.

627
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,500
I didn't mind when they shocked the living pee out of me.

628
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,400
In fact, I kind of enjoyed it when they shocked the living

629
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,640
zero out of me.

630
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,660
That time they ran over my face with a pickup truck.

631
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,180
Oh, yeah.

632
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:17,940
That was fun.

633
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:26,780
That time they cut me in half with barbed wire and then peeled a bandaid off my amputated arm.

634
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,420
Oh yeah, that was fun.

635
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,640
That time they skinned me alive and called me dirty names.

636
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,400
Woo-ha! That was a big ol' cocaine party.

637
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:45,820
That one time they converted my entire body into a wall of membrane whose only purpose was to feel pain.

638
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:56,640
That time they converted my entire body to a wall of membrane attached to a human brain whose only purpose was to feel pain and then applied the flame.

639
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,900
Oh yeah, that was fun.

640
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:07,660
That time they converted every cell in my body to the same nerve endings found in male testicles,

641
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,180
enlarged each cell to the size of a sun,

642
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,500
and then inserted huge sun-sized cells into my body.

643
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:15,800
Oh yeah, that was fun.

644
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,200
That one time they converted every cell in my body to a sun-sized male testicle,

645
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,640
enlarged each cell into a sun-sized male testicle,

646
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:32,220
And friends, what Reverend Jayner Hyperkleets, Saint Jayner Hyperkleets I should say, of Doctors for Bob,

647
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,220
is trying to tell you is that if you don't pledge money, we don't even want to talk to you, understand?

648
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,260
I mean, you can be calling in and I say, well, have you pledged?

649
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,200
Well, no, what do you want me to do?

650
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,180
Good Lord, friends!

651
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:51,440
Actually, actually we have raised a record amount on this show right now, I can't believe it!

652
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,140
Uh, praise Reverend Fields.

653
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,080
Ay-yi-yi-yi!

654
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,040
Reverend Perryman.

655
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,940
Ay-yi-yi-yi!

656
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,760
Atmosphere.

657
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,760
Oh yes, there's some mighty...

658
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,080
...good pills.

659
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,500
There's some mighty support going on out there, friends.

660
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:12,660
They had a needle that was so big, they had to lower me on top of it by helicopter in order to anesthetize me.

661
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,160
That's what's going to happen to you and Doctors for Bob.

662
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,740
This universe will end if you don't pledge that money, friends.

663
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,520
And by the way, here's a...

664
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,320
We have some friends in Los Angeles who do...

665
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:30,160
Well, they do mean things on the phone and this is one of their phone calls here.

666
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,020
I hope this sounds right for you.

667
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,500
Yes, uh, can I speak to the manager, please?

668
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,900
Uh, I'm the manager in charge.

669
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:41,140
Thank you, uh, I have a problem, um, well actually we have a problem.

670
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,520
This is Thomas Elkins calling.

671
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:50,240
And, uh, I was by the supermarket a little earlier and I was coming back from the lab where I work at and, uh, we had some animals with us, uh...

672
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,240
...I think it was a raccoon.

673
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:57,360
And the raccoon got loose and I think it got into the store and I was afraid to tell anybody at the time but, uh...

674
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,080
...I really need to get the raccoon back because it's sick.

675
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,680
And it could cause a problem for your...your store, uh...

676
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,640
Could you have somebody look for it, please?

677
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,900
You think it's in here?

678
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,380
Yeah, I know it's in here because it climbed in through the back.

679
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,500
I saw it enter, uh, through the back.

680
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,340
Through the back of the store.

681
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,560
It came inside?

682
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,180
Uh-huh.

683
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,720
How did it come into the back?

684
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,060
Uh, I don't know but I saw it...I saw it slide in.

685
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,040
It was like a...a crack in the door or something.

686
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,980
Maybe somebody was loading it.

687
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,660
How long ago was this?

688
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,640
Uh, this was within an hour.

689
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,820
Oh my God.

690
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,420
Yeah, the poor thing is really sick.

691
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,680
Where do you think...oh, shit.

692
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,760
Where do you think he's at in here?

693
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,880
Well, uh, I mean raccoons are animals and they eat food.

694
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,160
It's probably getting into your...your foodstuffs or something.

695
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,420
And those things...those things have like almost human hands.

696
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,840
They can undo packages and stuff.

697
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,460
Oh, great.

698
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,320
Well, what do you want to do?

699
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:46,840
Come down here?

700
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,520
Well, could you have somebody look for it?

701
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,820
I mean, I can...I can, uh...

702
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,100
This place is just...we're all jumping up here in the front busy.

703
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,780
Well, I mean, could you just have somebody check in the back quickly?

704
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,900
I mean, uh, the thing is...is kind of friendly.

705
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,180
I mean, if you pick it up carefully, it shouldn't be any problem.

706
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,920
I mean, it's...it's...it's only contagious if the thing eats something and leaves some food.

707
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,940
I mean, if you pick it up, you shouldn't have any problem.

708
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,440
Because, I mean, if you want to...

709
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,600
What part of the bag did it come in through?

710
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,920
Well, it's hard...I mean, I don't know your store.

711
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,020
It's really kind of difficult for me to say, but it just...

712
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,020
Where the trash cans are?

713
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,060
Right here on the side?

714
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,620
Um...

715
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,260
The...the side...you mean the side or the very back?

716
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,240
I think probably it was the side.

717
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,120
I mean, I...you know, I wasn't trying...I wasn't particularly paying attention, but I think it was like the side.

718
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,420
Yeah.

719
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,480
And he...you had him outside and he got in through the outside?

720
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,640
Well, the thing slipped out.

721
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,300
It was like a...a bad lock on the cage or something.

722
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:37,780
Ha.

723
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,180
Okay, can you call me back?

724
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,400
Well, uh, could you have somebody run back there and check right now?

725
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:50,700
Well, friends, we're not gonna tell you exactly what the outcome of that incredible call is unless...

726
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,280
That's right, we need to raise another hundred bucks.

727
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,980
See, we're going for a record tonight, folks.

728
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,960
I can't believe it, but we're doing real good on these pledges.

729
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:06,720
And the more money we get, the better J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living avatar of slack on this planet, looks.

730
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:13,320
Because, you know, when those aliens get here, friends, they're gonna wanna see figures.

731
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,900
They're gonna wanna see numbers.

732
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:22,340
They're gonna wanna see how much cash money you've spent before they'll let you board those escape vessels and...

733
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:28,980
And, uh, get away from this...this doomed planet before the tribulations really crank into effect.

734
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,940
So, keep calling. That's 823-8801.

735
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,940
Uh, 823-8883.

736
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,560
And 823-7490.

737
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:46,780
If you want to hear the rest of that incredible prank phone call in which our good friend, the Reverend, uh, Illuminati...

738
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,360
Yes, I can say his name on the air.

739
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,820
Uh, managed to convince the store owner that there was indeed a raccoon running around loose in the back of his store.

740
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,020
A contaminated raccoon, friends.

741
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,040
And that man spent hours and hours looking for it.

742
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:05,720
And this is but one of the incredible prank phone calls of which we have tapes that we can't play on the air.

743
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,320
Thank you.

744
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,080
Oh, and, uh, I don't know where Buck is, friends.

745
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:15,200
He called...I called him about an hour and a half ago and said, I'll see you down at the show.

746
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,380
And he goes, well, I was just taking a nap. I'll be down there.

747
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,700
So, friends, let's wake him up here with himself.

748
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:28,500
And if you don't, uh, if you don't call and pledge, friends, we'll never hear the end of that hideous prank phone call.

749
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,220
Praise Bob.

750
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,800
Hey, this one's called Wirehead Conspiracy.

751
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,920
It's about...it's about a dude I know.

752
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,680
I personally know who sold out to the UFOs.

753
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,900
Oh, my God!

754
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,560
All of us!

755
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,640
A light from the sky settled over them trees.

756
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,440
It left this wire in my head that customized me.

757
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,320
The wire in my head, it advised me.

758
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:22,400
Better living through bio-circuits.

759
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,800
Yeah, okay.

760
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,980
Hey!

761
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,600
Hey!

762
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:28,640


763
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:29,940
Hey!

764
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,100


765
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,060
Hey!

766
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,760
The wire in my head found me new friends.

767
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,300
Bring it up!

768
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,840
We meet at the airport where the old freeway ends.

769
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:57,720
And we lay down our lives for the cowardly sin.

770
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,900
Ooh!

771
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:58,980
Ooh!

772
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:05,500
I got a wire in my head and so do my friends.

773
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,260
Ooh!

774
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,720
The wire, a big, big opportunity.

775
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,960
Ooh!

776
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:21,560
The wire, benefits me financially.

777
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,220
Ooh!

778
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,700
Ooh!

779
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,480
The wire in my head gives me good deals.

780
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:38,060
I drive a real solid car and I eat fancy meals.

781
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:47,140
And you can bet I kill any bastard who squeals.

782
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:54,180
I got a wire in my head and I like how it feels.

783
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,360
I got a wire for your head and I'm solid for the breeze.

784
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,060
Better living through surgery.

785
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,320
I got a wire in my head.

786
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:20,880
Ooh!

787
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,520
Ooh!

788
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:21,940
Ooh!

789
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,440
Ooh!

790
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:22,980
Ooh!

791
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,060
Ooh!

792
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,360
Ooh!

793
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:23,660
Ooh!

794
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,160
Ooh!

795
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,160


796
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,160


797
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,160


798
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,160


799
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,160


800
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,200
Ooh!

801
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,280
Ooh!

802
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:28,820
Ooh!

803
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,520
Ooh!

804
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:36,580


805
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:36,740


806
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,040


807
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:37,660
Ooh!

808
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:38,980
Ooh!

809
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,420
Ooh!

810
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,100


811
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,780
Oh!

812
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,480
Oh!

813
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:44,520


814
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,040
Oh!

815
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,100
Oh!

816
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,100


817
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,580
Oh!

818
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,000
Oh!

819
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,740
Well friends, we're gonna try to put somebody on here.

820
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,000
That was buck-naked all by himself.

821
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,860
Praise money and Bob.

822
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,420
Praise money and Bob.

823
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,240
That was Buck in San Francisco, and now we should be on the phones.

824
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,380
Can you hear me, dear listener?

825
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,160
No.

826
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:08,740
No?

827
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,160
Can you hear me?

828
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,960
Where did that poor dear listener go?

829
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,380
Hello?

830
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,140
Hello, dear listener.

831
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,340
Which one is it?

832
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,780
Would that be number three up there?

833
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,360
He's off.

834
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,220
I'm sorry.

835
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,000
The poltergeist.

836
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,880
That's what it is.

837
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,180
Oh, please, Reverend Mathers, leave us alone.

838
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,840
Yes, friends, it's a dead DJ that haunts the phone lines here.

839
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,680
Well, there's only one explanation.

840
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,840
You didn't call 823-8801 with your pledge,

841
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,240
and that's why we have these terrible...

842
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:45,920
Hello?

843
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:52,680
Well, it looks like we may be getting that caller in any second now.

844
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,300
Hello?

845
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,980
Hello, dear friend?

846
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,660
Nay?

847
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,900
Hello, dear friend?

848
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,220
Hello?

849
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:09,820
Hello?

850
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,280
Yes.

851
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,980
I already pledged.

852
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,060
Well, then you may speak.

853
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,900
Praise Bob. Praise Bob.

854
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,800
Do you have any further testimony?

855
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,720
Any other testimonials for that great man, Bob?

856
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,140
Not tonight.

857
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:26,840
Not tonight.

858
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,520
But I do appreciate the Hour of Slack.

859
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,500
I think it's just wonderful.

860
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,400
It makes the week go by so fast.

861
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,340
That's time control, sister.

862
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,520
And you know what can make the week go by even faster?

863
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,440
If you pull that watch off and smash it to pieces.

864
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,100
Oh, I'll try that next time.

865
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,160
Next week.

866
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,580
Well, you ought to come to one of our revivals next time we have one.

867
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,980
And we'll do that for you live.

868
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,660
We'll do that for you live on stage.

869
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,780
It's a beautiful experience.

870
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,200
One of the most beautiful rituals we have in our church.

871
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,540
When will that be?

872
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,400
I don't know.

873
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,080
Actually, I don't know.

874
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,680
We don't have one.

875
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,860
You see, they're sort of like floating crap games.

876
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,240
And it's very...

877
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,420
Are you a member of the church?

878
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,480
I'm afraid I haven't ever officially become a member.

879
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,320
Well, see, how can you expect to get the secret mailings and the decoder pin?

880
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,680
See, we give the messages out.

881
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,260
Uh...

882
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,560
And code every week on the show here.

883
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,440
But if you don't have the decoder pin...

884
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,080
Let me give you that precious box number, sister.

885
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,180
Where you can write for information on this.

886
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:33,940
Okay.

887
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,660
And this is as important as pledging to Kanoan.

888
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,400
That's Bob at...

889
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,000
No, not as important.

890
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,640
Almost as important.

891
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,420
Well, actually, it's thousands of times more earth-shatteringly important.

892
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,420
But we don't expect everyone to believe that.

893
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,560
Bob is at Box 140306, dear friend.

894
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,980
He's actually at that box?

895
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,260
Bob is inside that tiny P.O. box, and he's waiting.

896
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:03,180
It's the one with the little bit of smoke coming out from the edges of it as he puffeth on his mighty pipe.

897
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,540
What is in that pipe, by the way?

898
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,220
Uh, the sacred Tibetan herb, habafrop zipulops.

899
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:13,040
And I bet you thought it was tobacco or marijuana, didn't ya?

900
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,340
Oh, no. No, no.

901
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,320
I just couldn't pronounce that word.

902
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,140
Yeah, fromp, for short.

903
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,320
That's what Bob smokes in his pipe.

904
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,460
And people find that so hard to believe.

905
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,060
Uh, but, uh, in the meantime...

906
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,880
Well, thank you for your beautiful, lovely, testimonial, uh, sister.

907
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,660
You're welcome, Reverend, thanks.

908
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,720
And we'll, uh, slowly pop out of this phone call.

909
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,440
Thank you.

910
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:36,780
Thank you.

911
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,140
Bye.

912
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,640
Thank you.

913
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:42,780
Thank you.

914
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,300
Thank you.

915
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:43,300


916
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:43,700
Thank you.

917
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:44,980
Thank you.

918
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:46,940
Thank you.

919
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,400
Thank you.

920
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:50,260


921
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:50,260


922
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:50,260


923
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,480
Hello, Line 1.

924
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,260
Yes?

925
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,780
Ah, so we do have Line 1 here.

926
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:55,540
Yeah.

927
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,820
Yeah, okay, finally.

928
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,660
Well, what, what was the, uh, message?

929
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:05,760
Okay, the message is, is we have, we have a warning that should go out to all the viewers of Dr. Gene Scott.

930
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,540
Uh-huh.

931
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,300
Late nights on Channel 27.

932
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,040
Yeah.

933
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:14,440
Now, you see, I used to be a devout Dr. Scott addict.

934
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,460
Uh-huh.

935
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,860
I was Dr. Scott eight hours a night.

936
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:26,260
I mean, I, I, I sat up, my, my, my work went to the pit, I got divorced from my wife, and my, my life was going to the dogs.

937
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,040
I still, I still do that.

938
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:28,720
Uh-huh.

939
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:36,080
Now, here I am, I'm sitting here late one night, and all, all of a sudden, I begin to hear these voices.

940
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,920
And these voices are telling me not to listen to Dr. Scott.

941
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,440
They're telling me specifically, turn off Dr. Scott.

942
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,940
But I was so addicted.

943
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,840
I was so wrapped up in Dr. Scott.

944
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,800
That I just refused to heed these warnings.

945
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:51,620
Uh-huh.

946
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,640
I continued to listen to Dr. Scott.

947
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,240
Bob told, Bob told you to quit listening to him?

948
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:56,660
I'm surprised.

949
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,200
This is Bob speaking to me.

950
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,920
We're talking Bob in the flesh.

951
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,040
So, Bob and Dr. Gene, Dr. Scott have always been friends.

952
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:04,580
Uh-huh.

953
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,880
He's telling, he, he was telling me not to listen.

954
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,400
Well, but what about the rumors of Bob's death?

955
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,660
How could Bob be communicating with us on this plane and burning you and putting you in the hospital?

956
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:17,820
Uh-huh.

957
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:23,760
Well, you see, he was, I, I personally think that it was a communistic plot by Dr. Scott.

958
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:24,940
Well.

959
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,480
And I think, I think Bob was attempting to warn me.

960
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,520
Well.

961
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:32,500
I have an emergency 681-9738 from Amy in Tennessee, really.

962
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:32,900
Yes.

963
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,500
What was that?

964
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,220
I don't know.

965
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,920
Did, was that a conspiracy?

966
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,200
I think it was.

967
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:44,760
Well, listen, I, God, well, uh, have you ever sent your $20 to the Church of the Subgenius?

968
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,520
I pledged $50 earlier tonight.

969
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,120
Oh, tonight?

970
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:47,700
Yeah.

971
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,340
Well, how, how about for the church itself?

972
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,960
Was it for the church itself?

973
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,780
No, that's for KNON.

974
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,220
Oh.

975
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,560
How, how do I make a pledge for the church?

976
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:01,100
Oh, see, now, see, that's why you've been having these fearsome third-degree burns all over your body, friend.

977
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,280
Yeah.

978
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,880
We need to write to Bob at Box 140.

979
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,240
Well, let me get a piece of paper.

980
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:05,600
Let me get a piece of paper.

981
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:11,300
Yeah, get that piece of paper as we listen to the beautiful, uh, swinging love corpses.

982
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:11,980
Fantastic.

983
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,260
All right, what is it?

984
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,060
Oh, you ready?

985
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:15,440
Yeah.

986
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,500
Okay, it's, uh, Bob's death.

987
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:16,500


988
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:16,500


989
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:16,500


990
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:16,500


991
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:16,500


992
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,500
I'm gonna go to the PO Box 140306.

993
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:27,220
140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214, and you'll get that great package of information that tells

994
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:30,500
you how to get even more, but we can't tell you all about that right now.

995
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,920
And what's the zip code?

996
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,360
Uh, 75214.

997
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:35,800
75214?

998
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,140
That's right.

999
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,480
Now I'm gonna have to get off of these lines, because something weird is going on.

1000
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:39,800
Oh, okay.

1001
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:40,360
Huh.

1002
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,260
Oh, my God.

1003
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,280
Oh, my God.

1004
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,160
Oh, my God.

1005
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,360
Oh, my God.

1006
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:45,400
Oh, my God.

1007
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:55,820
Oh, my God.

1008
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,280
Oh, my God.

1009
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,280
Oh, my God.

1010
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:57,940
Oh, my God.

1011
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,320
Oh, my God.

1012
00:44:59,320 --> 00:44:59,400
Oh, my God.

1013
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,200
Oh, my God.

1014
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:00,360
Oh, my God.

1015
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:00,360


1016
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,240
Oh, my God.

1017
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:01,520
Oh, my God.

1018
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,400
Oh, my God.

1019
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:03,440
Oh, my God.

1020
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:03,440


1021
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:03,440


1022
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:03,440


1023
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,860
We measure things by what we are.

1024
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:12,880
To the maggots in the cheese, the cheese is the universe.

1025
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,480
To the worms in the cooperation, theotto-personae are world.

1026
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:16,480


1027
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,200
The corpse is the cosmos.

1028
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,440
Bob is the cosmos.

1029
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:27,080
How then can we be so cocksure about our world?

1030
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:32,940
Just because of our telescopes and microscopes and the splitting of the atom?

1031
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,000
No. Science is but an organized system of ignorance.

1032
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,420
There are more things in heaven and on earth than I dreamt of in your philosophy.

1033
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,880
What do we know about the beyond?

1034
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,900
Do we know what's behind the beyond?

1035
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm afraid some of us hardly know what's beyond the behind.

1036
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,640
Blast 1. Your sensory and motility circuits are about to end.

1037
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,400
Blast 2. Your sensory and motility circuits are about to end.

1038
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:20,040
Stand by for initial processing shot to aid viral launchings.

1039
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,720
Good morning, Laz.

1040
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,760
Hello.

1041
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,020
Doc, here we go.

1042
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:53,240
I'm removing the protective central membrane from your preneal unit.

1043
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,960
There.

1044
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:13,860
Now, for just a few adjustments.

1045
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,060
And...

1046
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,220
Now you're ready.

1047
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,600
Ready.

1048
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:39,060
Yes, Laz. Now that you're fully activated and operational, you'll be leaving the factory for the first time.

1049
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,920
You're unique, Laz.

1050
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:48,460
You're the first robot programmed with the capacity for free will and emotion.

1051
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,840
However, in order for you to feel, you'll need more than just knowledge.

1052
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,040
We're going to add real experiences to your database.

1053
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:58,840
Experience.

1054
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,220
That's right, Laz. Human experience.

1055
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,620
Choose the ones you'd like to have.

1056
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,120
Search your database.

1057
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,360
This is the fastest out there right now.

1058
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,460
Fast and easy.

1059
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:13,320
Friend, have you ever heard the expression, there's no slack in this world?

1060
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:13,900
No.

1061
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,600
A lot of people have to ask me what slack is.

1062
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,620
And that's sad mystery.

1063
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,520
They were born with slack.

1064
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,600
Oh, yeah, you were born with slack.

1065
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,700
But the conspiracy took it away.

1066
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,860
The conspiracy made you want to be normal.

1067
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,520
That's what the conspiracy is all about.

1068
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:36,940
And conspiracy is a patchwork of different things.

1069
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,580
Some are nations.

1070
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:38,940
Some are products.

1071
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,860
Some are hypnotic television shows.

1072
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:42,600
Some are...

1073
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,060
bad pills.

1074
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,360
You'll find unless you find Bob!

1075
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,320
And you better find Bob right now!

1076
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,000
And no one has ever met Bob.

1077
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,180
The leader of our church, no one has ever met.

1078
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,620
Because as you know, all cults, their leaders are usually pretty hard to find.

1079
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,200
And Bob is no exception.

1080
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,220
Bob will help you.

1081
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,080
Dig your own weirdness.

1082
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,940
I was getting messages in the back of my brain.

1083
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,880
And I just kept hearing the word, Bob.

1084
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:12,560
Bob.

1085
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,620
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1086
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,280
They said you're my-

1087
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,020
Hello darling.

1088
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,220
Hello darling.

1089
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,380
Hello darling.

1090
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,560
Hello darling.

1091
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,780
Hello darling.

1092
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,960
Hello darling.

1093
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,100
Hello darling.

1094
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,160
Hello darling.

1095
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:26,260
Hello darling.

1096
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,180
Hello darling.

1097
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:27,400
Hello darling.

1098
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,080
Hello darling.

1099
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:28,980
Hello darling.

1100
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:29,340
Hello darling.

1101
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:29,380


1102
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,040
Hello darling.

1103
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:30,540
Hello darling.

1104
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,240
Hello Darling.

1105
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:31,740
Hello darling.

1106
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:38,580
Le Mísimo Willy.

1107
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,780
Hello darling.

1108
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,980
Hello darling.

1109
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,000
Hello darling, let me kill your witty

1110
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,860
Well I'm Reverend Cleve, the bassist on a blow fly

1111
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,020
Dr. Rudy Ray Moore and my name's Steve Dolomite

1112
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,300
I ain't the next, I know what's what

1113
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,540
Babe, I like the shape and size and contour of your butt

1114
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,700
So come on over here and give up the cash

1115
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,040
Whip some scum on me, bitch, or give me all your cash

1116
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,100
Return your honor to worry about your soul

1117
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,280
Cause when the exits come, you'll be right on my pole

1118
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,420
To dobson Malaysia we will go

1119
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,760
When you drink the cool letter go ho ho ho

1120
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,900
You'll be filled with enough pride to blow your time

1121
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,020
You just wanna keep fucking and never stop

1122
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,440
Now I might be lying there with a ice pack on my nuts

1123
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,740
Or maybe I'll chase some other fine fucks

1124
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:21,980
But at least you won't have to wear machinery

1125
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,140
And you'll be free from the conspiracy

1126
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,120
You can watch them fry up in your face

1127
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,220
While we make our way to outer space

1128
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,540
And while you're wishing upon a star

1129
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,840
You'll probably lose me and some interstellar bomb

1130
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,820
Ho ho ho ho

1131
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:37,760
Come on Cleve, that's your 17th bottle of night chain tonight

1132
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,360
Let's go home now before you pass out right here on the street

1133
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,740
Woman, I can drink for you

1134
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:41,740


1135
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,900
And I can go wine and stay sober

1136
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,260
And then all the heathens, Hindus in Asia

1137
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,980
Yeah, I heard that before

1138
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,780
Get your popsicle sticks and let's get your damn dead dick home

1139
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,160
Damn, hope there's something good on TV

1140
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,880
For whatever intimidation and injustice lie with decency and honor

1141
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,240
Let the doctors arise

1142
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,640
And arise they must

1143
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,240
For within every one of us there is a doctor

1144
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,960
A dormant doctor, a supreme arbitrator

1145
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,000
Who can be summoned to intervene when crises threaten

1146
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,640
The stabilities and well-beings of our hearts

1147
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,440
And the lives of our loved ones

1148
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:12,460
Yeah

1149
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,240
Now let's party

1150
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:26,260
Seeing someone sleeve job a 14 and a half inch John Holmes Wangdinger specials offensive

1151
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:30,540
If nobody's sleeving yours or you're not sleeving anybody's

1152
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,440
You know, that's the whole problem

1153
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,760
When you give something up

1154
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,560
You expect everybody else to give it up too

1155
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,540
And I think that's worse than if you take something up new

1156
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,700
You should expect everybody else to

1157
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:50,620
Because obviously a lot of other people are already doing something

1158
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:53,080
Because they want to or think they want to

1159
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,040
Or they like to

1160
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,160
Or they like to think they want to

1161
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,400
Or they want to think they like to

1162
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,400
Just because they want to swear and smoke and drink

1163
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,940
And in your opinion go to hell

1164
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,120
That's their business

1165
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,740
Not yours

1166
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,880
The only business that's yours is yours

1167
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,900
And if it's yours and it offends you

1168
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,960
You better pull it out and look at it closely

1169
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,920
And find out why it offends you

1170
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,780
Because I tell you

1171
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,880
It offends you mostly because

1172
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,440
It reminds you that you're missing out on something

1173
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,460
And that's why sometimes

1174
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,960
When we say things in the church of the subgenius

1175
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,540
We offend people because

1176
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,540
Because it reminds them that they're in the grip of the conspiracy

1177
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,740
Because it reminds them they lead dreary, empty, stilted

1178
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:48,200
Hungry lives of desperation and quietness

1179
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,980
They don't like the way we talk

1180
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,400
Because it reminds them that they've got sexual organs

1181
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,240
And if they, if they would just make an effort they could use them

1182
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,620
They don't like the way we talk because we remind them that we're all animals

1183
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:09,640
And daily must fulfill our biological functions

1184
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,180
And as they are something of which God almighty or whoever

1185
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:17,240
Brought us here, gave us, we have no control over them

1186
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,780
Therefore, they've been told, oh that's nasty

1187
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,780
Put it in that little clean white bowl

1188
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,620
That symbol of purity

1189
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:27,660
Why do you have to flush away

1190
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,540
Pure water

1191
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:35,420
With nothing but biological salts dissolved in it

1192
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,520
With five and a half gallons of fresh water

1193
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,860
That somebody could be cooking dinner and drinking

1194
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,920
Our friends

1195
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,480
It's because

1196
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:49,200
Some people don't like to be reminded

1197
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,280
They pretend

1198
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,020
That if they don't talk about it

1199
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,740
And don't think about it

1200
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,260
Then they can forget about it

1201
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:03,880
And if they're not reminded that they have to squat down and

1202
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,200
Like every other monkey on this planet every day

1203
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,460
If things are working right

1204
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:13,180
Then maybe they think they aren't one of them monkeys that's on this planet

1205
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:18,200
But the big smart dumb monkeys with too much shit and not enough time

1206
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,660
Yeah, talking about you

1207
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,480
And all you other signifying monkeys

1208
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,520
That's why people get offended

1209
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,520
That's why they don't like to hear us talk about prairie squid

1210
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,800
Oh God, how disgusting

1211
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,100
To use an aphorism of that disgusting nature

1212
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,240
But what they're missing is the point that we're saying is that

1213
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,400
A prairie squid is just like any other wild animal

1214
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,680
It's a natural thing

1215
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,120
You can't cover up a prairie squid

1216
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,120
Because it'll come creeping out some

1217
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,920
And you stamp out the prairie squid

1218
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,520
And you stamp out life itself

1219
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,380
That's what we're saying

1220
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,820
We're saying that our biology is what we are

1221
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,420
And there's nothing we can do about it but enjoy it

1222
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,860
That's why sometimes we offend people

1223
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,000
That's why the church will never be

1224
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:15,480
Something you'll see in prime time television

1225
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:21,640
Because they don't want you to be reminded of what you really are

1226
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,700
Because then you take a good look at yourself and realize

1227
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:30,560
Then hell, what am I doing all this shit, them, for?

1228
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,400
That's why they don't like for us to say these things

1229
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,500
That's why prairie squid is a thing

1230
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,520
Poo dog, poo dog

1231
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:47,640
All those strange, strange cult references

1232
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,440
They're all symbols as old as mankind himself

1233
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,100
Just like Bob is a symbol of what is as old as mankind or older

1234
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:00,560
If you believe everything a subgenius tells you

1235
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,640
Or writes down for you

1236
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,640
Hell, put it down in a book, I'll worship it

1237
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,400
Hell, sit up here on the table at dinner time

1238
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,280
I'll worship it

1239
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,400
Hell, put it on sale, I'll worship it

1240
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,600
Yeah, everybody's looking for bargain basement salvation

1241
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,060
Uh-huh, well, Dobbs will be the first to tell you

1242
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,200
You'd pay to know what you really think

1243
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:49,820
As long as you believe

1244
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,200
So here's what I want to tell you

1245
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,460
Like this, when an old man tells you

1246
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:53,460


1247
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:53,460


1248
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:56,380
Yeah, I mean do it

1249
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,100
depende

1250
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:05,440
What I want, I want you to know

1251
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,220
the small dobstown in South America.

1252
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,900
Yes, it used to be in Bolivia.

1253
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,780
Now it's outside of Rio

1254
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,220
where you can get to a Xerox machine easier.

1255
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,200
And you think I'm pulling your leg, don't you?

1256
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,280
You don't really believe there's a South American

1257
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:25,120
emissionary outpost for the church, do you?

1258
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,480
I'll be there and you won't.

1259
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,760
Friends, let's get one last pledge in here, okay?

1260
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,600
Just pledge that last five bucks you got in your pockets.

1261
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,120
Why not?

1262
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,920
It'll earn your way into subgenius hell.

1263
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,940
And friends, when you compare that one

1264
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,640
to some of the other heavens that people describe to you,

1265
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,520
I think you'd rather be in that poor subgenius hell.

1266
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,380
It's fun.

1267
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:54,660
That's 823-8801 for subgenius hell

1268
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,200
or 823-8883.

1269
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:01,380
Friends, we have actually achieved our goal.

1270
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,440
Praise Bob.

1271
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,000
There is slack.

1272
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,640
Oh, what other little pieces did I have in here?

1273
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:14,800
We heard Pete Scott doing that wonderful song,

1274
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,140
Let Me Feel Your Willie.

1275
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,340
I don't know what that's about.

1276
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,100
And friends, once again,

1277
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:24,340
we're going to give you that sacred box number.

1278
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:32,220
That's Bob, friends, at P.O. Box 148.

1279
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:39,480
40306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1280
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,020
Order now.

1281
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:43,240
Not available in any stores.

1282
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:46,480
And your eternal salvation, friends,

1283
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,460
or triple your money back, guaranteed.

1284
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,920
You can't beat that kind of deal.

1285
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,900
And you know, friends, where other religions

1286
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,700
may offer you eternal salvation

1287
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,240
from all your worldly goods,

1288
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,900
why, for three bucks from us,

1289
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,700
you can get that from the subgenius church.

1290
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,560
Get yourself an excuse.

1291
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,880
I can't tell you about that stuff.

1292
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,440
You can get that if you keep listening to this show

1293
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,480
and keep pledging, friends.

1294
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,080
The excuse for everything.

1295
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,140
That's right.

1296
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:20,800
The excuse for every sin against God, man, nature,

1297
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,780
woman, or child, or beast that you've ever done.

1298
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,440
You can get that excuse from us.

1299
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,140
Yes, friends, and send that money

1300
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,880
and hang in there for norms.

1301
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,880
The amazing...

1302
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,340
Yeah, what...

1303
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:35,160
That's right.

1304
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,400
Okay, it's a two-headed show, friends.

1305
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,000
Hang on for Monday Morning with...

1306
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,800
What's his name?

1307
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,160
Him, too.

1308
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,000
All right.

1309
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,440
That's it, friends.

1310
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,320
And their guests, Lee Trench and...

1311
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,440
Kathy Blalock.

1312
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,380
That's right.

1313
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,480
Kathy and Lee.

1314
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,540
Praise Kathy.

1315
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,940
From the...

1316
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,760
From the Motor Video.

1317
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,700
From Music, Dallas Music Video Show

1318
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,400
on the Public Access Channel.

1319
00:59:59,480 --> 00:59:59,820
That's right.

1320
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:00,860
The DMV...

1321
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:01,280
The DMV Show.

1322
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:02,780
On who...

1323
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:03,660
On whose show?

1324
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,120
Why, I've been a guest.

1325
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:06,580
Norm's been a guest.

1326
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,480
Hang in there for Monday Morning, folks.

1327
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,240
We've still got two minutes to play the subgenius credits.

1328
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:14,000
And for you to mail in that pledge.

1329
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:14,500
That's right.

1330
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,480
If you can put that...

1331
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:20,060
That stamp on that envelope before this song ends

1332
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,840
and get it down to your mailbox

1333
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,960
before the next song ends,

1334
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,900
then Norm will be on.

1335
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:27,940
So you better do that quick.

1336
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:29,060
Otherwise...

1337
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:30,260
There's...

1338
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:30,900
The end.

1339
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,100
The day my coon dog died

1340
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:38,020
Reading the pamphlet

1341
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,140
Over and over again

1342
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:47,480
I was drinking Budweiser

1343
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,460
And Bob was on TV

1344
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,320
The day that Uncle

1345
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,500
Good kick

1346
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,240
By Bob was on TV

1347
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:05,560
I was with Cousin Junior

1348
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,240
The DNA backfired

1349
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:14,620
I was drunk

1350
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,960
I was lonely

1351
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,020
I was plastered

1352
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:24,560
I was drinking Budweiser

1353
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,260
And Bob was on TV

1354
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,240

1356
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:30,240


1357
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:30,240


1358
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:30,240


1359
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:34,140
Drinking Budweiser

1360
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:37,740
Watching Bob on TV

1361
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:43,180

Ped loyalty

1367
