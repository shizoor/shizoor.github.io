1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,740
Climb inside.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,160
On the way to

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,580
if you climb inside.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,420
Climb inside my little people.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,900
Climb inside my little people.

6
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:58,480
Climb inside my little people.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,240
I've returned.

8
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,380
Here in the West,

9
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,400
I'm called Christ.

10
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,500
I've been sent by my father Lucifer

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,860
as a divine agent of intervention

12
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,120
to save you from a nuclear holocaust

13
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,660
and the destruction of the human race.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,720
Be not afraid.

15
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,800
The great disappearance that has just occurred

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,640
is all part of the plan.

17
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,800
These people that were removed

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,980
were highly concerned.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,200
They were crystallized in their thought patterns.

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
They would have been unable to accept

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,560
the new age of Satanism.

22
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,880
And now the old is gone

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,200
and it's time to bring in the new.

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,920
I come to bring you all to God.

25
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,100
All religions have strayed

26
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,680
from the cosmic truth of God

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
and the universe.

28
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,140
Now I will show you all

29
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,820
the simple path to God

30
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,240
and you shall see all of yourselves

31
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,180
as the divine beings that you truly are.

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,980
All one.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,040
In the vast synchronicity of the cosmos.

34
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,240
You will understand the great law of karma

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,720
and you will learn to live in peace and harmony

36
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,340
and brotherhood among all of mankind.

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,040
Together we can eliminate all war,

38
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,440
suffering, disease, hunger, and injustice.

39
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,280
Love and light can fill the earth

40
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,220
and we shall seal the door

41
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,480
where evil dwells forever

42
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,060
and the great plan can be fulfilled.

43
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,100
The perfection of the Aryan root race.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,620
Follow me,

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,860
brothers and sisters,

46
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,200
and we shall create a new world.

47
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,280
Today,

48
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,240
the kingdom of God has come upon you.

49
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,920
May the force be with you all.

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,780
My friends,

51
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,500
that was a direct reading

52
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,640
from a so-called radio broadcast.

53
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,620
It was done last week.

54
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,440
I didn't want to play.

55
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,620
I didn't have a tape of the original,

56
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,460
but that's the exact words of a broadcast.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,180
I'm afraid that what I'm going to say to you

58
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,160
will shock you.

59
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,600
It will disturb your sleep.

60
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,800
It will make you worry for your loved ones.

61
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,560
It will give you nightmares of disaster,

62
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,700
plague, and horrible death.

63
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,880
It will make you rethink the priorities of your life.

64
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,440
It will change the way that you look at yourself

65
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,920
and the world.

66
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,180
There is a killer loose in the land.

67
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,980
This killer cuts down all that he touches.

68
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,320
If he touches you,

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,860
you will die.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,600
If he touches your child,

71
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,580
your child will die.

72
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,060
His victims die a slow, horrible death.

73
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,340
They waste away.

74
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,140
They drown in their own body fluids.

75
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,100
They lose control of their mouth.

76
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,380
They lose their memory.

77
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,920
They become demented.

78
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,340
They die in agony.

79
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,220
There is nothing that can be done to save them.

80
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,200
The killer's name is J.R. Bob Dogs,

81
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,560
or Bob for short.

82
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,980
When he starts talking,

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,080
he says,

84
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,720
to kill you,

85
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,780
it is said that you are slackless,

86
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,160
an insensate,

87
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,600
mean puppet with no soul,

88
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,860
an occupant of an earth ship

89
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,100
rocketing headlong into Armageddon.

90
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,100
This killer and his cult of followers

91
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,160
first emerged on the American scene in the 1950s,

92
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,020
rising like an angel of printing death

93
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,660
from out of the oozing rivers of body fluids

94
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,240
that spilled like fettish waterfalls

95
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,280
into the streets of our beloved,

96
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:29,980
America.

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,280
From the sick and sleazy pleasure houses

98
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,520
of the killer Bob and his twisted subgeniuses.

99
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,840
And yet, despite this heinous assault

100
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,340
on all of the good and pure and virtuous traditions

101
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,720
that made America a shining beacon of freedom

102
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,580
to all the world,

103
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,660
the authorities have done nothing to stop this terror

104
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,660
from washing over this great land

105
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,280
like a sea of evil blood.

106
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,060
In fact, the leaders that you elected

107
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,980
are able to save you.

108
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,060
They are the ones that are leading

109
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,320
and abetting their cause,

110
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,620
claiming these evil subgeniuses

111
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,680
have the same rights as ordinary people.

112
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,820
Our elected officials are daring to let these freaks

113
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,160
and perverts hide behind the protection

114
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,120
of the Constitution of the United States.

115
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,640
It has been well documented that the tremendous power

116
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,840
of organized militant groups such as

117
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,200
the Subgenius Liberation Army Corps, or SLAC,

118
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,400
SLAC,

119
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,560
have its slimy tendrils deep into the White House,

120
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,260
the United Nations, and possibly even to the Vatican

121
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,900
and the Council on Foreign Relations.

122
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,640
These swine hold most of our craven and criminal politicians

123
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,800
in thrall, either through threats and blackmail,

124
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,720
or else through the politicians' own naked lust

125
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,280
for the pleasures that Bob's world offers.

126
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,260
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

127
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,440
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

128
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,280
which reaches from the inner mind to...

129
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,160
The Subgenius Hour of SLAC!

130
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,080
He was an average sort of guy, the image of a song.

131
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,080
How can I say this?

132
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,880
There was good in Larry and there was evil.

133
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,000
The evil part broke through, took hold.

134
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,400
He was an average sort of guy, the image of a song.

135
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:32,880
The evil part broke through, took hold.

136
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:32,880


137
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,520
I'm a reporter, not a mystic, Linda.

138
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,620
If what's happened has made this all clear,

139
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,320
well, then, perhaps it makes sense after all.

140
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,860
And in all men.

141
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,600
When I first heard of Larry and Sarah,

142
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,920
We are...

143
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,920
Ain't got no car

144
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,960
Ain't got no wife

145
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,040
In fact, I got killed

146
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,620
Coming over here tonight

147
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,200
I am a dead man

148
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,720
I'm laying on the floor

149
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,380
I am a dead man

150
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,720
I am deceased

151
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,260
And once more, I am a dead man

152
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,360
Yes, I have discontinued living

153
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,240
I have given up on cash

154
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,920
Wine and women

155
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,180
I ain't got no money

156
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,020
I ain't got no shoes

157
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,200
I guess it ain't funny

158
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,860
That is why I have the blues

159
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,720
I am so dead that I feel like a stiff

160
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,140
If you don't believe it

161
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,180
I am a dead man

162
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,080
Just take a sniff

163
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,560
I am a dead man

164
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,100
Sniff me

165
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,680
Ain't got no job

166
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,220
Cause I won't need it anymore

167
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,000
Can't hit the time clock

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,460
Cause I can't get up no more

169
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,580
I'm on a permanent vacation

170
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,440
With no pay

171
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,620
Don't ask me what I think

172
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,400
Cause I got nothing to say

173
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
I tell you I am dead

174
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
That's why I have the blues

175
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,720
Yes, that's what I said

176
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,520
Now I'm telling you the news

177
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,840
I am a dead man

178
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,160
As quick as I can be

179
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,160


180
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,160


181
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,160


182
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,160


183
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,620
I am a dead man

184
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,680
If you don't believe it, just touch me

185
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,060
I am a dead man

186
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,740
I have paid the ultimate price

187
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,800
That's why I'm qualified

188
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,060
To give you this advice

189
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,480
I'm a dead man

190
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,460
D-E-A-D

191
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,100
I am dead

192
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,080
That's what I said

193
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,180
I am dead

194
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,420
Oh, yes, dear friends

195
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,780
And it's true

196
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,060
It's, uh, John Bartles there

197
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,420
A fine, fine performer

198
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,260
But, uh, it, uh

199
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,520
And we'll get back to more

200
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,980
From the fine Mr. Bartles

201
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,500
As soon as we can

202
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,800
But, you know, the power

203
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,780
The power of organized perversion

204
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,760
Is a factor in the suppression

205
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,520
Of the truth about this bomb

206
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,660
And it is certainly a fact

207
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,740
That these deviants

208
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,640
Are a part of the media's push

209
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,280
To destroy America

210
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,260
If the uncensored truth about Bob

211
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,860
Were released to the American people

212
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,800
It would have the potential

213
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,300
Of permanently derailing the plan

214
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,580
To submerge America

215
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,940
Into a multicultural new world order

216
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,540
It would have the potential

217
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,140
Of waking up the sleeping American people

218
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,740
And our masters in Washington

219
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,300
New York and Dobstown, Bolivia

220
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,120
Cannot allow that to happen

221
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,760
And so, uh, I'm going to

222
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,960
Tell you a little bit more

223
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:27,960


224
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,900
We're repeatedly told

225
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,980
By the controlled media

226
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,080
That the Church of the Subgenius

227
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,120
Is a joke

228
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,040
A bunch of crackpots

229
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,620
Boking a little fun

230
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,880
At our sacred American heritage

231
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,940
But that simply is not true

232
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,440
In fact, they are

233
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,600
An extremist paramilitary organization

234
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,080
Highly trained in the art

235
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,320
Of mind control

236
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,260
Trained by who?

237
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,720
By our own CIA

238
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,460
That's who

239
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,520
The Church of the Subgenius

240
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,680
Infiltrated our most secret organization

241
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,180
In 1953

242
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,500
When a letter signed by J. Edgar Hoover

243
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,800
Recommended that a young man

244
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,820
Named J.R. Bob Dobbs

245
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,520
Be placed in charge of the U.S. Air Force's

246
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,920
Project Blue Book

247
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,420
Investigating the phenomenon

248
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,700
Known as UFOs

249
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,640
In later years

250
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,000
He befriended a young agent

251
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,520
Named George Bush

252
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,240
And a soldier named

253
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,500
Lee Harvey Oswald

254
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,580
Yes, it is some great joke

255
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,700
Isn't it?

256
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,760
Let's hope that the rest of us

257
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,400
Survive long enough

258
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,180
To make it to the punchline

259
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,560
When Dobbs left the government payroll

260
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,260
In late 1970s

261
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,360
He had by then left a long trail

262
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,580
Of twisted minds behind him

263
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,320
Key government officials

264
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,080
Converted into practicing occultists

265
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,240
In the surface of the killer bob

266
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,960
It has been speculated

267
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,680
That between 80 and 95 percent

268
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,800
Of children that disappear

269
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,600
From our homes due to kidnapping

270
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,160
Are converted to the subgenius faith

271
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,920
By means of drugs, torture, and starvation

272
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,300
These children are smuggled out of the country

273
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,640
And sent to one of the cult's

274
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,680
Overseas slave labor camps

275
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,360
Cruel sweatshops

276
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,900
Where the children are forced to spend

277
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,980
16 hours a day

278
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,920
Making fake miracle trinkets

279
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,880
Which their false prophet leader

280
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,440
Bob

281
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,200
Peddles to his followers

282
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,400
Making over 17 million dollars

283
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,340
In 1993

284
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,980
Many of the children are sent to Thailand

285
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,760
To stalk Bob's

286
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,300
Many brothers

287
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,040
Some are sent to one of the 13

288
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,960
Dobbs town training centers

289
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,020
To be indoctrinated

290
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,660
To learn the dark secrets of the cult

291
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,820
And to work in their jungle laboratories

292
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,960
Manufacturing a designer drug

293
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,660
Called Gabrogfran

294
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,800
In 1983

295
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,380
Three subgeniuses were arrested

296
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,580
For covertly attempting to poison

297
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,180
The Philadelphia water supply

298
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,680
With a 50 gallon dose

299
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,960
Of this potent hallucinogen

300
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,760
The children are sent to the

301
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:56,900
Military hospital

302
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,480
Where charges were dropped

303
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,780
And the information suppressed

304
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,660
By order of the department of defense

305
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,740
Because it seems that this

306
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,640
Gabrogfran drug

307
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,600
Was developed by the military

308
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,100
As a weapon under orders of

309
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,520
CIA head George Bush

310
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,140
During the Carter administration

311
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,740
How many innocents must die

312
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,740
So that the sick sex games

313
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,400
Of the pervert subgeniuses can continue

314
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,180
How long must we wait

315
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,680
Before the police and the military

316
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,480
Take matters into their own hands?

317
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,000
And stop this madness

318
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,600
What can you do to save your family

319
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,740
And your country from this deadly menace?

320
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,920
There's a lot you can do

321
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,200
Avoid contact with known subgeniuses

322
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,180
If there is a known subgenius district

323
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,980
In your area, avoid it

324
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
Do not go there

325
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,080
Avoid the trendy or fashionable part of town

326
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,680
Whenever possible

327
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,860
This is often where subgeniuses are to be found

328
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,340
If you live in a rural area

329
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:56,760
Or subgenius district

330
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:56,760


331
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:56,760


332
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,960
In a small town that has preserved

333
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,580
Traditional American values

334
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,020
Stay there

335
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,720
Watch your family for signs of disobedience

336
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,880
Or strange behavior

337
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,080
Stay away from the television

338
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,360
It has become infested with subliminal messages

339
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,640
That lure you and your loved ones

340
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,700
Into the cult

341
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,700
Do not go to airports alone

342
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,500
If you must go however

343
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,320
Be sure not to drink anything

344
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,960
Bring bottled water

345
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,640
Many airport water supplies

346
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,740
Are tainted by the Gabrogfran drug

347
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,040
Teams of subgeniuses

348
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,420
Work at every airport in America

349
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,100
Waiting for the drug to take effect

350
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,160
And loading their helpless victims

351
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,260
Into waiting planes

352
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,260
While airport officials and the FAA do nothing

353
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,180
Make your children stay at home after school

354
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,640
If they try to sneak out

355
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,680
Beat them severely

356
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,120
This is very important

357
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,320
As this blood cult of evil targets

358
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,280
Places where teens congregate

359
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,920
Shopping malls are among the best recruiting grounds

360
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,240
For young people to be lured into Dobbs evil web

361
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,740
If you would like to be a part

362
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,340
Of the

363
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:20,140
The path is the mask of love

364
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,220
A way, a way

365
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,740
The flow is the task of love

366
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:26,740


367
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,540
Above today

368
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,080
There is no other way

369
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,900
You gotta trust us

370
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,540
When you need a friend

371
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,400
To find us

372
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,800
You gotta look within

373
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,000
You gotta trust us

374
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,740
You gotta trust us

375
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,900
Before you turn to dust

376
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,740
Before you turn to dust

377
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:56,740


378
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:56,740


379
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,140
You gotta see it before you see

380
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,940
You gotta see it before you see

381
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,700
You gotta see it before you see

382
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,120
You gotta see it before you see

383
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,140
You gotta see it before you see

384
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,900
You gotta hear

385
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,260
Without fear

386
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,900
You gotta feel

387
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,860
To reveal

388
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,780
You gotta touch

389
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,680
Without doubt

390
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:35,680


391
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,140
Such is ill and I hate it, hey

392
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,000
Such is ill and I hate it, hey

393
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:32,280
Well, for you, of you, with you, more of you, just of you

405
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,080
problem for the future youth force. They just get on their communicators and call the police,

406
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,880
and a heavily armed super-trained SWAT team will be called in. They will easily drive the

407
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:26,420
Christians out with tear gas, stun grenades, and their M-16s and shotguns. If the Christians do

408
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,880
not come out from the tear gas, they will come in after them. Ten-gauge shotguns and explosively

409
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,040
charged battering rams can knock down any door. Plastic explosives can smash giant holes in any

410
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:43,140
walls. But what happens when a few Christians are heavily armed with, and this is a core-ish part,

411
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,700
bulletproof vests, tear gas masks, automatic weapons, and high-powered rifles? No problem.

412
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,440
You just use the Philadelphia Plan. Invented by Mayor Wilson Good, you drop an incendiary bomb

413
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,800
by helicopter and blow the house apart in flames. And if the Christians don't run out,

414
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,460
they burn to death. And if they do run out shooting, they will be blown away by police

415
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:11,200
snipers. If they run out of flame, they will either be allowed to burn to death or splashed

416
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:18,000
with fire extinguishers and led off to prisons, tossed into the death chambers. No doubt they will

417
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,380
be stripped naked and kept in handcuffs so they cannot resist what is to come later on. They will

418
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,860
probably be fed nothing nor given any fresh water. And they will be thrown into the fire.

419
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,940
They will have to lay in their own feces and urine. Possibly stale bread will be thrown onto the floor

420
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:44,260
and possibly water will be sprayed in with hoses so that they are forced to lap it up as dogs

421
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:52,700
amidst the urine, waste and blood from injuries and mnestration, as it says here. But who will be

422
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:58,680
the future prison guards? Why, the most sadistic, sick, and savage ex-prisoners become the new prison

423
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,620
guards. Of course, the subgeniuses.

424
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,220
The most brutal rapists, murderers, and perverts will be assigned to take care of the Christians.

425
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:13,800
No doubt Christians will be selected for daily beatings and tortures. Select girls, boys, and

426
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:21,680
women will be chosen for sexual rapes. In front of all, pregnant women will no doubt be booted

427
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:27,720
several times in the stomachs to prevent the birth of another Christian.

428

This is the end of the video. If you liked it, please subscribe, like, and leave a comment. Thank you. See you next time. Bye.

429
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:40,480
This is all, once again, my friends, from a Christian book called The Answer to Raptures, available at any good American supermarket.

430
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:49,680
And, let's see, oh, the Christians will be led to their deaths in giant sports stadiums and complexes of the world,

431
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:56,220
such as the Los Angeles Coliseum, the Houston Astronome, all naked and handcuffed, beaten and abused,

432
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,280
and before the Luciferic juries and the field stadiums.

433
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:06,280
Christians will be given their last chance to worship Satan as God, or be put to death.

434
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:13,700
And the method of death will be decapitation, beheading. We are told in Revelation chapter 20, why beheading?

435
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,560
Because it is the bloodiest and most terrifying and most systematic death, death ever to face.

436
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:28,480
When the carteroid arteries in your neck are severed, the blood literally spurts out everywhere.

437
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,260
And sometimes...

438
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:40,200
Sometimes your head is alive for up to 10 to 15 seconds looking about at a stadium, a satanic stadium, cheering madly, and then you are gone.

439
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,560
This terrifying form of death is purposely designed to terrify the Christian.

440
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,240
And no doubt, as they are led to slaughter in these giant sports stadiums and complexes,

441
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,120
the rock bands will be blaring away some satanic tune.

442
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,740
Possibly the old Rolling Stones classic, Sympathy for the Devil,

443
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,480
Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love,

444
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,780
the ELP classic, Jerusalem,

445
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,740
Atlantis by Donovan,

446
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,740
or possibly even Pat Benatar's We Are Invincible.

447
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:20,400
Maybe they will even slice or chop the heads off of Christians in synchronicity to the beat of the rock bands.

448
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:28,720
Ho ho ho ho, oh dear friends, it's a scary, scary world a-comin', according to...

449
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:36,480
uh, these fine, fine preachers, and according to this fine background music by, uh, Saint Tommy Lopez.

450
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,300
Oh, what have we here? What other things have we? There's...

451
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,200
all, not all that many tapes, but...

452
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,020
but there is...

453
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:53,560
Oh, oh, I should mention that, um, that grinning evil death rant that I was doing earlier,

454
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,180
uh, about the evil of killer Bob Dobbs and so forth.

455
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:58,700
That, that...

456
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,040
Dr. Legume actually created that from an AIDS pamphlet that he found.

457
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:11,220
You know, most of the stuff we do is based on real, uh, non-Dobbs-ful things.

458
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,980
And, and here's Dr. Legume's letter that came with that rant.

459
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,540
Here's my latest still warm from the devil's hip pocket pamphlet.

460
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:27,400
I'm gonna pass out a buttload of them to foolish toady Christians this Saturday at the Peter Popoff Miracle Crusade.

461
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,540
You'll notice I included the sacred P.O. box, so the stink trail will lead back to you.

462
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,760
Joy, joy.

463
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,640
Says...

464
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,300
evil...

465
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,900
Dr. Legume.

466
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,380
And, well, meh, I don't know what, we've got lots of lovely, sarcastic music here to play,

467
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:48,480
and letters from the followers, and some news about the pilgrimage,

468
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,440
the subgenius universal pilgrimage coming up.

469
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,460
Oh, yes.

470
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,820
Ahem.

471
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,620
And, uh...

472
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,240
Uh...

473
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,720
What do you say to this?

474
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,840
Oh, my friend, how far have you progressed from the Stone Age?

475
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,180
How far have we advanced from the ooze and the slime?

476
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,620
Are the present doctors really miracle men of medicine?

477
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,280
What have they cured?

478
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,940
What have they controlled?

479
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,140
In the next few minutes, you will be shown a special example.

480
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,980
My friend, this is not the 10th century, but the 20th century.

481
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:31,300
I firmly suggest that if you are squeamish, please keep your eyes closed,

482
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,660
or better yet, leave the room.

483
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,440
I do not advise that children hear this.

484
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,620
But for you of the strong stomach and the open of mind,

485
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,340
I predict that there is one enemy we have not conquered,

486
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,440
and in our lifetime we never will conquer,

487
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,700
and that is leprosy.

488
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,580
Leprosy.

489
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,660
Leprosy, yes, leprosy.

490
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,980
The curse of the ancients.

491
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,900
The blemish of the present and the scar on the festering face of the future.

492
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,380
Leprosy inhabits the bodies of the damned.

493
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,080
Leprosy is highly contagious.

494
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,080
The Chinese know that even a look from a leper can bring you down

495
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,880
with this dreaded disease.

496
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,580
Leprosy is called the walking death.

497
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,200
Leprosy, the indwelling devil.

498
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,860
Leprosy, the result of yesterday's sin, tomorrow.

499
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,980
Oh, my friend,

500
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:29,160
we talk about this just for you to show you the karma of the 20th century.

501
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,060
These poor unfortunate souls exist under the same sun,

502
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,260
the same moon, and the same stars as you and I.

503
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,140
But we are so much more fortunate.

504
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,000
This spreads to the face, leaving it puckered and thickened.

505
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,140
The eyesight dims and is soon gone.

506
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,660
The voice goes to a heavy whisper and then stops.

507
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,380
The nerve vanishes.

508
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,200
The bones of the fingers,

509
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,400
rot,

510
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,680
decay,

511
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,600
also the toes and drop away.

512
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,520
And then you stumble into the pits of death.

513
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,500
Close the quote.

514
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,220
So says the good Dr. Joseph Mealy Hopkins.

515
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:08,820
Now...

516
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,140
Oh, thank you, Doc.

517
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,880
I can't break this.

518
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,740
Break this.

519
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,000
What we need is someone to take this church off our hands is what we need.

520
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,740
Okay, what's your church and what's your name?

521
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,080
First Church of the Good Discount, House of Faith.

522
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,320
Hey, that's my church.

523
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,040
That's your church?

524
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:24,880
Hello?

525
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,600
This is a true story.

526
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,900
You're giving the church away?

527
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,120
No, we're actually...

528
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,080
You're man enough to take it.

529
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,120
Oh, well, what if you give it away?

530
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,260
What are you people gonna do?

531
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,620
Well, we're gonna do something fun.

532
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,440
Oh, yeah?

533
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,980
Yeah, we're gonna quit working for God.

534
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,840
We're gonna go to Green Hill and get glanscating.

535
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,260
That's right.

536
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,820
It's part of the plan.

537
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,280
They'll come up and there will be the sickening and the healing.

538
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,720
What happened to all the doctors?

539
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,260
What happened to the exploding golf ball?

540
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,560
Yes, who are the doctors?

541
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,440
Who are the doctors?

542
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,580
The ones that caught fire on the table.

543
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,400
This is Reverend Terrence Austin Tritt.

544
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,600
Well, listen, the phones are ringing off the wall and we'd like to help you out, but honestly,

545
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,800
we're just gonna have to turn your tape off because...

546
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:06,580
President Nixon is on line three, Doctor Puzzling Evidence, and please pick up line three.

547
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,000
Okay.

548
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,380
Well, thank you.

549
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,320
Hello, this is Dan White.

550
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,880
Can I come to your convention and get my head launched?

551
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,320
Yes, sir.

552
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,520
Oh, it's just a funny show.

553
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,460
Yes, it's a funny show.

554
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,880
Hello, tiny little caller.

555
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,320
Hello.

556
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,380
Wow, I don't believe it.

557
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,100
This is actually a live show.

558
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,260
No, it's just a tape.

559
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:27,500
It is a live show.

560
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,300
I thought it's all taped.

561
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,020
Oh, my God.

562
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,580
The tape's set at the wrong speed.

563
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,680
Thank you.

564
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,340
Here you come, the crazy.

565
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,240
What do you mean you called in without finding out what you were calling?

566
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,720
Oh, I knew it was the Church of the Subgenius because I'm a member, but...

567
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,420
You were a member?

568
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,100
You were a member.

569
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:48,420


570
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,300
I wasn't...

571
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,440
Oh, you've changed the name.

572
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,440


573
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,440


574
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,440


575
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,440


576
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,440


577
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,900
Oh, right.

578
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,460
Okay, go ahead.

579
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,860
Yes, well, it's a new church and it's a whole new story and...

580
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,300
You're not the white-haired guy that's on all the time.

581
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,700
And before that, it gets weird because then there comes the age of giant underwater scorpions

582
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,720
and wiggly, oogly things wiggling through the primeval muck.

583
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,700
Boy, we pass them on with the show.

584
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,520
Because we don't get up on that chart without enough of them.

585
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,760
In fact, any subgenius can chew up any denomination money and pass what he wants onto the show.

586
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,720
And they often do.

587
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,340
Yes, they do.

588
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,780
In places you've never imagined.

589
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,860
And with things that you can't believe.

590
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:16,380
But it's scary.

591
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,800
Well, we know where we usually pass things from, don't we?

592
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,600
Yes, we do.

593
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,360
Yes, from Bob and...

594
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:20,420
Yes, we do.

595
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:20,620
This is the church.

596
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:20,620


597
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:20,620


598
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,040
I want to go explain something.

599
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,080
I tuned in my radio a few minutes ago and I...

600
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,560
And sign here.

601
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,800
...tuned in to KPSA and there you go.

602
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,620
Sign here, please.

603
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:27,920
We're signing papers.

604
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,040
Okay, here I go.

605
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,900
Well, do you want the church?

606
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,600
And sign over here, please.

607
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,320
Okay, that's right.

608
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,180
We have to sign things.

609
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,620
Sign.

610
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,900
We've got somebody that's signed.

611
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,720
Yeah, okay.

612
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,820
We've got somebody here that takes at least two rooms...

613
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,760
Keep the pen in his hand.

614
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,540
...I'll keep the...

615
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,360
I'll be all right.

616
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,680
I exist because the world's in my...

617
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,140
In my telephone, yeah.

618
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,540
Well, actually, the church only exists because we have the paperwork on it right here and

619
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,620
the health works, therefore I am.

620
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,720
Well, I think I'm going to go out and stoke up the old wood fire.

621
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,340
I'll be back in just a few minutes with some tips on your future...

622
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,120
Yeah, let's be putting on some bogus live stuff and go out on the roof, boy.

623
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,640
Yeah, that's what I'm saying, huh?

624
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,280
Kilns fired in edible 24-calorie silver.

625
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,440
Never before in human history...

626
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,260
Mm-mm, wish I was there now.

627
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,880
Never, never before in human history has the Pope, McKinley, Harding, Coolidge,

628
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,020
Dobbs, Mint, not a U.S. government body, commissioned such a rarity.

629
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,420
Delicious and crackling with a cooked scallop.

630
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,000
A chicken of prepared edible material.

631
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,520
I think about it.

632
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,420
I think about it.

633
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,020
I think I'll have one right now.

634
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,460
Well, I'll bet you have.

635
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,040
And they grow into the same kind of animal as I do.

636
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,860
He says he knows you, Doctor.

637
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,260
Well, let's tune in on the monitor over here and see exactly who that is that's calling.

638
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,580
Can you see me?

639
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,760
Yes, yes, we see you and it's disgusting.

640
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,080
And I'm bringing the mirror close to my nose.

641
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,080
Oh, it's that doctor.

642
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,260
Do you know who you're listening to?

643
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:44,780
Yes.

644
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,280
Which is the new voice?

645
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,780
The new voice is the last voice that I heard.

646
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,540
Have human babies.

647
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,420
That doesn't sound right.

648
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:50,920
It does make sense.

649
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,080
There's the new voice again.

650
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,740
Must be one of those sub-dini hierarchical figures.

651
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,540
He knows all the passwords and the secret jokes, so let's send him a new cartoon by

652
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,360
Stang and Stanislaw.

653
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:02,660
Which one?

654
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,420
Which one?

655
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,440
It's either, I think it's, I'm going to take a wild guess.

656
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,220
It's Pope Meyer.

657
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,940
That's pretty wild.

658
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,680
That's pretty wild.

659
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,420
That's pretty wild.

660
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,080
That's too wild.

661
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,420
South, south, go south.

662
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,460
Go south, go south.

663
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,740
It's Terry Thornley.

664
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,200
No, not, farther south.

665
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,060
Farther south.

666
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,880
Farther south and out of the country.

667
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,640
Oh.

668
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:19,960
Oh, that's a good one.

669
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,340
Oh, it's Robert Desco?

670
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,040
Yes.

671
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,660
For the info.

672
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,780
You know, the same people.

673
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,540
Go to the London Grill.

674
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,260
We'll be doing our show from there if you know.

675
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:28,640
You will?

676
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,020
Yeah, we're going to have to do it.

677
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,300
Yeah.

678
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,080
It's going to be on Friday night.

679
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,240
Your show's going to be from there?

680
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,240
Yeah, it's going to be from the London Grill in Santa Cruz on Friday night.

681
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,160
It's going to be a remote.

682
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,380
And you'll really like it.

683
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,120
This is my show.

684
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,620
If I go all the way down there and you guys aren't there, I'll laugh just as much as

685
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:43,720
you did.

686
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,020
I guarantee, I guarantee you find the London Grill in Santa Cruz.

687
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,300
We will be broadcasting from there on Friday night.

688
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,940
Then don't you do anything but watch the show.

689
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:49,960
I guarantee you find the show.

690
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,940
In fact, you would bow your head and kiss your panty that you even know about it.

691
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,640
You've got that little white stuff you put on your nose so it doesn't chip here.

692
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,400
Are you people pro-capital punishment?

693
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,360
What's the white stuff you put in your nose?

694
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,880
I want the white stuff you put on your nose.

695
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,340
We are capital punishment, dear friends.

696
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:16,100
And yeah, there was a nice little classic old stretch of very old show, the old KPFA

697
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,820
show.

698
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:22,440
from the subgeniuses of Berkeley.

699
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,440
And that was a pact when it was G. Gordon Gordon

700
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,100
and Glass Madness guesting

701
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,560
with the great Gary Gbrok friend, Puzzling Evidence,

702
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,840
and Dr. Howell.

703
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,920
That show's been howling away for many a year now.

704
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,480
It's gone through a lot of changes,

705
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:44,680
and there's infinite amounts of old, old tape

706
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,660
of old, old, old men we can always whip out on you.

707
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,240
Hey.

708
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,380
Hey, there.

709
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,760
So you come out, and you draw, and you say,

710
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,240
bam, bam, stop, and a guy doesn't stop.

711
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,240
Then you move up to the head, and you put one right there,

712
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,080
and that's usually final.

713
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,620
Get that spear away from me.

714
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,040
Get it away.

715
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,200
It exploded.

716
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,660
It hit people that had not known.

717
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,600
It's been hit in months.

718
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,300
Some began to dance in the spirit.

719
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,900
Others threw up their hands in exclamations of praise.

720
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,520
Others began to dance up and down the aisles.

721
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:30,000
Others fell like they'd been hit by a proverbial chainsaw.

722
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,360
I was in pain.

723
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,300
Others tuned in to the subgenius radio ministry

724
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,680
hour of slack.

725
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,580
And, uh...

726
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,440
What's going on now?

727
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,660
Well, I want...

728
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,400
I found some cool songs.

729
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,960
Now, last week, we were doing our opinionated thang,

730
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,880
really, really hating,

731
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,040
hating the conservative fundamentalist-type people.

732
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,520
And, of course, you know J.R. Bob Dobbs

733
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,440
with our doctrine of patriotic, psychotic, and narco-materialism.

734
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:11,420
We insist on equal hate for pretty much both sides.

735
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,300
Yes.

736
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,660
And so, in the interest of...

737
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,300
In the interest of equal time,

738
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:20,140
we're going to let the disgusting liberals be trashed as well.

739
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,980
This particular cut is off of a new one we found right here at the station

740
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:29,200
by our good friend, Reverend Mojo Nixon,

741
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,980
and his good friend, Reverend Jello Biafra,

742
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,700
with this song, which is...

743
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,700
Let's hope we have it queued up just right here,

744
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,240
called, Love Me, I'm a Liberal.

745
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,620
I cried when they shot John Lennon

746
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,000
Tears ran down my spine

747
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,460
And I cried when I saw JFK

748
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,100
As though I'd lost a father of mine

749
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,600
But Malcolm X and Ice-T had it coming

750
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,660
They got what they wanted to get me for

751
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:14,660


752
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,180
They asked for this time

753
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:20,020
So love me, love me, love me

754
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,500
I'm a liberal

755
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,400
I go to pro-choice rallies

756
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,940
Recycle my cans and jars

757
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,300
I'll honk if you love the dead

758
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,780
Hope those funny crunched-ass dumb stars

759
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,100
But don't talk about revolution

760
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,900
That's going a little bit too far

761
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,760
So love me, love me, love me

762
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,240
I'm a liberal

763
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,960
I'm a liberal

764
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,200
I'm a liberal

765
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,620
I'm a liberal

766
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,200
I'm a liberal

767
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,580
I'm a liberal

768
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:09,220
I cheered when Clinton was chosen

769
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,480
My faith in us was only born

770
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,160
I'll do anything

771
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,060
To save our schools

772
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,440
If my taxes ain't too much more

773
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,800
And I love blacks and jays and Latinos

774
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,280
As long as they don't restore

775
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,440
So love me, love me, love me

776
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,880
I'm a liberal

777
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,580
Rush Limbaugh and the LAPD

778
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,920
Should all hang their heads in shame

779
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,700
I can't understand where they're at

780
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,900
Arsenio should set them straight

781
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,860
But if Neighborhood Watch doesn't know you

782
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,900
I hope the cops take down your name

783
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,820
So love me, love me, love me

784
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,280
I'm a liberal

785
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,220
I'm a liberal

786
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,240
I'm a liberal

787
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,900
I'm a liberal

788
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,920
I'm a liberal

789
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,850
I'm the whitest person that ever did the funky chicken

790
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:25,610
I read The New Republic

791
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,130
Rolling Stone and Mother Jones, too

792
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,150
If I vote it's a Democrat

793
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,910
With a sensible inside view

794
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,570
But when it comes to terrorist tariffs

795
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,910
There's no one more red, white, and blue

796
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,770
So love me, love me, love me

797
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,470
I'm a big road

798
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,970
Once I was young and had an attitude

799
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:00,330
Stickers covered the car I drove in

800
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:03,890
Even went on some direct actions

801
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,230
When there weren't rental cops to be seen

802
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:10,730
But now it's grown older, wiser

803
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,250
And that's why I'm turning you in

804
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:18,030
So love me, love me, love me

805
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:21,670
Love me, love me, love me

806
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,970
Love me, love me, love me

807
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,330
I'm a liberal

808
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,370
Liberal

809
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,350
I'm a liberal

810
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,710
Liberal

811
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,050
Liberal

812
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:36,490
Liberal

813
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:39,610
acre

00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,210
fon

815
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:40,210


816
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:48,730
I am a liberal

817
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:48,730

823
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:51,550
re

824
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,650
I am politically correct

825
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,710
Hypocritical, you bet

826
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,930
I am pro-gay

827
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,510
But I wouldn't want my own kids to turn out that way

828
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,250
I am pro-abortion

829
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,890
And for gun control

830
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,310
I'm for balancing the budget

831
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:27,410
And for financing overseas wars

832
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,330
I am pro-small business

833
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,250
And for capital punishment

834
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,390
And I think we're more controlled

835
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,010
By the federal government

836
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,930
Now I'm for plenty of changes

837
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,190
Even though I don't know what they are

838
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:04,050
I'm for helping out Detroit

839
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,070
But I drive a foreign car

840
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:07,910
I do believe in God

841
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,070
But I promote humanism

842
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,690
I don't believe in war

843
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,830
But I'm for wiping out communism

844
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,570
Now I believe everything

845
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,630
That I hear on the news

846
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,490
And I can't figure out

847
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,770
Why the Arabs hate the Jews

848
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,010
I am an American

849
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,510
American hypocrite

850
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:49,490
Hey I'm a Jew

851
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:50,610
And I'm really proud of that

852
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:52,110
It don't bother me a bit

853
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:54,710
I can't believe the US government

854
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,030
Would ever lie to me

855
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,370
I'm an American hypocrite

856
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,030
Can't you see?

857
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,210
An American hypocrite

858
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:05,070
Can't you see?

859
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,570
Now my TV sets on

860
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:10,890
Day and night

861
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,750
Turn into shows on violent crime

862
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:17,230
And I can't understand

863
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:19,230
Why my kids got a gun

864
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,610
And I'm drugged most of the time

865
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,630
I'm an American

866
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,510
An American hypocrite

867
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:27,850
And I'm really proud of that

868
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,470
It don't bother me

869
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,930
Not one bit

870
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,370
I'm an American

871
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:37,010
An American hypocrite

872
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:37,210
I'm an American

873
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,490
Oh yes dear friends

874
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,610
John Bartels the amazing

875
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:44,130
John Bartels there

876
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:45,910
And before that

877
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:46,930
Jello Biafra

878
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,310
And Mojo Nixon and

879
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:53,490
I should give some addresses now I think friends

880
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,530
I need you to get your pencils ready

881
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:58,550
One of them is a correction from a couple of weeks ago

882
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:02,670
We've been playing a lot of material by Rudy Schwartz Project

883
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:05,890
Also known as Joe Newman

884
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:11,410
And I gave his address over the air a couple of shows back

885
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:13,190
And apparently I did it wrong

886
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,490
I left a number out of his street address

887
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:19,490
So any of you who wrote for him

888
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,370
Information on Joe Newman's tapes

889
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:27,250
Here is the correct address for Rudy Schwartz Project

890
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,210
And a Joe Newman

891
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:34,250
That's Joe Newman

892
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:41,350
At the post office box 4542

893
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:47,350
Box 4542 in Austin, Texas

894
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:51,490
78765

895
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:55,470
And while we're at it

896
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:58,710
I guess we ought to be giving our own post office box number

897
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:00,770
Yes the post office box number of

898
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,350
The Church of the Subgenius

899
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:03,910
That church who's

900
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:08,090
One of whose radio shows you are listening to right now

901
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,810
For better or for worse

902
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:11,290
So get that pencil ready

903
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:14,350
And be ready to just send for free information from

904
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:15,310
Bob

905
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:17,650
That's right

906
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:18,550
Bob

907
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:23,270
Or our slack or subgenius foundation

908
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:24,350
At

909
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,270
Here it is

910
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,010
The post office box

911
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:30,250

912
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:32,270
06

913
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:34,450
That's box 1403 06

914
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,870
Dallas, Texas

915
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:38,970

We'd love to hear from you

917
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:44,530
And send you catalogs about all the tapes books and what not

918
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:44,530


919
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:53,170
and death, horror, and fun, free pills, drugs, and evilness, music.

920
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:59,510
And let's listen to yet one other old subgenius show.

921
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:03,990
Well, actually, this would be a new subgenius show coming up in just a couple of minutes.

922
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:10,090
Reverend Susie the Floozy's show, which is broadcast, originates, shall we say,

923
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:13,330
at WREK in Atlanta, Georgia.

924
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:18,790
Stay tuned for Reverend Susie the Floozy, who's unfortunately had to get,

925
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,330
well, you'll hear the sad, sad tale.

965
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:04,030
time fun house number 13 lucky 13.

966
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:11,390
oh i'm your slack sister and polymorphously perverse prayer partner reverend susie the floozy but

967
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:20,630
oh i feel the need to make confession unto you dear friends i am stinky with sin oh purge me

968
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:28,090
oh pop this red aching boil of guilt and regret that feels like it's got its roots in my brain

969
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:29,970
oh either

970
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:33,990
reverend went out last week and

971
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,330
got a job

972
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:45,110
oh here i am in the belly of the feast and those digestive fluids are serving to eat away all that

973
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:51,930
tarnish and crud that's been building up on my survival skills i had become a little complacent

974
00:50:52,690 --> 00:51:00,070
the sad fact is i needed the money the big problem was in the past few years i've been used to having free wills

975
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:00,070


976
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:00,070


977
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:00,070


978
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:00,070


979
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:05,830
Oh, that's a concept. They don't take much trucking in the corporate life.

980
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:08,110
Any kind of will.

981
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,570
Oh, sapped will. Oh, they love that.

982
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:18,070
Oh, but free will, or even will-a-dogs, who did an excellent show tonight.

983
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:20,470
Oh, they couldn't take that.

984
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:27,530
So, dear friends, by the virtue of my ministry,

985
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:33,370
and the auspices here at WREK Atlanta,

986
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:37,490
I need to make confession.

987
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:41,870
Oh, yeah, I got a job.

988
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:45,570
And even though it's not exactly a felch-level position,

989
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:50,950
I just feel so filthy.

990
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:54,810
Oh, I'm just passing a normal everyday life,

991
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,790
so you can imagine the amount of passing.

992
00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:00,410
That's the last thing I've got to do to fit into a neo-corporate anti-existence.

993
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,010
Oh, there's one way to do it,

994
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,710
and it's like treating the whole thing as if I'm on a mission.

995
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:09,730
A mission to bring you the slack that you so desperately need.

996
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:14,110
And if that involves getting down on my knees in the muddy stinking trenches

997
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:16,410
to find out what the lack of slack is like,

998
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:17,430
so be it!

999
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,610
This is war!

1000
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:23,810
I'm wallowing in the tar pits alongside my Yeti sisters and brothers.

1001
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:26,130
I'm suffering, sweating, bleeding,

1002
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,590
and bleeding in the workplace with you.

1003
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:32,470
But here's a little workers' compensation coming your way right now.

1004
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:39,830
I want you to feel that slack flowing out of the speakers and into your cerebral cortex,

1005
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:46,370
massaging you with healing, stinging waves of Bob-given slack.

1006
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:51,230
It's coating you like Bactine with aloe vera gel.

1007
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:54,470
Dear friend, if you're so genius,

1008
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,470
you know what it is to be a spy.

1009
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:59,970
You know what it is to have your life on the line

1010
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:04,170
every time you say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing

1011
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:07,070
and get found out that you're not one of them.

1012
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,310
So come on.

1013
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,110
Let's slide into our trench coats,

1014
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:19,050
pull our slouch hats down low over our ray-bands,

1015
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:22,410
and slip into spy versus spy mode.

1016
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,890
Let's go to it.

1017
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,970
And if you're caught or captured,

1018
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:33,570
this secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.

1019
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:58,270
It's enough.

1020
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:17,230
First of all, don't rush.

1021
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:17,230


1022
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:17,250
And here it goes.

1023
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:17,250


1024
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:17,250


1025
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:17,250


1026
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:17,250


1027
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:17,410
They want you in the protection for a good time.

1028
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:17,410


1029
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:17,490
Good work.

1030
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:17,670
Yeah.

1031
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:22,650
Bye.

1032
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:37,630
We're so glad you can all be here

1033
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:42,950
And when life gets cold, oh so hard

1034
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,210
You make it all the while

1035
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:48,170
Scream yourself a laugh

1036
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:50,870
And then a wild hit like a smile

1037
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:54,650
This is getting heated too

1038
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,690
Our friends across the world

1039
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:00,510
You're the best, most loyalist

1040
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,670
And that's for sure

1041
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:06,030
When life gets cold, so push me

1042
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:08,730
You make it all the while

1043
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:12,210
Gonna have some fun tonight

1044
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,190
Feel free to be alive

1045
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,430
Scream yourself a laugh

1046
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,750
And then a wild hit like a smile

1047
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:20,850
Scream yourself a laugh

1048
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:21,610
It's gonna be happy

1049
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:24,770
You're the only ones who understand

1050
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,610

That's what it is about this year

1055
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:48,470
All is very well, CJ is here

1056
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:53,750
And I can see the spells fall apart

1057
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,630
Please give me today

1058
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:58,850
It's the year I know you're gonna be

1059
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:01,590
You're gonna find yourself a baby

1060
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:02,870
It's gonna be okay

1061
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:05,870
It's gonna be alright

1062
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:08,730

It's gonna be happy

1080
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:04,990


1081
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:07,710

It's gonna be alright

1088
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,390
It's gonna be alright

1089
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:40,250
I asked you a pro capital punishment or amateur capital punishment.

1090
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,250
We're amateur capital punishment or kill me.

1091
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:46,410
Do you think capitals ought to be punished, Dr. Cabrog for him?

1092
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,430
Not so much, but I guess it's a start.

1093
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,710
Well, you can always get your parents to call in.

1094
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:53,990
Miniature puterine reproductions authenticated by the world court at The Hague

1095
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:56,150
and sent to you in moisture-resistant styrofoam chests

1096
00:57:56,150 --> 00:58:00,250
of the front door letter slots of the subgenius 36 most beloved characters.

1097
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:03,950
Don't blow into the microphone, young man, if you wish to receive a beautiful Hummel figurine

1098
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:08,630
which revolves on its ceramic base and plays the immortal Lara theme from Dr. Zhivago.

1099
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:11,730
Yes, a special blue rivet advisory panel will ensure that the Foundation's Council

1100
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:15,230
is certificated and inscribed insignia as approved by Dobbs, Master of Heralds,

1101
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:16,170
before the application deadline.

1102
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:16,970
No way.

1103
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:17,690
What is your point to me?

1104
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:18,190
Is it a potential?

1105
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:20,550
Well, we are the potential guests.

1106
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:21,070
So wait a minute.

1107
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:22,930
What we've got to do is concentrate on those potential guests,

1108
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:24,470
and you can stay with us for right now.

1109
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:27,710
Now, Doctor, I think we should return to the basic finances of the church

1110
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:30,330
and just who owns the church and what we can do with what's left of the church.

1111
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:30,650
Right.

1112
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:32,850
Well, Ivan Stang no longer owns the church.

1113
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:35,210
Bob still has the Foundation, but we've got papers on that.

1114
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:36,050
All right.

1115
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:36,650
Hold on here.

1116
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:36,950
Hold on.

1117
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:37,310
Wait a minute.

1118
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:40,610
What we also can talk about, of course, is what we can do with the church

1119
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:42,670
now that what's left is still here and breathing.

1120
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:46,250
Well, we can give it away, or we can just let someone take the church for a spin.

1121
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,310
See, what I think is that people don't realize that the church...

1122
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:51,330
The church takes two rooms to keep and grow in your house.

1123
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:51,990
At least two.

1124
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:54,390
And the maintenance involved takes up most of the week anyway.

1125
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:56,230
And it does not run on unleaded.

1126
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:56,670
I'm sorry.

1127
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:57,750
So...

1128
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:58,870
You've made a big noise about wanting to know the truth.

1129
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:00,070
I'm calling in and saying you want the church.

1130
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:02,150
If you don't have at least two good-sized rooms in your house...

1131
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:04,590
Yes, at least two good-sized rooms and a lot of money.

1132
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:05,250
And a lot of...

1133
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,150
And neighbors that don't mind Wotan showing up in the middle of the night.

1134
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,910
Right, and you need stamps and gummage.

1135
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:11,270
Get the idea?

1136
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:13,650
Or kill me!

1137
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:15,490
Or kill me!

1138
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:16,610
Now!

1139
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:18,290
And, uh...

1140
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:18,810
The guy...

1141
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:23,470
It got to the point where the guy he was bothering pulled out a .32 and let him have it.

1142
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:30,970
And at which point, the bullet hit him square in the chest and went through his lung and came out his back.

1143
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:36,410
But instead of falling on the ground, he walked back in the bar and ordered a drink.

1144
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:37,710
Get the idea?

1145
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:38,910
Or kill me!

1146
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:40,130
Now!

1147
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:41,110
Now!

1148
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:43,790
Let's have a body count!

1149
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:46,310
Let's have a body count!

1150
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:48,210
No!

1151
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:48,610
None dead!

1152
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:49,370
It's a miracle!

1153
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,590
Friends, it's a miracle!

1154
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:50,910
Bob!

1155
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:52,070
Praise Bob!

1156
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:53,410
Praise Bob!

1157
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:54,770
Praise Bob!

1158
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:56,130
Praise Bob!

1159
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:05,530
Stamps and gummage.

1160
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:07,130
Yes, lots of stamps and gummage.

1161
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:07,930
Would you sign here, please?

1162
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:09,090
Okay, sign here.

1163
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:10,610
I don't have any stamps and gummage.

1164
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:10,950
Wait a minute.

1165
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:11,250
Wait, wait.

1166
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:11,610
Ah!

1167
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:14,430
Thank you very much.

1168
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:16,350
The world is over now.

1169
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:18,070
You can return to your bed.

1170
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:18,630
Wow!

1171
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:19,610
We're trying.

1172
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:20,350
We're trying.

1173
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,390
Well, we're not trying hard enough.

1174
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:23,290
Well, it's certainly very trying.

1175
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:24,090
Send us more money.

1176
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,310
Yeah, more money.

1177
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,630
More money?

1178
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:26,310
How much would you like?

1179
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:28,890
Uh, uh, fifty thousand, would you say that would do it?

1180
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:29,910
Uh, checks in the mail.

1181
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,030
All right, thank you.

1182
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:31,710
You're welcome.

1183
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:32,750
You can expect your...

1184
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:32,810
Next caller, please.

1185
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:34,990
We'll put on the automatic Bob Nelson.

1186
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:36,790
We'll put the automatic Bob Nelson on.

1187
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:37,130
Here, turn myself off.

1188
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:37,690
Yes, okay.

1189
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:38,890
Where's my thesaurus?

1190
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:41,110
Ricky, Lucy, Phil...

1191
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:41,810
Here, Bob, here's your hat.

1192
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:42,750
Put this part on.

1193
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:44,830
Here, here we go.

1194
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:45,030
Here.

1195
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:46,710
Now, give, give it up.

1196
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,370
Drive this station down Shattuck Avenue.
