1
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,180
The Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:32,180
The Hour of Slack!

3
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,280
The Hour of Slack!

4
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:35,480
The Hour of Slack!

5
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:23,140
The Hour of Slack!

6
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:53,140
The Hour of Slack!

7
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:59,980
The Hour of Slack!

8
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,540
The Hour of Slack!

9
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:52,980
The Hour of Slack!

10
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,960
The Hour of Slack!

11
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,080
The Hour of Slack!

12
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,300
The Hour of Slack!

13
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,060
Nuclear means a device which you can wear in your shoe and light with a lighter like a Zippo or something.

14
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:37,380
But nuclear is a whole array of like, you know, Moabs and Scrohabs and Ahabs and so forth.

15
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,580
Those evil tribes.

16
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,060
No, the Moab is...

17
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,860
Over 93,000 miles.

18
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,640
No, the Moab is the monstrous, oversexed, anal bristometer.

19
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,720
The Moadib.

20
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,420
No, the Moab means massive aerial ordnance or massive ordnance aerial bombardment,

21
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,800
meaning to blow up the whole country of Iraq with a shockwave,

22
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,680
one of America's brand new weapons of destruction.

23
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,960
I was wondering about...

24
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,580
Guaranteed for liberty.

25
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:11,060
The brand new ones, you know, because there's supposed to be some fancy new noisemakers and big earth rattlers.

26
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,140
Step back from the Centurion.

27
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,260
You will all die under the power of the fist of the fossil.

28
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,340
Say hi, baby.

29
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,700
Now, the problem...

30
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,520
The propaganda that goes back and forth is marvelous because I was reading just a little while ago

31
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:32,820
that the evil Saddam Husseins had ordered a whole bunch of fake American and British army uniforms

32
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:39,060
so he could dress up the Fayadin in these uniforms who would then go out and commit atrocities

33
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:48,700
on their fellow Iraqis as a propaganda routine, you know, to make it look like how evil and terrible the demonic British are.

34
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,940
You know, how they are.

35
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,460
I heard they really were demonic.

36
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,120
Have you ever heard of Mad Bomber Harris?

37
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,600
He started the whole idea of blowing the living hell out of Iraq in the 1920s.

38
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,560
When they were close to independence, he thought, why not use the new bombers,

39
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,980
you know, the brand new bombers in the air we've got,

40
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,480
and just keep dropping them on those peasant villages,

41
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,900
you know, kind of toughen them up and soften them at the same time a little bit.

42
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,060
During these last few months, I've been trained by Al-Qaeda,

43
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,620
and I'm weak and materialistic.

44
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,080
I told our country and I told the world,

45
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,460
if it feels good, do it.

46
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,700
I hope you'll enjoy me in expressing fear and selfishness.

47
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,400
We will embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed.

48
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,760
We can be summed up in one word, evil.

49
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,140
I am committed to defeating not only the good work of charities,

50
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,320
but the values that will bring lasting peace.

51
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,720
And we have a great opportunity during this time of war

52
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,700
to lead the world in a way that will bring lasting peace.

53
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,220
We will all work together to bring a world towards suicide and murder.

54
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,180
Let's roll.

55
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,840
Kill, kill, kill for peace.

56
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,760
Kill, kill, kill for peace.

57
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,800
You know, he actually used the phrase,

58
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,680
now I may be wrong, but he actually used the phrase,

59
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,220
now I may be wrong, but he actually used the phrase,

60
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,220


61
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,220


62
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,820
kill for peace.

63
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,560
I could swear I heard the emperor say,

64
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,380
the goal of this war is peace.

65
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,520
He may have said some other things,

66
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,360
but at one point he actually said the phrase,

67
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,720
war is peace.

68
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,320
Friends, it's 1984.

69
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,620
1984 is 19 years late.

70
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,240
That means X-Day will be the year 2017.

71
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,180
Praise God!

72
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,140
Praise God!

73
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,860
19 years.

74
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,480
It was written in a vast, deep, deep color,

75
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:18,960
in a sleep.

76
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,840
Stuck to the ground

77
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,720
needs one of the baby incubators in Kuwait City,

78
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,440
waiting to awake.

79
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,460
And yet you cannot.

80
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,980
Until 1984.

81
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,140
When your dreams come true.

82
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,680
When your brother is bigger than anything.

83
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,300
And I want you all to see that.

84
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,120
He wears a toothless jaw.

85
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,540
It's 1984.

86
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,160
1984.

87
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,320
Just keep on picking up pieces of corn,

88
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,660
which have fallen out of that mouth there,

89
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,420
and we might stay alive one more day in America.

90
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,120
1984.

91
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,040
Bob loves you.

92
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,980
Bob loves you.

93
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,460
Bob loves you.

94
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,140
Bob loves you.

95
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,360
Bob loves you.

96
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,800
Bob loves you.

97
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,000
Bob loves you.

98
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,940
Bob loves you.

99
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,140
Bob loves you.

100
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,780
Bob loves you.

101
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,940
Bob loves you.

102
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,140
Bob loves, Bob loves you.

103
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,760
Bob loves you.

104
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,760
Bob loves you.

105
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,220
Bob loves you.

106
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,300
Bob loves you.

107
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:26,340
Bob loves you.

108
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:26,340


109
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:26,340


110
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,340
Have any favorite Bob songs?

111
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:27,760
God.

112
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,060
They're going to cut off a lot of vital tissue.

113
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,700
Right, right.

114
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,360
But...

115
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,700
So you think they're playing this song in Baghdad right now?

116
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,900
Or on the way to Baghdad?

117
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,760
I think on the way to Baghdad,

118
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,060
there's a lot of guys shitting in their foxholes,

119
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,420
dreaming about their foxholes and crying in their boots.

120
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,160
Where's my-

121
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,720
Dreaming about those boot jobs

122
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,500
They're going to get when they get back home.

123
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:49,940
Yep.

124
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,640
Get their boots enlarged.

125
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,380
Shaved medulla oblongatus.

126
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,500
They're going to look like all the rest of the kids, only nobody knows they're going to be different.

127
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,780
Way different.

128
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:00,860
Changed.

129
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,440
A different kind of tattoo.

130
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,160
Well, they get the free smallpox inoculations and the free tracking devices.

131
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,860
Well, that tattoos your inner.

132
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,600
It's pretty good, but that's not the whole of it.

133
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,860
That's only part.

134
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,400
Yeah, they get the holes, too.

135
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,500
Yeah, well, that's only part of it, too.

136
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,200
And then to the tattoo.

137
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,440
Yes, it makes them lift their leg when the bus comes up to the bus stop.

138
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,160
If they're well trained.

139
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,040
Well, some of them have to wear the collars, the special, well, let's just call them.

140
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,800
I know I do.

141
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,360
Digital angels, you know what I mean?

142
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,980
If I didn't have this collar on, Dave, I'd be wetting myself.

143
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,360
Well, we can thank the digital angel for setting you straight.

144
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,060
That's right.

145
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,660
If it weren't for this modern age, I'd just be a vegetable.

146
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,740
Where do they put your chip?

147
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,980
Where do they put your chip?

148
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,420
All over me.

149
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,060
I mean, there's tons of them.

150
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,100
I've got a chip for every organ that still works.

151
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,360
Did Papa Joe ever get that collar removed from his?

152
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:55,980
Nah.

153
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,300
His was embedded into his vertebrae.

154
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,580
Did we ever get those collars removed from this show?

155
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,980
Those barnacles?

156
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,320
Those grafted on ticks?

157
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,760
If people remember the early days, we asked each and every one of you

158
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,400
if you'd like to become a closer member of the show's team out there.

159
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:24,220
If you feel you are not properly sedated, please call 555-3129.

160
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,840
Failure to do so may result in criminal prosecution for drug evasion.

161
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,000
Welcome back to our program.

162
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,320
Please continue.

163
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:41,340
I believe most Pacific Islander parents like using products like hairspray or glue as an inhalant to get high.

164
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,300
I'm here to let other Pacific Islander parents know

165
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,400
that we need to care about you.

166
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:53,120
If you need drugs or ideas on how to keep your drugs, please call Bob.

167
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,080
Welcome back to our program.

168
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,700
That was a lemur cut.

169
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,560
Tonight's collages are almost but not all by Mr. F. Lemur.

170
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:13,080
The second of the two Bush cut-ups heard earlier was by someone named Edo at fuckitall.com.

171
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,380
The Star Spangled Banner was by Mark Mothersbaugh for your dating experience.

172
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:25,420
The show was actually assembled on March 9th, 2003, the year of duct tape and plastic sheeting.

173
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,700
Isn't duct tape and plastic sheeting just another version of duck and cover?

174
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,480
Duck and cover.

175
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,860
What did duck and cover tell you?

176
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:42,440
Duck and cover told you that if you just ducked when the bomb went off.

177
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,800
And put a newspaper over your butt.

178
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,960
Yeah, if you just ducked.

179
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,640
Just duck.

180
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:45,900
Duck.

181
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,280
And duck.

182
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,480
And duck.

183
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,020
And then you're a nuclear bomb.

184
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,480
Duck.

185
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,840
Then everything will be okay.

186
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,480
You will win.

187
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,240
Well, they were talking about amphibian birds at the time.

188
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,660
When they asked you to duck and cover, they wanted you to run out to the nearest palm

189
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:05,160
and grab a little turkey boy or a little quacky and stick him under your shirt and carry him home.

190
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,740
And when they ask you now, that's what the duct tape is all about.

191
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,840
These are all reasons to duck and take subconscious.

192
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,420
They're playing with your mind.

193
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,580
Duck and Cover.

194
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,200
Duck and Take.

195
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,860
That is being used in this war.

196
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,140
Air-raid sirens warn us of the approach of enemy planes, but in addition if gas is dropped

197
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,840
by the enemy, a special gas alarm will be sounded.

198
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,420
It will be a hand rattle, or a hammering sound like the beating of a dish pan.

199
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,720
More gas is dropped from planes either as a spray or in gas bombs.

200
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,200
But should enemy raiders use gas against your community, there is no reason for fear or panic.

201
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:59,440
Because if you know what to do, you can protect yourself and safeguard your family against the menace of gas from the air.

202
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,480
Of course, that's Arcana. You know what Arcana is?

203
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,640
Do you know what wisdom is?

204
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,400
Do you know the meaning of the eye in the soft?

205
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,140
Of the eye within the eye within the eye within the eye?

206
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,180
Are your balls ready to rumble?

207
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,000
Are they ready to roll?

208
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,700
Do you know the meaning of love?

209
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:30,420
Pour me another mug of that there eye in the soft, would you, there barkeep?

210
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,920
You had enough, buddy boy. I'm going to catch you off.

211
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,200
If you're babbling to everybody in the damn barn, everyone's tired of listening to your wisdom.

212
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,720
It's not for him, it's for me.

213
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,920
I had a gold Akashic record, damn it.

214
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,120
My bad.

215
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,460
Back in the day, everybody was doing my song.

216
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,840
Yeah, you got a gold. We got your astral card right here, buddy.

217
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,560
And it says that you haven't passed your limit, and you've been around more times than anybody else in this bar.

218
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,420
So could you please shut up?

219
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,440
Shut the fuck up, man.

220
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,800
Stop drinking that wisdom shit.

221
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,540
Don't be sucking on the wisdom eyeball.

222
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,460
Too much is always better than not enough.

223
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:12,880
Okay.

224
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,180
I'm a regular.

225
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,440
But it's almost as bad.

226
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,880
I'm a regular.

227
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,080
Oh, you're quite a regular now, dear lad.

228
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,060
Just let me check further here.

229
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,140
What is the elliptical meaning of that?

230
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,280
There's only one eyeball.

231
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:35,080
I'm going to chase you with an elliptical eyeball and then fork all around and round and round and round.

232
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:35,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

233
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,700
That's right.

234
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,940
Well, there's no train of thought we're sketching.

235
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,640
This time we're taking the express.

236
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,900
We're guilty of not doing enough about the war.

237
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,240
That just keeps coming.

238
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,980
I keep feeling so bad about not doing enough.

239
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,800
Well, you could suck the cycloptic wisdom teeth, and then you would understand what to do as Laguerre pronounces itself.

240
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,060
Which magazine should I subscribe to that would be the right thing to do?

241
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:12,560
Martial arts, survival, mercenary, merc, magazines like that that teach you use of small arms and large feet.

242
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,720
That's going to be, we're going to have to pull off some pretty big feet to live through this, I think.

243
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,280
I mean, size 12.

244
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,040
I was just going to learn to give really good oral sex to great big tough guys.

245
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,780
That was how I was going to live through the end of civilization.

246
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:31,380
As a sniveling pansy awaiting for the trains of military to come through town and to wait for one of those.

247
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,240
I want them to say, that's the best barrel.

248
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,720
That barrel over there, that's the best one.

249
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,500
You better hope no fish jump out of it.

250
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,520
The prisoner in that barrel.

251
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,120
The prisoner in that barrel.

252
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,120


253
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,660
I don't know who she is, but she's good.

254
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,280
You know it's not a woman, man.

255
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,760
Shut up.

256
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,700
Those are orgasmic.

257
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,340
That's how you get through the end times.

258
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,500
The chocolate.

259
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,100
Unless you have the biggest gun.

260
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,920
You take your duct tape, you take a big Hershey bar, because that's the survival candy bar.

261
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,540
You want to be able to take small, small pieces of it.

262
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,900
You duct tape this candy bar right up into your crotch there.

263
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,780
Take a lot of duct tape and just strap it right in there.

264
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,100
Is that the way you relate?

265
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,760
Is that what you're really supposed to do?

266
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,180
You're supposed to strap duct tape into your crotch?

267
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:16,720
I mean, um...

268
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,240
No, the food.

269
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:17,780
Hershey bar?

270
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,100
Hershey bar.

271
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,240
Your trading materials.

272
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,500
Oh, the loin packs.

273
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,800
Those are actual things that are trademarked.

274
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,280
Yeah, because that's what you're going to use to trade with the natives or the surviving

275
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,620
wretches in whatever country far away from America that you flee to.

276
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,160
My dehydrated loin pack is leaking and I've noticed sores beginning to well around my knees.

277
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,560
Oh, here's another good news.

278
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,100
The reason you have to flee America is because you're not going to be able to get out of America.

279
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,200
So you're going to get off the ship of the American people.

280
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,840
Because the Americans are taking over.

281
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,520
Yeah.

282
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,920
Yes.

283
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,360
I'm the political president man.

284
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,000
Stupid America.

285
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,140
That's the fact.

286
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,440
You better bring back the, uh, the uh, pillory and stocks and stuff and, uh..

287
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,700
Today, a U.S. nuclear fishing boat torn apart.

288
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,200
A one man's search for truth almost cost him his eight.

289
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,940
Well welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this edition of Up the French.

290
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,060
Gruen, France.

291
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,780
It's not going to be pleasant. I hate the French. They'll always be ridiculous.

292
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,520
Yeah, the French are Nazis, as a matter of fact. Lee?

293
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,400
Pat, a concern of several European terrorists. Pat?

294
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:34,200
Lee, it's shocking. The French Nazis build terrorism. They are an instrument, an agent of terror. Lee?

295
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,180
That's right, Pat. Israel is carefully assessing CBN News Middle East correspondent Chris Choll. Right, Pat?

296
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,440
Well, it could be bloody blood all over the place, and just that simple. Lee?

297
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:54,800
Want good cranberries and cancer and heart disease. That's too bad, Pat, because I was thinking about having a big old piece of bloodstream pie with disease on top.

298
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:01,640
How about the phrase, axis of Putin's soul? It's in Texas. No, not really. Oh.

299
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,320
In Bosnia, they built a Mall of America in Bosnia now.

300
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,160
Well, they're working on Disneyland East, was what they said.

301
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:15,580
Far East. Disneyland Far East. That's what this is all about. Disneyland East.

302
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:27,480
China. Have you heard the new chain, Baghdadi? The pants and the soup at the same time? That is a disgusting prescription for anyone without brain cells. Baghdadi.

303
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:37,280
So, the bookies taking bets on when this thing is going to start, exactly when they're going to, like, boom, you know, go, let the gates down and, you know.

304
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,580
They're laying the odds down.

305
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,160
When the first thing comes out, they're going to be like, oh, it's going to be a disaster. Yeah.

306
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,100
And the shot will be fired. And it won't be shot. Sit down. From a shotgun.

307
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,020
We'll have nowhere to run.

308
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,000
And here comes Big Bad George.

309
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,480
Now, that was a true honor. That's what I'm saying.

310
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,340
And the military industrial complex.

311
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:07,640
Speaking of strange showbiz, after the king of the universe spoke tonight, suddenly they cut over to saying, it looks like we're in hot pursuit of Osama bin Laden.

312
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,960
He's been spotted in the border.

313
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,420
I've got to stand in Pakistan.

314
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,760
And they're closing in.

315
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,040
I know.

316
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,200
And the smoke is blowing up behind us.

317
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,940
They're going to do it just like cops, you know.

318
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,760
They're going to have the music in the background and stuff.

319
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,580
And he's going to be running through, like, with a dachshund, I think, chasing and biting his ass.

320
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:29,880
And then when he gets up on the top of one of those, you know, old industrial warehouse buildings and they pull him down, screaming and swearing in Arabic.

321
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,500
This is earlier today down in public square.

322
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,640
What's this for?

323
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,660
What's this for?

324
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:38,940
What's this for?

325
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:38,940


326
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:38,940


327
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,340
What's that spell?

328
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,880
What's that spell?

329
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,640
What's that spell?

330
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,560
What's that spell?

331
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,520
That's the joke, right?

332
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,900
Just what's that spell?

333
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,040
Well, come on, all of you big strong men.

334
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,980
Uncle Sam needs your help again.

335
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,360
Got himself in a terrible jam.

336
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,740
Way down yonder in Baghdad.

337
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,900
Put down your parts and pick up a gun.

338
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,780
We're going to have a whole lot of fun.

339
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,520
And it's one, two, three, what are we fighting for?

340
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,100
Don't ask me.

341
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,160
I don't give a damn.

342
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,460
My next stop is Baghdad.

343
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:08,640
My dad.

344
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:08,920
My dad.

345
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:08,920


346
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:08,920


347
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:08,920


348
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:08,920


349
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:08,920


350
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:08,920


351
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:08,920


352
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:08,920


353
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:08,920


354
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:08,920


355
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:08,920


356
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,640
My dad.

357
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,960
It's five, six, seven, open up the pearly gates.

358
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,180
Because I just inhaled some anthrax.

359
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,960
Welcome back.

360
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,600
Now come on, Wall Street, don't be sad.

361
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,500
Stang, you have such a perplexed look on your face as if you'd actually inhaled anthrax

362
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:24,820
yourself.

363
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,380
Actually, I was thinking about some of my buddy's kids who were on their way over there.

364
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,020
I sometimes think about the soldiers.

365
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,900
Usually you're preoccupied with buds and squids and now you're thinking about the soldiers.

366
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:38,900


367
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:38,900


368
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,060
I'm thinking about your buddy's kids.

369
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,300
How open hearted are you?

370
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,460
Five, six, seven, open up the pearly gates.

371
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,240
You're not singing along.

372
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,720
I don't think you want to stop this war.

373
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,080
So, you.

374
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,180
Do you really take yourself seriously?

375
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,340
I have big teeth and big glasses and- We think you're stupid.

376
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,680
You must forgive me.

377
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,060
You show your stupidity by assuming that we're like you.

378
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:08,900
You're a fool.

379
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,680
You're a fool.

380
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:12,680


381
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:12,680


382
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:12,680


383
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:12,680


384
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:12,680


385
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:12,680


386
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,360
The F-A-R-C has revealed a game.

387
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,400
You've got three or four D-I-A-A-C-I-E-L criminals at your back and corner.

388
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,440
He almost passed out.

389
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,800
It's time to play Name That War.

390
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,420
You're five miles south of Bogota City.

391
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,780
You're in the rainforest.

392
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,880
What do the initials F-A-R-C stand for?

393
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,260
These protests.

394
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,720
I think that's another reason they're having the war now.

395
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,820
so that the protesters can't protest because it's all zero degrees.

396
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,820
There'd be a lot more people out there.

397
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,920
Well, that's what the weather control people say.

398
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,780
It's ruining that.

399
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,100
Rubber bands and aluminum sulfide do a dandy treat make.

400
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,900
Suspended from arrogant and left to wait.

401
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,360
Children who flop and children who flip will freeze in the rain like a big old drip.

402
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,680
Wow.

403
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,080
It's about weather control.

404
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,980
It's about the Lusitania, too, but you've got to be a real conspiracy buff.

405
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,660
Cowboy poetry is so romantic.

406
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:13,360
I was going to play my mouth for you, but I've been shamed.

407
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
It gets my heart all fluttered.

408
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,440
Yes, you have been shamed.

409
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,120
By the grace of the Lord.

410
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,160
And Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

411
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,720
This song is depressing, James.

412
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,860
They stopped Bob from dealing.

413
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,580
Stop thinking about all them body bags, man.

414
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,660
Bob was almost done.

415
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,460
That's all I can think of is body bag after bag.

416
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,520
Coming out in Arlington.

417
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,600
Yeah.

418
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,040
Back of those old planes.

419
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,660
Everybody's real gung-ho right now.

420
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,660
Everybody's real like, yeah, this is going to be like the Super Bowl coming up.

421
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,140
Oh, yeah.

422
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,960
Wait till Zayn drop one of them chemical bombs.

423
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,500
On TV.

424
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,720
The right-wing jocks are going so crazy.

425
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,080
Wait till our boys are coming home with their skin peeled off their faces.

426
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,560
Yeah, and it's communicable, too, up to six generations.

427
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,900
We'll see how gung-ho they all are.

428
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,700
I think it's a pretty small everybody that's really excited.

429
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,600
They wish they would have gone.

430
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

431
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:06,780
What?

432
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,520
What?

433
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:07,540


434
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,380
I think it's a pretty small everybody that's all excited.

435
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,380
I do, too.

436
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,960
I think it's more bunch of people going, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

437
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,720
A good friend of mine was telling me about, but a good friend of mine, he's a blue-collar

438
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:28,220
kind of guy, works blue-collar work, and telling me how all those guys, they all listen to

439
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,500
Rush Limbaugh, and they're all so, you know.

440
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
Oh, those guys are crazy.

441
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,840
They're gung-ho about everything, about it.

442
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,560
I was just going to tell you guys something.

443
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,560
I heard on the mic on the Savage show.

444
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,560
That guy is so nuts.

445
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:47,520
He claimed that a demonstrator waded through a police line and a line of horses, grabbed

446
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,120
a horsey by its bridle, punched it, and knocked it down on the ground.

447
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,300
A demonstrator did that?

448
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:53,920
Like blazing.

449
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,520
We need those guys in back here.

450
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,220
Let's get back to promoting the war.

451
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,240


452
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,580
It's reality.

453
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,340
Face the flag, you son of a bitch.

454
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,740
Take a good long look.

455
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,440
What you're seeing now can't be found.

456
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,520
It's the present.

457
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,160
The future, son.

458
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,700
It's being written now.

459
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,840
You're the one to write it.

460
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,980
The flag can show you how.

461
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,000
You know what it stands for?

462
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,220
What its makers meant?

463
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,480
Think?

464
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,220
Speak?

465
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,700
Privilege of dissent?

466
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,060
To think our leaders might be wrong to stand and tell them so.

467
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,740
I've got to touch a hangover, bureaucrat.

468
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,780
Don't push me.

469
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,540
These are the things that other men under other flags...

470
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,160
will never know.

471
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,480
But responsibility.

472
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,820
That's the cost that free men must bear.

473
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,120
You know, if we had any moral character, we wouldn't be standing here covered with mud drinking.

474
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,100
If you don't accept that...

475
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,460
Somebody oughta felt you in the mouth.

476
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,080
Face the flag of stars and bars

477
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,660
Of red and white and blue

478
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,540
Of flag flags and stars and bars

479
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,240
That guarantees the rise

480
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,240
For men like me and you

481
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,320
Face the flag, son, and face reality.

482
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,220
My mind is a globe with whirling transient nodes of thought

483
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,500
careening through a cosmic vapor of invention.

484
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,100
Our strength and our freedoms are based in unity.

485
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,980
The flag is but a symbol, son.

486
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,080
The world's greatest nation.

487
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,100
As long as it keeps flying, there's cause for celebration.

488
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,560
So do what you gotta do, but always keep in mind...

489
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,460
God has a heart on for Marines.

490
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,100
Because we kill everything we see.

491
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,640
Face the flag, son, and thank God it's still there.

492
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,020
This is a break from the G.I. show for you all.

493
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,340
A cutup by Artemia G.I. and G.I.

494
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,940
Other splicings and slicings in here by Fernando and Andy Lemur.

495
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,080
Lots of ESO Swamp Radio tonight from WCSB Cleveland.

496
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,700
WCSB.org if you want to hear it streaming live on Thursday nights.

497
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,300
And that features Princess Wee Chae Smith, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang

498
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,820
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave in Extreme Union with himself.

499
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,320
Extreme Union with himself?

500
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,440
A form of Tourette's Syndrome that affects people only when they call radio.

501
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,220
Rosenheit Syndrome, eh?

502
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,020
I found a note on my desk that said,

503
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,180
A witch with Tourette's.

504
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,520
A witch with Tourette's?

505
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,960
Yeah, and I can't figure out what the heck that note was supposed to refer to.

506
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,140
I want to see him go to war.

507
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,420
Was that a warning to myself?

508
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:07,640
I want to see him go to war just so that there's a lot of dead people all over the place.

509
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,320
You mean the awards in Baghdad?

510
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:09,860
Yeah.

511
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Hosted by Jewel, Tommy Franks.

512
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,680
Yeah, he's going to be the new Sheik of Arabi.

513
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,920
Sheik Franks.

514
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,520
Can you see him with a caftan on his forehead?

515
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,780
A caftan?

516
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,860
That's a pair of underpants.

517
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,920
Slice his throat.

518
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,060
Spice his head.

519
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,560
Get the barbecue ready.

520
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,600
General Tommy, your meat is my meat, Frankfurter himself.

521
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,680
He views the world as his hot dog.

522
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,180
Ready to be barbecued and served with a choice toxic mustard.

523
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,720
I want to be the mustard.

524
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
You are the mustard.

525
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,380
You're the glint in Tommy Franks' eye.

526
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,460
While friends and lovers mourn your silly grave.

527
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,420
Look, it's the barrel of a tank.

528
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,580
This is for you, Tommy.

529
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,000
I got news for you, Tommy.

530
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,880
Here's a tactical nuke.

531
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,220
Up your ass.

532
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,640
Jesus.

533
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,960
Get back, Baghdaddy.

534
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,500
Whatever happened to the Arabian Nights?

535
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,600
Don't those guys have, like, genies and flying carpets and stuff?

536
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,100
Yeah.

537
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,560
And what about the...

538
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:30,120
Can't they, like, rub this lamp and have hordes of scimitar-wielding, balloon-pantalooned...

539
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,720
Turban.

540
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,400
Yeah, Alibaba, 40 Feet's type guys.

541
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,380
What open sesame guys.

542
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,240
Right, open sesame guys.

543
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,220
People that make it happen.

544
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,560
Businessmen in boxer shorts.

545
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,300
Turbaned young fez drivers in Pocono Oriental cabs.

546
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,540
Small, medium, and large-sized shakes.

547
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,240
All your bones included.

548
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,460
You're trying to kill my daddy.

549
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,300
I killed him.

550
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,460
Everybody's daddy, man.

551
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,740
They killed Daddy Junior.

552
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,020
Well, things aren't going to get better.

553
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,880
I did kill my daddy.

554
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,560
We did it all.

555
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,200
We did it all.

556
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:11,960
We did whatever we could.

557
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,420
Whenever we get our hands on back in the 70s, we did fucking handfuls of mushrooms, pills,

558
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,760
the roots, coke, whatever it was.

559
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,000
We just fucking swallowed it, okay?

560
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:18,540
That's what we did.

561
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,560
Dennis Bleary.

562
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,820
He's Crispin Bleary.

563
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,440
He smoked too many hockey sticks.

564
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,080
I think he owes George Carlin an explanation.

565
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,940
Really, he does.

566
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,180
I thought he was George Carlin until I heard him expectorate out the...

567
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:31,880
Out the back.

568
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,620
Out the back door.

569
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,260
Out the back.

570
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,180
Back, back, back, back, back.

571
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,820
What would Jesus do now?

572
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,120
War.

573
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,480
War.

574
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,100
War.

575
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,780
War.

576
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,100
War.

577
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:40,640
Healing.

578
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,820
Demons.

579
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,620
Racism.

580
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,720
Sexism.

581
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,740
Anti-Semitism.

582
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,120
Arab-bashing.

583
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,700
Anti-Islamism.

584
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,840
Gay-bashing.

585
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,380
War.

586
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,220
Britain.

587
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:50,700
Britain.

588
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,140
War.

589
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:51,860
War.

590
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,460
War.

591
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:52,960
War.

592
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,700
Jesus.

593
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,540
Jesus.

594
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,700
As part of an adverb...

595
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,900
Yeah, you said on the X-rated hour of Slack just last week,

596
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,160
the one that's not played on radio stations,

597
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,380
but only on the intranet.

598
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,380
And the inter-net.

599
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:07,440
I can't see.

600
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,900
That means...

601
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,880
Oh.

602
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,120
Every time you guys cuss, that ends up on a secret show.

603
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,000
There's a song going out for George.

604
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,660
The magus are breeding.

605
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,620
The king of the universe.

606
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,680
King of the universe.

607
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,660
King.

608
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,500
Ray.

609
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,540
Ray del universo.

610
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,360
Ray del cosmos.

611
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,460
The emperor.

612
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,440
The rei de tout.

613
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,540
The ancien.

614
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,080
Pray for him to go up there on that.

615
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,760
A rei de moi.

616
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,120
Hear me.

617
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,380
The sound of my voice.

618
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,440
We must get that.

619
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,420
Say, Dom.

620
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,000
And I've made my choice.

621
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,820
When y'all voted me sheriff,

622
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,300
I said I was gonna rid this town of these barbages.

623
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,320
I'm gonna do it anyway.

624
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:56,240
I will conquer the Assyrians with my funny fake goatee and feral hat.

625
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,120
You may think that I'm a man.

626
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,880
You may think that I'm a man.

627
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,280
I'm a fool.

628
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:01,820
The legend.

629
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,820
But you are a fool.

630
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,960
If you believe we can crawl out of this mire.

631
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,000
Who gets the harems?

632
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,260
The harems?

633
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,200
Yeah, the harems.

634
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,320
I've heard a lot about harems in those palaces in Baghdad.

635
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,740
No, I just thought that was an esophageal grunt.

636
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,680
Oh, man.

637
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,760
You know, the sultans would get harems.

638
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,720
And there must be harems.

639
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,560
They don't have sultans anymore in Iraq.

640
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,900
Well, there's always...

641
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,500
Yeah, right.

642
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,800
Just like they don't have kings here, right?

643
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,360
Right.

644
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,500
It's an undemocratic people's republic.

645
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,400
Yeah, I suppose they do.

646
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,080
Yeah.

647
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,500
Yeah.

648
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:38,660
Sultans.

649
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,100
Yeah.

650
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,400
Sultans of Swig.

651
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,180
Sultans of the ornament.

652
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,860
Chairman Mao had a harem.

653
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,420
Pharaohs.

654
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,020
Jack Kennedy had a harem.

655
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,640
And you, sir.

656
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,560
Where do they keep the pharaohs?

657
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,620
Or no Jack Kennedy.

658
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,720
I know Mao Zedong, my friend.

659
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,440
Where do they keep the pharaohs?

660
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,600
I know Mao Zedong.

661
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,760
Actually, that's a pretty old turf there.

662
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,600
That's, you know, the Tigris and Euphrates.

663
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,780
Oh, yeah, that's the oldest.

664
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,960
The birthplace of civilization.

665
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,760
Mesopotamia.

666
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:02,700
Yeah.

667
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,440
They're afraid of the...

668
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,460
The Fertile Crescent.

669
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:04,820
Yeah.

670
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,740
Speaking of Fertile Crescent, that's...

671
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:12,280
The amount of archaeological cool stuff that's going to get buried a little deeper is just

672
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:12,780
horrifying.

673
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,220
Well, that's the hex theory.

674
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,560
But that's up to Saddam.

675
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,140
That's up to Saddam Hussein.

676
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,160
It's his choice.

677
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:26,160
This land is cursed by a Sumerian god, and you must get rid of it and destroy it.

678
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:26,500
No?

679
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,500
Something like that?

680
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,440
Only it was just going to get buried.

681
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:29,760
But you...

682
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,120
But you know it's going to get smashed to smithereens.

683
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,620
Just like that little ibex.

684
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,440
Which was the ancient civilization in which the ladies did not wear shirts?

685
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,800
Oh, Manoa.

686
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,500
Yeah, right.

687
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,200
The Manoans.

688
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,380
Yes, my favorite civilization.

689
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,780
They had the cool labyrinths and the bull-headed monster guys.

690
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,740
And they would ride bulls and all the men would applaud.

691
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,400
And they'd quit, yeah, and they'd make fun of the Cretans.

692
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,960
Just like we do.

693
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,580
And we're on to North Korea.

694
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,820
Church of the Sub-Cretans.

695
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,760
That's what we should tell everybody over there in the war zones tonight.

696
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,380
God's Midans!

697
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,700
That's what the Führer used to say.

698
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,020
Dons.

699
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,400
And we're saying it again.

700
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,840
God's Midans!

701
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:06,540
God's Midans!

702
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,440
What does that mean, Dave?

703
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:07,700
What does that mean, Dave?

704
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,860
It means God is with us.

705
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,840
They used to put them on the Nazi daggers.

706
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:11,860
I'm putting them on the Midans.

707
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,600
God is with us.

708
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,620
Oh, yeah, sure.

709
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,300
Yeah.

710
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,640
They believed it in those days, and they believe it now.

711
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,200
In the bowling alleys and parking lots around America.

712
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,120
In stubby Sam City.

713
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,480
In Carl's Magic Theater.

714
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,260
Every place you might go and have your hair tortured or maybe have your feet upturned.

715
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:28,740
They believe it now.

716
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,480
They believe the Schmitt.

717
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:33,640
The Schmittagogical creature called war takes care of everything.

718
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,140
A-sha-loo-l-ha-la-la-la-bab.

719
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:38,840
La-la.

720
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,120
A-sha-loo-l-la-la-la-bab.

721
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,360
Bob Akbar?

722
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,360
Bob Akbar!

723
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,900
He is great!

724
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,680
Greater than my shoe size and twice as small as my cranium.

725
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,000
Bob Akbar!

726
00:34:59,340 --> 00:34:59,940
Bob Akbar!

727
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,500
Bob Akbar!

728
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,320
Bob Akbar!

729
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,840
Bob Akbar.

730
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,300
Bob Akbar!

731
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,300


732
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,300


733
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,820
To begin with, it may be surprising to know that radiation is invisible rays

734
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,760
that we call radiation.

735
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,860
They are about the size of table salt or fine sand.

736
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,120
We don't worry about radiation.

737
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:22,580
Radiation would not affect this much for instance because any material will keep the penetrating

738
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,660
rays from hurting us.

739
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,740
Within an hour, after a massive enemy attack, fallout in the vicinity of Virginia will

740
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:28,740


741
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:28,740


742
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:28,740


743
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:28,740


744
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:28,740


745
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:28,740


746
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:28,740


747
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:28,740


748
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,120
of any nuclear groundburst will be destroyed beyond repair.

749
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,480
Suppose a nuclear explosion takes place at 12 noon.

750
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,640
By 1 o'clock, all the fallout is down.

751
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,500
If fallout settles on your food,

752
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,760
the food itself isn't harmed or made radioactive.

753
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,060
Fallout swallowed accidentally with food or in drinking water

754
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,140
would do you no harm,

755
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,380
so we would not have to take precautions

756
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,700
using everyday methods of food preparation.

757
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,580
And hungry people should not be denied animals

758
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,180
because of possible contamination.

759
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,600
If we remember these facts,

760
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,320
if we act intelligent,

761
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,020
we can increase our chances of nuclear attack.

762
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,480
Many people have difficulty understanding

763
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,740
how blood and tissues are pulled up into the mushroom cloud.

764
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,380
That's why the federal government has a nationwide program.

765
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,380
The goal is a raging nuclear furnace

766
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,360
that shoots out showers of fallout.

767
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,680
And it's a great opportunity

768
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,140
for every man, woman, and child.

769
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,580
This goal can be reached.

770
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,900
For with radiation,

771
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,060
we can face the facts about the nuclear age.

772
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,560
Come on, you.

773
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,460
Papa Lord.

774
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,660
I haven't seen the film yet.

775
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,180
I'm going to be watching for DJ A

776
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,100
because he's not going to be able to get in tonight either.

777
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,060
There are new security measures here

778
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,340
because of the terrorist activity going on.

779
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,720
The homeland is locked down.

780
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,980
Yeah, and there was a Patriot Act stamp to the door

781
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980
for your reading edifice.

782
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,280
Dave, have you looked in a mirror?

783
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,940
There's one stamp on your forehead.

784
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,280
Lick the postage stamp, man.

785
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,980
So I can look through my...

786
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,720
Yeah, so you don't forget for one second

787
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,840
what the rules are, buddy.

788
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,140
One second.

789
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,300
You can't...

790
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,600
Forget the rules.

791
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,780
Are you going to be a team player?

792
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,680
I'm watching the phone.

793
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,780
I see no DJ.

794
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,420
Are you with us?

795
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,380
Are you against us?

796
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,320
Private?

797
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,280
Are your privates private or are they mine?

798
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,460
I belong to you, sir.

799
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,900
Your privates are my privates

800
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,940
and your privates are my privates.

801
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,620
Keep your privates private, okay?

802
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,760
Next week, America enters the torture zone

803
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,480
on Torturing the Enemy Part 3

804
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,300
with a celebrity I want to get the fuck out of here.

805
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,600
Next week, it might be a very...

806
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,080
Hey.

807
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:56,140


808
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,400
Situation.

809
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,680
Starring downtown Julie Brown.

810
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,940
Kaz Kalimba.

811
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,800
Color-coded.

812
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,200
Johnny Stetter and John Black.

813
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,580
People are our mouths to keep us from broadcasting.

814
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,660
Tommy Franksberger.

815
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,900
The broadcast industry of America.

816
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,780
The shelf-towed people who live in your face.

817
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,780
I just don't know what to do.

818
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,480
I thought I'd come and ask you.

819
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,360
Military action to destroy them

820
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,500
with weapons,

821
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,600
with weapons of mass destruction.

822
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,560
Well, um...

823
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,200
This nation has weapons of mass destruction.

824
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,140
Yeah.

825
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,240
He is acting the insidiously to actors.

826
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,320
Well, thanks anyway for talking to me.

827
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:40,820
Well...

828
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,500
Why am I in London?

829
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,720
Because, because faith, faith, faith, power.

830
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,040
Faith, Moses, Joshua, marching.

831
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,360
Faith, Jesus, marching.

832
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,700
Faith, marching, God.

833
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,520
Dark, light, racism.

834
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,240
Sexism, militarism.

835
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,060
New World Order.

836
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,060
Heal, hope, healing.

837
00:38:59,240 --> 00:38:59,860
Hope, healing.

838
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,560
Hope, healing.

839
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,680
Peace, hope, healing.

840
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,240
Hope, healing.

841
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:02,900
Hope, healing.

842
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,880
Peace, peace.

843
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,240
Hope, hope, hope, hope, hope.

844
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,080
I love you.

845
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,800
Children, children, children.

846
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,320
Hope, love, love.

847
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,320
Faces, places.

848
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,740
Hope, hope, hope, love you.

849
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,620
It was another normal night

850
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,780
And I got done fighting with my wife

851
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,560
So I went down to the bar

852
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,540
And just made all take and roll

853
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,600
Since I was a little kid

854
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,260
They've been the two best friends

855
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,180
That a man could ever hope for in this world

856
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,760
Now I'm a normal guy

857
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,820
And I work all day for my money

858
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,480
And I fear the good Lord like I know I should

859
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,340
I ain't no new age coot

860
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,160
But I gotta get this off my chest

861
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,880
And put this tragedy behind me now for good

862
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,720
I remember getting drunk

863
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,580
And I remember falling down

864
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,740
And someone laid me on a pool table

865
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,180
And I'd have been consumed

866
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,140
Then through the blinding lights

867
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,100
Two creatures stared into my eyes

868
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,520
As at the jukebox or a flying saucer

869
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,600
Spinning round the room

870
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,940
And I'd tell myself this couldn't have been

871
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,920
No member of the human race

872
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,300
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men

873
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,240
From outer space

874
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,060
Well it hit me like trouble

875
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,080
In the back of my head

876
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,800
Knocked me clean out of my shoes

877
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,260
And when I woke up, Lord, I wished that I was dead

878
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,800
I had got off the case of those abduction blues

879
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,320
Yes, it must have been an abduction, Lord

880
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,900
Cause I don't know what happened

881
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,520
It hit me like a bolt out of the blue

882
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,120
Now I think I'm gonna look crazy

883
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,940
But I know that it weren't them

884
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,660
Say the things that they can do and never do

885
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,960
Well, when at last I woke

886
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,920
Both my legs, they had been broke

887
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,760
Both my eyes were black

888
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,640
And my ears were stringing bad

889
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,000
I'd seen enough

890
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,280
I'm not gonna lie

891
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,080
I'm not gonna lie

892
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,080


893
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,380
But this was the worst case

894
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,260
Of intergalactic relations I've ever had

895
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,280
And I'd tell myself this couldn't have been

896
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,280
No member of the human race

897
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,640
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men

898
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,620
From outer space

899
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,360
Cause it hit me like trouble

900
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,360
In the back of my head

901
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,140
Knocked me clean out of my shoes

902
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,720
And when I woke up, Lord, I wished that I was dead

903
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,360
I had got off the case of those abduction blues

904
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,280
Yes, it must have been an abduction, Lord

905
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,060
Cause I don't know what happened

906
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,840
Hit me like a bolt out of the blue

907
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,500
Now I think I'm gonna look crazy

908
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,240
But I know that it weren't them

909
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,360
Say the things that they can do and never do

910
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,780
Never do

911
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,020
Music

912
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:15,760
Music

913
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:15,760

943
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,980
and the swerving headlights from Interstellar Cattle Drive.

944
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,080
Friends, that's www.swervingheadlights.com.

945
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,340
Before that, Lemur collages.

946
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:48,240
War is hell, my friends, but Bob brings hope and confusion.

947
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:07,440
Chaz, the conspiracy is so powerful that we don't know what year this really is.

948
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,980
And Bob could show up any second.

949
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,280
For all we know, it's July.

950
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,260
Sure, there's snow on the ground, but it might be July for all we know.

951
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,100
They might have turned everything.

952
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,800
We don't even know if this is Earth, man.

953
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,860
No, we don't even know if the polar caps are the same ones we're wearing.

954
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,320
In fact, this might, for all we know, be a hideously polluted Mars.

955
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,120
And what we call Mars is the Earth left behind.

956
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,520
No.

957
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,520
After we polluted it the first time.

958
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,080
Or they polluted it.

959
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,380
I had the same, I had a parallel thought.

960
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,340
I won't say that the parallel lines met, but I had a parallel thought

961
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:46,040
that they had gone into our brains, deep into our corpus callosum and the other pithy parts,

962
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:51,000
and they had reprogrammed everything to such a point that I was looking out my window

963
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,160
and I was on another planet and we had all been moved in our sleep.

964
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,780
Well, it wasn't us.

965
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,440
It was the powers that be.

966
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,400
The big guys, you know, the ones that weigh over 500, 600 pounds.

967
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,300
Not to mention the ones that...

968
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,380
The ones inside your own head, dude.

969
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,820
Well, they don't live in Telemetry City and they don't give me commands.

970
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,000
The ones in my head, dude.

971
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,860
Do you remember how to get to Shell Beach?

972
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,460
Yeah, it was very distinctly a Shell Beach experience.

973
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:21,260
Right, like that movie Cool City or Dark City or Dark Coolness or whatever it was.

974
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,480
Night Town.

975
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,800
Night Town, yeah.

976
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,860
Going down to Night Town.

977
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,000
Hey, but I think the big news of the week is really that Pioneer 10,

978
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,780
winked off.

979
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,960
He knows how to cue.

980
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,000
He knows.

981
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:34,940
Pioneer.

982
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,040
Pioneer 10, 28 years out there.

983
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,600
And it's out there now.

984
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:46,660
Right this very moment, there's a piece of us, book an ass, out of the solar system.

985
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,280
And it's manned by two kiboshes and a piece of pie.

986
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,140
That is science, man.

987
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:57,280
That is the expansion of our ever-lessened, ever-pubescent, lusty waves.

988
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:01,080
20,000 years from now, a robot will find it.

989
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:09,940
And sell it on eBay for billions because it will be the oldest known thing built by the extinct human race.

990
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,360
That is well said because I thought you were going to say he's going to smell it and sell it to an ape and start it all over again.

991
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,480
You know, that's how it usually starts.

992
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,560
Well, that may be how it started at one point, but I personally don't think so.

993
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,420
So many lines converging.

994
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:30,200
I think that the Yeti's force evolved the humans so that they would send that Pioneer thing out into space.

995
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,280
To smell it.

996
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,560
It smells like rotting garbage, though.

997
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,580
To the country western singers in outer space.

998
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,760
Yeah, and Johnny Paycheck died.

999
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,980
Well, we talked about that last week.

1000
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,640
Well, he actually fell asleep and nobody's been able to wake him up yet.

1001
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,180
So they threw a big old wake and they tossed him in the earth.

1002
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,420
Is this this week's show or last week's show?

1003
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,620
I don't know anymore.

1004
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,220
The tapes are confusing me.

1005
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,400
Johnny Cash's birthday was today or a week ago today?

1006
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,620
Is it January or is it Julyuary?

1007
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,760
It's one of those 70-year-old days.

1008
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,240
How old was Johnny?

1009
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,180
Your babies grow up to be couples.

1010
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,360
Mamas don't let your babies...

1011
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,840
Don't let them smoke, froth, and dress up like girls.

1012
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,640
Grow little titties and go on girls.

1013
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,920
Don't make them grow little titties.

1014
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,680
We'll try not, moms.

1015
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,480
Don't tell them not to or that's just what they'll want to do.

1016
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,680
Mamas don't let your babies go to X-Day.

1017
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,280
Don't let them have operations that change their sexes.

1018
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,060
They're so...

1019
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,300
It's a twisted, sick, demented bunch of people.

1020
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,400
Mamas, please.

1021
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,040
If you hear me, if your babies do survive the war,

1022
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,720
if they do come home from the war,

1023
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,940
don't let them go to X-Day.

1024
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,540
Because they never really come home from X-Day.

1025
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:47,900
No.

1026
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,440
They won't be babies no more.

1027
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,480
You think a war might spank their booty?

1028
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,460
X-Day is going to spank their brains out.

1029
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:57,640
This will be the sixth X-Day or what we call sixth sex day.

1030
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:58,880
Sixth.

1031
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,940
There will be some sixth sex.

1032
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:06,920
There will be 666 sick sex monkeys.

1033
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,500
Spelled sick, sick, sick with S-I-C-S-I-C-S-I-Z-S-S-S-S-S.

1034
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:17,500
Spelling out Bob with their butts mooning the sky for the satellites to read.

1035
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,180
And you'll be the quote marks on the end.

1036
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,960
I'll be the queen of procreation.

1037
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,820
Your two cheeks.

1038
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,540
I'll be the lizard woman.

1039
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,420
Pointing up at the satellites of Ashcroft.

1040
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,220
Will be the quotes on Bob's butt name.

1041
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:31,840
Attention!

1042
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:33,380
Attention!

1043
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,720
This is your beloved leader, Og the Exalted.

1044
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:46,060
There will be a special giant joy rally today at Og Memorial Stadium.

1045
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:56,500
First let me say that this trip was made possible only by our dauntless chief, Og the Magnificent.

1046
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,240
Introducer of Og Power.

1047
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,040
Which runs most of the time.

1048
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:01,740
Of our industry.

1049
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:07,540
Naturally I protected government property by making the saucer invisible.

1050
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,680
Yes, I brought the secrets back with me.

1051
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,380
And here they are.

1052
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,940
The big secret is of course oil.

1053
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,020
Which has brought a better life to all the people in the USA.

1054
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:27,220
But the key to making oil work for everybody is competition.

1055
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,140
Fellow Martians.

1056
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,200
I thank you.

1057
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:32,540
Mmm.

1058
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,680
You know what this means, Cosmic.

1059
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,020
You bet I do, Og.

1060
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,980
It means that you're through.

1061
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,260
So why don't you get lost?

1062
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:52,680
Yes, the real secret is not only a great source of energy, but also the freedom to make it

1063
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,740
work for everybody.

1064
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:58,820
And if you have both of these things, any goal is possible.

1065
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,100
It's destiny.

1066
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:02,270
Destination unlimited.

1067
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:11,090
Man continually strives to replace the old with the new.

1068
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:19,030
A quarter of a mile high skyscraper's tower with convenient rest and recreational facilities

1069
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,830
for all.

1070
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:26,710
On many of the buildings are landing decks for helicopters and auto gyros.

1071
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:30,370
The new Ford F-150 is the first of its kind.

1072
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:30,370


1073
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:30,370


1074
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:36,070
Rich in sunshine is the city of 1960.

1075
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:47,010
On all express city thoroughfares, the rights of way have been so rooted as to displace

1076
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:52,470
outmoded business sections and undesirable slum areas whenever possible.

1077
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:57,270
Somebody who had shown their nipplets.

1078
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,270


1079
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,390
Their nipplets.

1080
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,350
If you show nipples, you're a nipple.

1081
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:00,350


1082
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:02,470
Hey, wasn't there a giant bust?

1083
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:09,210
Speaking of nipples, I heard that like four days ago there was a giant crackdown on lifestyle

1084
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:09,990
shops.

1085
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:11,030
Oh yes, of course.

1086
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:17,950
All of a sudden Tommy Chong's website was an illegal terrorist act.

1087
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:22,290
Yeah, you can't buy Hembu or Peep Purse or any of those fine papers anymore.

1088
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:23,730
No, you can't get nipple clamps.

1089
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:24,730
Right.

1090
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:30,330
And the electrodes that affix to your testicles now have to be color-coded and there's a little

1091
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:34,770
like a warning that you have to sign off on or some sort of procreative gesture you have

1092
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:35,810
to make towards the wind.

1093
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:36,330
I don't know.

1094
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:36,490
It's strange.

1095
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:41,170
When will the superhero alien come and take us away?

1096
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,810
Stang, we've been waiting and waiting and...

1097
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:44,490
Me too.

1098
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:46,790
When will the rubber nade salesman come and take us away?

1099
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,590
If now wasn't a better time than any, I don't know what is.

1100
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:50,310
Yeah, really, man.

1101
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:51,990
Don't look at me.

1102
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:52,870
Well, we're trying not to.

1103
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:55,390
What do you think, I've got like a Bob's phone number or something?

1104
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:56,030
But you're right there.

1105
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,590
No, no, I'm just a PR back, man.

1106
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,030
I'm supposed to go...

1107
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:00,330
I'm supposed to go...

1108
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:00,330


1109
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:00,330


1110
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:02,190
Why, we don't know what...

1111
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:02,730
Well, we don't.

1112
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,890
We don't know what year it is and we don't know...

1113
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:05,850
I know this.

1114
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:09,770
Bob said that the X's will come July 5th, 1998.

1115
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:12,910
Obviously, it is not yet July 5th, 1998.

1116
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,690
Perhaps we'll be lucky and tomorrow will be.

1117
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:22,350
You were off by 14 years by the Mayan calendar, which is given affixed as July 5th, 2012.

1118
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:27,670
Well, a year in calendar is covered with some sort of yellowish juice.

1119
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:29,770
Mayan as opposed to urine.

1120
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:30,130
Yeah.

1121
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:30,850
Yours and mine.

1122
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:31,530
Urine and mine.

1123
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:31,690
Oh!

1124
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:32,370
Yeah.

1125
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:32,850
Oh, oh.

1126
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:35,750
You were talking about the Andean calendar of the...

1127
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:38,830
The prepubescent one.

1128
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,410
Husky people of the Andes.

1129
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:40,570
And the Maltese.

1130
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:41,330
Yes, the Husky.

1131
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:43,850
And what exactly happens at 7 a.m.?

1132
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:49,190
On 2012, a bunch of the Mayan elder gods come down from the clouds.

1133
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:50,430
On 7th of July 5th, that's what happens.

1134
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:50,710
July...

1135
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:57,550
Of the year 1998, Bob's good buddies from Planet X, who happen to be sex goddesses,

1136
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:57,890
will...

1137
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:00,410
I just feel betrayed, Sting.

1138
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:03,070
...come down or up or in from another dimension.

1139
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,430
They'll arrive at some way.

1140
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:06,330
Yeah.

1141
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:09,330
Or rather, we shall be vacated.

1142
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:16,530
We will vacate this evacuation chamber, this great latrine called Earth Farm 1, where the

1143
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:20,870
aliens have raised us in order to feed off of our anguish and pain.

1144
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:26,250
And they'll have a great dessert of those left behind in their anguish and pain.

1145
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:27,870
They especially do love the one.

1146
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:28,910
The ones were raised in their own filth, don't they?

1147
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:36,290
The slackless are punished and the deuce-paying squeaky ministers are squeaky clean and...

1148
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:37,050
Rubbed.

1149
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:37,590
Rubbed down.

1150
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:38,270
Pure of impurities.

1151
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:39,550
It's Peter the Parrot.

1152
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:39,970
Oh!

1153
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,270
Wait, the biggest thing.

1154
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:41,850
I can't believe it's Connie.

1155
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:43,130
The biggest...

1156
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:44,550
Hello, can you have Orin call home?

1157
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:45,170
No.

1158
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:46,910
Oh, Orin, please call home.

1159
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:47,610
His honey is...

1160
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:47,690
Hey.

1161
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:47,870
...is...

1162
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,110
How could we...

1163
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:50,130
I mean, yeah.

1164
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:51,370
I mean, but wait a minute.

1165
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:51,770
Hey.

1166
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:52,210
Hey.

1167
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,370
Now, come on.

1168
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:54,410
Like, dudes, like, hold on.

1169
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:55,290
Now, hey.

1170
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:56,090
Wait, everybody.

1171
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:56,310
Hey.

1172
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:57,490
Put the pipe down, man.

1173
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:57,890
Yeah.

1174
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:58,430
Hold on.

1175
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,150
Just open those eardrums.

1176
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:03,570
Mr. Rogers died.

1177
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:07,750
Once again, we have another casualty.

1178
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,370
Now, you know the real end times are near when Mr. Rogers makes his escape.

1179
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:13,910
He tried to get in that little...

1180
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:14,230
He got off.

1181
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:14,770
...little train.

1182
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:16,050
He got off, man.

1183
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:16,490
He got off.

1184
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:19,990
He tried to shrink his mind and get in the little train and take off to Smallville.

1185
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,010
That's why, you know what?

1186
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:22,530
When I heard Mr. Rogers died, I got real scared.

1187
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,390
Well, but he's with his wife.

1188
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:24,390


1189
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:25,670
He's with his grandpa now with that...

1190
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:25,770
That's because he's the implant.

1191
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:26,010
...lost.

1192
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,870
I got real scared, man, because I just know if there's no Mr. Rogers here anymore, there's

1193
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,670
nothing to keep the aliens from toasting this motherfucking place.

1194
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:33,710
Chaz, Chaz.

1195
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,830
What about the Teletubbies?

1196
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:35,690
It's the implant.

1197
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:36,110
No.

1198
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:38,550
That's why he got scared when Mr. Rogers died.

1199
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:38,730
Yeah.

1200
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:39,950
They'll be leading the charge.

1201
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,010
It's because of the micro angel.

1202
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:44,570
Once again, you guys, you don't get scared when Mr. Rogers dies.

1203
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:45,290
You feel sad.

1204
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:45,730
See?

1205
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:48,170
Look at how screwed up he is because of that implant.

1206
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:48,650
I don't feel sad.

1207
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:49,470
I'm scared as hell.

1208
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:49,670
No.

1209
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:51,630
Your implant is not even put in the right place behind your neck.

1210
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:56,290
What's going to keep George Bush from just nuking the whole earth now that Mr. Rogers

1211
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:56,830
is gone?

1212
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:00,370
Well, they used to meet regularly to discuss policy and so forth.

1213
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:04,090
No more beautiful days in neighborhood earth, boys and girls.

1214
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:10,010
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard the reports that enemy planes are approaching.

1215
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:14,670
In less than three hours, an H-bomb might fall over Portland.

1216
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:26,470
But like myself, I think you're going to be very interested in this story that we're

1217
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:27,090
going to tell you.

1218
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:33,390
And in this age of missiles and man-made moons, it takes on added significance.

1219
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:39,050
There are no actors in this story, but there are a lot of people.

1220
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:45,950
The people of the city of Portland, Oregon, and what happened to them or could happen

1221
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,610
to them on a day that we'll call X.

1222
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:51,190
Holding hands.

1223
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:51,610
Holding hands.

1224
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:51,610


1225
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:53,850
Waiting for that foghorn to blow.

1226
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:59,310
It's been three hours now and he said he was never going to come again, but I knew I'd

1227
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:00,910
just stay here and wait.

1228
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,030
I could hear the footsteps from two blocks away.

1229
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:08,190
Those big chubby feet slapping against the pavement.

1230
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:15,150
Yeah, it was W for War Bush and his buddy Sodom and Smackem Hobie.

1231
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:18,370
Yeah, they thought they had the streets sealed up.

1232
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:20,270
They thought they were clean of the bean.

1233
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:21,590
Yeah, they thought they were the wild.

1234
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:34,190
Well, so they placed the

1235
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:34,930
Whatever it may be like.

1236
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:39,810
Gonna be someone small.

1237
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:46,770
We both know there's no need for talking anymore.

1238
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:48,770
No need photo.

1239
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:51,490
Everything's going on behind the scenes.

1240
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:51,570
Perfect.

1241
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:53,010
Behind the scenes.

1242
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:55,410
Everyone knows that everyone blows.

1243
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:59,250
There's nothing going on in front.

1244
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:04,310
And there's nothing going on behind your eyes.

1245
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:08,050
But behind your back, we're doing plenty.

1246
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:11,270
For the United States Governments of America.

1247
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:12,550
Behind the curtain.

1248
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:14,590
Beyond the curtain.

1249
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,570
You, the representations of people we representative.

1250
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,790
We would like to know that we are not sham.

1251
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:23,310
We are not focused and smoky.

1252
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:26,950
We are real and we represent your representations.

1253
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:30,510
We're behind each and every one of you Americans.

1254
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:34,530
Whispering funny things in the back of your neck.

1255
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:39,430
I don't know if I'm going to be able to pay my bills.

1256
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:41,510
No, I can't pay anything.

1257
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:46,330
Sometimes I just wish I could take a car and go out and shoot a goddamn partner.

1258
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,330
Too many visions, man.

1259
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:51,090
Too many dreams.

1260
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:55,670
I saw the mushroom cloud again last night and it wasn't in my suit, man.

1261
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:58,390
It was in my ears and my eyes.

1262
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,130
Everybody is watching.

1263
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:04,350
Go down, man.

1264
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:06,230
Like the walls of Jalecho.

1265
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:10,890
Just let me love.

1266
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:19,350
Now, wait for the command.

1267
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:23,190
Alien Love.

1268
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:30,030
Alien Love.

1269
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:34,210
Friends, you are listening to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

1270
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:35,030
Here's our address.

1271
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:35,850
Got that pencil ready?

1272
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:44,210
P.O. Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1273
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,690
That's where you send things.

1274
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:48,150
To me.

1275
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:49,130
To play.

1276
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:54,510
The show, the Hour of Slack, is the voice of the church of the subgenius.

1277
00:57:54,570 --> 00:58:01,710
More about that at www.subgenius.com, which includes a catalog of books and other things.

1278
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:02,410
Friends.

1279
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:07,690
Why don't you come on over to my joint?

1280
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:10,750
Why don't you stink up my joint the way you stink up my...

1281
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:11,110
Okay.

1282
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,650
Back to the first one.

1283
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:16,370
None of this made any sense at all.

1284
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:16,890
How are you?

1285
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:17,190
How are you?

1286
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:18,390
There was no connective tissue.

1287
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:20,110
There wasn't one.

1288
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:21,090
Pioneer.

1289
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,710
Fire turned off.

1290
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:24,630
Mr. Rogers tuned out.

1291
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:25,550
Good afternoon.

1292
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:26,370
We may have...

1293
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:27,130
He got off.

1294
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:28,230
Well, yeah.

1295
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,930
He's aboard that ship now.

1296
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:31,610
He was being the board.

1297
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:33,990
I think our jobs are cut out for us.

1298
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:36,470
It's time for us now to build our own ships.

1299
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,850
To meet Bob halfway, perhaps.

1300
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,870
Our ships are cardboard cutouts.

1301
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:41,850
Bob beckons.

1302
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:45,190
The men from Planet X are beckoning to us.

1303
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,330
They're saying, lift.

1304
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:49,350
Just pull yourself up by your own boob straps.

1305
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:50,770
You boots.

1306
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:52,650
You silly platoons.

1307
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:53,590
The beckoning.

1308
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:53,990
Pull yourself.

1309
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:54,850
Yank yourself.

1310
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:56,650
Lift yourself up by your own straps.

1311
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:56,670
Yank.

1312
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:57,030
Yank.

1313
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:57,930
Wank.

1314
00:58:58,370 --> 00:58:59,450
Wank for Bob.

1315
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:01,010
Wank for Bob.

1316
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:03,770
Wank as if your very life's depending on it.

1317
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,210
What the hell?

1318
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:06,630
It's a knife, I tell you.

1319
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:08,850
Hey, you've been listening to ESO Radio.

1320
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:09,830
Swamp Radio.

1321
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:10,750
My name's Chaz.

1322
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:11,770
Once a cowboy Dave.

1323
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:13,270
Princess We are Doe.

1324
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:14,770
The Reverend Ivan Stang.

1325
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:15,350
Wank.

1326
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:15,990
Wank.

1327
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:16,790
Wank.

1328
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:18,210
Wank.

1329
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:22,890
This is the radio voice of the Wilson State University.

1330
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:26,270
Till next week, keep your hat on tight.

1331
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:29,770
You back to the wind and your sack in the saddle.

1332
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:31,810
The sack of Princess We.

1333
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:33,310
Wank.

1334
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:34,470
You wanker.

1335
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,710
Wank your wankers as if your life is dust.

1336
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,010
Your life's your very life.

1337
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:38,390
Wank.

1338
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:38,810
Wank.

1339
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:39,070
Wank.

1340
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:40,330
Wank.

1341
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:42,830
Wank.

1342
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:43,630
Wank.

1343
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:43,630


1344
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:43,630


1345
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:43,730
Wank.

1346
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:43,730


1347
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:43,750
Wank.

1348
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:43,930
Wank.

1349
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:43,970
Wank.

1350
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:43,970


1351
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:43,970


1352
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:44,110
Wank.

1353
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:44,110


1354
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:44,350
Wank.

1355
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:45,310
Wank.

1356
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:45,330


1357
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:45,330


1358
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:45,330


1359
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:45,330


1360
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:45,330


1361
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:47,350
Wank.

1362
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:47,530
Wank.

1363
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:47,750
Wank.

1364
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:49,810
Wank.
