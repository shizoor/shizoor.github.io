Give me that old time religion. Give me that old time religion. Don't give me a subgenius. I rate a slap.
Right, that sounds very charming, very charming. Uh-huh. And of course it's got to be really elegant.
No, ma'am, then I suggest you get your money back and go home. Okay. Okay? Bye-bye.
Hello.
This is not a rerun. It's not even made of old subgenius radio parts, mostly.
It is instead subgenius barrage number three by that weird, weird man in Cleveland who calls himself Sheridan.
Sheridan, Sheridan, where do you roam?
And boy, you should see some of the cool stuff he sends me, like old Playboys, real old ones, maybe used ones.
Anyway, he sure saved me some work this week. I'm supposed to be getting ready to leave the planet in two weeks on July 5th.
And on top of that, I spent yesterday unexpectedly in the hospital with a severe allergic reaction to a water.
I'm going to be getting a little bit of a
And usually when we find them in the house, we free them. We trap them and then set them free outdoors.
But yesterday, I guess it was...
I had that one last sting that triggered a real allergy that had been built up.
I swole up like a super itchy toady frog, and they had to give me shots.
Now, it's true that we were discussing spraying that wasp nest that very morning, and maybe they overheard me.
Anyway, thanks to Sheridan for this well-timed...
Toil saving change of pace.
As follows.
Testing 1, 2, 3.
God, I hope they don't play this for a long while.
Background 90.
The hour is constructed from an extraordinary collection of conversations recorded long ago.
Background 90.
Nobody loves me like I do.
Nobody loves me like I do.
For half a century, these recordings have lain unheard.
Historians have quoted from the transcripts, but now for the first time, we can hear these
intimate stories in the voices of those who told them.
Don't you feel responsible for trying to help this endangered planet?
No?
Good.
The fact is, it's too late.
There isn't a goddamn thing you as an individual can do about eco-disaster, nuclear death,
overpopulation, and so on.
Things are going to hell on a fly.
The only thing you or anyone else besides the Rockefellers can do about it is to just
sit back and watch the show.
But remember, the end of the world may be much worse and take much longer than you thought.
Welcome back.
Thank you for listening to WWI10.
In Green Bay, Ohio.
What's with you now?
GM Radio.
We just heard Bible Cactus with shrimp on the barbed wire.
Before that was Muddy Water River Puppies with Untitled Number 2.
We started out that set with the experience.
We're going to have a very extended dance mix of Our Credit by the Mount Holies.
Now, this update.
Hi, I'm Shauna Zurbuch filling in for Grinnell the Pumper with this news.
Thousands of upwardly mobile unemployed professionals have gathered for eight straight days to help

to protest prisons as a place they didn't want to be in as opposed to carrying their resume
looking for a job.
In China, nine people were killed as the enormous hole they were standing in suddenly filled
with discarded flip phones and foam beer can holders.
I'm sorry.
The forecast tonight.
Inky shadows.
Tomorrow raining cats and boots and cats and boots and cats and boots and back to you,
buddy.
Stop calling me that, Shauna.
My name is Raphael.
Support for this hour of What's With You Now is provided by the National Institute for

Consider briefly
the story of human civilization on Earth.
It tells of the ingenuity,
elegance, generous and nurturing
nature of a species that is also
self-focused, vulnerable and defiantly
intelligent.
People, sheep, and horses.
All passed out.
Children are prone.
They urgently need this new
source of skill and toughness.

loud and bright.
I'm going to sign a draft

I said, there's no need for you to be so modest.
He found rather the most sweet, but really the weirdest dreams to rampage in life.
Stand up for your own abnormality!
Ah, the way of life continues.
But this man is not a human being, no.
He's the one true living, the black master.
It's a spiritual know-how to help you dash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.
He is the one real shortcut to slack.
For all we know, when said as a spirit, means the sum total of knowledge.
But when said another way, for all we know, things that we do not know at all.
This is the beautiful, fragile drama of civilization.
We are the actors and spectators of a cosmic play that means the word to us here, but means nothing anywhere else.
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.
They look like what you expect of pharmaceutical drugs.
They look like carbon atoms and some other things stuck on there.
They look like these big, complex molecules.
And you're like, oh yeah, I'm complex. My brain's complex.
It takes a complicated thing to change it.
You must make a decision.
A cupcake.
Just pretend some mood.
You must make the decision.
A cupcake.
This is not a rerun.
Do they know why it works in the brain? Like, do they know what it does?
Well, essentially, no.
And join the Church of the Subgenius.
In a country where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution, anything is likely to develop.
Enter the Church of the Subgenius, billing itself as the weirdest cult on earth.
What do they believe in? Everything.
Who do they believe in? A mysterious character named Bob.
Bob is the culmination of that to which man has aspired throughout his long and slackless history.
Bob is what will bring slack to planet Earth.
And to you, young man.
There is actually only one point in the entire cosmos that is present in all constellations of stars.
And that presence is here, planet Earth.
Those pictures we have made up for the clusters of stars only make sense from this point of view down here.
Their stories only make sense here on Earth.
And only something to us.
We are creatures of stories.
We are the stories we tell.
We're the stories we're told.
We're the stories we're told.
You're in the bathroom, taking care of business after another Taco Tuesday.
The lighter in your back pocket falls into the toilet, mixing in with your new deposit.
You're not going in after it.
And you can't leave.
You're the only one in the building.
It's late at night, and you're the late night security guard.
If you walk across the street to buy a new lighter, that would be the first time an intruder actually talks.


And you'd be the first one to be able to get in.
And only the cameras would be watching.
You love this job.
Reading comic books and mad magazines all night long.
Occasionally glancing at the monitors to earn your pay.
You'd hate to be a ghost.

You'd hate to lose this gig for a stinking lighter.
But there aren't many options.
You can't light a cigarette with the cafeteria microwave.
And you can't rummage through everyone's desk looking for a dry, clean lighter.
After all, you're a camera.
So you decide.
Screw it.
Dump the rest of your smokes in the toilet and lush.
It takes two before it all goes down.
Fecal matter, cigarettes, and lighter.
You wish you had a pen.
A pack of matches to drive away the stink.
Foiled again.
But that's okay.
You can tough it out.
Go without smoking till the end of your shift.
There's food, but everything in the fridge has hair growing out of it.
You eat an entire family size.
A family size bag of cheese corn.
A couple donut sticks.
A whole apple pie.
And an extension cord with hot sauce.
Just realize.
A cigarette after eating is part of your routine.
And coffee and cigarettes are just so good together.
It's only been a half hour and you're already jonesing for nicotine.
You look at the monitors.
You're still the only one in the building.
Should you risk it?
Screw it.
Anyone with a gun can get a security job.
You carve eye-quit into the wooden security desk.
Lock the front door behind you and wait to cross the street.
You've gotta have a smoke.
A Domino's delivery car passes by.
And it occurs to you that you could have ordered a pizza.
With a side of a cigarette lighter.
A fast bowling.
A
bag of wax and paper.
A
ring of hope.
You feel a train of air.
And a
good nine-and-a-instant menu.
And the quiz,
I guess it's always spelled bad.


I remember reading about the door-to-door, house-to-house, town-to-town campaign that the whole family put on.
When we return, I remember flying with him in the middle of that.
When I first met him, I thought he was one of the smartest, quickest, funniest human beings I'd ever met.
I always thought he was absolutely best in private.
He had a tremendous capacity to involve you, interest you.
You wanted to tell him everything.
At the time, journalists either didn't know or chose to look the other way.
The secrets remained secret.
No.
Now, compare with that, a dinner at the White House at which you were served very good drinks first.
There were ashtrays everywhere, just inviting you to poison yourself with cigarettes.
And the moment comes, and these two ravishing people appear in the doorway.
You are then brought into dinner, and dinner turns out not to be at a horseshoe table,
but at many little tables seating about ten people apiece, with fires roaring in all the fireplaces,
so that it's all...
All like having dinner with friends.
The food is marvelous, the wines are delicious.
People are laughing, laughing out loud, telling stories and jokes, enjoying themselves, glad to be there.
I've never seen so many happy artists in my life.
It was like a different world.
On this planet, there are people.
Looking up, and by drawing lines between the lights in the sky, we've attempted to make sense out of chaos.
Looking down, we've drawn lines between the lights in the sky, we've attempted to make sense out of chaos.
We've drawn lines across the land to know where we belong, and where we don't.
We do mostly forget that these lines that connect the stars, and those lines that divide the land, live only in our heads.
They, too, are stories.
We carry out our everyday routines and rituals according to the stories we most believe in, and these days, the story is changing as we write it.

We've just heard autistic mime with juggling verbs in a crime novel.
From the LP, Don't Introduce Yourself.
We started out that set with an extremely long version of Messing.
We've just heard autistic mime with a kid by Jules Magoo and the Nickel Tippers, featuring old gay black Muslim on congos, bazookas, and gesundheit.
Now, this news update.
I'm Grinnell the Pumper with this news.
During the flood, at the conclusion of rescuing 14 family members...
members from one house, the fire chief was overheard saying,
stop screwing people.
AC and water beds be damned.
Fire chief Hang Dog was later quoted as saying, good thing
they didn't have pets, or I would have dropped that last
screaming nut and saved the dog.
Investigations continue and hors d'oeuvres at 11.
In France, the economy has stalled as Parliament again fails to establish
an acceptable voting age for refugee bagel makers.

Disgusting to look at, smells funny, squishes in the spoon,
feels strange in the mouth, and tastes like pigeon bile on a bald tire.
But kiss Cottage Cheese.
You like it, you eat it.
And be sure to tune in tonight for an exclusive interview with the new hit band Gay Boyle
Gastropod, who will be performing on a special platform composed of a giant slice of toasted
Schwebel's bread.
Now, a look at our roads.
Well, it looks like they're in bad need of repair.
Some of these holes could swallow a Panzer tank.
Use caution, folks.
Thanks, Tony.
And don't forget to tune in to our special show about Alzheimer's tonight at

Tonight.
Counting down the top three chart toppers, we have number three, raised castings and
spare tires with lug thugs.
Number two, Bissell smoke in the cardiac rug stains with you left my toothbrush where?
And coming in at number one for the second straight day on three planets, decorative ears
and the death landscape doing their cover version of Tommy, can you hear me?
Well, that's all we have time for until we have more time.
So until next time, keep on smoking.
Keep ticking.
You're the bomb.
We'd like to thank Shauna Zurbach, who filled in for Drenel the pumper last week as she
was at the doctor for another round of tests and pokes and tests and pokes and tests and
pokes.
And I'm Raphael Slickerhoots signing checks and signing out.















But first, we have a weather update from that crazy manicure lady at the tattoo shop.
Stay inside, people.
Just stay inside.
Ah, there you go.
Yeah, for sure.
God, I hope they don't play this for a long, long time.
Do you want this job?
He said, I thought I had a pretty good thing going on.







I was lying up till this morning.
Still reeling from these two back to back humiliations.
Okay, kid.
This wouldn't be a great way to do that on Earth, but it's really a very efficient way
to do it.
And I'm sorry.






And you just have to not be nonplussed about that.
You just have to say, well, you go into something else or you don't, you know, you can't dwell
on, hey, I don't, you know, what you're doing isn't doing anything for me.
And she just sort of skipped across the room and looked lighter.
The burden was lifted because you told her it was okay to be different.
So I'm just, hey, I don't know what you're doing over there, Mr. Drummond, but it ain't
doing nothing for me.
And she said, I don't know what you're doing over there, Mr. Drummond, but it ain't doing
anything for me.
And I'm like, well, you're just so stupid.

She just sort of skipped across the room and looked lighter.
The burden was lifted because you told her it was okay to be different.
Nothing.
The chances of being here aren't infinite, yet here we are, perilous and wrong.
There have never been more people living on Earth, using worse stuff.
And it's become obvious that many of the old systems we invented for ourselves are obsolete.
And we have to build new ones.
I think we have a lot to learn and try to learn from each other.





They don't need much to live on, just a constant supply of mindless entertainment and food.
And then in 1995, another quite decisive turn for me was an invitation to go to Zambia
and to see what this experience and these lessons might mean for Africa.
One thing the channel didn't care very much about, obviously, was news.
Consider briefly the story of human civilization on Earth.
It tells of the ingenuity, elegance, generous and nurturing nature of a species
that is also self-focused, vulnerable and defiantly protective.
We the people shield the flame of our existence from the raw and vast elements outside our control, the great beyond.
Yet it is always to the flame we look.
How much longer?
How much longer must this circus continue?
How much longer must this circus continue?
How much longer must this circus continue?
I don't care how pissed off you get.
I will take your point and blunt it so that even you won't know what you said.
Did you have something to say?
Did I interrupt?
My pleasure.
Just remember to praise Bob, friends, and you'll be okay.
Praise that mighty man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.
He's out there slacking off for you, for your slack.
Because, you know, you can't spread slack unless, wise, you got some slack yourself.
And that's the truth.
That's a God's truth.
He didn't work for you.
He hired at the job and would have been an unbelievable figure if you were cast in the role of a young man of destiny.
Drown into the joy of thy Lord.
And no one has ever met Bob.
The leader of our church, no one has ever met.
Because, as you know, all cults, their leaders are usually pretty hard to find.
And Bob is no exception.
He was an easy fellow to meet.
Had no reserve at all about him.
He had a great sense of humor and it stuck out in front of him.
So far, you couldn't...
You wouldn't miss it.
When I first met him, I thought he was one of the smartest, quickest, funniest human beings I ever met.
After relaxing on the lake, Bob's wed you to have a great time entertaining his friends.
Right, Bob?
Bob?
Bob?
I am saying everything.
If you're so smart, why aren't you?
I always thought he was absolutely best in private.
He had a tremendous capacity to involve you, interest you.
You wanted to tell him everything.
I do as I say, mother.
This steady awareness of the irrelevance of the thing that you really couldn't do.
When critical quality was a nearly preternatural self-confidence.
I think one clear element in it was simply the number of times that he had accomplished things that people said could not be accomplished.
So that no was a word he was used to hearing and used to disproving.
This steady awareness of the irrelevance of the thing that you really couldn't do.
Old Bob would sell just about anything to just about anybody.
What's he sold you today?
This steady awareness of the irrelevance of the thing that you really couldn't do.
A cupcake.
A cupcake.
A cupcake.
A cupcake.
I don't want to be caught short in a gray vinyl suit when the lid blows off.
In this kind of world, a good life is a balanced and a virtuous life, not a single-minded pursuit of income.
Friends, what are you people waiting for?
Did you know that for less than 10 cents a day,
for a year,
that's less than one thin dime every day for one year,
you too can have eternal salvation or triple your money back.
Nothing else to buy.
No need for periodic renewals.
You are saved forever.
Yes, for a one-time donation of a measly
mom
could change any minute.
At subgenius.com, you will be saved.
Even better, there's no need to repent any sins.
Or transgressions.
As a member of the Church of the Subgenius,
you'll be issued your very own official, defined, all-inclusive excuse.
And friends, it's a big document.
Fancy-looking.
Poster-sized.
So why wait?
Hurry to subgenius.com and save yourself today.
And it's a kind of dignity which doesn't usually merge with that much.
It's a kind of much casualness and friendliness.
Still reeling from these two back-to-back humiliations?
Let me out!
Let me out of here!
You can't keep me in here!
Let me out of here!
Let me out!
You can't keep me in here!
You can't keep me in here!
I'll take you to the police!
Now, compare with that.
A dinner at the White House at which you were served very good drinks first.
There were ashtrays everywhere.
Just inviting you to poison yourself with cigarettes.
Anyway, friends.
Um...
And now this.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Good evening, James.
Just a minute.
We came with a lady.
Oh, pardon.
Quite a shack this Bixby joint.
Yeah, it reminds me of the reform school.
Ah, there you go.
Yeah, for sure.
When we return...
I remember flying with him in the middle of that...
When we return...

You always want more, don't you?
Can't have it all.
But she wants to have a little more.
And she can't say no.
But of course she says she's got to have more.
But I've got to have more.
So I don't know where to get you.
Yeah, bro.
And now I'm going to get some more.
I've got to get you on support.
And I want to get you on support.
We never really knew how different life was
until it was over.
More slack for some subgenius brains is
slightly less miserable for a short period of time.
Some subgenius brains don't even get that, friend,
and they don't get it even once.
You've suffered this far.
You can keep suffering.
You can keep suffering longer.
But maybe not only suffer.
All right.
I need a little bass.
Jared?
Well, that was a good one.
You know that one.
Hey!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Hey!
Hey!


Or you can kiss your sweet assurance of sanity goodbye.

So shut up and listen.
Listen and look for yourself.
You don't even need us to translate the handwriting on the walls.
What's going on is very grotesquely obvious
to even the most subjugated idiots.

Thank you, Sheridan, for providing that subgenius barrage.
That's the third one he sent.
There's a fourth one here also, and he says there are two more on the way.
I think he's having fun editing these.
It was really fun for me the first 35 years.
Uh, anyway, friends, it's not too late to be saved and board the saucers rather than fry in hell on earth.
And the only thing you need to know about how to do that is subgenius.com.
