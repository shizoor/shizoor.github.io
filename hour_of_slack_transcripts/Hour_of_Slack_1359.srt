1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
What's the name of this place?

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,180
The Self Genius.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,080
Watch now.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,300
I have absolutely heard of that place.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,800
Sounds like a school for Neanderthals.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,920
No, it's actually considered the Harvard of kindergartens.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,660
I wish it would work.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,680
Oh dear.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm watching woodwork.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,300
How are you doing?

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,980
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,620
The earth tremors are strong here,

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,880
and the building seems to be settling.

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,560
That crashing and vibrating you here

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,940
is a result of nature's transient phenomena.

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,100
Thanks for your help.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:45,980
Yes.

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,340
So don't worry.

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,180
We're all perfectly safe in that grotesque grinding

20
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,920
is simply an epiphenomenon,

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,240
a byproduct, if you will,

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,340
of the...

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,760
the speed and celerity of industry.

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,380
Ivan Stang is taking a break

25
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,340
in the excrementation chamber,

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,320
and we're taking it easy here,

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,220
as only a subgenius can do.

28
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,860
I heard he was pyroflagellating in that chamber.

29
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,620
He's welcome to be as creative as he wants,

30
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,160
because that's what it's all about,

31
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,180
the search for slack.

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,220
He asked me for some wooden matches.

33
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,440
And wouldn't you know it,

34
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,280
you had them.

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,060
He could pyroflagellate so much better.

36
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,780
Leaving me with a bag of shit to hold.

37
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,440
Maybe you should think harder

38
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,140
about trafficking in fucking junk.

39
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,900
I'm a purveyor of spirits,

40
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,480
I dope fucking included,

41
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,340
and when chance affords, a thief.

42
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,220
But I ain't no fucking hypocrite.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,100
There is a light off on the board

44
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,980
for microphone number two.

45
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,120
So after all that disruption and fussing,

46
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,020
we still don't have three mics.

47
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,040
No, there's one explanation.

48
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,240
And what might that be?

49
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,740
If a menstruating woman enters the radio studio,

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,520
one of the mics will break.

51
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,760
Well, and that happened sometime

52
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,780
while my back was turned.

53
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,680
Now, we don't want to have to kick you out of the sweat lodge.

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,260
Don't look at me, she says.

55
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,260
Well, we could put her on the ducking stool

56
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,240
and see whether or not she loves God.

57
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,200
No, this one is not working.

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,420
It's that one you're hearing me through, huh?

59
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,640
I believe so, because there is another thing

60
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,420
that they were completely talking about.

61
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:35,060
And that was that the mixing board is stuck

62
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,160
and some things won't turn on,

63
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,300
like the submixer, which doubles as microphone number three.

64
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,500
The instructions at my radio station

65
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,940
and the other one that you guys go to sometimes

66
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,900
say not to whine about the equipment.

67
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,480
I know, I don't like to do it.

68
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,740
You're breaking the rules of many professional radio stations.

69
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,560
I realize that.

70
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,960
I'm not the one who wants to talk about it.

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,380
I'm not the one who wants to talk about it.

72
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,360
I'm not attempting to dismiss this subject.

73
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,620
But I have to say that...

74
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,160
I'm enjoying it because I'm forbidden to most of the time.

75
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,320
You can do whatever you want.

76
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,080
We're back to the way it was.

77
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,760
It's going to have to be that way.

78
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,900
That is the truth that we have to live with.

79
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,920
I just want to cry like a little baby.

80
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,900
I will bend like a reed in the wind.

81
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,560
Maintain your flexibility.

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,320
That's what comes my way.

83
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,720
I will play my flute.

84
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,140
I will prefer some things above others to come my way.

85
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,140
My flute of tranquility.

86
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,780
Tranquility.

87
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,360
That's not one of the things I was hoping for.

88
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,520
What, that flute?

89
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,440
Philo's flute of tranquility.

90
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,820
I will play my skin flute of tranquility.

91
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,900
Yes, it's tranquility for you.

92
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,780
A grown man.

93
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,740
Terrible embarrassment for witnesses.

94
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:42,980
Truly.

95
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,660
These witnesses may have something to say.

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,260
I saw a beaver today at this...

97
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,300
What was the name of that...

98
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,220
Well, we probably shouldn't plug a restaurant,

99
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,280
but it was up in that town.

100
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,880
We can do anything we want.

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,320
This is pirate radio.

102
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,880
Yeah, we can do what rules, man.

103
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,540
There's no rules.

104
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,640
It was Creek Monkey Cafe.

105
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,920
Yeah, Creek Monkey.

106
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,300
And they really did have...

107
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,720
They were on the edge of a creek,

108
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,580
and there were beaver dams.

109
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,880
They had their own beers there.

110
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,480
They have beaver dams outside the restaurant.

111
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,960
You can step out on the back porch.

112
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,540
Watch the beavers frolicking and killing and maiming.

113
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,980
They don't do that.

114
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,280
No, they just frolic.

115
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,060
You're just exaggerating.

116
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,680
They busily carve up the neighbor's trees

117
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,800
and make their little huts and dams.

118
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,200
Now, it's true.

119
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:27,860
They may have...

120
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,800
They may have to fell a forest giant

121
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,240
in order to make one of their artfully constructed dams.

122
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,740
Sometimes they have to undercut a, you know,

123
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,480
a restaurant's foundation so that it falls into the river.

124
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,580
You know, I just finished publicly whining

125
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,720
about Robert Anton Wilson being resistant to miking.

126
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,820
I'm not resistant.

127
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,160
I just didn't want to...

128
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,040
And that was...

129
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,700
My peas.

130
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,820
And that was part of a...

131
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:54,980
Huh?

132
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,620
Eh?

133
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,000
What?

134
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,420
The...

135
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,700
We are, of course, once again,

136
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,360
making a delightful smorgasbord of sound effects

137
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,100
for your pleasure back home.

138
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,680
Ah, yes.

139
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,420
But we generally don't try to strike the microphone stand

140
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,700
or move it or make loud sounds

141
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,440
that are conducted into the microphone.

142
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,620
It was a necessary sound effect, Dr. Halpern.

143
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,260
I know it is.

144
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:22,960
And I...

145
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,640
Philo's disobeying me.

146
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,880
I just want our...

147
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,360
And his contrariness.

148
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,400
Our listening audience...

149
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,420
But look, it's almost touching, Dr. Hal.

150
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,560
...to appreciate how wonderful it is.

151
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,900
And believe me, we have this incredible, technical...

152
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,300
It's pointed.

153
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,220
...complicated matter under...

154
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,140
It's pointed strategically at Dr. Hal.

155
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,860
Just look at this giant board with its blinking lights

156
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,920
and flashing switches.

157
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,760
It looks like a Christmas tree.

158
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,860
We are totally mastering this intensely complex scientific equipment.

159
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:48,640
Yes.

160
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,660
That tree's lit up like a Christmas board.

161
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,760
Board and man are one.

162
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,560
How effortlessly we pilot the ship of radio,

163
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,660
all kidding around and making goofy sound effects aside.

164
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,340
Because what we have here assembled are masters of radio

165
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,560
who have been doing it for years and years

166
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,280
and actually laugh to scorn all foolish amateurism of the airwaves.

167
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,260
Gentlemen...

168
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:12,820
That's so true.

169
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,700
...to your health.

170
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,620
So true, Dr. Hal.

171
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,620
Thank you, thank you.

172
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,700
We're between Los Cruces and Deming

173
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,380
and we're heading for a place called City of Rocks.

174
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,540
And this is...

175
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,200
This is the Chihuahuan Desert.

176
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,020
We'll soon be approaching the Sonoran Desert.

177
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,540
But this is the Chihuahuan Desert.

178
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,520
And it's so named because behind every single one of those bushes

179
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,280
and yucca scrub things out there and tumbleweeds,

180
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,580
there lurks a Chihuahua.

181
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,740
Now you told me it was because of the...

182
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,240
because there were Chihuahua-sized tarantulas in there.

183
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,740
No, there's also Chihuahua-sized tarantulas.

184
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,240
Otherwise, this whole country would be overrun with Chihuahuas.

185
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,360
And these are not the kind of Chihuahuas that you make into pets.

186
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,280
They're bloodthirsty, nipping Chihuahuas

187
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,640
that jump up onto your face and nip your eyes out.

188
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,380
And then they...

189
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,340
When you're blind and helpless, then they go for your throat.

190
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,700
Oh!

191
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,620
And they make you bleed to death.

192
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,700
They nip your artery, your throat arteries,

193
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,680
as you try to get them off.

194
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,160
But, you know, two or three of them will jump on you at once.

195
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,700
And then you, you know, you bleed to death real quick.

196
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,400
And then they...

197
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,960
All the Chihuahuas come and fight over your parts.

198
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,700
They like the soft parts best.

199
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,740
And they're real fast at pulling things like blue jeans and coats off of people.

200
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,440
You know how Chihuahuas are.

201
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,600
They're really mean and fast.

202
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,300
Yeah.

203
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,760
If there's a gas station up there, we ought to stop.

204
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,720
We must stop.

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,240
Because out in the Chihuahuan desert,

206
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,940
you don't want to end up stranded by the side of the road

207
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,580
because that's just what the Chihuahuas are waiting for.

208
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,840
They're small, but they're really, really mean.

209
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,820
It's also known as phylo-leg-breaking land.

210
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,620
Yeah, it's definitely...

211
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,560
Well, not leg-breaking.

212
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,780
No, that was mortarian.

213
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,620
ACL-terrifying.

214
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,120
Mortisorexit.

215
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,820
Mortier.

216
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,760
Ripped his ACL.

217
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,640
Oratule tissue.

218
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,140
Legs got aces.

219
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,100
Popped his leg back in a direction it wasn't supposed to go in.

220
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,200
And that's the place for it, folks.

221
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,960
I just spent...

222
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
Oh, in fact, here I...

223
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,380
I just spent some more time in a similar place.

224
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,040
But you know what?

225
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,700
The rocks were not as hairy, you know, with little rock salts that grip your flesh wide open.

226
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,240
The rock salt?

227
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,680
The rock that wants you to spray your ankle wasn't there?

228
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,100
Yeah, it didn't grip like that.

229
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,300
It's much more extruded.

230
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,820
And we were near a thing called Hercules.

231
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,200
Hercules' finger.

232
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,620
I don't find that for a thing.

233
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,440
Hercules...

234
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,880
Oh, you'll see.

235
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,620
They have Hercules' finger?

236
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,080
Not to be confused with the devil's finger.

237
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,040
No.

238
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,560
Or Thor's hammer.

239
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:00,700
Or Thor's hammer.

240
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,000
Satan's toe bone.

241
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,780
Hercules, that doesn't look like his finger.

242
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,320
National Monument.

243
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,700
No offense, but that...

244
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,160
Yeah, it is not his...

245
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,680
That don't look like no finger to me.

246
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,620
It's not his finger that comes to mind.

247
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,020
That's not...

248
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,760
Well, City of Rocks looks a lot...

249
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,260
But who's gonna give anyone...

250
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,340
In near-demming New Mexico, looks a lot like that.

251
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,220
It's a series of gigantic phallic symbols.

252
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,000
I just don't understand.

253
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,940
This is like Godzilla's weenie.

254
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:20,900
Yep.

255
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,640
What?

256
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,900
That's not a dog sleeping in a rock.

257
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,920
I'm gonna have to take a short break here.

258
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,420
I'll be back in a few minutes.

259
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,480
A kind of a dachshund because the weening...

260
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,040
This is the best part of the show.

261
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,060
These dogs take quite a long time.

262
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,640
When Phyla takes a break for a few minutes.

263
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,540
And that is why the dachshund is known as a long weener.

264
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,240
What?

265
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,380
Never mind.

266
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,420
I retract.

267
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,440
I take it back.

268
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:45,980
He's talking about...

269
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,060
Nope.

270
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,840
First off, the ankle-spraining rock.

271
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,580
The rock is a rock.

272
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:51,580


273
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:51,600
The rock is a rock.

274
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:51,600


275
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:51,620
The rock is a rock.

276
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:51,620


277
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:51,620


278
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:51,620


279
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:51,620


280
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,520
It can be invisible.

281
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,720
Sometimes it's like...

282
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,720
It was right along there hiding, trying to catch me.

283
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:02,580
Anyway, this is the City of Rocks near Demet, New Mexico.

284
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,580
It's this very, very strange area made of volcanic tuff.

285
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,900
Remember volcanic tuff?

286
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:19,480
About 35 million years ago, a volcano exploded here and pumice rained down all over the place.

287
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,620
And then more crap came down.

288
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:21,620


289
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,260
And then more crap came out and spewed all over that.

290
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,400
And the pumice was compressed and became tuff.

291
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
T-U-F.

292
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,100
Tuff.

293
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,400
Tuff.

294
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:30,900
That...

295
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,980
It's soft.

296
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,220
It then cracked as it cooled.

297
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:45,380
And those cracks in the tuff were enough to allow rainwater, wind, and God only knows

298
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:51,340
what else, to slowly separate parts of it into, you know, a...

299
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:51,620
A...

300
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,460
A deeper and deeper little areas.

301
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:02,240
And wind and rain erosion turned it into this amazing situation we have here.

302
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,840
Somebody is definitely fucking with us.

303
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,820
How'd that rock get up there?

304
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,860
Some of this tuff is pretty tough here on the trail.

305
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,440
We're pretty sure we're on the trail this time.

306
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,900
I think anything can be the trail though.

307
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,940
And around each bend, there lies...

308
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,180
Slack.

309
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,580
Uh, Slack in the case of this particular bend being a piece of music we're about to share.

310
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,780
Sorry we neglected to actually describe the city of rocks in all those location recordings

311
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,540
and Ask Dr. Howland Puzzling Evidence shows.

312
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,560
That'll be coming up after a review.

313
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,380
And we'll be back with a refreshing change of noise.

314
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,200
Although we did indeed, as promised, get our photos heavily edited and online.

315
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,560
And the easiest way for me to tell you how to see them is to go to subgenius.com, click

316
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,740
on News, and then go to my blog, Reverend Ivan Stang.

317
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,160
Also, the events page has a link under the X Day promos.

318
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,540
Meanwhile, Reverend Tater turned us on to this upcoming piece of music by the name of

319
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:26,440
Carlos Serafina from the Detovelvulation Project called 13 Miles, which Tater calls,

320
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,640
Out of Tune in a Good Way.

321
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,520
And boy, is he not kidding.

322
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,080
Inехan justamente sufficient as sure an education moving,

323
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:04,700
but also that he ought to TortL s su hace fer they ensure and object

324
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:04,700


325
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:04,700


326
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,520
major

327
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:18,520


328
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:18,520


329
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,740
Thank you.

330
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,260
Thank you.

331
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,360
Thank you.

332
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,240
Thank you.

333
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:25,920
Thank you.

334
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,600
Thank you.

335
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,380
Thank you.

336
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,820
Thank you.

337
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,860
Thank you.

338
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,640
Thank you.

339
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,160
Thank you.

340
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,780
Thank you.

341
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,280
Thank you.

342
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,940
Thank you.

343
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,400
Thank you.

344
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,860
Thank you.

345
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,220
Thank you.

346
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,100
Thank you.

347
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,460
Thank you.

348
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,600
Thank you.

349
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,560
You don't know where

350
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,860
I'm going to hide your balls.

351
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,680
But the music will tell you.

352
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,920
Now, first of all,

353
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,420
shut your eyes while I hide them.

354
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,180
Yes. Shut your eyes.

355
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,660
Now,

356
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,020
open your eyes

357
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,960
and dance

358
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,880
lightly about looking everywhere

359
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,660
for your balls.

360
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,020
And now the music's going to tell you where your balls are.

361
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,700
They may be high up so that you have to stretch and jump up for them,

362
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,060
or they may be low down so that you have to pick them up off the floor.

363
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:35,800
Listen.

364
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,640
Well, were your balls high up or low down?

365
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,960
They were high up, and I hope you've all jumped up and got them.

366
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,300
Now, dance around and toss them in the air

367
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,000
and play with them.

368
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,280
Play with them.

369
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,240
Now I'm going to hide the balls again.

370
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,100
Shut your eyes.

371
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,220
Now open them

372
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,700
and run lightly around

373
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,000
and throw them in the air.

374
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,000


375
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,640
Looking everywhere for your balls.

376
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,840
And now you're going to find them,

377
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,000
and the music will tell you where your balls are.

378
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:56,680
Listen.

379
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,380
Have you found them?

380
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,500
Where were they?

381
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,840
Yes, this time they were low down on the floor.

382
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,100
Now dance and play with them again.

383
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,560
Is she making fun of me?

384
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,820
Anyway, hide your balls from some unknown evil English lady.

385
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,980
Thanks to Reverend Greg Bishop for turning us on for the show.

386
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:35,400
And now Princess We Are Doe will attempt to explain her reaction to the next state park that we explored.

387
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,300
It's like everything around me is the coolest thing I've ever seen, and it's all free.

388
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,300
I can take anything I want and take it home with me.

389
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,740
Pieces of it.

390
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:55,960
I always wondered how at festivals people had these bowls of pretty rocks out, and you could get like a bag of it.

391
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:55,960


392
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:55,960


393
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:55,960


394
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:55,960


395
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,900
I'm not sure I've ever seen a bag for $5.

396
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,820
This is how.

397
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,620
They come out here, they find them, and then they put bowls out and you give them money for it.

398
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:04,900
Isn't it right?

399
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,560
Yeah.

400
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,560
It's true and right.

401
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,500
Well, they put them in little polishing machines that cost about $20.

402
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,540
Well, if these were just wet, all they have to be is wet to be shiny.

403
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,100
I know how to do that.

404
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,480
I can make them wet.

405
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,460
I'm just saying.

406
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,880
I don't want to do it on camera, though.

407
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,900
It's my favorite, and there are cacti, really sharp.

408
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,760
Oh, thank you for mentioning.

409
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,020
Cacti everywhere where you are.

410
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,160
I was about to walk over there with a little barrel of cacti.

411
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:39,880
Friends, we're in Rockhound State Park in New Mexico, and we're off trail, totally off trail, and it's really cool.

412
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,460
The place they don't tell you about.

413
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:55,220
When we pulled up, our hearts sank because it was pinks and RVs as far as the eye could see, and this very plain looking foot of a small mountain.

414
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:55,600
None.

415
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:02,560
Nonetheless, we took the little trail they showed on the map, and then we went.

416
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,780
I bet if we went over that bend, we'd have privacy.

417
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,360
Anyway, we found this really wonderful crag of cragness.

418
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:23,380
Big, weird looking rocks and cacti and twisted dead trees and our favorite sort of roadrunner coyote landscape.

419
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,700
Across with Flintstones.

420
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,580
Flintstones, Twilight Zone, and that Bryce program I used to play with.

421
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,500
Arnie Stocknesson made this trail.

422
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:47,720
He left little marks and cairns along the way, so you know you're not the first human who's ever been here, and that this is a way that someone has been able to come so far.

423
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,000
However, I don't see the next cairn.

424
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,400
You don't see the next cairn?

425
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Or white spot painted on the rock.

426
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,280
They just left us here in the middle of...

427
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,560
No, no.

428
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,380
We left them.

429
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:56,840
Oh.

430
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,240
Remember, we wanted to get away from those pinks.

431
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,600
But look how much closer we are to the rock ridge.

432
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:10,340
It's marred by the presence of radio transmission towers and wireless transmitters and all that kind of crap.

433
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,840
Damn things are everywhere.

434
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,240
Someday, someday they won't be no use to nobody.

435
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,720
They'll just be rotting away up there.

436
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,500
Nobody to tune nothing in and nothing being broadcast because it'll all be fried.

437
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,280
Just fried.

438
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,680
Just like that.

439
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,120
When the change comes.

440
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,460
Next day.

441
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,360
The tribulations.

442
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,820
Yes, sir.

443
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,640
Yes, sir.

444
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,160
Anyway, listen to that bag of rocks.

445
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,800
You've heard the phrase, dumber than a box of rocks.

446
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,780
That's my bag of rocks.

447
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,480
We have a balance here.

448
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,380
Now, we're continuing on the trail.

449
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,180
Right.

450
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,100
Because we don't know what is ahead.

451
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,820
This is unmarked.

452
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:55,120
This is unexplored territory except by Arnie Sognasom, the great explorer.

453
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,480
The great explorer.

454
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,680
There could be acres more slack around the corner.

455
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,420
We're here for our slack at the Devil's Slack Altar.

456
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,660
Praise Bob.

457
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,620
From PR News in Washington, I'm accused by several women of sexual harassment.

458
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,340
A senior Chinese official has acknowledged the country is ill-prepared for polar bears.

459
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,540
I'm adding red cans to the mix.

460
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:25,520
Republican businessman Herman Cain is claimed he'd had an affair with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich for 13 years.

461
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:31,520
Cain made the announcement this afternoon in Atlanta where he was to open a national bombing in Baghdad this week.

462
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,100
I am suspending soul searching.

463
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,000
Newt Gingrich called Herman Cain a fass.

464
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,480
He said the two had had a private conversation to him.

465
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,520
A lot of people complained they didn't like the color and some thought Cain was different.

466
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,620
But it turned out he wasn't there at the time.

467
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,420
PR News in Washington.

468
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,080
Princess Wei has become a rock hound.

469
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,240
Gold.

470
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,680
Gold.

471
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:55,680


472
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:55,680


473
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:55,680


474
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:55,680


475
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:55,680


476
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,260
Gold.

477
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,900
Since she's a female rock hound, I guess you could call her a rock bitch.

478
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,800
Gold.

479
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,500
We found lost Mesa.

480
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,140
Mesa of lost women.

481
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,620
Mesa of lost women.

482
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,520
Y constructing the Tigris Bajamas'

483
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:35,800
Mesa won the first Topsy Turvy Pots.

484
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,760
Stomping second BBD WINTER QUIÚ GOOD MOTHER EDITING

485
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah, that didn't go to ends with more believe you

486
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,000


487
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,000


488
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,000


489
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:47,420
덴 SCOUTS 셰 ble�e.....

490
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,280
Thank you.

491
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,560
Thank you.

492
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,200
And you can count

493
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,840
pathetic posers and

494
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
shitwads.

495
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,760
Useless pee-mongers.

496
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,360
The great

497
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,080
unwashed.

498
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,300
Shall we say.

499
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,140
Metaphorically.

500
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,200
They might be better washed

501
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,760
than us.

502
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,700
But you know what I mean.

503
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,540
Princess, what did I forget to tell you

504
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,480
that there are 17 different types

505
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,320
of rattlesnakes that live out here.

506
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:15,980
No.

507
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,840
You've told me that I forget all the times

508
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,980
it scares me so much.

509
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,840
And although it's

510
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,020
January

511
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,360
they're probably not out

512
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,400
but you know it's been a warm

513
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,440
day today. They may not have curled

514
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,320
up in their hidey holes under

515
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,280
the rocks and under the

516
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,080
cacti yet.

517
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,420
Frisky little fellows

518
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,080
that they are.

519
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,960
Here's a green mark.

520
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,140
Ernie Sacknelson's

521
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,860
green mark.

522
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,780
That means beware of pinks.

523
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,640
It's an anti-color of pinks.

524
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,760
The negative of pinks.

525
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,360
A green mark.

526
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,400
That shows that now we must beware.

527
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:54,900
See look.

528
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,020
There's the trailer court.

529
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,020
Oh my god.

530
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,540
We're now inside of the pinks.

531
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,040
There's people.

532
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,080
Yeah.

533
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,360
People. Humans.

534
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,500
Humans.

535
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,000
Humans.

536
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,800
But soon we'll be in another place

537
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,640
where there are no humans.

538
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,360
We'll go to

539
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,560
Chikahawatalgataka

540
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,940
a national monument.

541
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,880
It will be free because it's national.

542
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,240
The state parks weren't free.

543
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,480
We thought they would be free because of

544
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,520
Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.

545
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,100
Like the national parks.

546
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,580
But nay.

547
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,680
Nay.

548
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,440
Nay.

549
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,040
They wanted five bucks.

550
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,220
Which I'm happy to give them.

551
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,180
Because these are, you know, beautiful places.

552
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,440
And it costs to not let the conspiracy have them.

553
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,920
The sad thing is that the conspiracy surrounds them.

554
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,740
Real close.

555
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,980
There's houses within walking distance.

556
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,640
Actually there's a town surrounding the trailer court.

557
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,500
But up in these mountains there aren't many people.

558
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:55,000
Just a few rockhounds, subgeniuses, other antisocial people.

559
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,320
It reminds me of the Alabama Hills.

560
00:32:59,360 --> 00:32:59,920
Yeah.

561
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,960
That's what we like.

562
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,800
It's things that look like the Alabama Hills.

563
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,820
Things that look like Bryce Canyon.

564
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,440
Things that look like the Devil's Waterhole.

565
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,040
The Devil's Hall.

566
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,020
The Devil's Staircase.

567
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,980
And Bob.

568
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,440
Bob's Frop Chamber.

569
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,940
Or Bob's Privacy Chamber.

570
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,600
Which happens to be this open crag made of crags.

571
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,860
Giant rocks and boulders that form sort of a reef of rock in the midst of the desert vegetation.

572
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,160
You know, you say desert and you think, oh, the White Sands National Monument.

573
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,340
Just sand.

574
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,980
And just a cactus every now and then.

575
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,940
And tiny little desert mouse tracks.

576
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,960
But what we're in is the Chihuahuan Desert or maybe the Sonoring Desert.

577
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:59,500
And it's green almost everywhere except where there's giant craggy rocks.

578
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,280
It's very green.

579
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,800
It's green with prickly pear and Indian tea.

580
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,680
Yuccas of many kinds.

581
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,020
And what was that bear plant?

582
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,840
Bear riping.

583
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,680
Bear claw.

584
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,260
Yeah, a seven-year bear claw plant.

585
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:22,340
Every seven years it uproots itself and comes shambling after you to get you.

586
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,420
Because the desert is full of hostile creatures.

587
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,600
Giant mutated tarantulas.

588
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,260
We're not that far from Los Alamos, you know.

589
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,380
All them things could be up here.

590
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:35,920
Yeah.

591
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:36,840
Damn it.

592
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,540
You're a rock kleptomaniac.

593
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,920
You're not a rock hound.

594
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,860
There's a difference, you know.

595
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,240
What do you mean?

596
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,340
One's a hobby, an avocation, perhaps even a profession.

597
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,700
Yours is a sickness, an obsession.

598
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,940
There is a difference.

599
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,780
No.

600
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,440
God.

601
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:05,520
We had to look around and go, where can we go?

602
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,360
Where are there no pinks?

603
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,840
Where would there be privacy?

604
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:18,520
And since they'd like to cluster together by definition, they tend to stay all in that

605
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:28,820
one safe area with the hiking trails or concrete, you know, or boards, or have railings.

606
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,740
And we like to get down in there.

607
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,620
Yeah.

608
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,140
Where the things you'll see from the road, you go, God, I wish I could go climbing around

609
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,920
in that stuff.

610
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,600
That is so weird looking.

611
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:49,320
And we need to negotiate this prickly pear hallway to test your courage and coordination.

612
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,740
Well, so much for...

613
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,080
We both got a B, which means you're dead.

614
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:57,560
Got a B?

615
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,800
That means you're dead because one touch of that plant kills you.

616
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,120
Oh.

617
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,820
It takes 24 hours, exactly.

618
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,780
It's called the 24 hour death cactus.

619
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,380
To counteract the death?

620
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,100
Huh?

621
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,660
To counteract the death?

622
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,340
Yeah.

623
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,400
Oh!

624
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,260
I'm a type of gringo.

625
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,260
I think you've heard...

626
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:14,480
No.

627
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:14,960
...which type.

628
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:24,600
I just touched a prickly pear spine in my excitement to photograph a rotting prickly

629
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,180
pear leaf, which has its skeleton exposed.

630
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:33,300
We've made photographs of the skeletons alone because they look so weird.

631
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,520
You wouldn't even know it was a prickly pear skeleton except that it's shaped sort of prickly

632
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,240
pearishly.

633
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,560
We saw our two friends, the crows.

634
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,200
The two black crows that we traveled with.

635
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:47,480
Yeah, the two black crows.

636
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,920
They're kind of like a side man.

637
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:48,960
We saw them.

638
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,120
They followed us...

639
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,520
Oh, God!

640
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,320
All the way across the country and back to a certain point.

641
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,360
You don't see them everywhere.

642
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,860
Look, where's the trail?

643
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,500
Do we go up, down, or indifferent?

644
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,380
This is why the pinks don't go here.

645
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,500
What would Arnie do?

646
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:08,500


647
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:08,500


648
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:08,500


649
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:08,500


650
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:08,500


651
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:08,500


652
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:08,500


653
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:08,500


654
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:08,500


655
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:08,500


656
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:08,500


657
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:08,500


658
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,300
What would Arnie Sognason do?

659
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:20,060
It's easy to get distracted with thoughts of wonderment, thoughts of the future, cosmic,

660
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:26,420
grand schemes in this marvelous environment out here in nature.

661
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,140
Just listen to those crickets and cicadas.

662
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,340
The sound of nature.

663
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,440
The sounds that I'm hearing in this phone...

664
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,360
The sounds that I'm hearing in this phone when no one's talking are stranger than what

665
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,060
I hear when you're talking.

666
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:49,440
Stang, I can only conclude that you're having a bunch of hallucinations.

667
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,100
Could be.

668
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,880
Well, I think you're hallucinating.

669
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,400
And you're misinterpreting your cerebral cortex as it does once in a while.

670
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,300
How would I know?

671
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,820
How would you know?

672
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:06,540
You would think the large blue lady entering your room carrying the scimitar was the postman

673
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,360
who was delivering your nightclub.

674
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:08,420
That's right.

675
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:20,840
I was always thinking there was he knows, like, surviving...

676
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,200
But if you write or e-mail, I'd

677
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,200


678
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,300
Nothing I've ever heard of.

679
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,800
I never had aameatancy of beingッ

680
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,660
The woman just said you were briefly awakened.

681
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,660
I see.

682
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,300
I'm getting a little bit scared here.

683
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:34,060
That's as least you can tella now.

684
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,380
You could just come and sit next to me.

685
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:45,200
And I noticed that a lot of guys from the near west side and some guys from the east side.

686
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,800
So you don't think people should start their own religion?

687
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,240
Well, I don't.

688
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,160
No, I'm not saying they shouldn't.

689
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,620
No, I'm not saying I don't think people should.

690
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,920
What we need to know is if you can do so profitably, then go for it.

691
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,140
Maybe that was a bad idea on his part.

692
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,180
Hello, Cleveland!

693
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,700
Hello, Cleveland!

694
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,840
This show goes to 11. Actually, the show goes to midnight.

695
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,360
If I could see things in the distant future as well as in the distant past,

696
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,440
what a lucky man I'd be.

697
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,600
I'd have 40, 40, 50, 60, 70 vision any time I...

698
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,360
Just sit right here.

699
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,580
Wait.

700
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,620
Sky King died today.

701
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,040
It was a day like no other day.

702
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,680
The day Sky King died.

703
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,780
I remember up there in the sky.

704
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,680
Sky King and Penny flagged by.

705
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,620
Up there in the sunburned.

706
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,900
With the disco.

707
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,340
I remember the day.

708
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,820
The day Sky King died.

709
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,640
I went to bed that night and I just...

710
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,080
died.

711
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,500
I remember the day.

712
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,000
The day Sky King died.

713
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,160
I still remember the day.

714
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:36,160


715
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,360
But the day the skyねy turned to the sky.

716
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,360


717
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,960
His head should be broken now.

718
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,960
The dust went off.

719
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,920
Now it got made of drops.

720
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,300
The world is a.

721
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:03,680


722
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:03,680


723
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:03,680


724
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,720
Let's send a message from the sky king to the sky king.

725
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,160
OK to the sky king!

726
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,160


727
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,160


728
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,160


729
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,160


730
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,160


731
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,380
The Day Sky King Died

732
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:22,000
by the Swingin' Love Corpses at QuiveringBrain.com

733
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,200
who also did this background music.

734
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,020
And before that, a clip of Radio Synesthesia from WCSB Cleveland.

735
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,960
The instrumental a little earlier was

736
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,460
Touch Me Please by the Psychoskeletons

737
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,300
found under that name at SoundClick.com

738
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,440
and PR News was by Reverend Cosmic Debris.

739
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,660
This is Hour of Slack number 1359 from Subgenius.com

740
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,820
and other places such as Upcoming,

741
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,340
the Ask Dr. Howell Show on Radio Valencia

742
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,380
with Dr. Philo Drummond,

743
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,020
and a clip from the Olden Firesign Theater,

744
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,080
our mentors from 1972 in the Duke of Madness Motors collection.

745
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,520
But now, back to the trail.

746
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:06,380
Even put a bottle cap in their pocket

747
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,300
until they get back, or put the bottle cap on the bottle.

748
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,160
There's a novel idea, until they get back.

749
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,120
Yeah, this is real close to the campground,

750
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,300
and yet people throw their bottle caps here.

751
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,160
I'll take that one.

752
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,540
It's just sick.

753
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,380
You've done enough bottle cap picking.

754
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,040
I stopped.

755
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,400
I'm like so tired of people's piggishness

756
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,640
and having to pick up after them.

757
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,820
I'll put them in my pocket with my dead batteries.

758
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,760
I'm in picking up of free gorgeous rocks mode.

759
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,900
Yeah, normally we...

760
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,440
It's sad.

761
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,320
The little respect people show.

762
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:45,200
It would be so easy not to just throw that plastic bottle of water

763
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,240
down in the middle of Bryce Canyon.

764
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,220
It seems like...

765
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,200
It doesn't weigh anything after you drink the water out of it,

766
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,180
so why not crumple it up and stick it in your pocket

767
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,900
until you get out?

768
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,300
No.

769
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,100
You've got to leave your pink mark.

770
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,440
The mark of the pink.

771
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,280
Yep, I was pink.

772
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,380
I'm a pink boy, and I was here.

773
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:02,700
Not everyone.

774
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,160
Not everyone.

775
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,420
You can't do that.

776
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:03,420


777
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:03,420


778
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:03,440


779
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:03,720
You can tell.

780
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,400
You want to be guilty, but there are odds.

781
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,780
No, most people aren't guilty.

782
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,280
Obviously, there are a few.

783
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,800
Yeah, there's just these...

784
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,620
And it's sad that we all...

785
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,740
They mar the world that we all share.

786
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,140
They mar it.

787
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,040
Well, you know, the trail itself mars the world,

788
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,780
and the highway getting to the trail,

789
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,180
and the thing that brings us down the highway to the trail

790
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,780
all mar the world,

791
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,980
if you want to look at it that way.

792
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,480
Yeah.

793
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,760
On the other hand, without those things,

794
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,260
we never would have seen any of these.

795
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:33,740
No.

796
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,200
No.

797
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,540
There must be a balance.

798
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:41,340
By dobs, there must be a balance.

799
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,700
Yes, I insist upon it.

800
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,640
Surely there must be.

801
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,360
We can't be such stupid chimpanzees

802
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,900
as to screw it all up

803
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,920
just when it was getting cool.

804
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,740
My God, man.

805
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,680
What's wrong with these people?

806
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,480
What's not wrong is the question.

807
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,240
I'm a...

808
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:03,820
I'm afraid.

809
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,300
Oh, yes.

810
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,680
What's not wrong?

811
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,380
Why, there's even nothing or two wrong with me.

812
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,120
I'll admit it.

813
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,200
Yes, I'm a humble man.

814
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,440
A greatly humble man.

815
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,500
Where is my camera?

816
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:22,900
I need my camera to record the greatness of nature,

817
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,900
which compared to myself is...

818
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,160
is so much grander.

819
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,020
This one rock,

820
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,200
this one tiny, funny,

821
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,900
little purple...

822
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,440
little purple...

823
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,180
cube of rock in the middle of gray and red ones.

824
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,760
I mean, orange cube.

825
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,620
What was I saying?

826
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,420
Something's happened to me.

827
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:41,780
Radiation.

828
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,160
We're near Los Alamos.

829
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,080
It's not far.

830
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,400
But we are here.

831
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,380
I have a dobs head on,

832
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,940
but it's under two layers of clothes.

833
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,500
It is January.

834
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,840
It's not cold, though.

835
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,960
It's like about 50 now.

836
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,260
The sun's on its way down.

837
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,820
It's been behind clouds all day.

838
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,320
Darn it.

839
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,940
But if it hadn't been,

840
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,540
we'd actually be hot.

841
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,460
Look, there's some left of cigarette butt there.

842
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,400
Right where everybody could see it.

843
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,380
Not like picking up a rock and sticking it under it

844
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,940
where it'll remain for 200 years.

845
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,500
Till some bug...

846
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,280
Two million years till some bug man picks it up and goes...

847
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,760
A roach man will pick it up.

848
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,400
A roach man of two million years

849
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,200
will be walking along what's...

850
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,440
remains of this ground.

851
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,560
And kick that rock and look underneath and go...

852
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:37,580
Good Lord!

853
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,780
Would say the roach man.

854
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:41,560
A roach!

855
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,700
But that was a mere American spirit roach

856
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,860
or Marlboro or Merritt or something.

857
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,260
Sad.

858
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:55,700
Sad.

859
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,000
A tear is rolling down my cheek

860
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,060
like the noble red man.

861
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,000
Weeping for the wonders that were lost.

862
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,060
Weeping for the fact that he himself,

863
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,620
his own ancestors,

864
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,240
helped wipe out so many large species

865
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,500
when they arrived on this continent.

866
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,960
A tear rolls down my cheek.

867
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,960
A tear rolls down my cheek.

868
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,420
At the cigarette butts.

869
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,520
Sorry.

870
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,280
There are cigarette butts

871
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,460
in Rockhound State Bar.

872
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:43,800
I'm not a cigarette butt.

873
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,280
Calling all coordinates.

874
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,140
Calling all coordinates.

875
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,260
Moon 4 degrees Taurus.

876
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:46,740
Roger.

877
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,520
Cancer rising.

878
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:47,940
Roger.

879
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,360
29 Pisces 59.

880
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:49,900
Roger.

881
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,480
This one looks serious, Roger.

882
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:51,960
You're right.

883
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,160
We'd better call Captain Equinox.

884
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,480
Captain Equinox, the deadliest foe of those who attest

885
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,300
to railing democracy.

886
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,520
By day, Adolph Tree, a mild mannered college professor.

887
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,400
By night, King.

888
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,420
Kiki, a mini-skirted obituary of Hollywood's star-struck

889
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,140
Sunset Strip.

890
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,880
But twice a year, he's Captain Equinox.

891
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,880
Today's dumb story spies over Broadway.

892
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,660
But first, here's Captain Equinox himself

893
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,300
with today's secret coded message.

894
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,720
Okay, Solstice Squad, get your pencil and paper ready

895
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,380
and listen up.

896
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,680
You can buy a car, rent a car, or have your car serviced

897
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,640
at Jack Poet Volkswagen in Highland Park

898
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,080
at 5944 North Figueroa off the Avenue 60 exit

899
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,040
of the Pasadena Freeway.

900
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:29,980
Got that down?

901
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,060
If you don't have your decoder, tear off the top of your daddy's car

902
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,480
and mail it together with 10 cents in cash or coin

903
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,660
to Captain Equinox, decoder tie, Drop City, Colorado.

904
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,140
And now, Captain Equinox.

905
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,460
Yes, some of the rocks here look just like meat.

906
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,800
They're red and veiny and pork chop shaped.

907
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,460
They don't have the smell nor the texture of meat,

908
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,540
but they look like meat.

909
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,940
Not all of the rocks look like meat.

910
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,040
Some seem to look like faces.

911
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,700
Listen, you can hear the trucks and pinks.

912
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,080
You can hear guys barbecuing.

913
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,500
Oh, remember when we went to the restrooms,

914
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,620
there was a guy just standing in front of the men's room,

915
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,180
just standing there, a redneck.

916
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,740
I walked up to him.

917
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,980
Actually, I was walking to the restroom door,

918
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,800
and he goes, it must be wax.

919
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:33,560
It must be waxing day, huh?

920
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:35,820
I looked at him.

921
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,020
I said, oh, excuse me.

922
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:37,640
Pardon me.

923
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,140
It must be waxing day.

924
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,180
I go, uh.

925
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,080
He goes, that fella up there, he's waxing his RV.

926
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,640
It must be waxing day.

927
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,320
I looked up the hill, and there among the 40 RVs

928
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,960
was an old man waxing his RV.

929
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,300
And I said, like, that was the funniest thing I ever heard

930
00:48:59,300 --> 00:48:59,840
when I walked in the bathroom.

931
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,520
He probably looked at him and said, he was like,

932
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:02,960
honky.

933
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:03,860
He was like, I'm killing weather, don't it?

934
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,440
Feels like I'm killing weather, don't it?

935
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,980
Well, it was one of those kind of comments you say to strangers.

936
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,040
It was a homely one, I suppose.

937
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,860
But he really did say it like, it must be waxing day.

938
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,340
I'm sure he meant no offense.

939
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,660
He was being folksy and newsy.

940
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,180
Friendly.

941
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,940
Just wanted to see if I was Muslimic.

942
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:31,980
Yeah.

943
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:32,460
Yeah.

944
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:33,300
He was.

945
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,800
Now, I'm sure I could be a terrorist out to blow up Rockhound State Park, New Mexico.

946
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,960
Well, yeah, with your long hair, I mean.

947
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,580
Or an illegal immigrant from France or something.

948
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:41,720
Yeah.

949
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,140
I'm going to check my accent.

950
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,360
I'm sure it's, my accent goes a long way out here.

951
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,660
Not mine.

952
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,900
This whole part of the country.

953
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:52,720
No, you're a Yankee.

954
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:58,640
But around here, they can, even at my most polite, they can tell, oh, he's a nice city boy,

955
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,880
probably from Dallas or someplace.

956
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:00,720
Nice.

957
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:06,280
I bet he was like one of them lawyers or stage actors or something.

958
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,160
Do you notice how pretty he talks?

959
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,780
He talks real pretty.

960
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:15,560
His mouth sure ain't as pretty as his talk coming out of it is.

961
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,820
Now is it, is it?

962
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,000
Nose ain't nearly as pretty.

963
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,000
His mouth ain't.

964
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,500
How happened to you?

965
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:35,020
I go rock picking for one second and all of a sudden you degenerate into this thing that I don't even know anymore.

966
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,000
Who are you?

967
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,020
What's happened?

968
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,080
Who is anyone?

969
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,100
Who is anyone?

970
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,780
And how did this one rock get this way?

971
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,260
Who can tell the story?

972
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:52,100
Actually, I'm sure a qualified geologist could tell the story in endlessly boring terms.

973
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,300
Now, yesterday we were watching Tarzan and the Mermaid.

974
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,700
Oh, that's a good one.

975
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:03,440
The studio claimed that a stuntman died doing a high dive in Acapulco during the shooting,

976
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,300
but there's no proof that that ever happened.

977
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,260
Hollywood hokum.

978
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,480
Pure bourgeois.

979
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:09,120
Yeah.

980
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,080
So there.

981
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,840
That was Johnny Weissmuller's last Tarzan movie.

982
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,600
God, do we sound old.

983
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:19,940
I don't know why, talking about those great classics of the cinema,

984
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:25,800
produced by fighting two-fisted producers like Carl Denham, for example.

985
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,160
They're still around.

986
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,080
Yes.

987
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,720
The movies are, not the producers.

988
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,360
Yeah, well, yeah, the movies are around.

989
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,180
Those producers are now panty waists.

990
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:38,260
They're not like hard-hitting Carl Denham at all.

991
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,400
Carl Denham.

992
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,660
What a name.

993
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,540
They're not even buffoons like Max O'Hara.

994
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,820
And they laughed at him.

995
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,640
They laughed at Carl Denham.

996
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,500
They said, you're crazy.

997
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,920
There's no Skull Island.

998
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:50,740
That's nuts.

999
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:56,380
And they laughed at Max O'Hara when his Golden Safari nightclub opened.

1000
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,740
They weren't laughing when they were running from those dinosaurs.

1001
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:04,460
You mean in the Denham expedition?

1002
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,360
Yes.

1003
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,560
Yeah, is that yours?

1004
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,840
It's so sad that Skull Island vanished beneath the waves.

1005
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:21,320
If you believe that, it certainly seems to disappear very rapidly.

1006
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,760
There aren't any more expeditions after, like, 1943 or so.

1007
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,320
Has there?

1008
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,620
The United Nations has kept it as an international preserve.

1009
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,460
I hope so.

1010
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,960
That would be great.

1011
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,120
I haven't seen any proof of it.

1012
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,240
It seems like something would come out on it.

1013
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,440
So that you can't see it anymore.

1014
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,360
All right, here's the phone.

1015
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,420
Just as something interesting got started.

1016
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,940
But just out of the love of novelty, I am going to answer the phone.

1017
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,760
Although, of course, it cannot be heard.

1018
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,160
Well, not by the radio audience.

1019
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,800
Can the radio audience hear?

1020
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,440
No.

1021
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,820
But now I will hold the instrument to my ear and I shall...

1022
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,600
Strange question.

1023
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,540
Can the radio audience hear?

1024
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,420
Hello, whoever this is?

1025
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:06,920
Who is it?

1026
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,360
Who's there?

1027
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:09,560
Who's there?

1028
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,880
Please answer.

1029
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:16,080
Well, the problem is, because of a technical malfunction, we can't...

1030
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,720
What's that flaming bag on the doorstep?

1031
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:17,960
Yeah.

1032
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,560
Over the...

1033
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:24,120
So I'm speaking to you, but you can't be heard, I'm afraid.

1034
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,840
You'll have to try us again when everything is in apple pie order,

1035
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,540
which, unfortunately, it now isn't.

1036
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,080
But thanks for calling anyway.

1037
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,040
I suggested that to someone the other day.

1038
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:35,260
What?

1039
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,840
They were really, really, really, really mad.

1040
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,080
They wanted to get revenge on somebody.

1041
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,280
And I said, I got a simple little thing.

1042
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,080
It's a tried and true method that works every time it's tried.

1043
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:51,160
Take a crap in a paper sack, put it on the front doorstep,

1044
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,080
light the bag, ring the doorbell,

1045
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:54,920
and run away.

1046
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,300
People still fall for that?

1047
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,520
It still works.

1048
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:02,380
People still will come out and jump on the sack with the fire out.

1049
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:02,700
Yes.

1050
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,560
Well, I'm afraid I can't discuss it with you,

1051
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,640
but I'll tell our audience what it is that you've just told me.

1052
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,000
Anyway, when I reminded them of that simple strategy,

1053
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,640
they thought it was, like, brilliant.

1054
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,860
That caller was saying that...

1055
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,040
It's the simple things that you can pull out.

1056
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,080
Movies aren't special as they are...

1057
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,820
They aren't now.

1058
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,140
As they were once, if I can screw him properly,

1059
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,520
with Netflix and DVDs and all of that sort of thing.

1060
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,220
They finally got movies down where they're, like, worth about a buck now.

1061
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,060
Maybe two bucks.

1062
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,120
But you have to pay far more for that.

1063
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:42,740
Well, video games are like an extension of movies in some cases.

1064
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,080
They're like a combination art form that's new,

1065
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,440
and that's made a difference.

1066
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,300
And also the fact that so many people today are just half humans,

1067
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,000
just shadows.

1068
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,340
Walking...

1069
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:56,820
Shamblings.

1070
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:57,480
Shades.

1071
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:57,520
Shields.

1072
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:57,800
Mounds.

1073
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,340
Shells.

1074
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,200
Humanoid shapes.

1075
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,220
So, of course, they can't possibly comprehend

1076
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:06,780
the importance of certain 1930s and 40s Universal.

1077
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,180
They don't even know how the movies are made back then.

1078
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,320
You know, they were, like, just...

1079
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,920
Before the computer, how'd they do it?

1080
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,820
They might be pleased with the novelty.

1081
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:21,700
If you were to set up a 16mm projector screen and speakers

1082
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,060
and then project a movie in a dark room,

1083
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,840
they might like the novelty.

1084
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,320
They might like the quality of the sound and the picture.

1085
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,100
Except the noise the projector made.

1086
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,360
But that would be cool, too, because, after all,

1087
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:43,040
do we not worship the device more than the material which comes through it?

1088
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:43,460
No.

1089
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,700
Well, you might not, but they do.

1090
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,700
I happen to know.

1091
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:52,260
They're unable to get past the fact that they have a contraption that does something,

1092
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,040
and they're clearly not interested in it.

1093
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:54,040


1094
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,260
They're not interested in doing anything with it.

1095
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,020
Well, now, look, let's face it.

1096
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,080
All of us were the AV kids that loaded the projectors, right?

1097
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,940
I was called on to do that, of course.

1098
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:05,960
Yeah.

1099
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,120
And all of us made horrible, stupid little movies

1100
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,000
when we were about 11 years old, right?

1101
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,700
And older, in my case.

1102
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,100
Yeah.

1103
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,380
Well, none of us is quite soft.

1104
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,040
I made comic books.

1105
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,800
You didn't make any movies?

1106
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,340
But what about the fake blood?

1107
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,120
What about the...

1108
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,020
There's a whole reason to make movies.

1109
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:29,120
I saw a movie of you in the garage that took 20 years to make.

1110
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:37,360
Well, that one started in 1977 or so, and so he was in his late 20s then.

1111
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,940
Looked like a 70s porno star, didn't he?

1112
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:40,940
Yeah, he did.

1113
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,700
Yeah, that's Bob's Lunch Hour.

1114
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,400
It's on my YouTube channel, which is one word, RevStang.

1115
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:52,860
And Bob's Lunch Hour, we had to remove the stolen soundtrack.

1116
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:54,000
But it's just as well.

1117
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,960
It was made as a silent movie.

1118
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,060
We started in 1977.

1119
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,360
We ran out of steam.

1120
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:06,860
And suddenly, we realized that it would be better if we finished it now, 30 years later.

1121
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,120
We did it in 2006.

1122
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:08,920
We should do that scrolling text thing.

1123
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,860
We shot the ending of it.

1124
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:17,220
So, Philo ages 30 years in this Twilight Zone-like short film.

1125
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:22,840
And there's a shock cut from the 27-year-old Philo to the 50-year-old Philo.

1126
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,840
A company by Changing Music.

1127
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,220
It's wild.

1128
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,020
Wild.

1129
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:30,500
Wild!

1130
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:39,160
From the original, just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in, to a punk version.

1131
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:51,080
When the punk version starts, that's when you see the wizened Philo in rags, replaced the business suited, young, healthy Philo.

1132
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:52,820
He's a good guy.

1133
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:59,980
He's been going, in the movie, he's been going downstairs and down elevators for 30 years.

1134
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,400
And only getting higher and higher up in the building.

1135
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,780
And at the end, he ends up on the roof and decides to jump.

1136
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,080
And at first, he goes to heaven.

1137
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,500
He's sitting on a cloud, looking young again.

1138
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,640
And at first, he's happy.

1139
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,120
But then he realizes he's even higher up.

1140
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,540
He looks over the cloud and there's the earth down there.

1141
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,140
And he realizes he's worse off than ever.

1142
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:22,720
I got too high.

1143
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,120
I got too high.

1144
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,960
And I can't come down anymore.

1145
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,060
It was our first and last subgenius movie.

1146
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,680
Or should I say first and latest?

1147
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:38,420
It seems to have it all, including a great span of years in its making.

1148
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:41,300
You could actually say 20 years in the making.

1149
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,360
30.

1150
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,140
30.

1151
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,320
Well, remember they used to say two years in the making and so forth.

1152
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,040
Well, 30 years in the making.

1153
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:51,600
This was before J.R. Bob Dobbs was known to the public.

1154
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:56,980
And we, as a joke, had Philo play a character named J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1155
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:57,860
And we made a name for it.

1156
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:58,480
Now, that's awkward.

1157
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:04,500
It says J.R. Bob Dobbs and it shows the young Philo, who, of course, didn't even have a pipe.

1158
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,260
He had a mustache.

1159
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,440
He didn't look anything like Bob.

1160
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,340
All confusing to our listeners.

1161
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,340
All confusing to our listeners.

1162
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,400
All confusing to our listeners.

1163
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,460
All confusing to our listeners.

1164
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,440
All confusing to our listeners.

1165
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,800
All confusing to our listeners.
