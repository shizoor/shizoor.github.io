1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
Yeah, let's have a party!

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,840
Party it down!

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,380
Thanks, Robert.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,060
And up to it.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:08,800
Yeah.

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,320
Oh, man.

7
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,820
It was horrible.

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,060
The horror.

9
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,380
The horror.

10
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,940
Oh, dear friends.

11
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,580
I'm sorry I have to come on the radio without shaving.

12
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,020
But you'd forgive me if you knew,

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,160
if you knew what I'd just been through.

14
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,580
You can hear by the way my voice sounds, can't you?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,720
You few regular listeners and all five or six of you.

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,880
It was intense.

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,200
It was intense!

18
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,240
I just got off the plane and I've got a story to tell.

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,900
Say it out loud, �

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,020
Listen up!

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,260
Bob?

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,360
Bob?

23
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,740
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,240
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,280
Bob?

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,180
That's your key phrase.

27
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,220
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

28
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,620
We are controlling transmission.

29
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,800
We will control the horizontal.

30
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,300
We will control the vertical.

31
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,800
For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.

32
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,100
We are conscious.

33
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,440
Bob is a rock.

34
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,980
And Bob is a tree.

35
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,720
Bob is a bear.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,540
And Bob is a bee.

37
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,220
Bob is truth.

38
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,920
And Bob is lies.

39
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,660
Bob is cakes.

40
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,380
And fruits.

41
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,340
And pies.

42
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,140
Bob's my hassle.

43
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,700
Bob's my wash.

44
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,520
Bob's my sandwich.

45
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,220
Bob's my crotch.

46
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,100
Bob's my toothpick.

47
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,480
Bob's my brain.

48
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,720
Bob's that ugly yellow stain.

49
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,620
Bob's a cactus.

50
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,200
Bob's an itch.

51
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,540
Bob is take off every stitch.

52
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,500
Bob's my master.

53
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,020
Bob's my slave.

54
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,980
Bob will rob me.

55
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,460
Bob will save.

56
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,260
Bob's my toaster.

57
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,700
Bob's my fridge.

58
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,020
Bob's my little sister Mitch.

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,180
Bob will cost you.

60
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,440
Bob is free.

61
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,360
Bob's the watch.

62
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,880
And Bob's the key.

63
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,080
In short, Bob's is the man.

64
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,920
Who used your leg as a frame.

65
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,020
Bob had a head.

66
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,140
If your mind is a jar, you can pour down a sink.

67
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,240
And the subgenius church is the missing link.

68
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,580
There is absolutely no other possibility.

77
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,360
Ah yes, good friends.

78
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,440
Look out, stop that radio station before it hits that list.

79
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,940

85
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,580
And only in the city of...

86
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,200
Dallas, Texas.

87
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,920
Yea, but you've heard all that before, so much.

88
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,600
Ah, let's get some of that Darth Vader jazz going.

89
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,380
Oh, friends.

90
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, let's have a party.

91
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,160
Party time.

92
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,800
Let's get down.

93
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:42,040
Oh, no, like I said, I'm sorry to come on without shaving, but man, I mean, this has been the most intense week for the subgenius church of hierarchites anyway, in general.

94
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:57,180
As you can tell by the way I personally, Reverend Ivan Stank, sound, because, you know, I was just too busy having a good time, a better time than I have in Dallas.

95
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:18,420
You know, I've got some ranting to do tonight, and we don't have a whole lot of tape yet from the Boston revival, which I just got in for from, honest to God, dear friends, I just got in about an hour and a half ago from the airport, just came in from Boston.

96
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:25,860
Yes, we did a mighty, tremendous, horrifying revival in Boston, Massachusetts.

97
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,460
Oh.

98
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,160
Oh.

99
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,440
And I don't have a whole lot of tape from it yet.

100
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,360
I have some, and I'll have to judge how listenable it is once we stick some on here.

101
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,140
But it's so great, you're just going to have to decipher some of it.

102
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,420
That's all there is to it.

103
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:55,180
The audience participation tonight is going to be really intense, except that you're not participating, even though you're part of the audience.

104
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:11,000
Your participation is going to be in the deciphering of this self-same mighty, mighty, oh, what can I, words escape me, dear friends, they really do.

105
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:22,120
I've got a tale of terror, a tale of horror and woe, and on top of that, wonder, a tale of wonder to tell.

106
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,800
That's mainly what this show's going to be.

107
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,920
I'm going to tell you the tale.

108
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,040
I'm going to tell you the tale of the Boston Devival, as I told it.

109
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:34,700
And as I tell it, I hope it makes you Dallas wimp, wimp subgeniuses.

110
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:53,920
You generally halfway subgeniuses, and in fact, most of you, halfway bobbies even, feel shamed, shamed and put down compared to the ovaries and testicular glory displayed by the Boston Yankees.

111
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:54,900


112
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:54,900


113
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:54,900


114
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:54,900


115
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:54,900


116
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:54,900


117
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:54,900


118
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:54,900


119
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:54,900


120
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,200
That's right.

121
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,780
You've been put down, friends.

122
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:07,080
You've been put down so bad by what Boston can put out in terms of subgenius revivals, subgenius hell.

123
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,400
Oh, oh, it was the horror, the horror.

124
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,160
It's true.

125
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,560
For one thing, we had a devival where everybody wasn't white skinned.

126
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,300
What an amazing thing.

127
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,580
Actually, whenever we go to the East Coast, it's that way.

128
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,340
Oh, we'll get into that later.

129
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:35,200
Well, there was, there were, you know, when we do a show here in Dallas, we get one or two Hispanics and no blacks at all.

130
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,760
I don't blame them.

131
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,900
I really don't.

132
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,940
Do they want to hang out with a bunch of wimps like the likes of you, Dallas?

133
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:54,900
I mean, I'm, I'm disgusted by seeing the comparison between what, what, what we have to do.

134
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:05,220
What we have to put up with the disgusting, low, low level of faith that we have to put up with here in Dallas compared to, I mean, can you believe?

135
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,980
I want to, I'm challenging you, you Texas subgeniuses.

136
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,400
I'm proud to be a Texan.

137
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,320
I really am.

138
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,300
I'm proud to be a Dallasite.

139
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:23,340
But I would sure like to see y'all top what I have experienced in the last week.

140
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,420
Week.

141
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,100
Oh.

142
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,240
Oh.

143
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,140
Well, about since I left the last radio show.

144
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,220
After the last show, I went home and started packing.

145
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,420
And I packed until I left on the plane for Boston.

146
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:44,120
And when I got to Boston, the Reverend Cleve Duncan picked me up at the airport and took me to the home of Dr. Cruel.

147
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:51,140
And, of course, you all don't, you're not cool enough to know that that's the home of the fabulous Billy Goons.

148
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,620
Oh, no, you don't care.

149
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,860
No, baby.

150
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:00,500
Yeah, but it was, uh, and at that point, I began to get distorted.

151
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,720
More distorted than you could ever believe.

152
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:10,860
I went out, having a good old time in Boston with Cleve Duncan, the mighty Cleve.

153
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,000
Met some of the swinging erudites whose tapes I've played so many times.

154
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,080
And came back to Cleve's house and spread evil fluids all over his couch.

155
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,080
And the, and the, the...

156
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,240
The expensive carpet belonging to these selfsame Billy Goons.

157
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,640
And I showed them what happens when a Dallas subgenius comes to town to Boston.

158
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,720
Oh, but you, but, uh...

159
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,660
Oh, shoot.

160
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,260
Forget it. Just forget it. You don't care.

161
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,120
You're just a bunch of, a bunch of bobbies.

162
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,540
Bobbies everywhere.

163
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,520
Doctors for Bob played in Boston.

164
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,060
They did indeed.

165
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,460
And this is what they played.

166
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,940
They, you won't let them.

167
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,120
You won't let them play in Dallas, will ya?

168
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:02,820
You won't get, get it together to put together a show, a might, nothing like what they put together in other towns.

169
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,160
Nay.

170
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,260
But this is what Doctors for Bob did.

171
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,420

00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,100
this evening,

177
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,320
I would just like to take this opportunity

178
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,580
to state briefly

179
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,700
and for the record

180
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,560
that my fellow

181
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Doctors for Bob and Matthew

182
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,540
are members

183
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,620
in good standing.

184
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,100
In, of a church.

185
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,360
But not just any church,

186
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,840
or the church to which we belong,

187
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,040
just happens to be,

188
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,700
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

189
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,980
the world's only bogus true religion.

190
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,200
Of course, I am referring to

191
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,540
The Church of the Subgenius.

192
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,080
This one's dedicated to Reverend Cleve Duncan.

193
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,300
Now the church of the sub-genius.

194
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,080
As founded by.

195
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,100
They all bobbed off.

196
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,820
Said it's hell's master of slack.

197
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,100
1953 is the prime religion of the future.

198
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,420
United.

199
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,300
Superior mutants.

200
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,420
Social renegades.

201
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,920
Twisted geniuses.

202
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,620
And sci-fi sinners.

203
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,260
In a worldwide rampage.

204
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,660
Of immorality.

205
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,680
And profane.

206
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,440
Yucks and grins.

207
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,880
Yucks and grins which will hopefully.

208
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,760
Inevitably.

209
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,000
Lead us directly to a commodity all too late.

210
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,780
Today's modern Jedi.

211
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,980
Jagogo society.

212
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,620
Not commodity free.

213
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,700
And the reason why.

214
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,260
Is slack.

215
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,120
Slack is what the conspiracy takes away from us.

216
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,840
Slack is what the conspiracy deprives us of.

217
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,160
Slack is our way.

218
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,000
Grabbing life.

219
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,160
By the lapel.

220
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,300
Fuck.

221
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,620
I can't say that.

222
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,180
Now back in the 50's.

223
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,260
Bob himself noticed.

224
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,640
A decided lack.

225
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,780
Of slack.

226
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,900
In our society.

227
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:50,900


228
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:50,900


229
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:50,900


230
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:50,900


231
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:50,900


232
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:50,900


233
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:50,900


234
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,520
In our culture.

235
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,960
He noticed.

236
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,640
An awful prevalence of normalcy.

237
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,120
He noticed.

238
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,280
That the normals.

239
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,380
Formed a vast conspiracy.

240
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,980
Against the different.

241
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,820
An insidious conspiracy.

242
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,920
Dedicated to squelching.

243
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,500
Our natural rogue instinct.

244
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,900
Dedicated to wiping out.

245
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,500
Our own factory.

246
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,020
Dedicated and short.

247
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,240
To the total.

248
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,220
And utter.

249
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,680
Eradication.

250
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,660
The original slack with which we were all born.

251
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,840
Won't Bob want to fight this conspiracy ladies and gentlemen?

252
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,040
What better way I ask ye.

253
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,440
The mellow foundation.

254
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Of a major.

255
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,680
New.

256
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,600
World.

257
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,300
Legend.

258
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,740
Catch the church in some genius.

259
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,780
Prince Bob.

260
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,180
Help me somebody.

261
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,260
Bob.

262
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:48,880
Help me somebody.

263
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:48,880


264
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,120
Help me somebody.

265
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,940
I, to my soul was born.

266
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,680
Straight batter.

267
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,920
And spirit through foot.

268
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,360
To keep the same terror.

269
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,200
That is the question, Father.

270
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,200


271
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,000
I am so angry.

272
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,060
Where is thatdon?

273
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,060


274
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,560
Too many broken words?

275
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:05,660


276
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:05,660


277
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:05,740
Andodo, how dink ye hearns?

278
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,920
Would I live with dah heavy mutina Genau wie ichunching die slipende.

279
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:08,980
Fen습니다agit movimento of a man.

280
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,380
He can't be eine Sabine Sol condiciones zu veralten.

281
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,000
We won three titles on here.

282
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,440
One of an annual Mini Durzein.

283
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,700
And another of an annual Not Geez Accusat.

284
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:16,900
But I want to first say.

285
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:16,960
that I thought they were common.

286
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,060
Their script was kind.

287
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,060


288
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:25,700
CBS, NBC, the U.S. government, CIA, FBI, Lutheran Church, Missouri City, Alcantara Church, Jewish Affairs League, Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission.

289
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,540
A little more of co-operative individuals who see to the next level.

290
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,880
Do you see the conspiracies?

291
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:43,420
The Eliopters, Book of Old Brand, the Men in Black, the Green Energy Demons, the advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures from the hollow earth,

292
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:52,580
the henchmen of media, the Yucca Teas, but even they don't have the full story, ladies and gentlemen.

293
00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:00,220
I'm here to tell you tonight that the conspiracy exists as none other than Jehovah One,

294
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:08,780
alien space god arrived from some corporate sin galaxy, and his star is the removal.

295
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,160
Now, many of you here tonight.

296
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:22,560
Many of you here tonight, I'm sure, view the Church of the Subgenius as a bit old, demonic.

297
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,440
You're right, it is demonic.

298
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:36,000
But we are speaking of an infinite demons here, when the Church of the Subgenius does recognize every major deity of every world religion.

299
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,480
Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, Muhammad, Elvis, Mo.

300
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,160
Hank, Arnold, Bach.

301
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:56,860
Rather than having one central authority, great speaker, the Church of the Subgenius possesses an entire pantheon.

302
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,520
Or subgenium, as it were.

303
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,600
One referred to as Shonduration Personal Savior.

304
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,400
Now, you're sure to understand anything from...

305
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,280
Multistage vibrators.

306
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,460
Sending white noise signals to the very epithelial centers of your brain.

307
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,220
To a multi-level, pyramidal religion.

308
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,580
Guaranteed to empty your pockets and send your soul to heaven.

309
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,540
Hallelujah!

310
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,480
It can be anywhere from...

311
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,160
Hallelujah, dear friends.

312
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,780
Oh, hallelujah, hallelujah.

313
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,080
Oh, you ain't heard nothing yet.

314
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,400
Oh, that's what they do in Boston.

315
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,060
Boston, yeah.

316
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,380
That's the kind of shows we can put on in Boston.

317
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:51,320
When was the last time you heard a subgenius revival like that in Dallas or Arkansas?

318
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:51,860
Huh?

319
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,140
Oh, you don't care?

320
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:53,920
You don't care?

321
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,180
I'll tell you what.

322
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,000
Wednesday night.

323
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,960
Last Wednesday night, I was in...

324
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,640
We did the video show.

325
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,440
The video show.

326
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,340
In Boston.

327
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,720
At the Institute of Contemporary Art.

328
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,920
As opposed to the Dallas video show.

329
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,000
Which we tried to hold in the multi-million dollar Mistral building.

330
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:33,800
Where the pinks literally were unable to handle the relatively simple VHS 3 quarter inch tape and cassette tape and live mic mix.

331
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,920
Why, for some reason, these foolish Yankees were able to do better than Texans.

332
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,900
How about that?

333
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,220
Not only that, but we sold out.

334
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:53,740
Sold out to the point where there were 200 people were turned away from the Boston video show.

335
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,160
And it was mighty.

336
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,540
Oh yeah, we can show.

337
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,640
We can show the finished version of Arise.

338
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,380
The subgenius video.

339
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,320
The movie.

340
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,000
Two.

341
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,460
There.

342
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,980
But not in Dallas, no.

343
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,040
You don't care.

344
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,900
There's not one of you out there who can set up a video show like this.

345
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:12,900


346
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,520
Like these pathetic Yankees can somehow do.

347
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,980
Oh yeah.

348
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,440
We had a butt-reaming show.

349
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,520
And what do we get into?

350
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:28,140
And not only that, but the Bostonites actually made their own video about how Bob is invading the public schools.

351
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,600
The elementary schools.

352
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,280
In Boston.

353
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:42,900
Friends, even though in Boston, Massachusetts, the subgeniuses are invited and paid for by state funding to perform at Boston.

354
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,620
Art, major art museums at MIT.

355
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,420
Art colleges, dear friends.

356
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:54,420
Yet, the Dallas Public Library refuses to carry the book of the subgenius.

357
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,180
Even when two copies are given to them by Buttnaken.

358
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,040
And the audience.

359
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,500
The audiences in Boston.

360
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:11,660
Here in Dallas, oh, we might get one or two pathetic Bobbies.

361
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:18,400
Who feel like it's, it's, you know, that we've commanded them to heckle us.

362
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,780
And so they heckle us half-heartedly.

363
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:26,720
But in Boston, dear friends, you get hecklers so intense with that Boston accent.

364
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,520
That kind of, hey you, hey buddy you, go ahead and love for Bob.

365
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,040
Oh, it was wonderful, friends.

366
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,960
It was wonderful.

367
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:41,520
The revival, the revival started with Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger as MC.

368
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,960
Wearing his Masonic fez.

369
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,000
Opening the show.

370
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,920
Oh, mighty man.

371
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:54,500
He ignored the firecrackers thrown from the audience.

372
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,560
The screams from the audience.

373
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,360
And friends, that's what we need.

374
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,500
We need those screams.

375
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
We need that hate.

376
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,620
We feed off your hate.

377
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,380
That's why I don't get out and talk to y'all.

378
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,720
Because I'm too busy.

379
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,900
In the words of Jane O'Hara, it concludes, I'm too busy.

380
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,060
I'm too busy hating.

381
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,820
I wish I could hate you as much as I hated them.

382
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,620
Oh, what a wonderful show.

383
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,300
And I'm going to take you into that.

384
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:26,420
The funniest subgenius, Dr. Sterno Kickhaver of Doctors for Bob from Little Rock, Arkansas.

385
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:37,040
Of course, there's nobody else from Dallas besides me and Buck that can dare to get up and rant and scream in the face of a hostile and yet loving audience.

386
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,020
Because, you know, the two are one.

387
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,580
Oh, listen to that.

388
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,840
Slick music from Mishima.

389
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,440
Cool.

390
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm going to take you into that revival, that revival right now.

391
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:59,960
Actually, we're going to get just a little bit of pre-revival tape as Sterno presents us with the new version of the brag of the subgenius.

392
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,900
And then we will go directly into that revival.

393
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,340
Subgenius.

394
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,740
World.

395
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,500
One.

396
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,260
Two.

397
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,440
One, two, three.

398
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,640
Subgenius.

399
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,620
Tonight, we are going to subject you people to the most unspeakable horrors.

400
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:27,100
And to the greatest, to the greatest spiritual uplifting experience and praise of Bob Dobbs.

401
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:36,340
And his name, a name you all know, his name you all know, is Pope Sterno Kickhaver.

402
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,120
And Sterno's the first one.

403
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,100
Evening, children.

404
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:54,760
I am Reverend Sterno Dobbs, the Pope of all Arkansas.

405
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:02,320
And I pick the terror of the God out of my nose.

406
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,840
Pardon my language, but yay!

407
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,340
Let the sons of God and man bear witness.

408
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,620
I torched the devil to prove my fitness.

409
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,820
I'm armed and loaded.

410
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,460
I'm a fission reactor.

411
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,720
I don't consider mortality to be a factor.

412
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:29,420
I proved the anti-virgins weren't so posh when I gave her a high-protein tonsil wash.

413
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,420
I have that evil eye.

414
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,600
I carry mojo bags.

415
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,320
I tire out chains as much as I can.

416
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,340
I'm a fissure-pumped rock jack.

417
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,380
I sign a retarded space bastard across the conmode.

418
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,280
When I drop my drawers, even Mother Nature follows.

419
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,140
I eat black holes for breakfast.

420
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,280
I steer my own evolution.

421
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,600
I think backwards, Bubba.

422
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,120
That's my solution.

423
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,500
So step aside, all you buttless pigs.

424
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,020
I'm a crime-fighting master criminal, Fuggy Jigs.

425
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,560
I'll freeze your seed before it hits the bed.

426
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,940
I have a triple backbone.

427
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,540
I eat my dead.

428
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,100
I swam to the Lunar Triangle and didn't get wet.

429
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,000
I fart plutonium.

430
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,440
I drink my sweat.

431
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,020
I achieved nirvana and took it home with me.

432
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,940
And I'm here to tell you, it ain't worth a peed.

433
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,200
I've been crowbarred with my meat ass.

434
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,100
I leave the plague for my nether part, and that's a fact.

435
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,560
I'm the big-footed devil of level 17.

436
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,180
I communicate without wires or strings.

437
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,560
I cram coca leaves right into my arm veins.

438
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
I'm a screamer.

439
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
I'm a laugher.

440
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,780
I've got six brains.

441
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,440
I'm insured for acts of God and Satan.

442
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,580
I believe my lizard and keep time awake.

443
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,680
I'm fuel injected.

444
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,080
I'll live forever.

445
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,080
I ran out of heaven with that.

446
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,980
I'm a needy limber.

447
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,700
They call me 666.

448
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,720
And that's just fine.

449
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:14,240
But I'm here to tell you tonight, children, that my slack factor is 999.

450
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:29,460
Now, try to imagine, dear friends, a situation where you're sitting in an audience.

451
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,400
You've paid $5.

452
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,960
You're not in Texas.

453
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,840
Because in Texas, they don't let this kind of thing happen.

454
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:43,340
Even compared to Boston, where they supposedly burn books and throw things at subgeniuses.

455
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,680
You still, nevertheless, that's where it happens.

456
00:25:47,440 --> 00:26:01,200
Say you're sitting there, and after Sterno is finished with the new brag, out comes Pope, the most potent of all subgenius preachers, Pope David N. Meyer.

457
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,180
Pope of the great Pacific Northwest and all of New York and all of Idaho.

458
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,260
And delivers his greatest rant yet.

459
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,760
Soon to be played.

460
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:26,820
But imagine a stage where there's this, aside from the tableau, the giant painting of Jim Jones selling Kool-Aid to thousands of people who are dying all around him.

461
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,120
And the giant 12-foot long pipe lowered down from the ceiling.

462
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,900
On the stage.

463
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:41,880
Imagine also the Nazi art girls who are put up on pedestals on the side as Pope Meyer preaches.

464
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:46,780
The Nazi art girls looking, instructed at all times to look bored.

465
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,680
Even when his choir is singing old 60s songs.

466
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,620
These girls flash cards to show you the rules of the church.

467
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,680
Soon to be played.

468
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:09,240
Imagine after Pope Meyer, who in fact has to be surrounded by bodyguards with guns because of his incredible charisma.

469
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,160
Finally, Reverend Stang, that is myself, comes out.

470
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,880
And after my rant, I'm attacked, literally attacked by groupies.

471
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:23,540
And am forced to indulge in live sex on stage.

472
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,760
That happened in Boston, friends.

473
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,020
And does it happen in Dallas? No.

474
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,220
No.

475
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,760
Because in Dallas, what do we get? The Twilight Room.

476
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:46,800
We get maybe a little video show at Bart Weiss, one of the few people with any ability to distinguish subgeniusness from pinkness.

477
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,580
May put on a little show here.

478
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,080
But nay, nay. Nothing like the horror.

479
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,200
The intense horror.

480
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,440
Oh. Oh.

481
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,000
As you can tell, I'm having trouble controlling myself.

482
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,340
It's been a long weekend, dear friends.

483
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:10,100
Doctors for Bob, Jane or Hyperclete's ranting, D.K. Jones playing live music on stage, the same music I've been playing on this show.

484
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,320
Well, why come we can't do these shows in Dallas?

485
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,840
A. Do you like alternative rock and roll?

486
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:17,720
Yeah!

487
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,940
Well, in Dallas, Fort Worth is only one station. That's the hottest station on the planet Earth.

488
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,520
Can you win?

489
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,920
Kick it!

490
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,980
That's right, all you night guards.

491
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,900
Cats and kitties, this is the Nightman calling from the big, bad city.

492
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,820
KNO in the station that knows no equal.

493
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,420
The proud voice of the rockin' people is proud to bring you alternative rock and roll.

494
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,620
Seven days of the week.

495
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,960
If you ain't heard it here, it is square.

496
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,100
It is square, dear friends. It is so square.

497
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,740
And I'm gonna take you to, once again, we're gonna go into that revival in Boston.

498
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:57,660
And I should mention that Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger, the MC of the Boston Show,

499
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,160
just called. I was unable to put him on the air.

500
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:08,780
But he issues a dare, a dare to you Dallas wimp, pathetic, weasel-faced, slack vampires

501
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:17,480
that call yourselves subgeniuses to merely attempt to set up the kind of show that they did in Boston.

502
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,920
And here's a little bit of that very selfsame show.

503
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,180
Dr.

504
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:34,220
The Reverend Dr. Pope, Mr. M.D. David N. Meyer ascends the stage to preach.

505
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,080
Surrounded by beautiful dancing groups.

506
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,940
Thank you children, thank you children.

507
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:43,280
First of all, thank you for your patience, thank you for your money, thank you for being here this evening.

508
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,420
I know you've had a long time to come here tonight.

509
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,340
I know you've been sitting out there for a long, a whole lot of music listening.

510
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,740
I know you've been sitting out there for a very long time.

511
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,940
And you know, sometimes subgenius shows are very rough and hysterical.

512
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,760
But we should remember that all of us together are brothers in this great church.

513
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,640
And that's why I want each and every one of you to turn to the person on your right and say to them,

514
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,140
Howdy neighbor!

515
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,100
Howdy neighbor!

516
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,180
And now I want you to turn to the person on your left and I want you to say to them,

517
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,340
Howdy neighbor!

518
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,480
Howdy neighbor!

519
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:22,900
Howdy neighbor!

520
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,760
And Pope Meyer descends into the audience to shake hands with each person saying howdy neighbor

521
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:35,000
even though he has bodyguards frisking each person before he actually shakes them.

522
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,760
Now that we've all said howdy neighbor in Oregon, please,

523
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,060
Now that we've all said howdy neighbor, we're in a subgenius sort of mood here.

524
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,540
You know, a lot of people, they say to me, David!

525
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,060
David, say to me, Bob David!

526
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,140
Why do you have these two bodyguards?

527
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:09,200
Why do you come to a city as peaceful and cultured as L.C.

528
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,140
You've got here to behold?

529
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,260
Why, why, why?

530
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,300
You have these bodyguards?

531
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:12,860
Why?

532
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,840
You told them there's a very good wine for that.

533
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,920
And you who were a club spin three years ago should remember that when the church was up...

534
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,060
Now, dear friends, just listen.

535
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,440
Listen to that audience in that devial.

536
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:33,440
And we're going to continue with a different section of the devial after we get past the X-rated portion.

537
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:49,900
I mean, do we get Dallas audiences simultaneously loving and hating Bob to the extent that they throw firecrackers, cherry bombs, smoke bombs in pure avalanche?

538
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,940
Is that a consideration of the preachers of Bob?

539
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,540
Nay.

540
00:31:52,680 --> 00:32:04,680
In fact, we don't even get the preachers of Bob in Dallas, except maybe old Charlie at the Twilight Room, which is long gone, might bring us on to their little tiny stage.

541
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,040
Old K-N-O-N might allow an hour of slack.

542
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:15,580
A few nice old Republican radio hosts or a black lady on the K-E-R-A might invite us on.

543
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,080
But K-Z-E-W?

544
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,820
Oh, they make fun of us.

545
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:29,800
The library, even when given books, turns them down, even if Ken Kesey calls it the best thing he's read in ten years.

546
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,060
Well, I'm sorry.

547
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,920
That's just the way this city seems to be.

548
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,720
Once again, I must say, sour grapes?

549
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,920
I think it's highly deserved.

550
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:49,920


551
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,740
world's beaten in their head.

552
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,640
But do you know why I preach truth?

553
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,500
Do you know why I preach the word of God?

554
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,440
Because it makes me feel cool.

555
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,040
Yes, darling.

556
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,640
Once a year, I can run a hundred word of God because it makes me feel cool.

557
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,680
And feeling cool is the essence of subgenius noob.

558
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
Subgenius is no longer your cool.

559
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,320
And if something else is the truth subgenius knows, Joe, when we talk about conspiracy,

560
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,620
I know that you're all cultured, I know you're all literary, I know that you can be

561
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,820
thinking incentives, but there's one thing you should know.

562
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,000
That conspiracy is no metaphor.

563
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,420
It's the truth.

564
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:29,420


565
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:29,420


566
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:29,420


567
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,180
Second days ofёлion.

568
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:45,200
We wantuary 되는 meal an hour per day.

569
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,000
Third days, hour per day ever.

570
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,240
And so does verification.

571
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,340
But very importantly, where all this win-win is going to go, let it look easy and let it

572
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,460
go.

573
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,300
A new world sal amis.

574
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,200
Zerminalist.

575
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,400
My life's ultimate j 해� sheepish showy, every week.

576
00:33:59,420 --> 00:33:59,420


577
00:33:59,440 --> 00:33:59,640
Who?

578
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,420
God!

579
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:00,840
Who?

580
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,560
God!

581
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:01,980
Who?

582
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,320
God!

583
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:03,420
Who?

584
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:03,420


585
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,280
Who?

586
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:04,280


587
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:04,920
Who?

588
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,200
God!

589
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,340
Who?

590
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,220
So if you want to be true to subgenius,

591
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,180
of course you have to follow the rules of the church more than others.

592
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,640
Now the first rule of the church of subgenius,

593
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,140
I think you know very well.

594
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,920
The first rule of the church of subgenius is...

595
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,780
God rules!

596
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,000
That subgenius must...

597
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,800
Have...

598
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,160
A...

599
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:23,780
World!

600
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,120
A... World!

601
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,840
A... World!

602
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,760
A... World!

603
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,320
A... World!

604
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,040
A... World!

605
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,440
A... World!

606
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,620
A... World!

607
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:34,860
A... World!

608
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:34,880
A... World!

609
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,380
King...

610
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,140
Or she...

611
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,080
King of Norway!

612
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,320
Have...

613
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,520
A... World!

614
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,120
Now the second rule of the church of subgenius,

615
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,860
you know from my video on the rules,

616
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,380
could be called into some question.

617
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,540
But it plays very well.

618
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,740
The second rule of the church of subgenius is...

619
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,520
Too much is always better than none!

620
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,260
Yeah!

621
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
Again, too much!

622
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,560
Too much!

623
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,640
Too much!

624
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,040


625
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,660
Too much!

626
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,700
It's always better than none!

627
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,580
That's right!

628
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,360
That's right!

629
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:06,920
That's right!

630
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,580
Well you know,

631
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,640
the third rule of the church of subgenius,

632
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,600
to rule when it's violated so often,

633
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,780
it's hard to redeem its rule.

634
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,520
I mean the 10 commandments are violated often.

635
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,760
Does that diminish their validity in any way?

636
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,200
Say no?

637
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,880
No!

638
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,820
It didn't happen.

639
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,620
So, when this rule is violated on a daily basis,

640
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,760
does that diminish its validity in any way?

641
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,260
No!

642
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,060
No!

643
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:31,640
No!

644
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,060
Now, the third rule that you're taught in subgenius is...

645
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,520
Try to be funny!

646
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,140
If you don't have a sense of humor,

647
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,300
don't try to be funny.

648
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:40,960
No!

649
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,220
I told you all about the video you could do in your day,

650
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,580
but now you're really fine, baby.

651
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,520
Can I have a life?

652
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:46,980
Can you please?

653
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,460
I guess no.

654
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:48,820
Alright.

655
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,220
Now, the next rule of the church of subgenius is...

656
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,320
No!

657
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:52,800
No!

658
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,340
No!

659
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,720
You will pay...

660
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,300
No!

661
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,860
Absolutely not, Tony!

662
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,580
I need to know what you really think.

663
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,800
When you read that spin magazine to find out about those critical independent singles,

664
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,140
did you get that spin magazine?

665
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,960
Really say no!

666
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,660
Absolutely not!

667
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,500
But children, when you give your life to the church of the subgenius,

668
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,200
when you tithe to Bob, that is just Bob,

669
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:19,500
when you open your mind and your heart and your temple to Bob,

670
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,180
truly you will pay to know what you really think.

671
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,120
But for once, you'll get value.

672
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,200
For your daughter.

673
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,800
Oh, yes, dear friends.

674
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,720
That is the way you do a subgenius diva.

675
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,700
I'm not a rabble rouser, but I'm not above that.

676
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,560
I am after all.

677
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,200
No.

678
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,160
I can't play the next rule because it's X-rated.

679
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,980
It's the most rabble-rousing rule of the church of the subgenius,

680
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:48,580
and it has to do with what happens to you if you can't take a joke.

681
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,600
And I think most of you can figure that out.

682
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,040
After Pope Meyer...

683
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,580
What happened?

684
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,580
How come we can't have Pope Meyer here in Dallas, Texas?

685
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,980
Why is there no arts...

686
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,300
I mean, this was funded by the state of Massachusetts, dear friends.

687
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,340
How come we can't rook the state of Texas into doing it?

688
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,580
Why?

689
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,920
Because we're local.

690
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,020
That's why.

691
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,600
Because anybody who's in the same state as the person writing the funding checks

692
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,040
couldn't possibly be very good because he's in the same state.

693
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,080
It's sickening, dear friends.

694
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,820
It is indeed a sickening situation for the state of the arts.

695
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,400
Pope Meyer was followed by myself, who I don't have tape of yet,

696
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,720
and you've heard it all before anyway, and D.K. Jones.

697
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,400
But then there was Doctors for Bob.

698
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,160
And they shocked the living gee out of me.

699
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,320
Listen to my tale, dear friends.

700
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,560
I'm not a sissy.

701
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,440
But why?

702
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,860
Why do you call me mad?

703
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,840
Could a madman have written songs such as these?

704
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,860
I think not.

705
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,220
I'm not mad.

706
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,080
I'm merely an ordinary person seeking life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

707
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:13,180
My pursuit of happiness includes machine gunning 127 innocent children.

708
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,780
If that's mad, go ahead, lock me up.

709
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:23,300
Just because I enjoy washing my face in the blood of infants, that's because I'm mad.

710
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,300


711
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,300


712
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,300


713
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,300


714
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,300


715
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,300


716
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,300


717
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,300


718
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,300


719
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,300


720
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,300


721
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,300


722
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,300


723
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,300


724
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,800
Is there any reason to lock me up?

725
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,600
I think not.

726
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,260
I've even got a piece of paper that says my mind is still okay.

727
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,060
Hell, I bet that guy down at the employment agency who wouldn't give me a job just because

728
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,620
I'd been locked up one time, that he ain't got a piece of paper that says his mind is

729
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,140
still okay.

730
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,880
Hell, I tried to tell them it was not me.

731
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,380
It was the green energy demons, but they merely laughed at me.

732
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,280
But now those green energy demons are ruling, but they're not going to let me go.

733
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,280


734
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,280


735
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,280


736
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,280
I'm glad that they're not laughing right so hard now, are they?

737
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:02,720
But that wasn't nearly as bad as that time they shocked the living gee out of me.

738
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,300
Oh, yes, dear friend.

739
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,360
And you've heard the Shock the Living Gee Out of Me song so many times.

740
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,440
I won't play the rest of it here.

741
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,260
It wasn't the best.

742
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,460
That's not the best recording in the world, but that was live.

743
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:23,280
That's what we get in other states that seem to have more respect for the word of God.

744
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,280


745
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:23,560
Yeah, exactly, Bob.

746
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:29,640
Following Doctors for Bob, of course, we had the traditional Kool Aid, pills and tapes

747
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:41,280
dispensation where at the mighty Boston ministers and myself and Jaynor Hyperglitz walked out

748
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,020
and dispensed the Kool Aid during the Night of Slack there in Bostontown.

749
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,900
Dispensed the pills of Bob.

750
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,820
Bob Taylor Haynesa, zine dub frames page two, and then Jack creepy guy from a great

751
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,280
show B칠 Ch meteorite at the Boston Times show.

752
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:53,280


753
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,460
of pills, of which you've heard so many times, is actually not, these aren't the kind of cheap

754
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:05,200
conspiracy street drugs you're thinking of. Generally, these are pills which contain nothing

755
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:13,200
more than that which is inside Bob's head. In other words, they contain your faith. If you have faith

756
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:20,920
in Bob, you get off. If you don't have faith, well, then it's a waste of your money. That five dollars

757
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,960
you spent for that revival is worth nothing. When that giant 12-foot pipe lowered down from the ceiling

758
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:38,640
and Pagan Kennedy, the, what, I'm in love, man. Pagan Kennedy, this young lady from Boston who came out

759
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:47,660
and preached on the word of Connie, Bob's wife, to an audience which by that time had become rowdy

760
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,160
beyond anything I've ever seen in Texas.

761
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:57,460
San Francisco, Philadelphia, Canada, or any other place we've preached. I mean, this was a rowdy,

762
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:03,560
subgenius crowd, friends. These people were drunk, drunk beyond your wildest nightmares. They were

763
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:09,820
throwing things. They were trying to kill us. Oh, some of the comebacks that, well, let's see, I've got a list

764
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:17,520
of the comebacks of these hecklers of love and hate. We weren't sure whether these were Christian

765
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,060
hate groups or people, or just subgeniuses.

766
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:24,360
We were just trying to get the people who had taken to heart our commandment to hate and love Bob.

767
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:33,660
Sterno, when pelted with rotten fruit, said, yeah, I remember my first beer, too.

768
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:44,780
Janers come back to the heckling phrase of suck my blank enunciated to the audience.

769
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:48,200
You're going to have to pay more than five dollars to see that, boy.

770
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:56,180
And of course, I had to stand up there and tell them, when I was a 13-year-old adolescent,

771
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,000
trying to prove how brave and cool and intelligent I was by throwing things from the

772
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:11,580
darkness of a huge audience crowd, at least in those days, we threw cherry bombs, hand grenades,

773
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:18,940
bags of bobby poop, friends. Oh, yes. But what did we get here? What did we get in Dallas?

774
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,940
We don't even get revives.

775
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,060


776
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:44,540
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I have with me the sacred scribe, Reverend Ivan Stang from the Mother Church.

777
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,680
Father Church.

778
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,780
The Father Church.

779
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,400
Praise Bob.

780
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,780
Praise Bob.

781
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,920
There's some Connie.

782
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,840
I sit here to worship Bob.

783
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:52,320
Why?

784
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,640
And that's.

785
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,060
He'll be with us shortly.

786
00:42:59,160 --> 00:42:59,740
So hold on.

787
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,580
Yeah, I can't.

788
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:00,980
I can't.

789
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,600
I got you.

790
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,520
But it's not going.

791
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,700
It wasn't going over there.

792
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:18,620
Now, dear friends, what you're about to hear is a tape proving that you don't just get slightly amateurish DJ action out of K&L.

793
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,740
And this was a station.

794
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,520
And Boston who wanted to do a thing about Bob.

795
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:32,720
They they they wanted to do a phone in interview from across town with me and and Jan Johnson, the mighty producer of this show.

796
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:42,720
And you will hear Jan Johnson and I wondering whether we were on the air or not, because the DJ himself did not think we were.

797
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,600
But actually, actually, we were indeed going out over the air with this conversation.

798
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:55,720
But I I'm sorry.

799
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,760
I'm sorry.

800
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:57,440
I'm sorry.

801
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:57,440


802
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,040
Yeah.

803
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,900
Put your hands on.

804
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,620
Oh, I did.

805
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,440
I put your land on the radio.

806
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,100
But your wallet on the radio.

807
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,940
Put your wallet on the radio and you'll be able to hear the word of Bob coming through.

808
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,300
It's called minister.

809
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,280
Called on.

810
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:16,880
Probably.

811
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:19,420
Called.

812
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:19,720
Called.

813
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:19,720


814
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:19,900
Called.

815
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,200
Yep.

816
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,640
Bob called me home.

817
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,600
Said he was going to call me home.

818
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:30,640
We didn't raise $750 on the last hour of flat pledge.

819
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,940
When we did.

820
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:33,900
Call.

821
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,600
Fortunately, there was a wire.

822
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,480
We're not on.

823
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,280
I don't know if there's this.

824
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:45,760
Yeah.

825
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,740
I need to be on my hearing.

826
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,320
Yeah.

827
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:49,540
Yeah.

828
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:49,720


829
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:49,720


830
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:49,720


831
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:49,720


832
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:49,720


833
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:49,720


834
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:49,720


835
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:49,720


836
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:49,720


837
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:49,720


838
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:49,720


839
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:49,720


840
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,600
I didn't I didn't think.

841
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:50,920
You know.

842
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:06,280
Let me tell you the story of J.R.

843
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,700
Bartholomew.

844
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,620
He walked with the gods.

845
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:17,120
He wore a silly grin and he smoked a suit.

846
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,720
He fought for the people.

847
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:19,720


848
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:19,720


849
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:19,720


850
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:19,720


851
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:19,720


852
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:19,720


853
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:19,720


854
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:19,720


855
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,620
A conspiracy every day of his life.

856
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:30,060
He whips the stench of many a man.

857
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:35,480
Fathers many children with his mighty glance.

858
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:40,540
He founded the religion in which we all believe.

859
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:46,020
Brought us all the slack that everybody needs.

860
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:51,420
He was the greatest salesman the world had ever seen.

861
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,660
He could sell the parts after he ate all the beans.

862
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,820
He could sell a pilot to a common fly.

863
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:07,160
All of us who knew him figured he would never die.

864
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:13,200
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs.

865
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,000
He was a...

866
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,700
A real man and brave.

867
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:24,020
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs.

868
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,280
He's lying dead in his grave.

869
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,320
Without Bob, what are we gonna do?

870
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:38,680
When the men from Planet X go marching through.

871
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:45,200
Our whole race is stuck in jail with only Bob to raise the bale.

872
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,000
But now he's...

873
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:46,480
He's dead.

874
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,080
So we'll do what we do.

875
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:58,420
He founded the city known as Dobbs Town.

876
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,700
Deep in Malaysia, it was rarely found.

877
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:08,680
There he studied forbidden science until that fatal day.

878
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,060
When he came up to his block in the city by the bay.

879
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,360
Few had ever seen him.

880
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,540
Few had ever dared.

881
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,200
Most had no occasion.

882
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,920
Others just plain scared.

883
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,240
So hundreds came to San Francisco for the event of the eighth.

884
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:36,580
When the Holy Smile of the World would step out on the stage.

885
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,640
Bob looked to the left.

886
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,380
Then he looked to the right.

887
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,000
Then he strode out with confidence.

888
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,000


889
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,460
confidence into the bright spotlight.

890
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:54,060
He waved at all the cheering fans as he stepped up to the mic.

891
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:59,220
When a praise-assassin's bullet sent him to eternal night.

892
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:06,100
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs,

893
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,860
proud to their savior had come.

894
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,980
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs,

895
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:20,420
was treated by the flash of a gun.

896
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,500
Without Bob, we have plenty to fear

897
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,780
as we swiftly approach that fatal year.

898
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:37,060
Before in 1998, he would have set the record straight,

899
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,760
but now he's dead, so we're doomed.

900
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:40,880
So we're here.

901
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,820
This has been the story of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

902
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:58,020
Some call him Messiah, others call him fraud.

903
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:03,220
I hope that before 98, that the word gets out

904
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:08,180
that Bob Dobbs was the only guy we could not do without.

905
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,840
I hope so.

906
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:13,660
Sometimes are upon us and things don't look so good.

907
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:18,420
Bob Dobbs had the answer but was seldom understood.

908
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,960
When in a heap of trouble our books are in the red.

909
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:29,240
There is no joy on the football, now that Bob is dead.

910
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,800
So we pray to fight Jesus to do battle for Bob's soul.

911
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:39,680
Do who's wrong and who's need of more strength?

912
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:39,840
Who's wrong and who's need of more strength?

913
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,100
Who's fitting our hopes?

914
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,260
We pray to he who needs no name that we might need to slack.

915
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,620
And we pray to God, please send our body back.

916
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,820
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs.

917
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:04,980
Our lives are worse without you.

918
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,480
Center.

919
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,840
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs.

920
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:15,380
Who, dear, what will we do?

921
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,540
Without Bob we are in a tight fix.

922
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,540
When the exes come to kill us just for kicks.

923
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:31,900
If Bob were not in his grave all these subgena would be saved.

924
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,740
But he is so our chance is our nix.

925
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:45,500
And his body is our only hope.

926
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,240
We pray to God to save us from the trouble of death.

927
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,980
Who, dear, what will we do?

928
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,860
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs.

929
00:50:53,680 --> 00:51:01,780
Who, dear, what will we do?

930
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,420
Without Bob we are in a tight fix.

931
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:09,840
When the exes come to kill us just for kicks.

932
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:09,840


933
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:15,700
Who, dear, what will we do?

934
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,620
When the exes come to kill us just for kicks.

935
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,320
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs.

936
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:24,320


937
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,420
Who, dear, what will we do?

938
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,540
Without Bob we are in a tight fix.

939
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,300
When the exes come to kill us just for kicks.

940
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,740
Who, dear, what will we do?

941
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:45,080
sound the way I do, was produced by Jan Johnson, the editor of Zontar, the magazine from Venus,

942
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:53,900
which you don't even know. You're so blind. You're so unable to even write for information

943
00:51:53,900 --> 00:52:00,200
to the P.O. box that I'm going to give at the end of this broadcast that you don't even know

944
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:06,720
about these things. You think that hipness involves buying the records in Sound Warehouse.

945
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:15,900
Oh, that's fine. Fine. That's hipness, baby. And not just Jan Johnson, but J-Hope, the mighty J-Hope

946
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:22,640
10, Bleepo Abernathy, Tim Clifford, and of course, Jonathan Delgado, who brought the church air to

947
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:28,780
the party afterwards. Tapes coming up soon. Michael Whelan, famous. Well, actually, he didn't have

948
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,180
anything to do with it. I'm not even sure.

949
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:36,360
I'm not sure he was there, but he sure was. He sure told us he was about to be the famous.

950
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:44,740
And Betsy, Betsy, man. Yeah, Betsy. We all remember in Boston. Oh, you can cuss on radio

951
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:51,620
stations like this. You can play the Janer device tape uncut. I can't play even two minutes of it

952
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:59,980
here because you don't care. Because because during the pledge drive,

953
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:05,600
I was like, oh, what can we get? Seven hundred and fifty bucks. Great. I have to die for seven

954
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:12,320
hundred and fifty bucks. Queen Tontaleo was there. The queen of the subgenius church. You didn't even

955
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:19,200
know we had a queen, did you? The fluids that I left on Dr. Cruel's couch. Dr. Cruel of the

956
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,600
fabulous Billy Goons. The guest, the famous guest, the famous subgenius guest we have there, such as

957
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:29,300
Reverend Onan Canobite, Bob Black and Hakeem Bay.

958
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:39,560
Evil, evil, anti-authoritarian, famous writers that of no Dallasite has ever heard of because of the blinders on your head.

959
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:46,040
Like an ostrich eating pizza with his head stuck in the sand, dear friends. Donna Causey

960
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:54,620
of False Positive magazine. Nancy Regalia of New Orleans came up. Man, that woman,

961
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:59,840
what a woman. She's got some stories to tell. And she sold about five hundred bucks worth of stuff

962
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,180
for a woman. And she sold about five hundred bucks worth of stuff for a woman. And she sold about

963
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:30,180
five hundred bucks worth of stuff for a woman. And she sold about five hundred bucks worth of stuff for us. Cat lady of the Good Sex for Mutants League, which you could apply to and achieve that good sex, you mutants, if you would but dare to write to Bob at P.O. Box 140306 here in Dallas, Texas, 75214. Tentatively a convenience. The saint of performance horror of the church was there and in true form in the tradition of the church.

964
00:54:30,180 --> 00:55:00,160
Tentatively a convenience in the church of the subgenius got himself arrested by throwing the beer money, which was in a giant beer mug all over the policemen who were hired to prevent just that very thing from happening. The Severn Institute showed up, Sam and Adrian with the finest fop ever seen. Don Truby with that Swaggart tape you heard last week. The Chainsaw Synthesizer Group was not allowed to be in the church.

965
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:05,780
play on stage because of the violence that had already happened, the strangely reticent

966
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:11,760
Chris Gross and David Levitt, a genius disguised as a subgenius.

967
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:18,440
The subgeniuses in Boston work at the artificial intelligence media labs at MIT.

968
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,540
Where do the subgeniuses in Dallas work?

969
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,060
They can't even get hired.

970
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:31,420
Friends, KDV, DeVries, I could go on and on.

971
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:39,380
The amount of hierarchites that managed to ooze up out of the East Coast have put Dallas

972
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,900
in so down, so down.

973
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:51,800
Reverend Remote Control Mark Johnson from Mind Blaster Magazine, it disgusts me that

974
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,400
you don't know who I'm talking about.

975
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,040
It really does.

976
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,440
It really does.

977
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,940
But you see, then there was the party.

978
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,760
The party after the show.

979
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:06,800
And see, we don't do these shows, these subgenius revivals because we like to scream at pinks.

980
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,380
We're more like the Masons.

981
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,420
We're not really trying to recruit people.

982
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:18,360
If somebody wants to join, let them find their way in if they're good enough.

983
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,180
You know what I mean?

984
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,200
The party after the show where some pink boy flipped out.

985
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,040
And I'm not talking about the show.

986
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,200
I'm talking about the party after the show.

987
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:31,920
Hold on.

988
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,840
I lost track just a minute ago of our party.

989
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,760
I can't remember the Ws with .

990
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:36,760


991
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,480
Hip hop blues.

992
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:42,480


993
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:42,480


994
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:42,480


995
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:42,880
And mypamaster.com.

996
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,360
One very funny thing, he took a few seconds off to do a little punkpek beginning and rolled

997
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:47,740
the only什么he Nichtlik.

998
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:47,860


999
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,100
He told me to stuff up at it and I slept with zaddle.

1000
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:53,580
He chopped up Oczywiście's Bwee Bwo Iw na squertagne at it.

1001
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:53,700
But he helped make meاWell.

1002
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,040
You nothing códigoc 써u wars하면서 k'sue iבדkiii.

1003
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,160
triad of

1004
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,900
follow me and John Hagan

1005
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,900
in Dallas, Doctors for Bob and Little

1006
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,820
Rock, Puzzling Evidence and Lies,

1007
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,460
etc. in San Francisco,

1008
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:06,200
and just, let's parenthetically

1009
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,020
throw in G. Gordon Gordon

1010
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,880
in Bolivia. But now

1011
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,760
the Boston true mutants

1012
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,900
make it a quadrad, except

1013
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,740
that Dallas is so pathetic

1014
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:18,180
that I'm dropping Dallas out of the triad.

1015
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,840
Forget it. All y'all do is

1016
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,020
listen. You sit there. You can't

1017
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,860
even pledge enough money to make

1018
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:24,700
this station go.

1019
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,380
You know, there's

1020
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,860
me and Will Frazier, the Will of

1021
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,620
Dobbs, sit here and actually work

1022
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,780
allowing you to have enough

1023
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,940
morale to listen to butt naked sing.

1024
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,820
Pope S. Cecilio may drive

1025
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:39,700
around, but that's it, man. The rest of y'all

1026
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,820
you just slack vampires as far

1027
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,500
as I'm concerned. Here's a hint

1028
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,580
of the party that happens

1029
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,620
after a subgenius revival, which

1030
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,980
you are too pathetic

1031
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:51,120
to ever, ever

1032
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,160
attend.

1033
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,040
Which they don't even know about. We're gonna save

1034
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,020
the city and they don't know. Right in the middle of the airport.

1035
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,160
It was thanks to the

1036
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,260
frame that we just went in the bathroom

1037
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,420
and ran up

1038
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,800
that we stole from you.

1039
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,140
This is the second, only the second time I've ever

1040
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,260
done frame above 10,000 feet.

1041
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,680
The first time being from

1042
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,340
Bolivia to Panama.

1043
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:22,140
A few more grams of that sex drugs and rock and roll.

1044
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,100
I was gonna maybe shoot some more

1045
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,580
up before we got off the plane.

1046
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,760
Oh yeah, I've got loads and loads. Although I'm already

1047
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,100
kind of burned out. He said,

1048
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,340
on that and shooting publicity

1049
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,400
like I've been. Yeah.

1050
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,820
Yeah, so you're running up a bunch of PR

1051
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,300
last night. Yeah.

1052
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,840
With them girls. Betsy.

1053
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:41,340
Betsy.

1054
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,200
You missed the girls.

1055
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:43,880
PR.

1056
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,440
Oh, my heart's stopping.

1057
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,640
Thank you, Bob.

1058
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:51,220
Thank you, Bob.

1059
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,700
Sometimes I just feel like peeing

1060
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,760
slash smiling.

1061
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,740
Peeing slash smiling.

1062
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,320
We've got to make sure.

1063
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,280
You know, it's up to us to make sure

1064
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,240
that they don't overdose.

1065
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,300
I know it, man.

1066
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:06,540
Grobingly.

1067
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,740
Now, Jane, you be careful there.

1068
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,740
I wouldn't want a young fellow like you

1069
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:13,660
to hurt himself.

1070
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:15,440
Well, Dean,

1071
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:18,740
would you like to just do all my church air

1072
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:19,320
for me?

1073
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,700
Why? How thoughtful of you.

1074
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:22,660
Jane,

1075
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,540
I don't know where I'd be without

1076
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,640
the elders of the church.

1077
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,420
Yeah, I know. It's pretty selfless

1078
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,540
of us, isn't it?

1079
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:33,980
Yes, it is.

1080
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,100
Selfless.

1081
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,500
Dot, dot, dot.

1082
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,980
One soul per ground.

1083
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,580
Church air.

1084
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,020
One soul per ground.

1085
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,800
Byron would be proud

1086
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,760
to hear the music they're playing

1087
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,140
on the radio.

1088
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,020
On the radio today.

1089
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,780
Put that kiss in the background.

1090
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,500
And friends,

1091
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,800
why, why,

1092
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,080
why were you

1093
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,040
unable to be at that party?

1094
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,180
Because, because we don't have

1095
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,640
those kind of parties in Dallas.

1096
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,960
And because we're local.

1097
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,000
Oh, yeah.

1098
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,980
You have such a low self-image

1099
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,060
that you think anyone in the same

1100
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,280
town with you

1101
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,940
can't be cool.

1102
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,340
But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.

1103
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,720
When are you going to get over it?

1104
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,080
Hm?

1105
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:29,640
Well, the famous

1106
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,960
and wonderful Ron Lindsay

1107
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,200
has finally arrived.

1108
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,080
We're going to continue this put-down

1109
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,580
of our own local subgeniuses

1110
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,620
next week when we get more tapes

1111
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,940
of that Boston revival.

1112
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,760
Oh, it was so fun.

1113
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,740
So fun!

1114
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:47,260
But, in the meantime...

1115
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,640
Are you interested

1116
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,800
in the strange and the unusual?

1117
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:04,860
Are you curious

1118
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:07,180
by the baffling and the bizarre?
