1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,100
It's my nightmare, crawling, slithering, along the edge.

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:23,200
It's my nightmare, crawling, slithering, along the edge of a straight razor.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:30,120
Everyone be calm and just relax and be seated if you please.

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,520
Because, you see, one of the things that...

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,160
Tell me why you make the pain if we are your children.

6
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,600
Oh, you see, you are my children, but law is necessary.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:04,580
If there is no more pain, then is there no more law?

8
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,260
There is always law.

9
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:20,480
I watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor, crawling, slithering.

10
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:31,460
Along the edge of a straight razor and surviving.

11
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,200
Transmission 11, we see 68, December 30, 0500 hours.

12
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,720
Sector King, Zulu King.

13
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,160
Yes, and praise God.

14
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah!

15
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,700
4.30 in the morning, time for show.

16
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,280
Live show for you now.

17
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,340
...itself is an infant.

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,480
How come always scary on show, says Doug Smith of Dallas, Texas?

19
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,060
Well, it's actually been some time since Gary has been on the show, Doug.

20
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:17,020
We tried to get him to come in, but he always has to go out smurfing through the solar system on his wind surfboard.

21
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,640
His solar wind surfer is...

22
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,500
...a 40-year-old.

23
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:20,580


24
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:20,580


25
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,260
Hey, strap in.

26
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,500
Show's about to take off.

27
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,080
...about two and a half miles in width.

28
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,360
Oh, my God, the pilot's dead.

29
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,300
Oh, my God.

30
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,600
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of sloth.

31
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,060
As it says in Isaiah 28, 7, 8...

32
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,960
...the priest and the prophet...

33
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,560
...the prophet...

34
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:50,560


35
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,840
...are aired through strong drink.

36
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,160
They are swallowed up with wine.

37
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,460
They are out of the way through strong drink.

38
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,180
They err in vision.

39
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,000
They stumble in judgment.

40
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,000
For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness.

41
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,340
And there is no place clean.

42
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,900
Yes, we're...

43
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,420
...over.

44
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,540
Shut that door.

45
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,720
Put the baby up in there.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,340
God, babies, they get into all the subgenius shows.

47
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,700
But we will not let the baby stop us.

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,220
We will continue the battle.

49
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,380
Let mortal combat begin.

50
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,680
Yes, praise God.

51
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,240
A handful of people on a wiki boat are going to save the world.

52
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,340
Exactly.

53
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,200
Oh, yes, dear friends, we're back.

54
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,060
You know, it's going to be a wonderful show.

55
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,720
Now that we have these departments and we have a format and everything.

56
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,680
Isn't that unbelievable?

57
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,500
All men and women defending your world.

58
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,820
It's not about death.

59
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,200
Life.

60
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,880
Hey, life.

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,060
I'm in this new studio, friends.

62
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,980
It's great because I don't feel guilty.

63
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,340
It's fun to do the show again.

64
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,160
Yes, it's fun, fun, fun.

65
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,640
And we have so many fun times and a fun format.

66
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,460
And we shall engage now and forever in mortal combat against God and all of the heavens

67
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,260
and all of the people in all of the worlds and all of the planets.

68
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,480
Praise Father.

69
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,780
Mortal combat.

70
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,900
It has begun.

71
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,540
The conspiracy is no metaphor.

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,700
We're talking about the conspiracy.

73
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,960
Are we discussing some literary poetic monster?

74
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,440
Say no.

75
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,260
No.

76
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,100
Say no.

77
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,040
No.

78
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,780
Say no.

79
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,480
No.

80
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:56,880
Say no.

81
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


82
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,880


83
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,680
No, we're not joking.

84
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,000
We're talking about living, breathing, firing and giving us strength that wants to consume you.

85
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,960
That wants to take away your slack, children.

86
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,020
Are we going to let them take away your slack?

87
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:07,580
No.

88
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,540
Say no.

89
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,380
No.

90
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:09,840
No.

91
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,200
Say no.

92
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:10,980
No.

93
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,480
No.

94
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,100
Tell me something.

95
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,940
Who stands in the way of the conspiracy?

96
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,300
Who?

97
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,580
Who?

98
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:16,940
Who?

99
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,080
Who?

100
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,680
Who?

101
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,660
Since 10 years

102
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,180
Bob, Bob, Bob

103
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,160
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

104
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,380
Right.

105
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,860
You are

106
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,840
fixed

107
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:32,940
on

108
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,480
mama온!

109
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,480
When you hear a given call, when you ride chicks for one dollar, think about it.

110
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,460
Think about it.

111
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,540
When you ride to the subgenius, think about it.

112
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,680
Think about it.

113
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,900
We all pass 140306, think about it.

114
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,920
When you cast your mojo taxes, when you ride through Dallas, Texas, when you're off, think about it.

115
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,640
Think about it.

116
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:18,740
One dollar, one dollar, one dollar, one dollar, one dollar, one dollar, one dollar, one dollar, one dollar.

117
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:27,060
Now, the next thing you turn to the subgenius is, you will pay to know what you really think.

118
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,220
Slack can be bought.

119
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,060
All the other ones is.

120
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,980
Oh, you're going to meditate for five.

121
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,120
Yes, you got to get baptized.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,340
You got to do this.

123
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,040
You got to do that.

124
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,640
You got to forsake strong liquor.

125
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,080
You got to forsake sex.

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,740
We don't, you don't need to be happy.

127
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,980
You don't need to live up for slack.

128
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,340
All you need is money.

129
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,640
I don't care.

130
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,380
I don't care what lengths I go to anymore.

131
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,640
All is fair and all that.

132
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,120
Dr. Harris, you're a doctor.

133
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,000
A doctor.

134
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,420
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

135
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:05,580
It does.

136
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:05,860
I'm a surgeon.

137
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,340
I'm a doctor, Edith, but I'm a man also.

138
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,320
You're under arrest.

139
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,060
Something sick.

140
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,400
Something sordid, vicious, and depraved.

141
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,760
Vagina.

142
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,260
Vagina.

143
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,280
V-A-G-I-N-A.

144
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,900
It's a canal-like passage between the uterus and an opening between the mother's legs.

145
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:35,160
It is the place where sperm are deposited by the father and the maiden in the passage to which the baby passes into the womb.

146
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,980
We cannotESTIDE A physical medical examination.

147

When the assassins accuse the assassin, they lie.

161
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,660
They lie and we have to be merciful for those who lie.

162
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,020
Those nabobs.

163
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,160
Nabobs.

164
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,280
Nabobs.

165
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,420
I hate them.

166
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,360
I do hate them.

167
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,980
I love you.

168
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,360
I love you.

169
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,520
I love you.

170
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,080
I love you.

171
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,000
I love you.

172
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:49,280
I love you.

173
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,260
you

174
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,040
Boy, is this a trip through memory lane.

175
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,980
There's some bad A going around.

176
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,260
If anybody's got any of this...

177
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,440
Give it to Jane.

178
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,540
Oh, listen to that lovely, typical doctor music in the old days.

179
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,700
They all learned how to play their instruments, unfortunately.

180
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,340
Then there was the more ascended music.

181
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,600
Mark Mothersbaugh did at one point.

182
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,180
I love you.

183
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,440
I loved you.

184
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,920
It's a bucolic scene here at Doc's Dock 93, Jim.

185
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,300
Everybody's tired from driving.

186
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,840
They're all sitting around with needles hanging out of their arms.

187
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,060
And it's all free and you missed it.

188
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,120
Pretty soon...

189
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,240
All the stimulants will be here.

190
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,720
And then we'll all wake up and party all night.

191
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,160
And someone, or maybe several people, will be badly injured.

192
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,220
And the police will come.

193
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,080
And we'll be in the newspapers.

194
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,080
It'll be another Doc's Dock.

195
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,420
Another wonderful, lovely Doc's Dock.

196
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,200
Oh, man.

197
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,500
Doesn't it make your tears well up in your eyes, Jim?

198
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,520
When things get confused out there...

199
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,860
Power, ideals, old morality, and practical military necessity.

200
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,680
But out there with these natives,

201
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,140
it must be a temptation

202
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,020
temptation to be God.

203
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:22,200
I hate to say this, but once we did recently, Jesus got a call at the office from this mom.

204
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,160
She was saying, you can't send this stuff to my child. It's going to mess him up. It's really bad.

205
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,900
Jesus is going, well, same thing I have to say to the cops every couple of months.

206
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,260
Have you ever heard of Mad Magazine Officer? Well, he was starting to do that. She goes,

207
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,160
no, you don't understand. My son is mentally ill. He's 40 years old and he lives at home.

208
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,060
And we're kind of like going, well, I think church is subgenius is the last thing you've

209
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:56,140
got to worry about with your son right now. So I don't know, maybe you're in the same boat.

210
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:07,700
I'll tell you what though, you have the, but I'll sneak you a membership pack. I'll sneak you one.

211
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,940
Now, as well,

212
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:16,080
the church was called by John Shirley. I think the science fiction writer said the church of the

213
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:23,160
subgenius is the knife they smuggle in with the strike jacket. So you can cut yourself free when

214
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,960
they're not looking, but friends, you can't depend on anybody to smuggle you that knife.

215
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,720
You have to learn how to escape from the strike jacket yourself.

216
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,900
I actually happened to have a instructional video in Dallas about how to do that.

217
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:47,080
I toured with a guy who escaped from strike jackets every night by dislocating his shoulder.

218
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:53,860
It works. But you know, to bust free of the conspiracy, you sometimes have to bust free

219
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:02,760
of parts of your own body. That's a grim way to look at it. Easy for me to say.

220
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,980
The conspiracy is a leg hold trap.

221
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:05,700
Huh?

222
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,860
The conspiracy is a leg hold trap.

223
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,140
You know, the,

224
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,520
the sad thing about the conspiracy is you see these,

225
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:21,300
these human animals trapped in it and they'll have gnawed off all three legs and that one leg's still in the damn trap.

226
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,320
That's why we call them humans, friends.

227
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:37,780
And another real basic thing that we've got down to, you know, we've said for years, church of the subgenius, we're not harping on intelligence.

228
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,160
We certainly cannot afford to do that.

229
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:46,140
The only people that we disqualify from the church are geniuses.

230
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:53,460
You know, anybody below that with 30 bucks and even, you know, genius can bite us way in or brain damage us way in.

231
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:03,440
You know, it's not the intelligence that counts, it's the sense, common sense, sense of humor and dollars and cents.

232
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,380
One might call it something for nothing.

233
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,780
But the normals.

234
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:20,840
The mediocritans, the somnambulax and pseudo subslans have tried to make it something which we've been led to believe we must work to buy.

235
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,040
It is this yearning for slackness separates us from them.

236
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,140
The human may live out his entire life in a grinding cycle of slacklessness.

237
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,060
His hours consumed by meaningless toil, interspersed with meaningless leisure.

238
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,520
Yet he never feels cheated.

239
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,040
He thinks it's natural.

240
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,920
Perhaps we should pity them.

241
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,080
But face it, most people are venal jerks.

242
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,020
Half-witted cattle racing each other to be first to the slaughterhouse.

243
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,380
And stampeding you along with them.

244
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,440
What do you do?

245
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,940
To walk on a horse.

246
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,640
That is the law.

247
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,140
To slurp up our drink.

248
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,720
That is the law.

249
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,140
We are not men.

250
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:30,160
To eat flesh and fish anytime.

251
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,040
That is the law.

252
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,040


253
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,040


254
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,040


255
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,040


256
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,040


257
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,440
Now I am the law.

258
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,540
Now shall escape.

259
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,420
That is the law.

260
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,760
The law.

261
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,720
Not to pee on the neighbor's mailbox.

262
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,180
Not to shit in the house.

263
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,600
Not to hump the master's leg.

264
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,860
That is the law.

265
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,400
Not to lick one's own genitals in front of company.

266
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,440
That is the law.

267
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:34,720
Not to gnaw at flea bites, noiseless while the master is trying to seduce a female.

268
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,980
That is the law.

269
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,320
We are not men.

270
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,440
Not to grovel and whine piteously for attention.

271
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,480
That is the law.

272
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,600
Not to fight the mailman.

273
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,360
Not to run out into the road in front of cars.

274
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,260
That is the law.

275
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,980
We are not men.

276
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,080
The snake is long.

277
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,680
The snake is old.

278
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,660
The riders are stoned.

279
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,180
I had an operation.

280
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,980
I had an operation.

281
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:05,980


282
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,700
They tampered with my brain some.

283
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:20,320
It helped me see the reason for living in the system.

284
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,440
We simply got away with unnecessary friction.

285
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,120
If you act like a dumb shit, they will treat you as an equal.

286
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:48,420
Now, do what Make on a

287
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,680
here.

288
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,500
Oh, no, you don't.

289
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,020
We have to work clean on this radio show.

290
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,360
The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, friends.

291
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:31,580
And it's about time that I've told you what you've been listening to for the last 20 soft minutes.

292
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:38,240
We've been playing a lot of, well, you know, friends, I'm sticking with this department format.

293
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,760
Now that we have a format.

294
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,900
And we've heard a lot of the old-timey media barrage department.

295
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,920
In that we've been hearing,

296
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,140
some tapes from the old Dockstock 3.

297
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,080
Back in the olden days, friends, before there was X-Day Drills, there was Dockstock.

298
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,220
And they were smaller, but a lot meaner and more wiry and uglier than X-Days.

299
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:11,080
And so they were like snails on a straight razor, if you know what I mean.

300
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,060
And we've heard some KPFA puzzling evidence of Dr. Howell.

301
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,260
That's the KPFA radio show.

302
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,940
Subgenius show in Berkeley.

303
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,980
And it's the old media barrage from, it's just like it's a barrage of media barrages.

304
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,540
Including the Pope David Meyer preaching about the con somewhere.

305
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,580
And an old-timey Bob song.

306
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,980
Onan Canobite doing Think-a-Bob.

307
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:46,600
We heard David Lynch ranting at X-Day about how Slack can be bought.

308
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,160
And we heard...

309
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,040
We heard from the super intro sex barrage, media barrage number three.

310
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,940
Mark Mothersbaugh did the Babacato and Fugue in D minor.

311
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,100
And some of that other...

312
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,840
We heard yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, ranting at Winterstar 1999

313
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,820
about the three legs and still in the trap.

314
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,460
And some outtakes from the subgenius video Arise.

315
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,620
The narration about humans, Slack, and work.

316
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,940
We are not men from the island.

317
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,980
We are not men from the island of Dr. Moreau.

318
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,780
And the law, the subgenius law, not to bite the mailman and so forth.

319
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,640
From the Einstein Secret Orchestra rehearsal last November 1998.

320
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,780
And in our rock song department, we heard Rage Against the Machine

321
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,880
in an excerpt from Killing in the Name of on their first album.

322
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,940
In the background right now is Cypheria doing an instrumental called Gothic Disturbance.

323
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,140
You see, and we'll play some new Bob songs, probably by Einstein Secret Orchestra,

324
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:58,240
and have our guest ranter department and our X Day Hymn department,

325
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,060
all the other departments, because, you know, as George Burns said,

326
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:08,580
with the collapse of vaudeville, new talent has no place to stink.

327
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,520
He also said, George Burns, the great George Burns, said,

328
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,920
Too bad that all the people who know me, I'm not a rock star.

329
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,120
I know how to run this country are busy driving taxis, cutting hair,

330
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:28,660
and posting to alt.slack and mixing radio shows.

331
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,380
Friends, it's true that with the collapse of vaudeville,

332
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,400
new talent has no place to stink except for the church of the subgenius.

333
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:46,220
Friends, stinky new talent always can find, well, can find a home here if it's bad enough.

334
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,060
And run it through the committee.

335
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,160
And a committee is a group that keeps minutes and loses hours.

336
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,340
And radio, like television, is a medium.

337
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,420
Because it is neither rare nor well done.

338
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,840
Well, the hour of slack is fairly rare.

339
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,500
Although now, friends, we're on four internet radio stations now.

340
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,840
Can you believe it?

341
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,040
The other one you can hear it on is the latest one.

342
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:20,500
It's, uh, nightravenradio.com.

343
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,840
That's one word.

344
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,060
I believe that's...

345
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,980
Yeah, that's right.

346
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,780
www.nightravenradio.com.

347
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,620
Liberals, as Mort Sahl said, feel unworthy of their possessions,

348
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,840
whereas conservatives feel they deserve everything they've stolen.

349
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:51,060
Now, we, the patriopsychotic anarcho-materialists, uh, just do what we can.

350
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,180
Ugh, that music was about to drive me nuts, friends.

351
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,820
This probably will, too.

352
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
Because I want to go on with some...

353
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:08,300
These are some quotes that our friend DeathRockerX on AOL.com sent to us.

354
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,840
Some quotes from the old but wise.

355
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,000
Uh, including Henny Youngman, who said,

356
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,560
I wanted to become an atheist, but I gave up, for they have no holidays.

357
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,920
Friends, you can be an atheist and a subgenius, and we've got a lot of holidays.

358
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,960
The biggest one being July 5th, uh, 1999.

359
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,220
Well, the last holiday, actually, since the world ends that day this year.

360
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,040
Uh, and it...

361
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,440
And, you know, and they call this the church of the subgenius.

362
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,100
Well, you can imagine, friends, we...

363
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,060
We like... We agree with Sam Levinson here, who said,

364
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,040
It's so simple to be wise.

365
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,980
Just think of something stupid to say, and then don't say it.

366
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,780
And on that note, I think I'll shut up and play this song by Temple Beat, called...

367
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,020
This is an Italian band, and this is a song called The Brain Cult of Machiavelli.

368
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,140
It's called Caccio Irony.

369
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,280
Thank you.

370
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,260
Thank you.

371
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,200
Thank you.

372
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:20,420
Thank you.

373
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,780
Thank you.

374
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,520
Thank you.

375
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,080
Thank you.

376
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,580
Goodness gracious.

377
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,260
What a simply horrible

378
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,800
patchwork of noise

379
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,920
that Church of the Subgenius is.

380
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,780
I listen every week

381
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,860
to gather evidence

382
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,700
and ammunition for the citizens

383
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,780
for normalcy.

384
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,820
Let me tell you, we're not going to get

385
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,180
those subgeniuses. We're going to get them

386
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,640
right in the gonads.

387
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,060
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that.

388
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,220
I don't use

389
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,860
words like that.

390
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,900
This tape, all about Satanism,

391
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,780
drugs, and rock and roll

392
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,520
is proof positive

393
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,340
that this so-called church

394
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,460
is going to send the world to

395
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,320
heck in a handbasket.

396
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,920
All those demented

397
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,260
be-ass-a-bub-kissing-hop-heads

398
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,060
make me want to toss my Nestle

399
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,000
stallhouse cookies with their talk of

400
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,240
buckets of pills from that low-life

401
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,780
pusher J.R. Bob Dobbs.

402
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,520
Boy, they're so high on drugs

403
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,320
that they can't even keep any continuity

404
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,200
in their tapes.

405
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,400
Too many children listen to these tapes

406
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,460
and subscribe to the insane

407
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,300
doctrines of the subgenius.

408
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,540
They're led down a deceptive road

409
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,880
to what these weirdos call slack.

410
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,300
Like that heathenist idea

411
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,300
of nirvana.

412
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,360
I say that slack should be taken out

413
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,020
like the excess yarn in my knitting

414
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,120
and pulled until it sees the light of a normal

415
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,620
day like the rest of us do.

416
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,420
So what should any decent-minded

417
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,220
American do when faced with

418
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,540
one of these zombies for Bob?

419
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,760
Well, first off,

420
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,920
give him a bath in Pine Sol.

421
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,260
They usually stink to high heaven.

422
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,740
Then ship them off to the nearest

423
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,880
normally accredited deprogrammer.

424
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,100
Well, they'll get bombarded

425
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,640
with enough People magazines,

426
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,760
arid extra-dry deodorant,

427
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,640
and Regis Philbin fan club material

428
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,660
so they won't be able to think anymore

429
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,480
the way it should be.

430
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,980
Then they'll feed them real dogma

431
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,580
about the glories of the home shopping club,

432
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,460
Wingo, Zingo,

433
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,260
and the evils of Mandingo.

434
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,280
We cannot stand by

435
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,500
while our standards and principles

436
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,220
are made light of by these possessed fools.

437
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,760
Normals of the world unite.

438
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,760
Oh, that was Sister Crist, dear friends,

439
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,520
from a long time ago, WFMU.

440
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,640
I guess that would be our guest rant.

441
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,700
Sister Crist this time representing the...

442
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,480
Citizens for Normalcy.

443
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,240
Uh, thank you.

444
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,060
To answer all your problems.

445
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,100
To answer all your problems.

446
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,860
To answer all your problems.

447
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,840
You know, I'm going to be so happy,

448
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,240
so content.

449
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,640
It's not a loss,

450
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,520
it's more of a passing

451
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,040
into something wonderful and exciting

452
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,900
for the whole rest of my life.

453
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,080
So I want to say goodbye,

454
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,480
and that I'm going to miss you all very much.

455
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,180
Miss you all very much.

456
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,040
Miss you all very much.

457
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,040


458
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,500
Because if you want to get out of North Star, Miss you all very much.

459
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:07,520


460
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,720
you can't be afraid of anything.

461
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,340
You can't be afraid of pigs,

462
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,480
you can't be afraid of a normal,

463
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,520
and you definitely can't be afraid of Bob.

464
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,800
and you definitely can't be afraid of Bob.

465
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,820
That guy is pussy pussy

466
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,040
for the head here in his back.

467
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,480
You might have heard of this, but you can't,

468
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,960
you can only get back to one place,

469
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,360
and that is

470
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,400
J.R. Bob's dog.

471
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,080
Get out.

472
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,500
You don't want to live with your face,

473
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,160
You don't want to show your face,

474
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,840
you don't want to face Bob.

475
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,460
Because there's a conflict in every human heart

476
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,640
between the rational and the irrational,

477
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,680
between good and evil.

478
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,400
Good does not always triumph.

479
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:11,570
Sometimes the dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.

480
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,610
Every man has got a breaking point. You and I have.

481
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:23,250
And very obviously he has gone insane.

482
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:41,310
Oh yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang with a live on the scene report here at Dockstock No. 3.

483
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:49,530
There are actually, the drums you hear in the background are being played by two, it looks like three year old girls.

484
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:59,230
A couple of three year old little girls are playing the drums there. Not bad actually, it's a lot better than what some of the professional subgeniuses were capable of late last night.

485
00:33:59,390 --> 00:33:59,610
Thank you.

486
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:04,810
And we'll play some of those real revival tapes later on.

487
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:13,030
But we've got quite an amazing contingent of subgeniuses here.

488
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:26,270
Here's Jan Johnson from the Boston delegation. There are delegations from something like 55 states and 60 countries.

489
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:29,150
Something like that. Many dimensions even.

490
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:45,270
And Dr. Ahmed Fishman, who is also from the Boston delegation, is playing a tune on the scene here in Arsholes, Arkansas, near the home of the sword and what is it, the Arm and Sword Covenant of the Lord.

491
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,150
White supremacist campgrounds.

492
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:57,850
The fact that we have these delegations from all over the country, this is Houston, of course Dallas, Little Rock, San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles.

493
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:01,090
Seattle, Pope Myers here from Seattle.

494
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,630
We all come together for these yearly or bi-yearly meetings.

495
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,850
And the interesting thing is we don't know why.

496
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:13,590
There is no goal, no set plan at all.

497
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,410
We just, we meet and then we try to figure out why.

498
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,110
And usually we can't make the song stop.

499
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,830
I'm tired of one day, I'm sick of all this going.

500
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,890
I'm not playing real music.

501
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,530
I'm sick of everything, and I'm sick of this, and I'm sick of all.

502
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,550
I'm sick of all!

503
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:41,450
I'm sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick of all!

504
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:53,370
This infernal machine is going to bring you to hell.

505
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:57,090
I said turn on my show

506
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,910
Gonna ring it off today

507
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:06,810
You will be looking through caverns of human flesh

508
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:09,410
You think your eyes deceive you

509
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,790
But know what you are seeing is not a bizarre

510
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,490
But a real carnal sight

511
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,110
Men in wear and wailing

512
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,830
With their arms attached to the walls

513
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:24,450
Stapled there by cruel utterance of sausage-message nonsense

514
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,450
And foolish ideals

515
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,530
These they utter until the dark hours of the morning

516
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:35,510
Until the sun once again relentlessly climbs up and burns them

517
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,290
Burns them and burns

518
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,350
And where will you be, friend?

519
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:45,590
Will you be in a saucer full of milk and honey?

520
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,650
Will you be riding high off into the sky?

521
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:54,450
Will you see that silver lining on every cloud as you

522
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,790
Whisk by on my infernal machine?

523
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,370
These machines don't work for you, friend

524
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:06,330
They don't work for nobody

525
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,370
Got their own criteria

526
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,830
Got their own agenda

527
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:15,410
Got their own suspenders

528
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,270
Goodbye!

529
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,370
I'm done!

530
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:20,190
Goodbye!

531
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:38,970
It's true, we feel like the purpose of life is not happiness, knowledge, or even truth, but merely to squirt.

532
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:47,110
You can understand a church on a simple level of, oh, some people think it's a Texas death and fertility cult.

533
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,510
Let's call it just another polygamous religion.

534
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:56,630
Yeah, some think it's a great collaborative art project using the greatest anonymous artists in America today.

535
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:02,290
And others just say it's my religion. Let me practice it.

536
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:08,170
Remember, kids, nothing is illegal if 100 sub-genie businessmen decide to do it.

537
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:08,630
That's right.

538
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:16,390
We had that wonderful tape where you saw the young, naked, nubile maidens wrestling with Arnold Palmer's bloody head.

539
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,510
Rolling in the mondo mondo hills.

540
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,750
Of habifrop zipilats.

541
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,950
And there's marijuana growing all over.

542
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:26,250
Well...

543
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:26,830
Neat setting.

544
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,010
Yes, it's true.

545
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:34,330
There's habifrop zipilat all over the Tibetan holy llama's grave.

546
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:39,330
It is one of the most maintainable shrubbery's for landscaping around exterior office buildings.

547
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,050
Right.

548
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,070
And very tidy.

549
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,970
It's not a morbid situation at all.

550
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:43,710
No, it's happy.

551
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:48,550
It's like Bob is a Robot or the Attack of the Mutants. It's like any movie of that sort that you've seen.

552
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,810
He's a cheery demigod.

553
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,350
That's right.

554
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,110
But the people that we're really concerned with are the artisans tonight.

555
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:58,310
We're talking about the small studios that support Bob's habit.

556
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,770
They crank out art in an amazing way.

557
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,370
Centralize it in Dallas.

558
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:06,430
The sub-genius air force picks it up, flies it to Dallas, and the next thing you know it's in the stark fist.

559
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,710
And nobody gets paid for it.

560
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,350
Except those who matter.

561
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:15,990
And others just say it's my religion. Let me practice it.

562
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,370
You can't have sex without Bob.

563
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,690
You can't have money without Bob.

564
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,990
Girls, a dollar in the pot pool will come to you in the night.

565
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,590
Free pills!

566
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,590
Brian Shaparo's may die.

567
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,370
Don't be left behind when the exits land.

568
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,470
I want to be on the computer for the next ten, ninety, ninety nine.

569
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:45,030
You don't have to understand it. You just have to buy it.

570
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:48,030
You have signed the application.

571
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,250
Welcome aboard.

572
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:55,710
But one doesn't listen long before a little warning signal goes off inside that says watch out.

573
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,230
Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint the precise error.

574
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:04,790
But the language, the pure language of heaven is missing.

575
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:07,370
Something says look out. This guy is fishy.

576
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:12,130
Cultist or someone with his theological wires crossed.

577
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:18,010
It's almost like listening to someone who knows only a few words of English but soon they're rattling off an experience.

578
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:23,130
They're speaking completely unknown language when they haven't even been to kindergarten spiritually.

579
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:29,770
We eat more, drink more, play more and do less to earn a good living than any other people in history.

580
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,930
We have at our fingertips the world's greatest music.

581
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,470
And I might add a lot of it's worse.

582
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,750
But the cultists would have no following.

583
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:42,270
We are a people grasping nervously, sometimes almost hysterically for more.

584
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:46,030
I know that I know that I know that I know that I know

585
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,610
that I know that I know

586
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:54,670
Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortious executions

587
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,930
it would be more consistent to call it the word of a demon.

588
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:03,630
There are little eyes upon you and they're watching night and day.

589
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:10,750
With a vocal and activist minority ready apparently to burn the bomber's field of tears.

590
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:11,950
For more.

591
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,770
And most incidentally are in their teens or their twenties.

592
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,710
And that's Washington people, I'll tell you that.

593
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,370
They dwelled in caves, not high rise apartments.

594
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,070
They may not have found a seat affluent, but they found

595
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:34,770
an endless supply of dope, uninhibited sex, an endless supply of money.

596
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,270
Free access to the distillery, I suppose.

597
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,630
Ah, yes, the harvest.

598
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:44,990
You can count on that.

599
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,250
But still, for more.

600
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:51,710
Why friends, we could beat another nation with our garbage.

601
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:58,330
What more than a space hogger on Earth is the church of geniuses?

602
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,510
I don't know.

603
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,390
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?

604
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:04,830
Bang.

605
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:09,570
Are you blaming God for atom bombs, atomic warheads?

606
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,130
Don't.

607
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,190
I don't know.

608
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:14,450
I only know that it will signal the end of time.

609
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:14,790
Why?

610
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,530
Bang.

611
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,550
Bang.

612
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:18,890
Bang.

613
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,610
The past blotted out, and the future assured.

614
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,650
Ah, yes, the harvest.

615
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:30,770
Laced with hundreds of beautiful, sexy broads.

616
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:34,510
A sex-stuffed gingerbread house.

617
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:40,630
Enter roommates Mitzi and Carol.

618
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,410
The party's now complete.

619
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:46,350
A time to strip down for action, and do as told.

620
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,830
Ready with the spells, sister?

621
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,390
Why not?

622
00:42:54,950 --> 00:43:01,490
Ziggety-Z, ziggety-zing, demon of darkness, come on the wing.

623
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:08,910
And then, as the witches chanted, the most horrible, cluck-cuddling howl filled the night

624
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:09,150
air.

625
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,330
Ziggety-Z, ziggety-zing, demon of darkness, come on the wing.

626
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:17,310
And a gigantic bat-shaped, seemed to fill the sky, blotting out the stars, blotting

627
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:17,930
out the moon.

628
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:24,410
And the deviled blackness, the ghostly trio, and even the Halloween creatures were terrified.

629
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,330
Get yourself a speculum.

630
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:32,650
Insert it, open it up, and take a look inside.

631
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:37,190
You can give yourself a basic gynecological exam.

632
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,330
Can you find your cervix?

633
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:50,330
Locate your goddess spot, otherwise known as the G-spot.

634
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:55,950
If you really can't locate your goddess spot, beat it into submission.

635
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:05,030
She and her girls specialize in the sale of pleasure and the sins of the flesh.

636
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,830
Ah, subgenius women.

637
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,310
And about this, please.

638
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:10,310


639
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:10,310


640
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:10,310


641
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:12,910
At this point, we think we've said all that there is to be said.

642
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:15,350
And certainly all that we're going to say.

643
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:20,250
Now, sit back and enjoy.

644
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:30,290
So, Bob Dobbs, we meet again for the first time.

645
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,150
Bob, I wept when you died.

646
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:39,030
Now I must kill you again for my honor.

647
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,350
And for the honor of Connie.

648
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,750
It's pandemonium out there.

649
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:05,010
Things are floating, things are beginning to fly, and you're inside the dome without an ounce of sense.

650
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:08,090
Don't look around for the nearest Evacogen.

651
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,790
Don't call the police.

652
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,550
Look inside yourself.

653
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:16,770
And then wire up Hotwire and Nexen to build a bog.

654
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,630
Cleaners and Maleficent mothers did.

655
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:24,090
Darker by the second as the Acrimony police begin to line the walls.

656
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:33,230
Now we see the Jennifer Headed children and thousands and thousands of the other rectal and young, uh, uh, challenged children trying to make their way up the slopes.

657
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:37,470
And the slopes are indeed high, for they've all been greased.

658
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:47,850
By the great Moomoo himself, who blindly wandered throughout these caves back many thousands of years ago, hoping, praying something like this would happen.

659
00:45:48,010 --> 00:46:02,910
And especially not on a day like today, when the plutonium storms are literally raging, and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of particles are filling the nostrils and eyes and other oral cavities that they're carrying.

660
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:06,270
Some of them have been carrying them for weeks at a time.

661
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:09,890
They can hardly, can hardly understand them.

662
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:12,050
Now I'm picking up, it seems to be a thermometer.

663
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:21,890
No, it's not a, I'm picking up a, yes, I'm picking up a, a, a vision of children and these same small children and handled by our mustaches.

664
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,830
And it's Christmas.

665
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:26,010
And it's very sad.

666
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:30,590
There won't be any Christmas on Pluto this year.

667
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,530
They've all gone.

668
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:36,250
All the little children.

669
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:41,530
The sack, slack, jawed, butter-headed, pumpkin-headed boys are gone.

670
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:46,790
All the little tin can shaped girls with no eyes.

671
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,830
All of the doctors have, all the doctors have left.

672
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,410
All the doctors have left.

673
00:46:53,910 --> 00:47:04,150
But as we gaze here upon this little pavilion, surrounded by untold thousands, as far as the eye can see, thousands of the shaved, bald-headed followers,

674
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:08,630
waiting for the doctors and the various delegations.

675
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:09,430
Always.

676
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:14,750
Dr. A.D. here is from the California delegation.

677
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,730
The promised land.

678
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,250
California's the promised land?

679
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:22,470
That's going to be a desert in 20 years.

680
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,430
I know, but who, it's a promised land, but.

681
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:27,830
We didn't say who it was promised to, did we?

682
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:30,210
It was promised to the normals.

683
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:32,630
Well, so where will the subgeniuses migrate back to?

684
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:33,090
The south.

685
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:33,390
Kansas.

686
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,410
The subgenius death camp.

687
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:37,230
That sounds like Dallas.

688
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,790
But subgenius death is better than normal life.

689
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:41,510
Grave ball.

690
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:42,870
Grave ball.

691
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,910
Charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500.

692
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:52,990
Keep going.

693
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:54,370
Keep going.

694
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:57,750
Yeah, that's right.

695
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:00,870
X-D's are coming.

696
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:03,070
And the Peaks are coming.

697
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:03,330
Bummer.

698
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,890
Make sure we all think we're hip subgeni.

699
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:14,390
We got us a window seat first class on the pleasure saucers, man.

700
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:20,510
You better work hard for your slap, man.

701
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,070
Bob will protect you.

702
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:23,610
Don't count on it.

703
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,930
You certainly don't want to preach to people.

704
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:32,330
Yeah.

705
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,070
The scouts are coming.

706
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:33,070


707
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:37,470
The shoppers will be scrambling out there, man, to sell you those over-inflated X-Day

708
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:38,430
saucer tickets.

709
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:42,010
That old Stark's business is going to be slamming down hard, man.

710
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:43,870
Oh, Bob.

711
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:47,990
Well, let's just cut to the point.

712
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:55,290
I know most of you want slack, but if you really want, it's the alien origins that

713
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:56,470
really got us going, right?

714
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:57,330
Let's admit it.

715
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,950
Oh, I love to be naked.

716
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,050
Many of you may have actually been in the same boat.

717
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:03,050


718
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:03,050


719
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:07,550
I actually even heard when I was abducted on the way to score some World Cluster munchies

720
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,230
years ago.

721
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:13,370
Got abducted by the alien nymphos and actually had my little mini-deck there and recorded

722
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:13,590
it.

723
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:18,710
The actual sounds of alien origins in the pleasure saucer.

724
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:25,010
Oh, I love to be naked.

725
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,650
Morality, you know, there ain't going to be no morality in outer space.

726
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,110
Whatever comes and goes by, that's what's going on.

727
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:33,030
Okay.

728
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:39,430
Well, another rule in the great morality was that thou shalt steal a government issue

729
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:41,290
rocket ship if possible.

730
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:41,770
Yeah.

731
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:47,110
Now, there's not a lot of them left, and most of them are in museums.

732
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:53,650
And the last big one, the last Saturn V is actually, they moved it indoors now.

733
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:55,910
It's going to be very difficult to get it now.

734
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:59,150
They have like guards around it and stuff.

735
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:01,030
Well, you know, there's got to be another way to do it besides rockets.

736
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:02,690
What now?

737
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,950
Well, yeah, of course, there is.

738
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:08,110
But, you know, to each their own.

739
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:13,150
Which is why the fifth commandment is, thou shalt switch to flying saucers operated by

740
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:16,410
gravity waves as soon as is technically feasible.

741
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:17,170
Right.

742
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:19,650
I think we maybe better go to a remote now.

743
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,710
It's like, oh, here they come.

744
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:28,130
Well, assembled here on the platform, another paradigm about to be crunched as this hotty

745
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,190
crew gets ready to board their own homemade med ship rocket ship.

746
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:32,670
Minister John, I'm going to take you to the next one.

747
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:32,670


748
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:32,670


749
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:32,670


750
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:32,670


751
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:32,670


752
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:32,670


753
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:32,670


754
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:32,670


755
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:32,670


756
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:32,670


757
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:32,670


758
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:33,670
Okay.

759
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:45,690
My

760
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:05,250
of psychic experience, I was staring at a toothpick,

761
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:08,030
wondering if I had a collapsible lung like Bob promised

762
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,190
with them loboptomectomies and all them other designs.

763
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:11,530
How did you say that?

764
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:14,390
That's one lung for Bob.

765
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:15,190
One toothpick.

766
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:16,210
Loboptomectomy.

767
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:18,570
And one toothpick for the rest of it.

768
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:22,850
What you do for the loboptomectomy is you go get yourself an Aerotech.

769
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:24,530
It's all too cute.

770
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:27,950
Gee, engine, stick it in your nose.

771
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:29,410
This is the triumph.

772
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:33,930
What I'm trying to prove here is what can happen,

773
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:41,430
what can be achieved by eliminating all that is cute through disease.

774
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:43,110
Oh, that is a beautiful idea.

775
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:44,530
Caller, do you have gas music?

776
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:48,970
You know, I'm afraid that we know this caller.

777
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,350
I'm afraid so, too.

778
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,990
I think he may have beat you to the scrotum so many times.

779
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:55,670
I have been ill, and through my illness,

780
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:59,250
I have eliminated all of my inner cuteness.

781
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:00,350
Uh-oh.

782
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:01,450
And you're cute.

783
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:02,130
You're lying.

784
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:05,050
Are you still a big man with a gland problem?

785
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:05,430
Is it Friday?

786
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:06,250
Do you still love, do you still care about me?

787
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,570
Wait a minute, is it still Thursday or is it Friday now?

788
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,570
No, no, no.

789
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:12,930
It's not what you think.

790
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,770
No, I don't think this thing has anything to do with anything.

791
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:16,630
Maybe it's Tuesday.

792
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:17,350
No.

793
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:17,730
Friends.

794
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:18,790
See, Tuesday's in the background.

795
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:20,110
Friends, this is Bleepo.

796
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:22,070
That's what I was afraid of.

797
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:23,290
We thought you did that.

798
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,330
You were castrated.

799
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:26,150
And, uh, some of us didn't know.

800
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,310
Bleepo, I felt a tremor in the force.

801
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:29,390


802
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:29,390


803
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:29,390


804
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:29,390


805
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:29,390


806
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:30,050
I had.

807
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,390
And I knew that you were very sick.

808
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,790
I definitely felt it.

809
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,530
I have an extra testicle now.

810
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,150
An extra?

811
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:37,470
Stang?

812
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:38,090
Yes.

813
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,970
They found it, Stang.

814
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:40,750
Finally!

815
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:42,010
Hey, listen, man.

816
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:45,670
I've been looking for that thing for about 15 years now.

817
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:50,370
They grafted it to the front of my forehead, right over my pineal gland.

818
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:54,930
Friday, your job is to retrieve the testicle from the old Bleepo.

819
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:56,830
I'm afraid it's a cosmopolitan monkey and a grand-aunt.

820
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:58,130
I look really hot now.

821
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:59,370
I don't think that's Bleepo.

822
00:52:59,370 --> 00:52:59,370


823
00:52:59,370 --> 00:52:59,370


824
00:52:59,370 --> 00:52:59,370


825
00:52:59,370 --> 00:52:59,370


826
00:52:59,370 --> 00:52:59,370


827
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:01,430
I'm afraid it's a guy who's got a testicle on the phone, even though he may have his

828
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:02,430
nose pinched together.

829
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:06,410
As an expert of different, many different dialects, I would say that this person is

830
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:06,410


831
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,390
Well, ever since the grafting, I've been having...

832
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:10,410
It's just, the women look at...

833
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:11,710
The women...

834
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:12,250
No, no.

835
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:13,850
I am not hearing Westchester County.

836
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:15,470
Animals, people on the subway...

837
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:17,030
I've heard someplace a little further east, perhaps.

838
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,650
I cannot not have sex at this point.

839
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:19,910
What?

840
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:23,150
I always thought that testicle was at Megan's Waddle somewhere.

841
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:23,970
It's not Bleepo.

842
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:24,770
He's from Yonkers.

843
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:25,250
This guy's from Yonkers.

844
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,970
Did you say you cannot not have sex right now?

845
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:28,350
Exactly.

846
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:29,350
I'm in a constant...

847
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:29,350


848
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:30,790
I'm in a constant state of sex.

849
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:33,250
The nose never goes...

850
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,790
I want that nut back, man.

851
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:37,750
You're having sex with an imposter.

852
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:42,170
This man has more than three having sex with a phone receiver, even if he...

853
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,730
Yeah, well, I need it back now.

854
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:44,070
Go ahead.

855
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:45,770
Show some pink.

856
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:48,750
And be sure you get paid.

857
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:50,510
Who took these pictures?

858
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:51,050
Didn't you, Bob?

859
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:51,290
He did.

860
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:52,310
Bye.

861
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:52,910
Bye.

862
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:54,190
Well, listen, let me tell you...

863
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:59,170
Your rocket ship is in the air.

864
00:53:59,170 --> 00:53:59,170


865
00:53:59,170 --> 00:53:59,270
It's a rocket ship.

866
00:53:59,270 --> 00:53:59,270


867
00:53:59,270 --> 00:53:59,270


868
00:53:59,270 --> 00:53:59,270


869
00:53:59,270 --> 00:53:59,270


870
00:53:59,270 --> 00:53:59,270


871
00:53:59,270 --> 00:53:59,270


872
00:53:59,270 --> 00:53:59,270


873
00:53:59,270 --> 00:53:59,270


874
00:53:59,270 --> 00:53:59,570
It's a rocket ship.

875
00:53:59,570 --> 00:53:59,570


876
00:53:59,570 --> 00:53:59,570


877
00:53:59,570 --> 00:53:59,570


878
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,030
So, you'll have to be a pilot, or a pilot at the ship, if thou gets the chance.

879
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:07,510
Thou shalt switch from rockets to flying saucers propelled by gravity waves or the

880
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,470
like as soon as it is technically feasible.

881
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:16,690
Thou shalt not breach the seals nor compromise the airlock.

882
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:25,050
Thou shalt retain optimal manual control over all ship functions, no matter how supposedly

883
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:29,170
trustworthy thine shipboard computer may be.

884
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:34,470
Thou shalt keep clean and shipshape thine current spaceship.

885
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:42,910

Yeah.

Thou shalt not breach the seals.

We'll have to go out and evacuate ourselves outside now and then in the void.

912
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:36,330
What do you do about bugs?

913
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,370
You know, alien bugs, viruses.

914
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,690
You can't drink that stuff by the gallon.

915
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:43,350
The ship's perfectly sterile all the time.

916
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:48,010
You just have to make sure that you get all the worst germs scrubbed out and put into Dave's room.

917
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:49,450
Well, he makes you sterile.

918
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:52,310
You know, if you do that, then that takes all the fun out of it.

919
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,050
Well, I suppose everything makes you sterile.

920
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:54,510
Well, no, no.

921
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:57,930
That's why we put it into Dave's room, so that we can watch the germs in there.

922
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:58,770
Oh, oh, oh.

923
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,470
And then we stay on the other side of the air box.

924
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:00,850
Right.

925
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:01,770
Yeah, just funnel them all over the day.

926
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:05,750
Do you think, you know, if the chocolatey, delicious chocolatey drink for children can give you a sterilization problem,

00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:09,410
what better are we than the Liebensraum Hitlers and all them guys?

928
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:11,250
You know, we want to make room for germs.

929
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:11,770
We've got prop!

930
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:13,170
That's right.

931
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:14,010
That's it.

932
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:15,250
That's all there is to it.

933
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,770
We've got prop and they don't?

934
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:17,170
Yeah.

935
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,550
That doesn't make any sense, dude.

936
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:20,510
We'll have our own rocket ship.

937
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:21,790
Just let the princess wee.

938
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,030
If you doubt that for a second.

939
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,970
Yeah, I better remember my origins.

940
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,170
I think everybody should.

941
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:29,730
Yeah.

942
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:34,310
And here are the origins, friends, of what we've been listening to.

943
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,730
The tail end of side one there.

944
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:44,190
We heard Sister Chris from WFMU in the old days doing the Citizens for Normalcy rant.

945
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:52,130
We heard Einstein's Secret Orchestra doing Let Me Tell You About a Place in Outer Space.

946
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:55,050
Sister Decadence's X-Day Farewell.

947
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:57,830
And David Lynch preaching on X-Day.

948
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:06,850
Some Doc Stock No. 3 report from the ancient days with the band that dare not speak its name performing Sick-a-Bob.

949
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:10,650
Einstein's Secret Orchestra doing this Infernal Machine.

950
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:18,090
Various old KPFA with Glass Madness and Wellman on artists and prop.

951
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:21,810
And Wellman's edit of You Have Signed the Application.

952
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:22,530
Ah, yes.

953
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:23,510
The Harvest.

954
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:26,370
Susie the Floozy did the Connie Collage.

955
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:27,670
And Annie Sprinkle.

956
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:28,590
Strip Search.

957
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:32,310
Friday Jones killed you for the honor of Connie.

958
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:34,770
And, of course, Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

960
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:36,530

Recording and Friends.

964
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:47,650
Speaking of Boston, there is a DeVival coming up in Boston April 30th.

965
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:49,150
The Friday.

966
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:52,090
And at the Middle East Club.

967
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,790
With Pope David N. Meyer.

968
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:54,670
Worst Truly.

969
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:55,590

And Thurman.

973
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:58,430
Friday Jones.

974
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:02,830
And the number to call about DeVivals is this phone number.

975
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:04,390
216.

976
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:06,950
This is the DeVival hotline.

977
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:13,650
216-556-0338.

978
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:18,090
That's 216-556-0338.

979
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:22,730
And also learn about the Seattle DeVival coming up on Memorial Day.

980
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:27,770
And Lemuria Rising in Portland, Oregon on June 10th.

981
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:29,350
And check our website.

982
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:31,330
And also check out this.

983
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:32,930
I'm sorry, Dave.

984
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:34,450
I can't do that.

985
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:37,990
Five, four, three, two.

986
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,190
I can just smell that field coming.

987
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:43,670
July 5th in that big old field at Brushwood.

988
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:44,470
Ah.

989
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:45,990
Ah.

990
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:48,330
First the little rockets go up.

991
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:49,810
Then the big rockets go up.

992
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:51,450
And then the really big ones.

993
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:53,530
Come on down.

994
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:54,270
That's right.

995
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:56,390
The rockets are our signal.

996
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:59,270
To let the saucers know it's time.

997
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:02,070
We're ready for them to come down.

998
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:03,530
To make that final step down.

999
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:05,310
Put their little ladder down.

1000
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:06,430
The little rope ladder down.

1001
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:10,550
To let the saucers know there's still something down here on Earth worth saving.

1002
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:11,050
That's right.

1003
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:12,390
Step on up, baby.

1004
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:13,170
Step on up.

1005
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,930
We got a ride for you inside.

1006
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:15,910
Check it out here.

1007
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:19,390
We've got everything you could possibly need without a mind or imagination.

1008
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,570
You could go beyond what you've already thought.

1009
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:24,050
Because everything you can't believe is here.

1010
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:25,450
It's here.

1011
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:25,690
It's here.

1012
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:26,830
It's up in the sky.

1013
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:28,310
And all it takes.

1014
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:33,890
All it takes to experience all this is to be a member of the Church of the Self-Genius.

1015
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:34,670

1021
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:54,370

01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:16,570
It means the same thing as zero.

1029
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:18,930
8-1.

1030
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:19,830
4 for nothing.

1031
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:20,570
Get it off.

1032
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:21,550
4.

1033
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:22,410
That's right, baby.

1034
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:23,690
4 for nothing.

1035
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:25,030
Can you just see everybody?

1036
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:27,030
I can just see the whole Brushwood people.

1037
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,390
The whole community there.

1038
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:31,450
The whole X-Day community in one big circle around the launch pad.

1039
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,530
And most of the girls aren't wearing shirts.

1040
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:34,750
No, and they're all...

1041
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:36,190
And everybody's just grooving.

1042
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:37,670
And here, this is playing.

1043
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:40,070
Yeah, while we jam them out.

1044
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:40,570
Yeah, man.

1045
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:41,870
Yeah, all booging back and forth.

1046
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,550
Man, feel that love vibe.

1047
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:44,870
Jesus will be there.

1048
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:45,550
The love vibe.

1049
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:50,670
Jesus Christ himself will be there blessing and anointing the young...

1050
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:51,990
Yeah, I like that.

1051
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:52,270
Back to life.

1052
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:53,030
Yes.

1053
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:53,290
Yes.

1054
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:53,490
Yes.

1055
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:53,750
Yes.

1056
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:53,830


1057
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:54,150
Yes.

1058
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:54,350
Yes.

1059
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:54,730
Yes.

1060
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:54,870


1061
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:54,950
Yes.

1062
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:54,970


1063
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:54,970

01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:54,970


1066
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:56,690
One of those rockets as they go up.

1067
01:00:57,330 --> 01:01:00,150
And you can be there to witness this.

1068
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:04,570
El Diablo, Satan himself, will be there to curse those rockets as they go up.

1069
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:05,690
But who's going to win?

1070
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,750
Jesus, Satan, or Bob?

1071
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:08,650
Well, you know...

1072
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:10,550
Well, Christ Bob Bob will be there.

1073
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:11,010
That's right.

1074
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:15,210
And you know, the rockets do rise on a column of fire.

1075
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:19,050
But underneath the fire, it leaves behind a column of clouds.

1076
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:22,950
So you have hell and heaven all there.

1077
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:23,890
It's all a metaphor.

1078
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:29,130
The rockets are a big metaphor for the cycle of the absurdity of life.

1079
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:31,490
They all end up on their heads.

1080
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:33,570
That's the miracle of it all.

1081
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:33,950
That's right.

1082
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:39,790
Sometimes the parachute pops out, and sometimes it don't.

1083
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:45,650
So you want to make your own rocket.

1084
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:48,170
You want to keep your own ship shite.

1085
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:48,790
Ship.

1086
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:49,670
Ship shite.

1087
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:50,850
What was that, Friday?

1088
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:52,350
Friday weekend for the launchings.

1089
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:53,870
You want to make sure if you're taking your own rocket...

1090
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:55,930
Slip it in, Friday. Slip it in.

1091
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:59,450
... or some kind of semi-rig on the New York State Highway Patrol,

1092
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:02,790
we'll be out looking out for those rocket ships on the top of Toyotas.

1093
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:07,830
Also, make sure that if you're trying to fly there via pyroflashlands,

1094
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:11,350
the smoke bands aren't affecting most of Chautauqua County.

1095
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:12,850
Man, I listened to Friday on that guitar.

1096
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:13,970
Oh, man.

1097
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:14,770
She bitchin'.

1098
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:15,970
That bitch be bitchin'.

1099
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,690
It's going to be better than that when it's live.
