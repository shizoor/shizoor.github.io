1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,220
To be enraged with a dumb brute that acted out of blind instinct is blasphemous.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:13,460
Speak not to me, you blasphemy man. I'd strike the sun if it insulted me.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,680
Look here, Starbuck.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,840
All visible objects are but as pasteboard masks.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,720
Some inscrutable yet reasoning thing puts forth the molding of their features.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,060
The white whale tasks me.

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,500
He heaps me.

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,460
Yet he is but a mask.

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,940
Just the thing behind the mask I chiefly hate.

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,580
The malignant thing that has plagued and frightened man since time began.

11
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,100
The thing that mauls and mutilates our race.

12
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,360
Not killing us outright, but letting us live on.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,900
With half a heart and half a lung.

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,660
God keep us, keep us all.

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,660
He rises!

16
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,080
I promise to cut taxes for the rich and use the poor as a cheap source of teeth for aquarium gravel.

17
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,400
That'll show those poor.

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,380
You're not rich.

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,760
But someday I might be rich and then people like me better watch their step.

20
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,440
And then this Democrat mayor gets up.

21
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,160
He said, wow, I think it was Donald Trump.

22
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,200
The people over there

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
Let me invite you all here to match St Curtin for a meal today.

24
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,600
Don't cost a pound of penis.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:40,600


26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:40,600


27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:40,600


28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,620
Make public facial ever go babe Hey, can I have a together drink with you Miss fils?

29
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,660
You deeply wet Istra

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,200
Can you believe?

31
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:50,380


32
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:50,380


33
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:57,700
Thank you.

34
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,560
Think what Donald Trump has done for us

35
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,780
Everyone's a fuck and their brains are full of fuss

36
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,780
Tra-la-lee, with the yoodle-fuck

37
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,060
Everybody gather up, come on, go pass the buck

38
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,360
Straddles get down from ain't a Seattle

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,900
Hop and skip and chop

40
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,060
It's time to be a sociopath and vote for Donald Trump

41
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,620
Part of the problem and part of the reason it takes so long

42
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,580
Is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore, right?

43
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,700
And they're being politically correct the way they take them out

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,700
Look at my African-American over here

45
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,560
Look at him

46
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,120
Are you the greatest?

47
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,400
I love the old days, you know what they used to do to guys like that

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,800
When they were in a place like this

49
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,560
They'd be carrying them on a stretcher

50
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,600
Oh no

51
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,320
No, no, will we dance, you know we don't

52
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,680
The ghost of less dramatics will rise up and sing the song

53
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,600
Pop the yoodle-bottle-dum, he's completely nude

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,980
Donald's got a boner, that's because he's not a prude

55
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,040
Dr. Tarzan, get involved, rise up and take a stand

56
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,100
Donald Trump's the guy to make America great again

57
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,120
Are you watching InfoWars or spitting on your chin?

58
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,460
Lubricate your rectum!

59
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,180
With your best, it will descend

60
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,540
Tra-la-loo, cock-a-doodle-doo

61
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,600
He'll deport the Mexicans, the Muslims, and the Jews

62
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,760
Tra-Italy-Dub, stuff your head inside your own

63
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,020
Join the Klan, pick out your sheet, and vote for Donald Trump

64
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,580
Hop or dance, goodbye to France, it's Mussolini's second chance

65
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,180
20 million white supremacists can't be wrong

66
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,140
Tra-la-loo, yip-de-diddly-do

67
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,240
Donald Trump, the Vladimir Putin, the Mardi Gras, the D

68
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,560
Ho-yo-yo, slippity-dippity-slop

69
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,780
It's time for all the getting, cause it's time for Donald Trump

70
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,000
Everyone's a dumbass and their brains are full of bluffs

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,040
It's time to build the air of love, vote for Donald Trump!

72
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,420
I can punch him in the face, I beg of you!

73
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,520
We having a good time?

74
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,260
USA! USA!

75
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,180
USA! USA!

76
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,160
Alright, yeah, get him out. Try not to hurt him.

77
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,520
If you do, I'll defend you in court, don't worry about it.

78
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:46,380
Sitting in the studio with Dr. Trump, Mr. Bob, and Santa Claus, and all these other guys

79
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,760
Yeah, he conquered the Martians

80
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,480
Hugh Hefner

81
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,920
Mark Twain would be here

82
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,500
Thomas Jefferson would be here

83
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,160
Woodrow Wilson, I'd like to talk, and Jackson, I'd love to talk to those guys

84
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,060
Jackson, that's what the times politically remind me of right now, is the times that could have been during Jackson's time

85
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,980
Where things were just about as crazily divided

86
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
By the eternal

87
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,620
Eason

88
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,280
He would say

89
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,120
Yeah, by the eternal Eason debacle

90
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,580
The young man, President Jackson?

91
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,980
Not so young, what am I saying?

92
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,660
Well

93
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:29,420
Drew some lines in the sand, and if you weren't on his side, you weren't on his side

94
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,580
And you would never get anything done with him, unless you were on his side

95
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,020
Well, many considered it the end of the country

96
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,300
That Jackson's hooligans and frontier backwoodsmen were going to be

97
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,780
Yeah, remind you of anything?

98
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:04,180
Only now, the guy gets atomic weapons, and he gets Vincent Gallo

99
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,400
Any movie by Vincent Gallo you want to see, he is right there in the library

100
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,040
The End

101
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,360
Years of War

102
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:19,560
Help however many has brought on some

103
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:19,780
Of these

104
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,580
Are you King Mrs.

105
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:21,800


106
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:21,820
Ring

107
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,220
Gaff

108
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,220


109
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,500
Crown

110
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,800
federated

111
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,020
Third

112
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:50,320
from German, the word Fricken, which means to strike. In English, Trump falls into many

113
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:57,760
grammatical categories. As a transitive verb, for instance, John trumped Shirley. As an

114
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:04,400
intransitive verb, Shirley trumps. Its meaning's not always sexual. It can be used as an adjective,

115
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:12,120
such as, John's doing all the trumping work. As part of an adverb, Shirley talks to trumping

116
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:20,100
much. As an adverb enhancing an adjective, Shirley is trumping beautiful. As a noun,

117
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:27,980
I don't give a trump. As part of a word, abso-trumping lutely, or in-trumping credible.

118
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:36,400
And, as almost every word in a sentence, trump, the trumping trumpers. As you must realize,

119
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,560
there aren't too many words with the versatility of trump. As in these examples describing

120
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,100
situations.

121
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:50,740
Such as, fraud. I got trumped. That they use Carlot. Dismay. Aw, trump it. Trouble.

122
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:59,120
I guess I'm really trumped now. Aggression. Don't trump with me, buddy. Difficulty. I

123
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:07,540
don't understand this trumping question. Inquiry. Who the trump was that? Dissatisfaction. I

124
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,460
don't like what the trump is going on here. Incompetence.

125
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:11,960
Charm!

126
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,320
I'm Cool.

127
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,680

131
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:32,300


132
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:32,300


133
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:32,300

140
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:32,980
my

141
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,960
ch

142
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,920
daily speech. It will identify

143
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,680
the quality of your character

144
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,980
immediately. Say it

145
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,540
loudly and proudly.

146
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,480
Trump. You.

147
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,240
That is with him. Republicans

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,960
won't send him a single bill

149
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,800
he can sign. And the Democrats

150
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,700
aren't much better.

151
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,420
Blind leading is stupid.

152
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,840
Doug, do you

153
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,960
recall anything

154
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,860
about what happened?

155
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,340
Stop reminiscing about the past

156
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,100
and concentrate on our glorious

157
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,680
future. Just look at it.

158
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,660
With our glorious leader, our new leader,

159
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,120
we can all sing songs

160
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,860
to the glory of our new leader.

161
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,980
Hillary Clinton.

162
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,660
We've been working on this plan since day one.

163
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,260
It has nothing to do with the approval ratings.

164
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,640
But as for the election,

165
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,600
whose turn is it to ask today?

166
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,000
Is the president running in 2016?

167
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,600
Today, the priority is good

168
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,500
government. But

169
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,920
ask you again tomorrow.

170
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,760
Thank you, everyone.

171
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,220
The program has been banned from the air.

172
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,140
You know that, too.

173
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,600
I know, but

174
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,820
it's too vital to the radio.

175
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,080
Not only was the ban on the program overruled,

176
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,480
but it's also

177
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,900
not only on television,

178
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,360
but on television.

179
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,100
The films that I

180
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,120
constantly revisit

181
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,100
and saw repeatedly

182
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,520
held up longer for me over the years

183
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,380
not because of plot,

184
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,300
but because of character

185
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,580
and a very different approach

186
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,080
to stories.

187
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,820
We say Muslims are

188
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,140
out of control.

189
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,980
Whatever he said about the

190
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,020
Muslims, I care about my religion

191
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,320
more than this country.

192
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,580
And if he's willing to kick us out,

193
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,820
then I'm going to be very disappointed.

194
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,400
Being away from the neighborhood

195
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,420
that I grew up,

196
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,120
especially in the neighborhood

197
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,000
that he grew up in.

198
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,080
When they cheered on 9-11,

199
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,760
now you want to ban them all,

200
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,920
Donald Trump.

201
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,640
I wouldn't touch you

202
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,480
despite your

203
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,360
39.5% lead in the polls.

204
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,720
You hate Mexicans.

205
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,700
What am I doing?

206
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,680
Mr. Trump.

207
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,860
Say let's see

208
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,660
who's stealing.

209
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,200
And rape.

210
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,720
You want to build a wall

211
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,960
and make Hispanics pay it all,

212
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,300
Mr. Trump.

213
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,380
Given the choice between you

214
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,420
and Hillary Clinton,

215
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,500
I choose.

216
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,620
I don't want to support either of you.

217
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,100
This song is just going to draw more attention to Trump.

218
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,940
Big picture people are...

219
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,960
Are we doing more hard-licking?

220
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,760
No.

221
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,700
You're a nightmare, Mr. Trump.

222
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,660
You're a cow with sex, a stooge.

223
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,740
Mocking disabled reporters,

224
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,620
calling women ugly.

225
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,200
You will not run.

226
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:45,880
You will not run.

227
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,120
You will run by the numbers.

228
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,180
I will treat you.

229
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,520
The three words that best describe

230
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,880
your lack of political experience

231
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,160
are as follows, and I quote,

232
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,200
kid, kid, kid.

233
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,840
You're a mean one.

234
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,400
You're a mean one.

235
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,020
Mr. Trump.

236
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,460
Mr. Pain.

237
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,860
You have dear hair.

238
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,220
You're the electoral fungus

239
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,300
topped with cotton candy hair.

240
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,840
Mr. Trump.

241
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,260
Your candidacy is an appalling dump.

242
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,660
Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment

243
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,300
of deplorable rubbish imaginable.

244
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,120
And you probably disapprove of this song

245
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,220
because it's about transphobia.

246
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,760
I don't see it.

247
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,500
Even though you don't really care.

248
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,000
Jesus.

249
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,660
Mr. Trump.

250
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,400
The seizing crocodile.

251
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,040
Shut up.

252
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,000
It would take an hour and a half

253
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,420
to learn everything there is

254
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,520
to learn about missiles.

255
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,680
I think I know most of it anyway.

256
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,860
My wife, Ivana,

257
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,360
is a brilliant manager.

258
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,900
I will pay her one dollar a year

259
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,900
and all the dresses she can buy.

260
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,140
I think the only difference

261
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,360
between me and the other candidates is

262
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm more honest

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,180
and my women are more honest.

264
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,580
I'm more beautiful.

265
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,320
I build the best buildings.

266
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,480
And I'm the biggest developer in New York by far.

267
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,300
While that's real estate and this is politics.

268
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,960
Are they really so different?

269
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,300
Usually if I fire someone who's bad

270
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,040
I tell them how great they are.

271
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,180
Because I don't want to hurt people's feelings.

272
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,740
My fingers are long and beautiful.

273
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,160
That's been well documented.

274
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,920
Along with other various parts of my body.

275
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,460
My Twitter has become so powerful

276
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,680
that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.

277
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,280
The concept of global warming

278
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,620
was created by the Chinese.

279
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,300
Sorry losers and haters,

280
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,560
but my IQ is one of the highest.

281
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,240
And you all know it.

282
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,740
Please don't feel stupid or insecure.

283
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,720
It's not your fault.

284
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,100
And it's not a wig.

285
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,120
It's my hair.

286
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,120
Do you want to touch it?

287
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,160
McCain, he's not a war hero.

288
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,440
He's a war hero because he was captured.

289
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,440
I don't want to hurt him.

290
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,740
I like people that weren't captured.

291
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,560
Okay?

292
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,880
What I say is what I say.

293
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,460
Well, I do whine because I want to win.

294
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,840
And I'm not happy about not winning.

295
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,760
I fully think apologizing is a great thing.

296
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,200
But you have to be wrong.

297
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,700
I will absolutely apologize if I'm ever wrong.

298
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,140
The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

299
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,280
I love Hispanics.

300
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,260
Some of us will probably catch it on TV

301
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,320
with chicken hanging from our mouths.

302
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,700
It's funny.

303
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,380
The media used to love social unrest and political uprisings.

304
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,240
It always meant good ratings.

305
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,600
When the revolution comes...

306
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,300
By the 1990s,

307
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,860
Congress decided six companies should own 90% of everything on television.

308
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,200
With big businesses controlling the sea of information,

309
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,020
people just needed someone to wake them up.

310
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,360
There is a calm moment before a king,

311
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:58,420
a king of kings,

312
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:58,660
a king of kings,

313
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:58,660


314
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:58,660


315
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:58,660


316
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:58,660


317
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:58,660


318
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:58,660


319
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,940
When a king relinquishes his throne,

320
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,440
but without a successor,

321
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,400
a power vacuum forms.

322
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,640
To some,

323
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,120
he was a political hat trick.

324
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,820
He got bin Laden,

325
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,600
started Obamacare,

326
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,060
and stopped the recession.

327
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,320
To others,

328
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,960
he was a war criminal

329
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,700
or a vaguely defined socialist threat.

330
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,500
They were all eager to see him go.

331
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,340
Obama liked his vision of America.

332
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,520
He wanted to keep building it,

333
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,400
and he needed to do it now.

334
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,400


335
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,400


336
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,400


337
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,400


338
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,400


339
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
needed a Democrat to pass the torch to.

340
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,840
But one man had a different vision.

341
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,780
Sounds like political presidential talk to me,

342
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,880
and I know people have talked to you about whether or not you want to run.

343
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,940
Would you ever?

344
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,500
Probably not, but I do get tired of seeing the country ripped off.

345
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,060
Why would you not?

346
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,500
I just don't think I really have the inclination to do it.

347
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,220
I love what I'm doing.

348
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:54,900
I am officially running for President of the United States,

349
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,460
and we are going to make our country great again.

350
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,100
The guy that made a living off bankrupting casinos and giving people their pink slips.

351
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,580
You're fired. You're fired. You're fired.

352
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,100
Now claimed he was going to get Americans their jobs back.

353
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,820
He had all the makings of a politician.

354
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,760
Money, fame, and a catchphrase.

355
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,160
And a million dollars in merchandise.

356
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,520
And he had a history with the media.

357
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,040
Donald Trump.

358
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,960
Donald Trump.

359
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,740
Donald Trump.

360
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,720
Did the Trump support drive the media, or did the media drive the Trump support?

361
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,440
As it turned out, someone else was making headlines.

362
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,720
Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.

363
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,080
She was the matriarch of one of the most powerful families in American politics,

364
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,760
and she had experience.

365
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,520
As a shareholder and director of our company, I'm always proud of Walmart.

366
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,200
There are different functions.

367
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,400
There are different ways that go with being involved in the activities of the First Lady.

368
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,980
Hillary Rodham Clinton is the 15th Secretary of State from New York.

369
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,880
There's only one problem.

370
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,300
The FBI.

371
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,720
They had been after the Clintons for years.

372
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,980
But they never got them.

373
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,840
20 plus years, and Bill and Hillary never got as much as the speeding ticket.

374
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,280
But it wasn't the Feds or Donalds she had to worry about.

375
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,980
Her biggest challenge would come from an unexpected place.

376
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,280
I'm often asked how disclosure might take place.

377
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,560
It'll happen on a Friday evening around 9.

378
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,280
The President will step up to the podium at the end of Crossfall in the East Wing,

379
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,840
and he will get right to the point.

380
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,300
My fellow Americans, this evening I'm here to tell you something quite extraordinary.

381
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:51,940
The Earth is in fact being visited by other civilizations, and has been for some time.

382
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,420
At the beginning of Monday morning,

383
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:00,620
there will be an engagement of the media as we prepare for what will certainly be an extraordinary new era in human history.

384
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,660
That's right!

385
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,420
We had your husband, President Clinton, on the show.

386
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:14,260
He said, I asked him about UFOs in Area 51, and if you looked in, because if I was president, that's the first thing I'd do.

387
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,080
I'd go right into those files and see what was going on.

388
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,280
Right.

389
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,960
And he said that he did do that.

390
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,280
Yes.

391
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,020
And that he didn't find anything.

392
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,220
Well, I'm going to...

393
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,300
Oh!

394
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,040
I'm going to...

395
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,460
I'm going to do it again.

396
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,740
Yeah, why not?

397
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,500
Right?

398
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,500
And you know, there's a new name.

399
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,620
It's Unexplained Aerial Phenomenon.

400
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:49,120
The current presidential campaign might be the first in which UFO disclosure has been championed by a major party candidate.

401
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,540
During a recent campaign stop in Las Vegas,

402
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,500
the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton,

403
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,260
told Politics Now host Steve Sibelius that his candidate will try to get to the bottom of the UFO question.

404
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:05,240
Mrs. Clinton told a New Hampshire newspaper she intends it's possible the planet may have been visited

405
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,980
and would consider creating a task force to investigate Nevada's Area 51 military base.

406
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:17,280
In the mid-90s, the Clintons were lobbied by billionaire Lawrence Rockefeller to end UFO secrecy.

407
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:22,680
Mrs. Clinton was photographed with Rockefeller while holding a book titled, Are We Alone?

408
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,760
I can't prove it.

409
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:32,760
But I believe that the Clinton team, having been introduced to the ET issue,

410
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,160
they made a determination we're going to be the disclosure president.

411
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:43,560
And so with that in mind, they begin the process of speaking to the ET issue and Podesta's the conduit.

412
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,840
I think it's time to open the books on the question of UFOs.

413
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,600
It's time to find out what the truth really is that's out there.

414
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,300
We ought to do it really because it's right.

415
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,480
We ought to do it because the American people, quite frankly, can handle the truth.

416
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,360
And we ought to do it because it's the law.

417
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,000
If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee,

418
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,120
the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished.

419
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,580
He's not of the temperament of the kind of society we live in.

420
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,400
He's not a stable, thoughtful person we need as leader.

421
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,420
You can see how loyal he is. He was begging for my endorsement.

422
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,340
Donald Trump is a fool. A fool.

423
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,500
Now Donald Trump tells us that he is very, very smart.

424
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,720
He is very, very not smart.

425
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,200
Attacking me, as he surely will, won't prove him any less of a fool.

426
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,360
It's entirely in his hands to prove me wrong.

427
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,860
Oh, God. Hello?

428
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,960
I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees. He would have dropped to his knees.

429
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,660
Oh, God.

430
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,500
Hey, well, let's hear it, Big Don.

431
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,240
Don't worry about it a little, Mario.

432
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,220
I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.

433
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,120
I tell you that.

434
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,340
Obama is going to be out playing golf.

435
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,680
He might even be on one of my courses. I would invite him.

436
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,820
I actually would say, I'm not saying they're stupid.

437
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,140
I like China.

438
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,380
I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.

439
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,300
Am I supposed to dislike them?

440
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,280
But we don't know, because we have no protection.

441
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:40,560
Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.

442
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,940
They've become rich.

443
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,280
I'm in competition with them.

444
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,240
They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this?

445
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,920
We have losers. We have losers.

446
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,420
We have people that don't have it.

447
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,500
We have people that are morally corrupt.

448
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,800
I'm really rich. I'll show you that in a second.

449
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,480
I have a net worth.

450
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,280
I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?

451
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,260
I don't have to brag. I don't have to, believe it or not.

452
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,200
I think I am a nice person. People that know me like me.

453
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,280
My friend, we have traveled very far.

454
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,920
We have no food, no water.

455
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,900
Once I see my people fed, I would be honored.

456
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,320
No. We have a serious problem with radical Islam.

457
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,780
We have a tremendous problem.

458
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,660
And we can't be the stupid country anymore.

459
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,480
Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates.

460
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,800
Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted.

461
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,280
The people that are with me 100% are the people.

462
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,040
What?

463
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,540
The Pope. The Pope was in Mexico. Do you know that?

464
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,740
Did everyone know that? Right?

465
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,600
He said negative things about me.

466
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,460
Dreadful.

467
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,560
The Pope is being told that Donald Trump is not a nice person.

468
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,820
Donald Trump is a very nice person.

469
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,920
You do not let us in. All of us will die.

470
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,300
I said temporarily. I didn't say permanently. I said temporarily.

471
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:21,000
We have no border. We have no control. People are flooding across.

472
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,900
We need to build a wall. And it has to be built quickly.

473
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,920
The greatest builder is me. And I would build the greatest wall you have ever seen.

474
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:39,460
And in that wall, we're going to have a beautiful, big, fat door where people can come into the country, but they have to come in illegally.

475
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,920
I don't think they like me very much.

476
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,680
This country needs somebody that's a dealmaker.

477
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,160
I'm giving you Commander Greyguard.

478
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,080
No deals. No deals. We don't make deals. Not with anybody. We don't make deals.

479
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,480
You mistake me, my lord. That was a command.

480
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,740
No, no, no, no. Excuse me. Just so you understand. We need people that know what they're doing. We don't need babies.

481
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,200
Are you refusing to obey my order?

482
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,700
Yeah. By the way, I never... I think you could say that, yeah.

483
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,320
Olly, bring me my sword.

484
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,500
They laugh at us. But they say, what about it? And they chop off heads.

485
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,060
They think we are so stupid. You have no idea.

486
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,080
Much like my head. I don't want to see it removed just yet.

487
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:28,400
I would bring back waterboarding. And I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.

488
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,620
This is some heavy stuff.

489
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,140
What do you got going in here?

490
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,520
I think that's how the early subgenius preachers were born.

491
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,280
They multiplied like...

492
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,720
Like amoebas.

493
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:04,680
Like amoebas, yeah. They would get... They'd start swelling up, look like they're going to explode, and all of a sudden they would split into two.

494
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,460
Horrible, pussy...

495
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,600
Horrible preachers.

496
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:12,020
Yes, the trucks were filled with giant seedpods of some kind. And they're all over the highway.

497
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,480
See, this is the thing Dr. Howe and Philo don't like.

498
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,160
What I want to tell you about is what X-Day really is about.

499
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,360
I'm afraid the public is not ready to know.

500
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,220
What about the incredible two-headed transplant?

501
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,500
Another X-Day mistake. Yes, that one was...

502
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,080
There's one up in the refrigerator.

503
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,420
There's, uh...

504
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:31,880
Nobody notices.

505
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,500
All right, yes dear friends, that was an amazing set of collages.

506
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,060
We used a lot of puzzling evidence to show from right after the election.

507
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,100
And I don't know who...

508
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,380
Who actually did a lot of those collages.

509
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,540
It may have been by puzzling evidence.

510
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,640
It might have been by Phineas Narco of National Cynical Radio.

511
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,360
But we know that the song at the beginning,

512
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,920
Uh, it's time for Trump, was the Rudy Schwartz project.

513
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,720
And now, back to lonesome cowboy Dave.

514
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,840
I'm proud of Rudy for having at least secured the elements necessary to create the show.

515
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,680
Well Dave, I have a quote for us.

516
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,620
This is H.L. Mencken.

517
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,620
And he said, quote,

518
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:27,720
As democracy is perfected, the office of the president represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people.

519
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,740
On some great and glorious day, the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last,

520
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:41,920
and the White House will be occupied by a downright fool and complete narcissistic moron.

521
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,040
That was H.L. Mencken.

522
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,660
Mencken.

523
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,180
Mencken.

524
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,820
The Munchkin.

525
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,100
In the Baltimore Evening Sun, July 26, 1920.

526
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,220
1920.

527
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:53,980
Yes.

528
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,100
So...

529
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,360
Yes.

530
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:03,360
And we must remember also that even in the 40s and the 30s, all of the salivators, the great salivators,

531
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:09,380
like Citizen Kane and stuff like that, which paralleled real, real, real, real events.

532
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,060
For instance, especially in the case of Citizen Kane,

533
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,020
which was the surrogate subcontractor.

534
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,280
And I think that's what really exploded for the, um, for William Randolph Hearst.

535
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,640
The belly button boy.

536
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,620
He's like back-up boy group.

537
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:22,660
So...

538
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,500
He used to follow him.

539
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:30,220
So when Trump kicks the bucket or the crystal ball, as the case may be, like in Citizen Kane,

540
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,940
what will his rosebud be?

541
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:40,180
Um, I have to say it would be his hot Slovenian wife, because that would be like more of a cabbage roll with a poker type thing.

542
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,080
It would have to be...

543
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,340
No, I know what it would be.

544
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,640
Jose and the Argonauts, because he was such a random spitter.

545
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,600
And he was anti-creative.

546
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:48,800
No.

547
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,700
I think I know what, what Trump's rosebud would be.

548
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,240
He would die saying the word,

549
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,440
Me.

550
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,180
Well, Dave, all I know is we're going to need a bigger lie.

551
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,300
A bigger, big lie.

552
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,860
We're going to need a bigger, big lie.

553
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,640
The big lie worked for those guys, but we've got to come up with a bigger, big lie.

554
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,640
Well, you know the rules.

555
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,560
Say it three times and they'll believe it.

556
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,520
Keep on repeating it over and over again.

557
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,440
You want to say a lie, make it a big one and say it over and over and over until it finally gets in there.

558
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:23,760
Tweet it.

559
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,780
Tweet it over.

560
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,120
If you tweet it over and over.

561
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,340
Until the echo chamber makes it so.

562
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:40,320
I've never seen anything this dumb, but I've seen so many super dumb things happen that I'm not really surprised that things could get even dumber.

563
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,620
I would...

564
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,480
I was a little bit shocked.

565
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,580
I thought, this is like, well, you're right all along.

566
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,500
Everybody is stupid as hell.

567
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,420
No, that was Bob said that.

568
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,560
And he said that was good.

569
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,880
No one is dumber than me, Bob said.

570
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,680
But it's, you know...

571
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,420
We must not go quietly into that dark night of tax returns, though.

572
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,260
We must rebel, rouse and shout like hell before we get Stockholm.

573
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,100
That's cool, but you know that was Dylan Thomas and stuff like that.

574
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,000
That's from a Dylan Thomas poem.

575
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,220
Well, you know when you're...

576
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,920
You know what Stockholm Syndrome is, right?

577
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,540
Scrotum Syndrome?

578
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,760
Yeah, where you're taken hostage but can't handle the fear and humiliation of being a prisoner.

579
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,520
So you automatically start to...

580
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,020
Oh, Stockholm Syndrome, I thought you said.

581
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,700
You start to love your captors.

582
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,540
Yes.

583
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:40,920
Uncontrollably.

584
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,000
But we're not going to do that.

585
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,240
I just want you to know that.

586
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:49,060
You form a co-dependency, a relationship that can only be described as perverse.

587
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,740
And that's what we all have with the presidency.

588
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,620
But at least he's got some good ideas for us all to digest for the next couple weeks before.

589
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,380
Oh, I must say one thing because it won't be funny but it's true and I just heard about it.

590
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:09,260
That there's a strong belief that there was some diddling going on in the state of Ohio with Mr. Houston or whatever his name is.

591
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,420
The Secretary of State.

592
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:16,600
The Secretary of State who differed on who was a Trump supporter as opposed to the governor there in Ohio.

593
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:26,740
But there was a million vote discrepancy and the margin of error was only like about 43,000 people that Mr. Trump won by.

594
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,460
And yet a million people were stricken from their roles and nobody knows what happened to them.

595
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,400
And he was in charge of getting the ballots.

596
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,340
Like your ballot, perhaps even.

597
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,800
Well, I was going to say.

598
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:45,200
I went to so much trouble to get that absentee ballot mailed in at the last hour of the last day.

599
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,500
And all for nothing, I tell you.

600
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,120
And we should have known.

601
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,900
We had so many clues, Dave.

602
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:57,640
For instance, that Kellyanne Conway, first woman to run a successful presidential campaign.

603
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,940
Look at her name.

604
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:00,820
Conway.

605
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,140
Conway.

606
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,820
Hiding in plain sight.

607
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,940
And then as we heard earlier on the show, there was Hillary.

608
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,120
Who's obviously one of the lizard aliens.

609
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:17,240
Bragging openly about how she was going to expose the gray alien UFO conspiracy.

610
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,300
So obviously they had to replace her with one of their own puppets.

611
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,700
So it's all part of the gray versus alien secret alien overlord mob war.

612
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:34,400
And I would think that would be a great psychocognitive tool for any listener to the church of the hour of slack.

613
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,020
Or any potential church of the subgenius member.

614
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:44,220
Would be Hillary Clinton, Trump, and Miss, Miss Conway and all of these other different characters.

615
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,920
As actual little hand puppets which can be easily worn.

616
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,660
And that way they can diddle and dawdle the night and day away.

617
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:57,440
By, you know, hashing out all these major problems that they've internalized by listening to the media.

618
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:04,260
You know, they argue back and forth and they look at each hand.

619
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,240
Punch and Judy.

620
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,460
And then they hit each other with little sticks.

621
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,000
Punch and Judy.

622
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,380
Yeah.

623
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,500
And then they wake up and they're like, ah, I'm expunged like a voter, you know.

624
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,820
I feel relieved you're gone and missing in action.

625
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,200
Well, we had lots of warnings.

626
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:28,400
In Book of the Subgenius, in fact, there's this long prophetic section called Dateline for Dominance.

627
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,600
And I'm looking through it.

628
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,000
Black rogue subgenius runs for president.

629
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,000
Embarrasses conspiracy by freeing him.

630
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,580
Being American captives from third world crazy.

631
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,300
This was like, it predicted Barack Obama, but it predicted him for 1984.

632
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,480
And then we go a little bit further down.

633
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,860
We got to wait 20 more years for X Day then even though.

634
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,940
Well, no, no.

635
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,280
Since, right.

636
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,440
But that at least gives us a hope.

637
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,600
You know, it gives us some kind of a way to anchor what might be the real dates.

638
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,780
As it says.

639
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,120
It says.

640
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:11,660
Prez clone elected ends most aid to poor.

641
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,340
Mines harbors of non-American countries.

642
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,100
And then immediately after that, Book of the Subgenius says Prez clone.

643
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,160
And I'm actually reading this from a book published in 1983.

644
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,580
Unfortunately, it's predicting Trump for 1984.

645
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,860
Prez clone goes berserk.

646
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,740
Rapes several newscasters.

647
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,100
Explained away as clone.

648
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,300
Colon cancer surgery in conspiracy press.

649
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,760
It's enough to make you weep like a baby.

650
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,560
Yes.

651
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:55,220
Subgenius computer whiz programs Prez clone by remote control to go on radio and say he is about to bomb Russia.

652
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,220
Oh, wow.

653
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,980
Is that really true?

654
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,980
I mean, did you really, did Bob really predict these things so accurately and yet so twistedly?

655
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,380
Yes, maybe.

656
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:06,660
You're right.

657
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:12,680
Yeah, they really, they, well, it's true that Book of the Subgenius was republished in 1986.

658
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:22,020
And Dateline for Dominance did look a little different the second time around, especially regarding 1984 and 1985.

659
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,760
But he is reading this directly from the book.

660
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,320
Yeah, I am.

661
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,100
Here's from 1986.

662
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:34,520
Prez clone conditions public with all American He-Man characters in media.

663
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:41,200
Then bombs Mid-East City and squelches terrifying reports on acid rain.

664
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,580
Now that sounds like just this week's news.

665
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,240
I know.

666
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,920
And that's from 1983 book predicting 1986.

667
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,740
Hmm.

668
00:34:52,520 --> 00:35:00,720
Popular anti-family movement disguised as pro-family movement attracts extremists from all sides.

669
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,740
Starts anti-subgenius witch hunt.

670
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,280
Which spurs Book of the Subgenius reprint site.

671
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,300
That may have been wishful thinking.

672
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,220
I don't know.

673
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,080
Let's hope not.

674
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,640
And here, the most popular prophecy, a lot of people quote this one.

675
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,020
A man with large breasts on his back becomes a major TV star.

676
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,540
My problem is I marked up this cherry copy of Book of the Subgenius.

677
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:33,720
So the next person who buys a book from us gets a book.

678
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,560
And that's not only my signature, but they get these little pencil marks.

679
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,260
Those mysterious pencil highlights by Reverend Stang.

680
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,960
So what have you been doing to look at the bright side, Dave?

681
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,940
Well, I've been thinking of some of the new edicts.

682
00:35:49,060 --> 00:36:00,620
I know that you, Doug, encountered through your Twitter forays into some of the new edicts that Der Fuhrer has kind of allowed into law or expects to see happen.

683
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,440
Well, what we were talking about was...

684
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,060
Okay, first off, I mean, a lot of subgeniuses have been trying to look at the bright side.

685
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,640
I was telling Reverend Pease that we'd keep doing hours of slack even in the concentration camps.

686
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,680
And he said, oh, we're calling those Patriot Resorts.

687
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,920
And they're not so bad.

688
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,660
We'll get snacks.

689
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,380
I'm thinking more likely they'd be called Trump Towers.

690
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,900
Prisons and public housing would both be merged.

691
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,920
And just all called Trump Towers.

692
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:49,040
And people who score low in citizen points by not turning in enough of their fellow citizens for treason or pot smoking will have to pay much higher rent than people with high good American scores.

693
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:55,620
Like the Trump youth that report on college radio stations who break the new patriotism rule.

694
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,840
Yeah, I've heard about that.

695
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,800
If you criticize the government now, that's exactly the same as terrorism.

696
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,140
And it'll have the same penalties as treason.

697
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,800
What year would you say exactly?

698
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,580
I know this is a bit off topic.

699
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:19,640
But what year would you say the median franchise is the year where all anti-government or even corporate, you know, we're not divided up in that way.

700
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,340
We're anti-control, as many of us are anyway.

701
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:28,700
It doesn't matter whether corporate status on the right or government on the left.

702
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,660
It doesn't really matter.

703
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,780
Now I forgot what I was going to say.

704
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,620
They wanted that.

705
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,160
That's exactly what they set you up for.

706
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,960
They did.

707
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,040
They set me up for it.

708
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,000
I saw it coming.

709
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:47,840
They can get into your head and stop you from remembering that one good line you had.

710
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,700
And I'd been working on it for weeks.

711
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:58,400
And all I could see was try and make your statement neutral, party neutral, so that you don't think somebody thinks you're a Marxist alien or something like that.

712
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,980
What if you are a Marxist alien?

713
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,320
And the next thing you know, it's like, pfft.

714
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:01,760
It's a lie.

715
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:01,960
It's gone.

716
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,040
What's wrong with being a Marxist alien?

717
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,640
You say it like that's a bad thing.

718
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:04,940
Yeah.

719
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,580
I don't think it's a bad thing.

720
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:13,580
I just don't want to be able to, I don't want to walk down the street tomorrow and have people come up and start spitting at me and shoot me with water guns and so forth.

721
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,660
Or real ones.

722
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,080
The lizard spit is good for you.

723
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,360
So I've heard, I mean, it can heal eye wounds.

724
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,760
It's good for nostril wounds.

725
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,780
But I think I'm too large.

726
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,820
I'm a thyroid giant from the age five, you know.

727
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,080
And I spend a lot of time in prisons in the South.

728
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,120
So I don't know if that's going to make any difference.

729
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,880
Well, that's a good lesson.

730
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,740
You better be a good American, just like those good Germans we grew up hearing about.

731
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,100
I had to become a Sonderkommando.

732
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,500
Because if I didn't, I was going to fry like a fish.

733
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:53,160
Well, I'm not, I got to admit, Dave, the first couple of days I felt sick and queasy.

734
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,340
Of course, that may have been because of the heavy, heavy drinking I did for the first two days.

735
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:09,360
But, you know, on the other hand, I was reminded when you're a star, you know, a college radio star like me, the media lets you do anything.

736
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,040
You can just walk up to them and grab them by the country.

737
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:21,640
So we've been trying to keep our minds occupied by collecting and learning about microfossils.

738
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,420
Yes.

739
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,060
Out on Stang Ranch.

740
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,760
Do you know what a microfossil is?

741
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,320
It's a very teeny teeny tiny thing.

742
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:34,580
A teeny teeny tiny impression in rock of an animal that lived almost, how many, two billion years ago?

743
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:43,460
Well, the official definition is defined as fossils smaller than the president's hands or voters' brains.

744
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:44,940
Oh, yeah.

745
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,980
So we're talking about one millimeter things.

746
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,800
They're really hard to find, but they're cool looking.

747
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,440
I expected something like that.

748
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,140
I thought the measurement was going to be even less, as a matter of fact.

749
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,480
But yes, I know exactly what you're talking about.

750
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:05,660
It's too bad they can't just all be, you know, covered in a thin, thin chocolate candy shell.

751
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,700
And we could just eat them like wafers, just so airy and light.

752
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,080
Get it?

753
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,280
Airy and light.

754
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,140
Oh, yeah, yeah.

755
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,620
Airy and light rather than regular.

756
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,440
Airy and light.

757
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,800
Would you hand me that top CD there, Princess Wee?

758
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,200
So I can see what our background music is.

759
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,680
At the beginning, the background music was Lonesome Cowboy Day.

760
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,100
Oh, I thought you were taking a shake.

761
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,860
Then something by Hip Sadic called Where's Bob?

762
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,700
Then Ed Fred's Ghetto Bob.

763
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,180
Moog Cookbook smells like teen spirit.

764
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,760
And this may be something called Lambada.

765
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,060
But we have Xavier Cougat coming up.

766
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,840
Oh, man, that would be great.

767
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,240
And James Bond's music.

768
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,440
And the swinging love horses.

769
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,580
That would be great.

770
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,860
Because I've been thinking about Xavier Cougat lately, and I don't even know why.

771
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,160
Well, we're not going to let him get us down.

772
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:05,760
And we can always hold out hope that Trump has been secretly just like a surrealist all along.

773
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,580
Like that conceptual comedian Andy Kaufman.

774
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:20,960
Trump said years ago that if he was going to run for president, he'd do it as a Republican because, quote, they're so easy to fool.

775
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,540
You wouldn't believe it.

776
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,800
And so maybe his whole plan was just to convince him.

777
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,920
We were talking about this earlier.

778
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,180
That his real plan was to convince the deplorables that he was really one of them.

779
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,820
But then once he got in, to totally blow their minds.

780
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:45,440
That would be great if he started making surrealist laws and proclamations.

781
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,060
Yes.

782
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:51,140
Which his tweets and twits almost equal to.

783
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,580
I would say he's beyond being a surrealist.

784
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,780
Now he's reached a level of...

785
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,620
Well, I'm just, I'm thinking, hopefully, you know, like Francis.

786
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:09,260
What if he decided one day, all dogs must wear top hats and little bow ties.

787
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:17,800
And car tires shall henceforth be made of titanium steel, but all the rest of the cars shall be made of rubber.

788
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,440
So speaketh God, Emperor Trump.

789
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,460
Things like that.

790
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,120
And when did you say this edict was coming into passage?

791
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:33,940
Well, no, I'm just hoping that this is the kind of thing that he's got in mind, you know, just to see what happens.

792
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:42,100
Like, if he wanted to, he could decide that daylight savings time would be held on alternating days.

793
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:50,620
Oh, yeah, like, or duck mopery and other influence situations shall be enforced on Tuesdays henceforth, hamburger days.

794
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,880
Right, Christmas every month.

795
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,260
Right.

796
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,880
That's the one that I was hoping for.

797
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,520
At least.

798
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,180
At least, as I sat in the backseat.

799
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,160
I had a huge catalog of them.

800
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,920
Free Adderall for redheads.

801
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,140
Oh, damn!

802
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,280
Free Atavism for other personalities and those with snotty nostrils.

803
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,120
The only cigarettes allowed shall be Chesterfields.

804
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,680
For biblical reasons.

805
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,240
I read the Bible. It's a good book. It's great.

806
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,700
It's almost as good as my book.

807
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,180
Only...

808
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,660
Oh, I like this one.

809
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,500
Only Christians will have access to the Bible.

810
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,660
Only Christians will have access to pornography or death metal.

811
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,460
That sanctifies the truth, brother. Amen to the amen.

812
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,980
And it also signifies, too, because if you ever think of, like, a yellow-pated signifying monkey,

813
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,880
the first thing you think of is Donald Trump.

814
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:52,200
And once that fades from your memory, you see him as a great hero type, you know, like a warlord type leader.

815
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,340
I could see him like as well as a Manchurian hat and maybe a real svelte belly.

816
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,360
You know, like a belly button doing belly dance and stuff like that.

817
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,740
But I can't see that happen tomorrow.

818
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,460
So, you know, I'm just... I'm still waiting.

819
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,980
Well, one of my friends...

820
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:10,920
Dr. Drummond said a vote for Trump is a vote against boredom.

821
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,860
I was saying, well, I like boredom.

822
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,480
But on the other hand, what if Trump decided that henceforth every jack in the box...

823
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,360
Every tenth jack in the box will be armed with explosives?

824
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,020
Just a little surprise every day, you know?

825
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:32,120
And only allow people who don't want things to be the ones who can have them.

826
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:42,620
Vaccinations could be available only by lottery, but for those who were chosen randomly, you'd have to take the vaccination.

827
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,060
Yeah.

828
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,400
Like, important...

829
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,500
Polders was maybe from 13 leavening agents and among them the most furious and furious.

830
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,140
Yeah.

831
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,660
And so lead the nation, you know?

832
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,320
It's the same kind of acrimony I've seen my entire life.

833
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,040
And now it comes...

834
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:02,380
It's spat out like a doody doody replicant mask.

835
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:09,600
Like somebody's like trying to, you know, bark everybody up in the interior and get us all to kill each other and stuff.

836
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:16,020
If global warming continues, we will build a wall around the Earth and make God pay for it.

837
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,440
You know, I wanted to say these like...

838
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,100
I'd love to contribute.

839
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:21,900
...Zach Branigan.

840
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,280
These are well-shared, my amigo.

841
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:29,700
All set of geniuses must wear collars with bells on them.

842
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,300
No farting, except by heads of state.

843
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:44,860
All diapers shall be small Confederate battle flags, but with Pokemon characters added.

844
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,340
North and South Korea will be deported to opposite sides of the world.

845
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,520
And then the two sides of the moon, with the North Koreans facing away.

846
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,040
Believe me, believe me.

847
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:09,500
That's what you have to preface and include the diatribe, each diatribe at the very end with, believe me, believe me, believe me, believe me.

848
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,640
You can try that sometimes.

849
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,000
He wants you to believe it.

850
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,880
These things are believable and, you know, when you think about the history of the world for the last 100 years,

851
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,760
some pretty unbelievably strange things have happened.

852
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:30,240
Well, yeah, that's why I was saying I'm not actually that surprised and that's why I was that scared.

853
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,500
And then I was that upset.

854
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:33,960
But...

855
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,540
Yes.

856
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,020
I've got a short little...

857
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:43,880
Some subgeniuses really just curled up in a ball of horror.

858
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:49,560
And other ones really started screaming and yelling and running out into the streets.

859
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:49,960
And...

860
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,940
Protesting democracy, as it were.

861
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:58,280
I have several friends that went into the fetal mode, yes.

862
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,060
But we have to fight back.

863
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,920
Yes, curling up into a ball, yes.

864
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:03,420
Fetal.

865
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:03,900
Yes.

866
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:11,980
And as long as there's a bowling alley or some sort of, you know, snarfly neighborhood where there's ice rinks and so forth,

867
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,860
you can always roll up one of those human beings into a small ball and go bowling with it.

868
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,900
You know, I don't think we have a bowling alley in this town.

869
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,840
I'll tell you, it is...

870
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,340
By Jack Straw and cockamamie, it's time that you did.

871
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,460
And let's think of the leader that way.

872
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:33,520
As we think of him as a rolled up bowling ball with a blonde wig, of course.

873
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:41,880
Well, you know, to hate a dumb brute that's doing things just by instinct is almost blasphemy,

874
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,260
as Starbucks said in Moby Dick at Starbucks.

875
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,100
But we had...

876
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,740
On the other hand, well, here's a good rant.

877
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,240
This is Dr. Shoggoth, one of the new guys.

878
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,580
Oh, yeah, praise Shoggoth.

879
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:03,100
He posted a little rant called Against Panic.

880
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,680
And he said, this is pretty short.

881
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:08,540
Well, stay on, brother.

882
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:11,320
This sounds like something the Joker would say in Batman.

883
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,200
Friends, loved ones, and country folks, you can't hashtag your way out of this.

884
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:16,240
Yes.

885
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,380
Donald Trump is your president.

886
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,260
That's democracy.

887
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,760
You can't protest an election away.

888
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,200
So put down your hashtags.

889
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,320
Stuff is going to get weird.

890
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,920
We've been through weird.

891
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:32,260
We've been training all our lives, dear mutants, to resist and uphold our integrity against a society

892
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,660
that increasingly insists on conformity.

893
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,360
We are the faithful who have trained for this exact moment.

894
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,640
This is not the time to panic and give in to despair.

895
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,100
This is what all our conversations led like a spring.

896
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,320
Love and hate and weirdness and wits were made for.

897
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,320
We can come out of this stuff better than we went into it.

898
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,680
This situation was made by chaos, and we know chaos.

899
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,080
This is a medium we can work in.

900
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,980
And our enemies were fools for handing this to us.

901
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,080
So stay strong, chippies.

902
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,340
When the going gets weird, the weird turns pro.

903
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,840
Or kill me.

904
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:12,660
Huh.

905
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,780
That was pretty good.

906
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,600
Well, that is inspirational.

907
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,880
Praise Reverend Chagas.

908
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,300
That is inspirational.

909
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,020
It cheered me up a little bit.

910
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,100
And we have to be inspirational, Dave.

911
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:21,920
That's our job.

912
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,300
Yep.

913
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,040
G. Gordon Gordon responded.

914
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,860
The great G. Gordon Gordon.

915
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,560
From Portugal, I suppose.

916
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,260
Somewhere where there's an expectation.

917
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,820
He moved to Portugal two months ago.

918
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:35,380
He was smart.

919
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:39,480
My opinion of the American body politic is rather obscure.

920
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,720
I'm not quite in the mood.

921
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,600
I need another share.

922
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:48,190
No, another porto.

923
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:49,230
A porto, yeah.

924
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:52,150
He said, I know a lot of my Yeti kin are totally bummed.

925
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,170
But look at it this way.

926
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:57,970
The ones who have the most invested in the system and who will suffer the most when shite

927
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:59,810
heel wrecks it will be the pinks.

928
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:02,450
So lean back, light up, and enjoy the circus.

929
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,750
After all, we still have slack.

930
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:06,850
We and we alone will prevail.

931
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:10,450
And we have never believed in all that government bull shite anyway.

932
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:13,610
And there are more places for you to buy frop or grow it.

933
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:13,610


934
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:13,610


935
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:13,610


936
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:13,610


937
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:13,610


938
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:13,610


939
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:13,610


940
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:13,610


941
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:13,610


942
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:18,650
And when the Trumpkins find out they've been conned because shite heel can't possibly give

943
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,630
them all the things they want, the fun will be even bigger.

944
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:25,370
Well, that's fine and good and great.

945
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:27,270
Yeah, it's easy for him to say from Portugal.

946
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:32,790
And then the next thing you know, I didn't know what the hell I was talking about.

947
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,030
That's again, that's what they want.

948
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,270
You were set up, Dave.

949
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:39,250
It's rigged.

950
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:40,250
It's rigged.

951
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,090
Your mind is rigged.

952
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:42,910
None of this really happened.

953
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:43,890
They rigged your mind.

954
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,530
There wasn't an Obama either.

955
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,730
That was all part of the dream.

956
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:51,110
They programmed all of this stuff in.

957
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:56,330
You're really lying in a tube somewhere, copper top.

958
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,370
Yep.

959
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:00,730
It's like the tunnel under the earth.

960
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:04,550
Our brains have all been evacuated and our memories are in plan with, you know, it's

961
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:07,050
like Strange City or whatever that one movie was.

962
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,790
We finally figured it out.

963
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:10,210
We figured it out.

964
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:10,750
It was all...

965
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:11,390
No, it wasn't.

966
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,030
It wasn't a dream.

967
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:13,970
It was real.

968
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:13,970


969
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:13,970


970
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:13,970


971
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:20,070
Here's one last comment here that was made on the Scrub Genius Forum by fellow citizen

972
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:23,550
Bork, who is in Scandinavia.

973
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:33,010
He's not even a Merkin, although he liked, he thought that G. Gordon Gordon was getting

974
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:39,630
a good European attitude towards American politics, he said, except this time a shred

975
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:42,590
of doubt has been shed on the US's commitment to NATO.

976
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:48,870
more precisely, the Trump seems to think it should be operated as an international protection money

977
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:55,690
racket. Our bettors up at the castle, who have spent the past 60 years wishing they could order

978
00:51:55,690 --> 00:52:01,630
summary execution of anyone who even looks funny at the unholy first-use nuclear alliance,

979
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:09,150
are severely embarrassed and freaking the hell out. I do not like the phrases freaking the hell

980
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:16,430
out and quote first-use nuclear alliance to apply to anywhere on the same planet as me.

981
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:24,450
Thank you very much. The only thing is he didn't really say freaking the hell out. He used another

982
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:30,250
word. He said freak. Well, it's that bad word we mentioned at the beginning of the show. Trump.

983
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:38,950
Freaked the freaking Trump out of me, man. I'm trumped up, dude. I can't handle this.

984
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:42,530
I gotta come. Do you got anything that'll make me come down, man?

985
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:43,390
A mandamin from the X-Thor.

986
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:48,950
You have any thorsian or like valium or liberal or any of that stuff?

987
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:50,970
I don't know, man. Just trump it.

988
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,990
I told you I had a private mandamin from the X-Thor.

989
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:54,430
I need some damn it all.

990
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,130
At least it was the wizard. The wizard.

991
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:56,530
Wizard.

992
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:00,590
But those guys are really sharp and medium.

993
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:03,450
I mean, they're very, very cruel.

994
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,430
They catch one false breath.

995
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:08,230
If one inarticulate.

996
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:15,610
The next thing you know, you're doing time in Tuba, Tuba, French, Sardinia or Siberia or someplace.

997
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:18,590
Waving your arms at people that don't exist no more.

998
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:21,630
We call those patriot resorts. I told you.

999
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:22,270
Yeah.

1000
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:23,470
Yeah, and you get treats.

1001
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:24,970
Trump Towers.

1002
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:26,990
Well, we have to go now.

1003
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:31,850
Well, may you not go straddling quietly into that good night.

1004
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:36,210
Because it's, well, just because. That's why.

1005
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:38,630
We shall overcome.

1006
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:50,370
We shall get our air force flown by beautiful subgeniuses and invade Fort Knox in Kentucky.

1007
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:54,430
Steal all the gold and buy Trump from himself.

1008
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:58,770
With the help of James Bond and ZZ Top.

1009
00:53:59,050 --> 00:53:59,790
Yeah.

1010
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:00,590
Yeah.

1011
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:04,370
Yeah, you just have to imagine the fabulous background music, Dave.

1012
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,530
It's not silently.

1013
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:06,570
Not silently.

1014
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:09,030
Well, actually, it's right on Fort.

1015
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:11,110
Knox from the movie Goldfinger.

1016
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:13,390
I believe by John Barry.

1017
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:22,190
Anyway, friends, there is hope and we are going to save the universe.

1018
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:22,610
Yes.

1019
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:31,290
As the swinging love corpses are going to explain to us as soon as we get our harpoons sharpened.

1020
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:32,250
Praise Bob.

1021
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,430
Praise Bob.

1022
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:34,630
Hail Connie.

1023
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,690
Take these harpoons and lances.

1024
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,210
Melt them down.

1025
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:45,410
Forge me new weapons that will strike deep and hold fast.

1026
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:47,950
But do not douse them in water.

1027
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:50,990
They must have a proper baptism.

1028
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:54,050
What say ye, all ye men?

1029
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:58,870
Will you give as much blood as shall be needed to temper the steel?

1030
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:03,190
To my anger now add your own.

1031
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:07,410
You be the cogs that fit my wheel.

1032
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,430
The gunpowder that takes my torch.

1033
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:23,770
A gunpowder that takes my torch.

1034
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:26,770
Yes.

1035
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:27,150
When we were born.

1036
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:34,990
When we were born.

1037
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:38,150
When we were born.

1038
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:41,050
Born into this life

1039
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:46,530
We were destined to make it right

1040
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,510
And it's predetermined

1041
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:52,090
And this is our fate

1042
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:54,890
We're singing this song

1043
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:57,370
So you can relate

1044
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:02,130
We are going to save the universe

1045
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:04,930
We are going to save the universe

1046
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:07,630
We are going to save the universe

1047
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:11,130
This time

1048
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,450
We are full grown

1049
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:31,110
We are grown up men

1050
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:34,330
We are all bastards

1051
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:37,310
We hate to reason it

1052
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:37,610
We are all bastards

1053
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,070
We are all bastards

1054
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:39,750
It is our mission

1055
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:42,570
It is our task

1056
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:44,790
It's obvious

1057
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:47,530
Yet useless

1058
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:52,430
We are going to save the universe

1059
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:55,250
We are going to save the universe

1060
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:58,290
We are going to save the universe

1061
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:01,670
This time

1062
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:37,230
We are going to save the universe

1063
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:53,450
We are going to save the universe

1064
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:53,470
Don't you worry

1065
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,590
Don't you worry

1066
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:57,590
Don't you worry

1067
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:01,650
Don't you worry

1068
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:05,930
Don't you worry

1069
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:25,650
We are rich, don't have no fears, don't get out of sight, because we are this year. We can't wait, so we understand, we're in control, and we are more than a fan.

1070
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:30,090
We are gone, to save the universe.

1071
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:31,290
We are gone!

1072
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:33,810
We are gone!

1073
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:42,070
Well, men and gentlemen,

1074
00:58:55,790 --> 00:59:01,650
I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.

1077
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:30,930
Praise Bob!

1078
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:56,930
Become a minister.

1079
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:05,410
You'll see photos and a list of all the stuff you get, and you really do get to go to the Scrub Genius Forum,

1080
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:10,370
which is members only, where we talk in ways that people don't talk on Facebook.

1081
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:14,270
Much, much smarter ways, ironically enough.

1082
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:15,070
Isn't that funny?

1083
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:20,730
We also have things like T-shirts and damn near everything you can think of with Bob's face on it.

1084
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:23,890
That and a huge selection of other subgenius graphics.

1085
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:25,630
And we sell several.

1086
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:26,510
Very weird.

1087
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:32,830
DVDs and CDs of the Bob songs and old MP3 stashes of this show.

1088
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:41,250
And best of all, from our main online store, you can buy the book of the subgenius, which is by far the greatest thing we've ever done.

1089
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:50,910
It's an actual Simon & Schuster book, 22 bucks, in print for over 30 years, and every copy that we send out is signed by yours truly.

1090
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:55,630
For that matter, your address on the puffy envelope is handwritten by me also.

1091
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:57,170
Keep my fingers nimble.

1092
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:01,290
That's subgenius.com, and remember, it's only money.
