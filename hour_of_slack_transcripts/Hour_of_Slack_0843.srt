1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Light your prop eyes up and test your tech

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,240
Well, welcome to the hour of slack

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,300
Praise Bob, Joel, and Connie's track

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,140
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,120
La la la la la la la

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,920
La la la hour of slack

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,480
Slack

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,980
That's great, faster than any other leading cleanser

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,340
Leading cleanser

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,200
Bob

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,580
But let's leave things of this world behind

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,200
And walk now down the path of Bob

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,120
For this brief minute of slack

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,740
From the church of the subgenius

15
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,960
And so once again we find this deep-rooted contradiction

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,460
Within the word of God

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,340
Who he himself has said

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,860
I am everything but yet everything is me

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,460
And by this very self-same contradiction

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,560
We know that we do have some measure of free will

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,340
Yes, free choice

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,200
And it's up to us to decide

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,620
Whether we're going to sin in the ways that God wants us to

24
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,040
Or if we're going to sin against God

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,160
But yet since he is everything and everything is him

26
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,580
Or her or it or everything

27
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,540
One could say well everything is everything

28
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,300
So a sin might as well be a good deed

29
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,460
Helping a little old lady across the street

30
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,120
Might be a sin if everything is everything

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,380
Now this is an acid-head sort of mode of thinking

32
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,440
And I don't think anybody wants to go along

33
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,300
With such a vague and to say the least fluid philosophy

34
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,920
Because we have to have some sort of standard reference

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,700
For goodness or evilness

36
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,500
We got a zero or meter on something

37
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,640
So why not let that something be Bob, friend?

38
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,680
Let there be slack

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:52,960
Slack

40
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,460
Oh that's crazy

41
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,140
Crazy talk

42
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,580
I think Bob is just a guy with a pipe

43
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,920
Friendship

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,760
Are we controlled by secret forces?

45
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,360
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

46
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,960
Do people think you're strange?

47
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,200
Do you?

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,420
Then you may be on the right track

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,680
Give me slack or give me food or kill me

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,720
Give me slack or give me food or kill me

51
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,460
Kill me

52
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:27,460


53
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,060
Kill me

54
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,580
Kill me

55
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:31,940
Kill me

56
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,660
Kill me

57
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,560
Kill me

58
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:33,680
Kill me

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:33,880
Kill me

60
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,060
Kill me

61
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,520
Kill me

62
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:34,860
Kill me

63
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:34,900
Kill me

64
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,700
Kill me

65
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,260
It's time to be manipulated

66
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,560
Brother I want to tell you something

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,060
The world is tired of dead preachin' preachers

68
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,640
Dead preachers preachin' dead sermons to dead congregations

69
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,440
They're tired of cold services and cold churches

70
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,860
This world is hungry for reality

71
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,680
They've had enough of Hollywood

72
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,640
They've had enough of Nashville

73
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,440
They've had enough of Nashville

74
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,800
They've had enough of show business

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,240
They're hungry for the mighty power of the man that walked the shores of Galilee two thousand years ago

76
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,120
And raised the dead and cast out devils

77
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,460
And healed the sick

78
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,480
And I'm here to tell you tonight that Jesus Christ is still raising the dead

79
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,160
Oh he's back from the dead

80
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,240
That's right

81
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,100
His grinning skull floats ever in front of your eyes

82
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,620
Because Jesus brought him back

83
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,480
And he's lusting for the flesh of the living

84
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,180
And these things are coming and coming speedily

85
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,240
We are near the very very end of the church age

86
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,020
And of course the Gentile time has already come to a close

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,540
For the archaeologists

88
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,620
Every day is a hair day

89
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,820
Slacks are always Jesus Christ's name

90
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,940
I got just what I wanted from everybody here today

91
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,500
And everybody said, name it

92
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,820
Name me an I reason because here is inflicted unbelief

93
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,700
Name me an unbelief is the lifeless body of his sister

94
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,520
Right now, man

95
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,140
Sarcastic

96
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,720
Satisfaction

97
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,860
Secure my weapon, Corvo

98
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,540
Again?

99
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,400
Again

100
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,680
Big day

101
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,720
Hey, did you get my present?

102
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,620
I punched a hole in Harvey Goldman's trailer

103
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:28,980
Hm

104
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,620
The world owes me a living

105
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,440
And I want my money back in one lump sum right now

106
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,660
That's the way you ought to wake up

107
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,940
Friends, it wasn't your parents' fault

108
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,620
They were just as screwy as you

109
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,560
It was the conspiracy's fault

110
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,540
It really was

111
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,480
I'm not a fool, I'm a fool

112
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:10,120
Friends, the conspiracy has hogged fascism long enough

113
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,380
We're taking fascism back

114
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,100
For the people, man

115
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,020
Fascism for the people

116
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,240
Fascism for the individual

117
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,360
It's what we call

118
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,160
Patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism

119
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:47,200
Say, must we work out?

120
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,220
How many 기다� groves left to call curfews?

121
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,660
Murphy can convict me

122
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:52,920
I cannot work out

123
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:52,920


124
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:52,920


125
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:52,920


126
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,320
I just am

127
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,360
Workout, man

128
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,180
I want you to hang on one minute please, I want you to hear something, and I want you

129
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,060
to hear it good.

130
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,220
I just want to tell you people something, there's some good people out here, and you

131
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,820
are insulting their intelligence.

132
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:23,320
And if you come to this country at our invitation, and we have to charge you through no choice

133
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,980
of our own, right?

134
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,440
If you don't want to pay it, don't follow me, I've come!

135
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,100
I want it to be firmly established that any person that feels that strongly has the right

136
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,520
to come to this microphone and speak.

137
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,200
I cannot help the system that is here.

138
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,580
It is my job to entertain you.

139
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,040
The fact that there is an exchange, that from this stage, whatever it costs, has to go out

140
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,300
there in the form of music, is the way that the world is made up.

141
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,520
I cannot help it.

142
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,340
I have no control over that.

143
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:47,800
I want to do it with something that nobody can steal from you.

144
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,300
Something that nobody can stop selling to you, or put you in jail so you can't maintain

145
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:52,580
it.

146
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,000
You're going to have to become self-realized to the peace within yourself on your own.

147
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,580
And beyond that, once you become self-realized, to learn how to express it, how to experience it constantly,

148
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,000
how to use the vehicles that you've got, whether it's your emotions, your mind, or your body,

149
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,640
to express the divine thing that you discover yourself to be.

150
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,120
And you can only discover that yourself.

151
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,760
We'll sell the precious body for a small piece of paper and carry it out of weight.

152
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,160
But be free.

153
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,820
You'll forget about them and you'll marry some blonde, dull, non-entity

154
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:45,140
and bear a brood of snot-faced, drug-snorting brats who can't believe what a doddering dullard you are

155
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,720
and can't wait for you to die or leave so they can kill you or something

156
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,480
while you sit there exhausted, sweating.

157
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,760
Sweating blood, staring at the TV, pondering your incredible degree of debt,

158
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,280
drinking yourself into a stupor and going,

159
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,620
What the hell happened?

160
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,560
Can't you swear?

161
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,440
Money can't cost me more.

162
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,980
I really love you.

163
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,020
I think that we're all just going to have to, like, the police force,

164
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,660
the lawyers, all the people that are running the whole thing,

165
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:42,100
these hippies with long hair are just going to have to braid their hair up,

166
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,320
put on a hat, man, and become policemen, you know, become lawyers, become doctors.

167
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,200
You know, but then we're the same as everybody else.

168
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,780
No, I mean, but with the idea.

169
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,340
I mean, with the idea that you want to change the system.

170
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,060
You can't defeat the system from within the system because then you're just part of it.

171
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,340
My dear, could you imagine?

172
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,740
I mean, Walt Disney is the...

173
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,240
Living in the ghetto, you know, a kid three years old using Mighty Mouse or Mickey Mouse,

174
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,220
whoever it was, for an article.

175
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,080
Right, you just look cute.

176
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,860
Running across the room for a gray rat thinking it was Mighty Mouse.

177
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,380
Are you ready?

178
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,080
We can't believe all of Walt Disney.

179
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,420
Well, I can blame almost all of it, or half of it.

180
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:17,860
Half of it.

181
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,360
I can't believe it.

182
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:37,520
I can't believe it.

183
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,320
Don't let, don't let, don't let.

184
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Hey, wise.

185
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,320
Joan, you're next.

186
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,280
This is Sue.

187
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,140
Hi, Sue.

188
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,760
How can I help?

189
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,420
Jim, I really have a problem with impulse buying.

190
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,360
I never have money left for anything.

191
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,040
Whoa.

192
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,700
Why?

193
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,540
Jim, I really have a buying impulse problem.

194
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:07,840
Well.

195
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,540
Buying.

196
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,340
Buying.

197
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,780
Anything.

198
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,440
Anything.

199
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,060
Anything.

200
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:11,920
Wait a minute.

201
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,640
Go ahead and use some of that money to bring some happiness.

202
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,080
Jim, I really have a problem.

203
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,720
Jim, I never have money left for impulse buying.

204
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,240
A lot of people have that problem.

205
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,320
Take cash.

206
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,380
Good idea.

207
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,800
I feel we really need to buy right away.

208
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,760
After all, money is only paper and metal until you put it to use.

209
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,060
I never have money left.

210
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,660
But we've already decided to buy.

211
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,420
Impulse.

212
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:32,980
Impulse.

213
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,440
I really think it'll help.

214
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,300
Good idea.

215
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,040
Oh, thanks.

216
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,840
Okay, let's go to line four.

217
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,760
This is Pennywise.

218
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,520
I'm Jim Phillips, and your name is?

219
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,000
Bob.

220
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,520
Hi, Bob.

221
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,460
What can I do for you?

222
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,020
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

223
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:45,460
Oh.

224
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,620
This is Pennywise.

225
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,800
Line six.

226
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,280
You're on.

227
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,220
And your name is?

228
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:49,700
Bob.

229
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,280
Caller number five.

230
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,580
You're on the air with Pennywise.

231
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,420
I'm Jim Phillips.

232
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,000
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

233
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,480
Yeah.

234
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,580
Let's go to line seven on Pennywise.

235
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,860
Hi, I'm Jim Phillips.

236
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,280
Bob.

237
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,160
Commercials.

238
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,660
Yeah, yeah.

239
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,220
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

240
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,640
Oh, well, listen.

241
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,200
I think your first responsibility is to yourself and your family.

242
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:09,780
The what?

243
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,680
Thanks for the call.

244
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,420
Hello.

245
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,980
You're on Pennywise with Jim Phillips, and you are?

246
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:14,420
Bob.

247
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,860
Okay, let's go to line four.

248
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,860
This is Pennywise.

249
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,520
I'm Jim Phillips, and your name is?

250
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,100
Bob.

251
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,340
Yeah.

252
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,420
Commercials.

253
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:20,940
Hello, caller.

254
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,440
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

255
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:23,920
Yeah.

256
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,780
And your name is?

257
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,320
Bob.

258
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:25,680
Bob.

259
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,340
Bob.

260
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:26,840
Hi, Bob.

261
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,860
What can I do for you?

262
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:28,560
The what?

263
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,000
Go ahead.

264
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,500
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

265
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,860
Oh, you sound frustrated.

266
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,520
It's because I am.

267
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,160
Well, my kids and I, for example, love to build things with scrap lumber.

268
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,880
The what?

269
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,360
All right.

270
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,380
Thanks for the call, Carl.

271
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:40,800
Bob.

272
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,040
Yeah.

273
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,140
This is Pennywise.

274
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,320
Line six.

275
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:43,780
You're on.

276
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,260
Bob.

277
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:44,740
Yeah, Barb.

278
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,100
Bob.

279
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,640
Go ahead.

280
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,900
Claims made in commercials.

281
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,360
Yeah.

282
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,460
I get confused.

283
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:48,680
Why?

284
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,060
I get commercials confused.

285
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,100
Like magic.

286
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,840
The what?

287
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,580
Well, many religious people follow the biblical plan of tithing.

288
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,000
You may want to visit with your clergy about it, but of course.

289
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,360
The what?

290
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:58,800
The what?

291
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,540
Commercials.

292
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,080
Commercials.

293
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,760
I get confused by all the claims.

294
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,620
And your name is?

295
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,040
Bob.

296
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,280
Yeah, that's a tough one.

297
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,060
A lot of people have that problem.

298
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:06,800
The what?

299
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,540
Truth in advertising.

300
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,920
I get confused.

301
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,180
Advertising, though, can be a really good source of information because of the truth in advertising

302
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,680
policy.

303
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,400
The what?

304
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,260
Because of the truth in advertising policy.

305
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:16,980
The what?

306
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,800
Truth in advertising.

307
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:18,700
The what?

308
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,500
Truth in advertising.

309
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,300
Truth in advertising.

310
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,200
You see, the law.

311
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,860
The law requires advertisers to tell the truth.

312
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,480
The what?

313
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,060
The truth.

314
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,540
The truth.

315
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,440
To tell the truth.

316
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,480
Truth in advertising.

317
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,640
Good point.

318
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:27,860
Yeah.

319
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So listen carefully to the wording of an ad.

320
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,700
The what?

321
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,720
The truth in advertising.

322
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,460
The what?

323
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,720
Well, then you have to decide if honesty goes both ways, right?

324
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,720
After all.

325
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,720
So, this is Pennywise.

326
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,700
You're on the air.

327
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,140
Hi, Bob.

328
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,160
What can I do for you?

329
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,060
Yeah, Jim.

330
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,760
This is Charlie.

331
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,280
Okay.

332
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,080
I've got a moral question for you.

333
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,460
The what?

334
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,120
Wait a minute.

335
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,040
Thanks for the call, Bob.

336
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,220
This is Charlie.

337
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,900
I've got a moral question for you.

338
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,200
Well, that's a matter.

339
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,440
For your own conscience, Charlie.

340
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,260
I figured you'd say something like that.

341
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:54,960
All right.

342
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,400
Why don't you give it a try this year?

343
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:56,680
Okay.

344
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,960
But don't ever catch it.

345
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,200
Well, thanks for calling, Charlie.

346
00:13:59,380 --> 00:13:59,580
Thanks.

347
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,580
This is Pennywise.

348
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Line six.

349
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,260
You're on.

350
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,060
Yeah, Jim.

351
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,740
This is Charlie.

352
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,600
Negative land.

353
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,420
The negative land, friends.

354
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,120
Before that rainbow bridge.

355
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,080
Some utopia and breaching from Austin, 1998.

356
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,060
All cut together by pot-haired nostril.

357
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,080
Before that.

358
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,440
New cut-ups by Artemia Salina.

359
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,160
Fernanda Nandi-Leemur.

360
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,020
And old cut-ups from the subgenius media barrage number five.

361
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,800
Plus music from Saint N.

362
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,720
More of the same coming.

363
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,220
But what do you want?

364
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,460
I want to be a member of your church.

365
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,580
I want to give all I got.

366
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,420
I want to love Bob.

367
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,180
I want to love Bob.

368
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,200
I was in a room.

369
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,540
Just the other day in Dallas.

370
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,600
Well, I did benefit from it.

371
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:56,860
Of course.

372
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,000
But so did a whole bunch of old Dallas boys.

373
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,120
Remember this.

374
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,040
I've been five years in the Naval Intelligence Division.

375
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,040
So that I do know a good, and it was in wartime.

376
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,260
So I know a good deal of what goes on.

377
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,740
I mean, I had connections with CID and the lot.

378
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,040
And there is no doubt in my mind.

379
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,740
I'm a good guy.

380
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:20,800


381
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:20,800


382
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:20,800


383
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:20,800


384
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,220
I know a lot of people.

385
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:23,340


386
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:23,340


387
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,060
I know a lot of responsible people.

388
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,780
But this isn't only just hippie fun.

389
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,320
Behind it is black power.

390
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,060
And behind that is communism.

391
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,180
My invisible monster is bigger than your invisible monster.

392
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

393
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,020
And friends, that's what most religions are all about.

394
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,020
Yeah.

395
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,860
And you may laugh at that.

396
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,900
But I'm afraid to tell you that according to the latest study I saw,

397
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,080
over 87% of Americans,

398
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,200
believe that there is an invisible monster

399
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,320
that will take care of them if they kiss its ass.

400
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,300
And friends, because of those idiots believing in that monster,

401
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,300
there is one.

402
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,500
He certainly made a lot of laws that we've ended up having to live by.

403
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,160
But friends, you can fight back.

404
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:17,520
Yes, we can turn the tables and declare war on God.

405
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,700
Now, frankly, some people might say,

406
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,660
that was real disrespectful sounding.

407
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,360
You, I think you, most of you, understand what we mean

408
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,640
when we say we're declaring war on God.

409
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,620
Repent, friends.

410
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,580
Repent through spending.

411
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,580
And you better do it quick.

412
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,560
They come to see the dungeons here.

413
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,780
The tourists flock from far and near.

414
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,340
They do the tower and try.

415
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,080
They do the theater.

416
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,760
The picking pockets cost your life.

417
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,980
And every jury has its price.

418
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,260
They bring the kids and show the wife.

419
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,880
It makes them proud to be around

420
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,020
and take their summer pickies.

421
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,680
To drink at home.

422
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,560
At night, it's all close.

423
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,140
And end up feeling sick.

424
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:30,060
And we're all making money.

425
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,500
Lovely money.

426
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,800
Rubber necks with cash to burn.

427
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,820
Export criminals return.

428
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,300
They keep on coming, never learn.

429
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,480
They fill their diaries page by page.

430
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,800
And make it sound so thrilling.

431
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,640
They're hunting for the real thing.

432
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,300
They're flushed and they are willing.

433
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,020
And we're all making money.

434
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,260
Lovely money.

435
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,720
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.

436
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,680
Want it, want it, want it.

437
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,540
Pay, pay, pay.

438
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,480
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.

439
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:27,740
Give me, give me, give me, give me.

440
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,400
Want it, want it, want it.

441
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,280
Pay, pay, pay.

442
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,800
Give me, give me, give me give my, give me.

443
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,960
Give me one, it, want it, pay and pay, pay.

444
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,520
Pay, pay, pay.

445
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,140
The ware.

446
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,640
만들 an open hand.

447
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,620
We'll be right back.

448
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,640
The question of kids now wanting everything to be free is very hard to handle because it's hard to talk to those kids.

449
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,460
Even you?

450
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,320
What?

451
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,120
Even you.

452
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,740
Even me? Hard to talk to them?

453
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,360
Of course.

454
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,960
Because to them I represent, among other things, somebody who has money.

455
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:44,580
Through this iron treasure's gate, the more popular criminals, those darlings of the crowd, were taken smiling onto the tower.

456
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,600
Rumor has it that the bloodstains of Charles I's decapitation were never actually washed from the stones.

457
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,860
All of me. All of me.

458
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:10,080
Friends, the tribulations, the saucers, the rupture, all of those things that are discussed in Dobbs' prophecy will come true.

459
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:17,380
But prophesying from it all, of wading through the blood of the baptism of the fist face of Bob,

460
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:23,640
burning through the titanium steel fort knocks doors with the power of that mighty pipe.

461
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,220
Friends, it will be Bob.

462
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,640
Bob is coming.

463
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,660
And he will burn away the hate.

464
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,300
He will burn away the radiation.

465
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,600
He will burn away the fire itself.

466
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,240
But you have to keep your hate burning.

467
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,720
Friends, you have to feed that fire.

468
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,740
Repent.

469
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,980
Quit your job.

470
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,000
Slack off.

471
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,140
While you still know how.

472
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,540
Time is running out.

473
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:56,620
The conspiracy at large has, well, between the United States and Russia, probably has 50,000 nuclear weapons.

474
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,920
Maybe 100,000.

475
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,500
And we've only got four.

476
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,120
Five.

477
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,160
We've only got five.

478
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,520
And yet we dare to fight them anyway.

479
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,900
Because it's always been the crazy people.

480
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,280
Friends, the crazy people.

481
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,660
Who are the only ones dumb enough to stand up and fight.

482
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,540
Fight city hall.

483
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,680
Now off you go.

484
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,120
Away you fly.

485
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,000
We've had your money.

486
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,200
Now goodbye.

487
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,220
We've lished you good.

488
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,600
We've bled you dry.

489
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,280
Goodbye.

490
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,300
Goodbye.

491
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,380
Goodbye.

492
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,180
Goodbye.

493
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,080
Goodbye.

494
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,280
Goodbye.

495
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:33,980
Goodbye.

496
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,760
Goodbye.

497
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:02,760
Goodbye.

498
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:05,960
Goodbye.

499
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:07,960
Goodbye.

500
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,280
Goodbye.

501
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,180
Goodbye.

502
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,120
Goodbye.

503
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:14,900
Goodbye.

504
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,300
Goodbye.

505
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,320


506
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:16,360
Goodbye.

507
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:16,380
Goodbye.

508
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:16,420
Goodbye.

509
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:16,460
Goodbye.

510
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:16,500
Goodbye.

511
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:16,540
Goodbye.

512
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:16,580
Goodbye.

513
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:16,620
Goodbye.

514
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:22,520
are worth long-paced labor and were stolen by one Catholic-blood-walled-to-bloody-tower.

515
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,640
What are you doing with that stuff?

516
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,720
I don't know what you're talking about.

517
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,760
I don't think it's on.

518
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,720
Yes, uh, BP does really accept bacon burgers.

519
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:38,100
And here, the original armor worn by Henry has now been coated in Teflon,

520
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,220
so those greasy Argentinians who don't have freckles make us they slide on their faces.

521
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,040
Can't get their hands on it.

522
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,800
How old are the Burrithyre remains?

523
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,160
Well, um, 14 and 15.

524
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,140
They sawed his leg off and counted the rings.

525
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,720
You jerk.

526
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,080
Beware.

527
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,520
Halt!

528
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,680
And circumcision.

529
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,880
Halt!

530
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,260
Majesty.

531
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,520
Halt!

532
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,920
Me.

533
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,220
The first word in this song is to incorporate.

534
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,540
It means to leave your body.

535
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,620
It's full of rain on top with me,

536
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,820
dripping with pain.

537
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:39,820
Cloudless, starless velvet valleys and the South Sea.

538
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,700
Mawa.

539
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,100
Mawa.

540
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,320
Combining your mind.

541
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:53,440
There is no time to make your sense and paste them in.

542
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:59,220
As salt or rain and we will begin.

543
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:01,940
Mawa.

544
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,560
Flower power sucks.

545
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,020
Sucks.

546
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,360
Sucks.

547
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:04,860
Sucks.

548
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,260
Sucks.

549
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:05,700
Sucks.

550
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,300
Sucks.

551
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:06,700
Sucks.

552
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,360


553
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,600
Sucks.

554
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,020
Sucks.

555
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:08,560
Sucks.

556
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,980
ما dive

557
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,580
上

558
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,040
Сат

559
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,600

562
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,540
And a bar and a cocoa

563
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:22,820
Escape from the way of your corporate loco

564
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,360
And by your side

565
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,720
There is no time

566
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,780
To waste

567
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,400
And they said

568
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,920
This will parade

569
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,200
And you'll be here

570
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,280
Bob sold it.

571
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,180
I smoked it.

572
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,740
That settles it.

573
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,900
Freedom, freedom

574
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,260
Kindly loving

575
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,320
You'll be absolutely free

576
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,580
Only if you want to be

577
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,180
Feeling all right

578
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,960
On pistons of velvet and satin

579
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,180
To music by magic

580
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,200
By people that happen

581
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,340
To enter the world

582
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,760
Of a strange circle

583
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,400
Tell all the dreams

584
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,780
As they link them

585
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,600
Are all mellow yellow

586
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,200
And by your side

587
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,520
There is no time

588
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
To waste

589
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,840
And they said

590
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,140
This will parade

591
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,180
And you'll be here

592
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,520
And you'll be here

593
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:22,420
Anyway, since I first saw his face, I know that Bob will triumph with our friends from outer space. And though we suffer needy, I know that it's alright, cause I know Bob and I, but tell me what to think.

594
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:39,780
The church of the subgenius will spread across the land, with pipes in place, we'll both march together hand in hand. The starfish of removal will strike a mighty blow, and we'll be free of the normal and the pig.

595
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:51,640
So give him Bob, Bob, Bob, and you'll see a whole lot better. Bob, Bob, Bob, send a dollar and a letter, he will change all your behavior.

596
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,400
He's your friend.

597
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,200
He's your friend.

598
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,220
And what do we expect? All this perversion and sex.

599
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,440
Are them oily pores in your back open up?

600
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,620
This is just as bad. All we care about is slack.

601
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,280
And letting all the slack get out.

602
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,080
The devil has to be behind that. Think I'd follow that? I don't think so.

603
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:40,180
I was about to grab the nearest object and smash the mirror into bits when I saw one with columns of numbers running across it.

604
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,820
I fancy myself comfortable with numerals, but these were beyond even me.

605
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,340
Fortunately, its words were not.

606
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,400
As cycles came and went in groupings of ten thousand...

607
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:59,980
...years. The sixth ice age receded, leaving behind denuded landscape and four continents.

608
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,840
By the 400th millennium, the genetic separation was irrevocable.

609
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,960
Occasional mutations proved the rule, rather than overturned it.

610
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:22,060
Separated into Eloatus humanus and Morloccus dishumanus, the former Homo sapiens left no genetic trail by AD 492,000...

611
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,400
...year.

612
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,620
965.

613
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,540
Do I surprise you?

614
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,440
Not at all, yes.

615
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,360
Hmm.

616
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,380
We weren't always like this.

617
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,580
After the moon fell from the sky, the earth could no longer sustain the species.

618
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,080
Some managed to stay above.

619
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,240
The rest of us escaped underground.

620
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,220
Then centuries later when we tried to re-emerge into the sun again.

621
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,380
The earth was no longer a place for us to live.

622
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:52,380


623
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:52,380


624
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:52,380


625
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,760
We couldn't.

626
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:59,260
So we bred ourselves into castes.

627
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,800
Some to be our eyes and ears.

628
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,400
Some to be our muscles and sinews.

629
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,340
You mean your hunters?

630
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,200
Yes.

631
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,580
Bred to be predators.

632
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,560
But bred also to be controlled.

633
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,900
You see, my caste.

634
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,320
Concentrated on expanding our cerebral abilities.

635
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:22,600
The earth is.

636
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,920
You control their thoughts.

637
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,400
Noth trust theirs.

638
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,920
To Eloi.

639
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,040
So it's not enough that you hunt them down like animals?

640
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,140
That's their role here.

641
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,380
To be your food?

642
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,340
Yes.

643
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,840
And for those who are suitable to be...

644
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,680
...breeding vessels for our other colonies.

645
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,320
You see, I am just one of many.

646
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,700
Is this the hour of slack?

647
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,540
No.

648
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,200
Yes.

649
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:01,420
Oh.

650
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,940
Ragnar, you're not really Reverend Cardboard Box, are you?

651
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,140
These kids with their names.

652
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,820
Reverend Cardboard Box.

653
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,680
Hey, come on, homie.

654
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,620
It's a gang, okay?

655
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,380
Gang people.

656
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,020
It's funny.

657
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,040
Weird names.

658
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,140
Weird costumes.

659
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,400
Cool tags, you know.

660
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,080
Got their handles done.

661
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,320
Jumbo was here.

662
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,960
Fat Larry fell down.

663
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,200
Oh, boy.

664
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,940
Must shouldn't be in a gang.

665
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:30,440
But a gang can be a bad influence or a good and slackful influence.

666
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,620
For instance, the subgenius gang.

667
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,960
Army is a conspiracy of dunces.

668
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,560
Isn't it?

669
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,220
Conspiracy of dunces?

670
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:46,220
Is it true that most of the people in the Church of the Subgenius are those like idiot savant innates?

671
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,740
Those people who don't really reconnoiter what they're actually establishing with us?

672
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,180
No.

673
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:50,380
No.

674
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,320
Half of them are the...

675
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,460
Dave, you're their patron saint.

676
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:52,740
Yeah.

677
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:58,840
Half of them are your people who are the greatest thing in the world at one thing.

678
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,260
And you're their patron saint, man.

679
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,540
They've been honoring you or listening to you for 20 years now or something like that.

680
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:11,280
Well, I'm about ready to start dealing out some funeral parlor holy cards.

681
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,400
I mean, prayer cards.

682
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,540
I'm going to start flipping from the bottom of the deck if these people don't stop bothering me.

683
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,860
Well, those are the voices in your head, Dave.

684
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,320
Those aren't real people bothering you.

685
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,460
How come they're...

686
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,120
Okay, well then how come they're so clever?

687
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,940
How come they can make things move around?

688
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,680
Because you're clever.

689
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,020
Because you're a saint, man.

690
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,160
That goes with the territory when you're a saint.

691
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,400
So you're saying the mind stuff is what drives the cosmic engine?

692
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:33,980
Yeah, Dave.

693
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,040
The phone calls are coming from inside the house.

694
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,660
Oh, man.

695
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,480
I thought I had this place nailed down tight as a drum.

696
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,780
What, your brain?

697
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,420
No, this house brain.

698
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,660
I mean, the higher...

699
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,560
No, it was a metaphor.

700
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,960
That was a metaphor, Dave.

701
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,740
That was a metaphor.

702
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,480
You did.

703
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,400
The calls were coming from inside your house.

704
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,340
I thought we were going to go into something else.

705
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,760
It's just that one cell.

706
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,020
It's that one beautiful cell.

707
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,040
That one brain cell you have, Dave.

708
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,680
Then why does it have ours if it's just a brain cell?

709
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,680
And if the truth is so horrible it will haunt your dreams for all time?

710
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,740
Well, I think I'm used to that.

711
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,700
No, wait a minute.

712
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,020
No, you wait a minute.

713
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,160
I love that area.

714
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,880
And I...

715
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:21,760
No, no.

716
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,580
That doesn't mean it doesn't.

717
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,380
No, no, no.

718
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,500
I don't know about that.

719
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:38,500


720
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,080
I don't think I'm used to that.

721
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,960
I don't.

722
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,280
I don't know what that is either.

723
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:42,740
This is where I was right?

724
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:42,740


725
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,980
I don't know.

726
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,020
I don't know.

727
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,220
I don't know.

728
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:46,320
I don't know.

729
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:46,460
I don't know.

730
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:46,960
Oh, man.

731
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,260
It's so funny.

732
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:48,340
I don't want to.

733
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:48,940
Mike.

734
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:48,940


735
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:48,940


736
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:48,940


737
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:48,940


738
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:48,940


739
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:48,940


740
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:48,940


741
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:48,940


742
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:48,940


743
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:48,940


744
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,360
It means to me, ding dong, the deity's dead.

745
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:10,340
Witch old god, the stupid Bob, and the smart Bob, and the work tongue Bob, and the straight veal Bob, are all gone.

746
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:17,600
Finally put to rest along with the other silly superstitions that have saddled mankind for centuries.

747
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,560
Keeping them low in their ignorance, and high in their expectations.

748
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,600
War?

749
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,040
He's lining up for the punch, folks.

750
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,960
Yes, the bloody head of Arnold Palmer dictates what?

751
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:42,340
The fake, aimless, lifeless body of Arnold Palmer does.

752
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,460
But no, we shall find out the spirit of Arnold Palmer before he dies.

753
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,380
Oh, what a joke.

754
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,600
The one who is the most powerful of the two.

755
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,940
Oh, yes?

756
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:58,860
Yes.

757
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,780
Anteaters.

758
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,800
Black mud squirming.

759
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:04,940
Discus.

760
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:05,840
Discus.

761
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,740
Ashmanir.

762
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,720
Irulimrim.

763
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:11,880
Rasta.

764
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:12,980
Ka.

765
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:13,700
Das.

766
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,300
Use.

767
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,040
Give.

768
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,260
Handwriting period 2.

769
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:41,380
Essence,

770
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:41,420


771
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:41,420


772
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,340
body and mind, am takeaways of a narrow and zostaEous responsibility.

773
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:42,340


774
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:42,340


775
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:48,820
World War II short film excellent vie am alright I imagine than all the rest of America have to say?

776
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:48,920
GG 300

777
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,740
I took a ship

778
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,120
Headed beside the sun

779
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,840
Swam like a senator

780
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,160
I reached the shore

781
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,240
On a trip

782
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,100
When he looked at me

783
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,680
He was brewing

784
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,240
Handle to the cake

785
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,820
To the ocean floor

786
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,640
Now I'm alone

787
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,940
Yes, I'm alone

788
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,180
Me, old, old

789
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,320
Sinking like a stone

790
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,400
I am a man

791
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,960
Without a country

792
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,560
And I'm a boy

793
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,160
Without a home

794
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,260
I'm a casualty

795
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,500
Of the battle

796
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,320
Of the roses

797
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,140
And the war

798
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,220
Of the broken home

799
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,520
I got busted

800
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,780
For drinking while drinking

801
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,440
Carrying a weapon

802
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,940
Under my coat

803
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,760
Not arrested

804
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,360
For all the monkey people

805
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,000
And now I am a pirate

806
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,540
On the bad dream boat

807
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,360
I'm alone

808
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,480
I'm alone

809
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,780
And now I'm not a stallion

810
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,980
Cause I am a man

811
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,640
Without a country

812
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,220
And I'm a boy

813
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,840
Without a home

814
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,900
I'm a casualty

815
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,960
Of the battle

816
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,940
Of the roses

817
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,740
And the war

818
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,780
Of the broken home

819
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,000
I'm übrigens

820
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,600
And I'm all alone

821
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,200
And that's not true

822
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,600
Too late

823
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,800
The hell is with it

824
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,480
I don't know

825
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,000
See, I'm wearing

826
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,800
Hats and belts

827
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,460
Ladies and gentlemen

828
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:43,980
人 that came visiting

829
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,480
My Pourquoi

830
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,940
Oh, prodding

831
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,780
Oh, man, it'd be lonely

832
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,640
Love a hating lover

833
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,120
Friend against friend

834
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,940
Now I'm alone

835
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,160
I'm alone

836
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,700
And now I'm never going home

837
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,640
I am a man

838
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,300
Without a country

839
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,000
Without a home

840
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,760
I'm a casualty of the battle

841
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,420
Of the roses and the war

842
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,440
Of the broken home

843
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,220
guitar solo

844
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,680
guitar solo

845
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,960
guitar solo

846
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,280
The Rainmakers, friends,

847
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,520
and before that, ESO Radio

848
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,140
and some Media Barrage No. 5 excerpts

849
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,660
from the early 1980s

850
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,100
with Doctors for Bob and Lies

851
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,440
and now Glass Madness

852
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,340
with a song

853
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,560
followed by the latest collage

854
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,520
from The Bishop.

855
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,360
My mom is a rock

856
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,140
My mom is a tree

857
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,780
My mom is you, babe

858
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,820
My mom is me

859
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,560
My mom is a football

860
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,700
My mom is a basketball

861
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,740
My mom is a rugby ball

862
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,960
And my mom is a golf ball

863
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,700
In the al perfum ф morally

864
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:23,700


865
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:23,720
that's me

866
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:23,720


867
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,280
My love

868
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:37,040
My life

869
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,660
my 54 보�

870
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,340
My bottle

871
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:40,340


872
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,200
Now you're watching

873
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,100
Ghost Channel on melt south

874
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:44,500
at night

875
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:44,500


876
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:44,740
it's winter

877
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:44,900
and immediately

878
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:44,980
it's the beginning

879
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:44,980


880
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:44,980


881
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,060
is so belonga

882
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:51,400
marijuana. Years of research were necessary in order to improve the product. But it doesn't

883
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:57,660
take long for the drug habit to make anyone over. In all the colors of the rainbow. A few years back,

884
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,700
the United States of America had nearly gone crazy. They were lining up dope peddlers and

885
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:08,100
shooting them in the back of the head. Just take it or leave it. Then it's chemistry to the rescue.

886
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:14,800
The answer is a simple one. Just use your head. But there's one sure thing. If you use narcotics,

887
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:21,820
the horizon is unlimited. Talk to someone who has had the experience. All around us are the

888
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:28,860
products of modern chemistry. Heroin, morphine, red, crack, sleeping pills. Something that came

889
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:34,220
out of a test tube created in the chemist's laboratory by a miracle of modern science

890
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:41,260
folded into a compact little package many times as strong. And the dope addicts say

891
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:50,700
yes, chemistry has changed the world we live in. Something that came out of a test tube

892
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:56,640
is going to have been transformed into the destructive forces of useful life.

893
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,560
Most teenagers start off with marijuana. Some of the boys smoke them. You know,

894
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,720
the ones with backbone. My girlfriend Ann and I went around with Bob. They both smoke pop.

895
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:13,480
That's jive talk for marijuana. So I tried it. Funny what it does to you. Everything speeds up

896
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,780
to a hundred miles an hour.

897
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:22,400
There was something intriguing and different when I came home high that night. You're real sharp and you laugh a lot.

898
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:29,060
You're the biggest person in the world. All you think about day and night is the radiance of sparkling colors.

899
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:34,020
And then you pass out, but when you wake up it starts all over again. And that's the story.

900
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:40,680
Unbelievable, isn't it? Chemistry takes a hand in such commonplace things as dope traffic in the United States.

901
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,780
It's certainly true that the increased use of narcotics is a thing of the past.

902
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,260
It's a thing of beauty. Carrying off the harmful fumes from other chemical processes,

903
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:56,140
there's always the gentle dew, which cover the surface with a film of gritty scratching particles.

904
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,800
It feels like your skin is being torn right off you. It does.

905
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:06,740
Some young man may develop startling, stupid, ghastly, tragic, hidden secrets of nature.

906
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,140
The pioneer of tomorrow.

907
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,380
That's another mandatory.

908
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,560
They're all laughing like lunatics, demons and stuff.

909
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,740
I call this radio show because I'm baked.

910
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,740
I'm baked.

911
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,080
You are the inescapable result.

912
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,780
Of your life.

913
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,400
Of your tragedy.

914
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,100
Just as I am the inescapable result.

915
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,760
Of you.

916
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,500
Of you. Of you. Of you.

917
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,000
Marijuana. Marijuana.

918
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,440
You know what I'm talking about.

919
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,880
About um, marijuana.

920
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,280
Yeah, um, so the, this.

921
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,100
Marijuana. Marijuana as scientists smoking it.

922
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:27,940
Uh, um, in, in, in, of a, uh, uh, the government.

923
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,200
And, um, and, uh.

924
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:31,800
Why?

925
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,740
Um, the, the, on marijuana, on marijuana.

926
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,180
Um, it, uh, has, uh, has an refrain.

927
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,460
It's, uh, on your, uh, well, uh, the, the.

928
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:51,320
that marijuana, but it's almost important.

929
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:56,460
And so marijuana can now go crazy.

930
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,820
Stop, stop, my mind is going off.

931
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,780
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

932
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:20,260
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

933
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,500
I know it's making me self-conscious.

934
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,740
I know, it's kind of wild.

935
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,200
It's making me sick.

936
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:26,580
It's kind of...

937
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,780
But you love the sick.

938
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,460
Bonesome cowboy Dave.

939
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,560
You want the sick.

940
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,340
Oh.

941
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,140
You need the sick.

942
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,920
Because they give me the medicine when I'm sick.

943
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,180
The medicine, you know, man.

944
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,000
It's all medicine, Stang.

945
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:48,600
Haven't we told you this numerous times through the cyber codes,

946
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,900
through the allubrium that stretches deep into your muscles?

947
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I love the pudding so much.

948
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,200
It's like it's worth waiting for the bats on the hillside.

949
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,860
It's worth the face raping.

950
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:07,960
It's worth having that bat poison pump down my goozle.

951
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,400
It's worth the colloquiality now.

952
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,520
There'll be facts now.

953
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,580
There'll be no good.

954
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,840
I'll fight you with your old horse, Eagle.

955
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,200
Can I be excused now?

956
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,020
I refuse to leave this earth and leave it in a...

957
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,060
Oh, wait.

958
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,720
You're disgusting.

959
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:28,840
I just have to go back.

960
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:29,520
Oh.

961
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,160
Oh.

962
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:30,340


963
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,680
Oh.

964
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:32,160


965
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:32,360


966
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:32,560


967
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:32,560


968
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:32,820
Oh.

969
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:32,820


970
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:32,820


971
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:32,820


972
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:32,820


973
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:32,820


974
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:32,820


975
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:32,820


976
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:32,820


977
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:32,820


978
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:32,820


979
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,200
Oh.

980
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,260
Oh.

981
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:48,480


982
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:48,480


983
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:48,480


984
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:48,480


985
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:48,480


986
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:48,480


987
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:48,480


988
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,060
Oh, I hear them.

989
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,940
It's so smooth and unwrinkled in Dave's case.

990
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,960
It's like a sheet of pudding without the curge on top.

991
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:56,820
Or is that the...

992
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,820
Oh, yeah, that's the shmegma pipe.

993
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,060
Watch as we slice down.

994
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,640
Watch on the webcam as we slice down.

995
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,860
to Dave's brain.

996
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,760
It's like butter.

997
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,720
It's so soft and yielding.

998
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,140
It just peels right open.

999
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,160
The moons of Jupiter,

1000
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,060
they just slide so...

1001
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,920
And it's as if there's nothing inside,

1002
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,000
just this goo.

1003
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,440
You know, this is not an intelligent

1004
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,940
or refractory lubrication machine

1005
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,780
if you'd like to pipe up your organs.

1006
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,400
This is me, and this is you, baby.

1007
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,260
This is a perversion of every natural law.

1008
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,620
And what is time travel?

1009
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,980
But your pathetic attempt

1010
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,600
to control the world around you,

1011
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,860
your futile effort

1012
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,640
to have a question answered.

1013
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,420
You think I don't know you, Alexander?

1014
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,340
I can look inside your memories,

1015
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,400
your nightmares,

1016
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,460
your dreams.

1017
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,060
You're a man haunted

1018
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,800
by those two most terrible words.

1019
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,600
What?

1020
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:03,960
What?

1021
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:03,960


1022
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,840
Mr. Dulles?

1023
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,780
What is it, Jimmy?

1024
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:13,240
I'm busy.

1025
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,760
Yes, sir, I know.

1026
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,160
Only it's Sheriff Gillis,

1027
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,920
and he says he needs to talk to you.

1028
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,080
He says he needs to talk to me.

1029
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,620
The truth is,

1030
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,820
he's in pursuit of an immodest amount

1031
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,160
of that curious weed

1032
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,540
which you and your school chums

1033
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,980
seem to find so fascinating.

1034
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:29,940
Dulles?

1035
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:31,860
Dulles?

1036
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:32,860


1037
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,160
I just wanted your professional opinion

1038
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,140
about a hunch I got.

1039
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,100
A hunch?

1040
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,440
Something just keeps going around in my head.

1041
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,300
Forgive my preoccupation.

1042
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,240
I replaced missing eyeballs with sawdust

1043
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,820
and glued the lids together.

1044
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,260
I've used bent aluminum combs for dentures.

1045
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,640
I've used the back part of the scalp

1046
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,060
when there was no front part.

1047
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:58,260
Then I folded one hand over watered-up newspapers

1048
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,600
when the other hand had no fingers.

1049
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,840
You find all this, Mr. Dulles,

1050
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,520
is obscene?

1051
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,720
Do you know what is really obscene?

1052
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,260
Look at this.

1053
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,400
Look at the work I've done.

1054
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,300
This is an art.

1055
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:12,840
And I am the artist.

1056
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:14,480
Music

1057
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,140
One more time, I take it from the top

1058
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,380
Say you never let me stop, stop, stop

1059
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,880
One more hit, just a little pop

1060
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,220
To get me on my way until I drop, drop, drop

1061
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,080
Music

1062
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,440
Can't come down, gotta be high

1063
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,840
Say you never let me die, die, die

1064
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,280
One more time, but just a little try

1065
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,660
You know how much I love you when I'm high, high, high

1066
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:45,840
Music

1067
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,900
Well, I can be sweet, but I'm better when I'm bad

1068
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,200
And I can be a hippie when I'm mad, mad, mad

1069
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,720
Gotta be high with a twinkle in my eye

1070
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,960
Listen to the music on my high, high, high

1071
00:48:59,400 --> 00:48:59,800
Music

1072
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,080
Can't come down

1073
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,240
gotta stay high

1074
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,560
Can't come together, but we try, try, try

1075
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,840
One more night

1076
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,220
a feeling so good I've

1077
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,360
gotta keep a pop until I die, die, die

1078
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:13,920
Music

1079
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,520
Can't come down

1080
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,620
gotta stay high

1081
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,980
What ll I do without my high, high, high?

1082
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,320
Life's too fast

1083
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,420
I need a lot of slack

1084
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,800
Gotta get the piggies off my back, back, back

1085
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,360
Music

1086
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,120
I can be sweet but I'm better when I'm bad

1087
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,420
And I can be a hippie when I'm mad, mad, mad

1088
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,960
Gotta be high with a twinkle in my eye

1089
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,220
And listen to the music on my high, high, high

1090
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,500
On my high, high, high

1091
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:22,340
On my high, high, high

1092
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:28,060
You can see Yeti video in Yahoo Group's Friends for more from the bishop

1093
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:38,380
And now, friends, retardation from Lemuria, Puzzling Evidence, and Dr. Philo Drummond

1094
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:44,420
I'm hot and heat with a look at the creative and different ways to say 80

1095
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,480
The western's conditions are so dreadful these days

1096
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,240
Expect highs at just about all the lower elevation in the high country

1097
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,480
But I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that

1098
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:52,860
Heck!

1099
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,540
You know, because that's where it's going to be in the future

1100
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:58,740
The 420 will be 500

1101
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,080
You know, I brought a banana, but I can't find it

1102
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,820
I lost it somewhere and I'm hungry now

1103
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,520
The show is just going on and on and my hunger is

1104
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,380
One of the best things to do for your brain

1105
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,240
Really?

1106
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,600
The show is, yeah, I know

1107
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,560
If you listen to the show, you are smarter by 23.5%

1108
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,240
I like to do good things for my brain

1109
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,460
I like to give my brain

1110
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,380
I'm wearing a good massage

1111
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,060
Are you a break thinker?

1112
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,600
One of those Chiatsu massages

1113
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,180
Just open up my skull

1114
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,140
Yeah

1115
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,020
And start kneading the gray matter

1116
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:33,900
Uh-huh

1117
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,840
Sort of a self-trepanator, right?

1118
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:38,180
Yeah

1119
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:42,540
I don't use any fancy cutting tools

1120
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,960
Yeah, none of those sharpened pieces of jade

1121
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,100
I hear somebody's cell phone making that weird buzz it does

1122
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,840
Yeah, you know who that is?

1123
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,240
That's my breathing

1124
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,000
Hear it?

1125
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,720
That's my ear tube

1126
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,280
Oh, that's the government listening to this show

1127
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,940
And all the other shows on KPTV

1128
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,200
Are you still in that iron lung?

1129
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:07,880
Um, I've upgraded to the new plastic lung

1130
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,900
Oh, okay

1131
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,380
One of those new fangled things

1132
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,000
Now friends, this church of the subgenius, this story of Bob

1133
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,380
It could be the greatest joke ever told

1134
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,620
But if

1135
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:19,960
But if

1136
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,620
And only if

1137
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,420
And only if Earth can make it to the punchline

1138
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:27,280
And we can do that, friends, if you will use your own

1139
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,680
Your own hate

1140
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,640
You, actually, you don't have to use anything of yours

1141
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,340
As Dr. Legume said, use their hate and their fear

1142
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,120
Pump up your mutant abnormality

1143
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,960
Flaunt your weirdness and wag it in their slack-jawed, uncomprehending faces

1144
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,420
That will do more than your vote

1145
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,880
Wag your weirdness right there in public, friends

1146
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,800
As Saint Hendrick said, let your freak flag

1147
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,560
Wave your freak flag high

1148
00:52:54,560 --> 00:53:00,100
Freedom, freedom, kindly loving you

1149
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,280
Be absolutely free

1150
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,340
Only if you want to be

1151
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,860
There's no reason why you do it

1152
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,800
And nothing stays long

1153
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,480
I won't forget you

1154
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,660
I won't forget you

1155
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,360
Forget you

1156
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,580
And it'll keep me young

1157
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,920
You never realize

1158
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,180
The way we came together

1159
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:40,020
And it's now

1160
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:40,220
What I've done

1161
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:40,820
I'm nothing

1162
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:40,820


1163
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:40,820


1164
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,940
Yeah, that's all

1165
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:41,940


1166
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:41,940


1167
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:41,940


1168
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:41,940


1169
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:41,940


1170
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:41,940


1171
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:41,940


1172
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,940
Ah, look where I ended up

1173
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:48,160
I was frank

1174
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:48,160


1175
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:48,160


1176
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,940
I've wanted to

1177
00:53:54,840 --> 00:54:01,900
You see yourself being turned and see yourself next to a soldier being cut down.

1178
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:07,000
You ride on a scene as where everything is beautiful, lush green, brighter than day.

1179
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:12,400
And like you see a completely crystal scene of a soldier being shot down.

1180
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:19,320
And also you feel yourself helping that soldier up, but not his uniform, but you're feeling yourself

1181
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,500
held in another vibe, another sense of that soldier.

1182
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,340
It seems like a soul of him, you know, you're helping him up.

1183
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,380
And then you whisk back to the waterhole.

1184
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:48,340
I can still recall my first guitar.

1185
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:55,440
A Futurama with a tremolo bar.

1186
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:02,660
I tried to play like Jimmy with my teeth.

1187
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:09,760
The dentist went and saw and said good grief.

1188
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,380
I can still recall my first guitar.

1189
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:12,380


1190
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:22,320
So when it is nearing Christmas, the present I always wish for is Jimmy Hendrix Stratt.

1191
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:27,920
Oh, when he played it was a crazy sound.

1192
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:34,920
He played his bloody guitar upside down.

1193
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,920
I wouldn't have seen him play the Isle of Wight.

1194
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,380
I wouldn't have seen him play the Isle of Wight.

1195
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,500
Or Joan of Arc.

1196
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,680
All right.

1197
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,960
Who would it be anyway?

1198
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:59,580
I can only remember my first instrument.

1199
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,500
The이나 by Andre Pадиć

1200
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:01,500


1201
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:01,500


1202
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:01,500


1203
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:01,500


1204
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:01,500


1205
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:01,500


1206
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:01,500


1207
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:01,500


1208
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:01,720
in order to say something very Bankers' sense.

1209
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:02,520
Someone like Thatcher and Have self-ixoom.

1210
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,440
Then, just a little...

1211
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,020
I'm sure Justacher is one of those is very much around

1212
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:07,020


1213
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:07,020


1214
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:42,940
Thank you.

1215
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,580
Thank you.

1216
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:48,760
And friends, that was Captain Sensible with Jimi Hendrix's Strat and some excerpts from Rainbow Bridge and so forth by Hendrix himself and some preaching from Austin.

1217
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,260
All put together that last segment there by Potare Nostril.

1218
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:59,000
And remember, friends, www.subgenius.com.

1219
00:57:59,000 --> 00:57:59,540
Um.

1220
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:22,580
Dobbs became the first, the first, my friend, to address Bob Post Office Box 204206 Austin, Texas 78720.

1221
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,880
It's not, it's dumb.

1222
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,240
It's not intelligent.

1223
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,860
And they kind of pass off that stupidity as intelligent.

1224
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,200
That's Bob.

1225
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:42,420
P.O. Box 204206 Austin, Texas 78720.

1226
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:49,920
Uh, uh, uh, where she has a three and a half year old toddler who's already been told to hate Bob.

1227
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,940
And to basically kill him.

1228
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,420
Bob.

1229
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:54,600
Jim, thanks for the call.

1230
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,680
You know, uh, it's funny because I called in, uh.

1231
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:06,620
About, uh, I don't know, 50 years ago and tried to get ahold of Dr. Trishberger because I guess there was some other doctor who was, um.

1232
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,480
Good.

1233
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,240
Possibly getting somebody for me to talk to.

1234
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,720
An official declaration of war against Bob.

1235
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,020
Shock and horror lingered.

1236
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,620
And there goes the torch parade.

1237
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,920
What sort of goings on is that anyway?

1238
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:28,880
Some sort of.

1239
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,320
Rights for the temple of vampires.

1240
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:34,480
Jack, you mean to sit there and say all that gang was vampires?

1241
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:35,300
How do I know?

1242
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,980
At least they seem to be priests of the temple.

1243
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:38,240
Yeah.

1244
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,120
Rogues and torches and stuff.
