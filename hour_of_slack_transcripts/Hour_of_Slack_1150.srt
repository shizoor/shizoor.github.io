1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,620
A beginning is a very delicate time.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,580
Strange things began to take place.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,180
Flying saucers seen over Washington, D.C.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,440
I understand, Colonel, you've been on tap, tap, tap.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,600
The Earth people who can think are so frightened by those who cannot.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,600
It's been absolutely impossible to work through these Earth creatures.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,760
Their soul is too controlled.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,260
Kill him!

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,520
I'm the Jett.

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,960
The Soul Genius.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,600
Power of the Swamp.

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,740
You ain't gonna find him in there.

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,460
And now for the first time, we are bringing to you the full story of what happened.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,780
We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,520
And remember, my friends,

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,100
future events such as these will affect you in the future.

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,240
You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,120
That is why you are here.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,440
It was a light coming down from the sky.

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,760
I don't know who or why.

21
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,480
We've been around for, well, we've been public since 1980.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,460
That was when we printed our first pamphlet, and then the book of the subgenius came out in 1983.

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,260
Now, all through the 80s, it was really just kind of a club of nerdy, overweight boys.

24
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,560
As you might well imagine.

25
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,700
It looked kind of like a GWAR concert.

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:47,740
But, we lied and presented it as a sex cult, like the Raelians that you may have heard of.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh yeah, right, right, Rael.

28
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,120
And then they wanted to clone themselves.

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,380
Well, you know, it's like a building.

30
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,200
They build it and they will come.

31
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:06,040
Sure enough, it turns out there are a lot of lonely mutants out there looking for a mutant of the opposite or otherwise desired sex or species.

32
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:14,360
And we started having these yearly events, which we call X-Day Drills.

33
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,860
Did you know the world ends July 5th?

34
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,940
No, I did not know that.

35
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,860
Yeah, Bob predicted a long time ago that the world ends on July 5th, 1998.

36
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,980
1998 at 7am.

37
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:25,860
98.

38
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,480
Yeah.

39
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:34,440
Now, obviously, the conspiracy of the normal people has been fooling with calendars for who knows how long.

40
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,300
Well, this is true, yeah.

41
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,940
Just to embarrass Bob.

42
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,900
And it's obviously really not 1998 yet.

43
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,920
Well, then there was the Romans that screwed it up too.

44
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,460
You know what I mean?

45
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,160
You always blame the Romans.

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,360
Yeah, there's, it's a real mess.

47
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,620
We don't really know what year this is or what planet this is even.

48
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,980
But, we get together at different campgrounds.

49
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,000
And we have these end of the world drills.

50
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,620
Cool.

51
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,180
Every July 5th, we do what you would do if you thought the world was about to end.

52
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,580
What does one do on a drill?

53
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,740
I mean, where the world ends?

54
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,040
I mean, just kind of run around screaming?

55
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,500
It's up to you.

56
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,100
I mean, things you wouldn't do on a normal day at work.

57
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,900
Well, I can think of a lot of things I wouldn't do on a normal day at work.

58
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,840
You know, like eat three helpings of ice cream instead of just one.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,260
Ah.

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,320
You know, really wild stuff like that.

61
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,960
People turning south on the freeway were startled when they saw the world end.

62
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,460
They saw three flying saucers high over Hollywood Boulevard.

63
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,640
With your ancient juvenile minds, you have developed explosives too fast for your minds to conceive what you are doing.

64
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,460
Then they attacked a town.

65
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,960
A small town, I'll admit.

66
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,160
But nevertheless, a town of people.

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,640
People who died.

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,300
Must be those strangers that come every night.

69
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,740
Those saucer-shaped lights put people uptight.

70
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,220
Leave blue-green footprints that glow in the dark.

71
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,460
I hope they get home all right.

72
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,500
Aside from the church declaring war on God and trying to change all human nature,

73
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:15,880
which is also what every peacenik wants, I guess, is to change human nature and make us so we're not chimpanzees or even primates anymore.

74
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,120
Good luck on that.

75
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,100
But actually, Bob promises the end.

76
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:28,040
The end of warfare for all who have become ordained subgenius ministers, which only cost $30,

77
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,940
on X-Day, July 5th, 1998, if the real 1998 ever gets here,

78
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,040
that's how big the conspiracy is.

79
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,820
That's how insidious it is.

80
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:46,900
You think this is, what, July 29th, 2008, if that's what it's supposed to be.

81
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,700
But we don't really know what year this is.

82
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,080
We don't even know what year it is.

83
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,700
We don't even know what planet this is.

84
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,960
If I could tell you that Earth was switched with Mars,

85
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:01,580
and World War II was nothing but a diversion to hide that slight of planet trick,

86
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,780
and you would laugh, some of you, if it were that funny.

87
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,540
But it's fucking true.

88
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,940
That's the horrible thing about it.

89
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:16,460
And if you don't believe me, the evidence is in our new book, The Bobliographon.

90
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,580
I'm sure the evidence is also in the Bible.

91
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,980
As far as I can tell, the evidence for anything is in the Bible.

92
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,360
And our books are the same way.

93
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,800
They're vague.

94
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,840
They're full of generalizations and terrible, wrathful things,

95
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,700
which suddenly turn into peacenik, nice things.

96
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,200
And there's a lot of sex and killing.

97
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,600
So, you know, and what we have that the Bible doesn't,

98
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,820
pictures.

99
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,880
That's a selling point.

100
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,020
Our books have pictures.

101
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,500
You see, as Onan said, once again, see, he's my script writer,

102
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,860
God forgot to make stupidity painful.

103
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,420
We're here to change that.

104
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,760
And I have a condition known as everything hurts really bad all the time-thritis.

105
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,000
The last time I said that at one of these, a guy came up and gave me three Vicodin.

106
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,660
Is that guy here?

107
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,240
Yeah.

108
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,800
Anyway, we have, um...

109
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,380
Where is he?

110
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,900
One guy...

111
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,660
Bumped out.

112
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,920
Lady trouble, huh?

113
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,100
Yeah, my ex was a pain in the ass, too.

114
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,100
What did you say?

115
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,440
You said my ex was a pain in the ass, too.

116
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,080
Your ex?

117
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,120
Yeah?

118
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,680
Your ex?

119
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:50,980
Yeah!

120
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,320
Your ex?

121
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,800
That's it!

122
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,260
Ex day!

123
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,160
Ex day!

124
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,620
Ex day!

125
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,740
Thank you!

126
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,200
Ex day!

127
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,240
Ex day!

128
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,880
Ex day!

129
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,480
Ex day!

130
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:08,960
Hey!

131
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,600
X Day.

132
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,000
X Day.

133
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,060
A day to rid yourself of a burden.

134
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,060


135
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,060


136
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,060


137
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,060


138
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,060


139
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,060


140
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,060


141
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,060


142
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,060


143
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,740
of that extra baggage

144
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,460
and to once again

145
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,440
soar like a falcon

146
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,480
to new horizons of freedom.

147
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,000
Abandon your intimate side

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,140
and demolish your relationships

149
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,880
with X-Day cards.

150
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,000
X-Day.

151
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,460
Well, that's it.

152
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,260
That's the new greeting card line.

153
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,040
X-Day.

154
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,700
Every new beginning's a delicate time

155
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,060
But just like when the end comes

156
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,680
It's never very pretty

157
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,780
And every in-between time

158
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,460
Looks like a perfect picture

159
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,220
It seems to last forever

160
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,240
Because it's the name still

161
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,840
Oh, baby

162
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,500
Change is gonna come

163
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,400
Not just maybe

164
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,880
Change is gonna come

165
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:58,540
Oh, baby

166
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,520
Change is gonna come

167
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,560
A spaceman makes it with an alien girl

168
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,120
Change is gonna come

169
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,140
Scientists prove we were never here

170
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,940
Change is gonna come

171
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,800
A change is gonna come

172
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,460
Here it comes

173
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,340
Every new beginning's a delicate time

174
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,620
But just like when the end comes

175
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,340
It's never very pretty

176
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,380
And every in-between time

177
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,080
Looks like a perfect picture

178
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,900
It seems to last forever

179
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,780
Because it's the name still

180
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,560
But oh, mama

181
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,160
Change is gonna come

182
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,180
Psycho, mama

183
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,680
Change is gonna come

184
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,420
If this were a dictatorship,

185
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,760
it'd be a heck of a lot easier.

186
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,360
Just so long as I'm a dictator.

187
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,600
What's your view on homosexuality?

188
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,260
Yeah, I am mindful that we're all sinners.

189
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,400
And to the C students,

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,760
I say,

191
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,060
you too can be president of the United States.

192
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,960
It's just, uh,

193
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,020
you know, it's just,

194
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,140
I just don't understand.

195
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,860
It doesn't make any sense to me.

196
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,800
But change is gonna come

197
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,700
by the attery squash.

198
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,900
There with Reverend Diva Schimata.

199
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,000
Praise Diva.

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,960
Praise Devo.

201
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,300
And there's, uh,

202
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,460
lots more of the attery squash

203
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,700
at myspace.com

204
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,500
slash the attery squash.

205
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:12,600
One more.

206
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,000
Attery is A-T-T-E-R-Y.

207
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,200
Before that,

208
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,960
yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,080
sermonizing at Winterstar of 2008.

210
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,900
See Rosencomet.com for more on that

211
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,900
and Starwood coming later this summer.

212
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,800
And see Subgenius.com

213
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,260
if you want to know about X-Day.

214
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,380
We also heard more on X-Day moronicism

215
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,140
on Rick Barber's show

216
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,860
on KOA Denver from last year.

217
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,800
Praise Rick and praise Lemur,

218
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,280
Lemur,

219
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,360
the colloquial,

220
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:46,640
collo...

221
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:47,560
uh...

222
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,180
graphi-ire.

223
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,160
Uh, how do you say that?

224
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,960
Collo-gi-graph-iest.

225
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,980
Uh, anyway, friends,

226
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,140
this is hour of slack number

227
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,660
1,150

228
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,560
devoted to the world of X-Day.

229
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,900
A world from which all normality has vanished.

230
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,940
The disappearance of humans

231
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,800
may seem like science fiction.

232
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,660
But eventually,

233
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,660
there will come a day like this.

234
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,740
A day when people no longer walk the Earth.

235
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,260
ノ

236
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,420
it's no great stretch

237
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,920
to imagine humans disappearing

238
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,840
from the face of the Earth.

239
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,100
Every generation has its tales

240
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,800
of Armageddon or Apocalypse.

241
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,240
We're the first generation that could,

242
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,640
by deliberate actions,

243
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,640
cause its own doom.

244
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,000
ructured 56 muito,

245
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,600
He says tentacles from Planet X.

246
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,580
It's a lie, you know.

247
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,620
I mean, all these people do is just lie to each other.

248
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,140
Of course, it's a lie.

249
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,020
Of course, it's a lie.

250
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,760
It's lunacy.

251
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,280
From the look of it, the tentacles are coming out of the beer cans.

252
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,260
Now you know how happy I can be.

253
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,120
All together now.

254
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:07,940
Three or three.

255
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,600
85, 85.

256
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,000
The number is 142.

257
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,500
Yeah, the monkeys.

258
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,260
They just seemed appropriate somehow.

259
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,400
Somehow.

260
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,500
Not exactly Yeti, but close enough for jazz.

261
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,640
By the way, is it true that the subgenii are descendants of Yeti?

262
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,480
Right.

263
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:33,440
We believe that there are only two races, the human race and the subgeniuses.

264
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:40,500
And both come in all colors and shapes and ages and several different genders.

265
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,900
And furry?

266
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,080
Well, that's...

267
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,820
Some are.

268
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,960
You know, not all of us can boast that we're full-blood Yetis.

269
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,540
In fact, almost nobody can.

270
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,720
In fact, I don't know a single one.

271
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,660
Yeah, well...

272
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,840
But, you know, if you look around at the people you work with, you'll go,

273
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,440
that person there might have a little bit of Sasquatch blood.

274
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,460
Yeah, well, I...

275
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,120
A little bit of Bigfoot there.

276
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,060
I've seen a few.

277
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,120
Especially, you know, you look at some of the Russian premieres.

278
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,240
They have that look about them.

279
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,020
Right.

280
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,400
Yeah.

281
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,300
The unibrow look.

282
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,160
Let's go back to the telephone.

283
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,000
In Denver is Lee.

284
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,160
Lee, you're on with the Reverend Ivan Stang.

285
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,640
Good morning.

286
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,840
Good morning, Rick.

287
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,300
Reverend Stang, it's an honor.

288
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,480
All hail Dobbs.

289
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,380
Praise Bob.

290
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,640
All hail Bob.

291
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,120
You bet.

292
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,780
Well, you know, some religions have the pilgrimage.

293
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,100
Some have jihad.

294
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,000
Some have the vision quest.

295
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:38,580
What would you say is the highest deed one can perform to achieve universal slack?

296
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,720
Well, slack is the goal of every subgenius.

297
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,680
Uh...

298
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,800
The trick, though, is that slack is different to each subgenius.

299
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,980
Most religions will preach a specific form of slack that's supposed to fit everybody.

300
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,820
And the conspiracy of the normal people, of course, that that's the way they work.

301
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,660
But...

302
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,260
So, we'll tell you that you need slack and that you should work your way towards it.

303
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,740
But since we don't know what slack is for you, we can't be all that specific.

304
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:13,860
Uh...

305
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,500
The...

306
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:23,240
As far as a pilgrimage, I would say X-Day is getting to be the yearly subgenius pilgrimage.

307
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:36,480
We hold the main X-Day drill in a clothing-optional campground in Amish country in New York, way out in the boonies,

308
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,160
where we can pretty much do anything we want.

309
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,580
You'll be glad to know that most people keep their clothes.

310
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,320
Would this be anywhere near Yaskier's Farm?

311
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,800
Uh...

312
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,080
No.

313
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,740
It's the other side of New York.

314
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,680
It's kind of near Erie, Pennsylvania.

315
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,420
I see.

316
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,720
And it's a pretty eerie place.

317
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,520
So to speak.

318
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,560
Uh...

319
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,360
But, yeah, Brushwood Folklore Center is where X-Day is held.

320
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:00,860
And we...

321
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,040
That's got to be the...

322
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,980
People come to that from all over the world.

323
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,940
And we've had people come from Germany and China.

324
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,760
It's...

325
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,440
It's just amazing.

326
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:13,560
It's just amazing.

327
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,960
It's kind of a mutant convention.

328
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,820
The first day is always rather awkward because, you know, weirdos often are kind of shy.

329
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,160
Or else they talk so much they drive everybody else away.

330
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,620
So it's a little rough the first day.

331
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,980
But it's got to be quite a community.

332
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,560
Interesting.

333
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,940
But, yeah, it's a real cult.

334
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,560
You know, I mean, when people talk about cults,

335
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,840
the Church of the Subgenius is a lot bigger than many of the ones that get so much press.

336
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:43,820
You bet.

337
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,220
Maybe you do believe this.

338
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,540
Maybe they're not lies.

339
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,940
They're delusions, whatever.

340
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,600
The fact remains.

341
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,800
The evidence here is flimsy.

342
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,680
It's bordering on ludicrous.

343
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,540
Hey, this isn't a courtroom.

344
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,820
You're not arguing a case.

345
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,620
You're doing nothing but damage talking the way you are.

346
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,320
And you can throw as much cow's blood around the loading dock as you want to.

347
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,800
You still haven't fooled anyone.

348
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,860
Leave it alone, David.

349
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,220
You can't convince some people there's a fire even when their hair is burning.

350
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,400
Denial is a powerful thing.

351
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,060
Well, keep talking.

352
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,660
I'll have no part of it.

353
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,560
Nor would anyone.

354
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,880
Any thinking person.

355
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,340
Keep thinking, Mr. Lawyer.

356
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,160
There's no defense against the will of God.

357
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,560
There's no court of appeals in hell.

358
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,740
There's no defense here either.

359
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,480
Not even with all the fertilizer in the world.

360
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,820
Not even if you stack it as high as you can.

361
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,860
It's still just bags of shit, isn't it?

362
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,280
Those of you who want to discuss this thing rationally to find a means of rescue are welcome to join me.

363
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,100
Those who want to stack dog food, knock yourselves out.

364
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,200
And anyone who believes in a little child like me who is not a false test colleague to tell

365
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,340
you if they're purple and they're not interested in those who give no shit about them.

366
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,520
No matter what happens on the show, don't take it personally.

367
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:55,820
Right.

368
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,940
Like I bought the thing where, you know, dude, trailer.

369
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,680
Thank you.

370
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,580
Don't confuse the listener with an act of human.

371
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,340
But we can be asking them to do more than one thing during a plug.

372
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,640
And that is listening to the puzzling evidence show.

373
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,480
Be careful.

374
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,740
And download the podcast.

375
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,100
And your show have the support it needs.

376
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,480
Now, which were the real callers and which were the fake callers?

377
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,680
I am in the same room with Puzzling Evidence.

378
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:29,460
These shows are actually lovingly collected and downloaded and podcasted.

379
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,440
See, that's what I'm afraid of.

380
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,680
If your show is an hour long.

381
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,520
I have to live with that every X day, Puzz.

382
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,480
I've been shot at X day.

383
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,540
Luckily, it was by my good friend, Dr. Legume.

384
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,140
And it had blanks in it.

385
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,700
Vary your delivery and your words.

386
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,260
Even the great X day has a copy of the original.

387
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,500
And conversational.

388
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,740
Can I have the deity shot?

389
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,040
Reintroduce your deity.

390
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,200
Now, remember, remember, I'm deaf.

391
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,580
Recognize your many different listening styles.

392
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,400
I can change it.

393
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,860
Bye, satellite.

394
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,720
Call out through towns with central and lateral control mechanisms.

395
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,000
It's also about how people will believe anything.

396
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,080
Of course.

397
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,860
I mean, look at Jim Jones out in California back in the 70s.

398
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:27,340
I mean, look at how he was able to mesmerize 900 people into drinking the Kool-Aid.

399
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,620
I heard about this Texas death cult that gets people to stand around waiting for flying saucers every single year.

400
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,740
They think the world is going to end.

401
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,140
Now, they may be a Texas death cult, but they don't meet in Texas.

402
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,520
They actually meet in the most rural parts.

403
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,540
Part of New York State.

404
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,360
Oh, how do you know they don't meet in Texas?

405
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,180
Well, they could meet in Texas.

406
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,420
Yeah, as a matter of fact, they do.

407
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,220
Yes.

408
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,540
And what they do, it's like the Bohemian Grove there.

409
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,740
They don't wear clothes.

410
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,500
Yeah.

411
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,240
We're talking, of course, about the Raelians, the fabulous visitors from the stars.

412
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:01,740
Right.

413
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,420
From Star Royale.

414
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,920
Everybody must get cloned.

415
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,800
Oh, yeah.

416
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,320
When you have too many and there's too many replicants.

417
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,880
Yeah, replicating replicants and stuff, it gets confusing.

418
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,640
No, they're the people who claimed they had cloned a human being.

419
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,380
And the press actually bought it.

420
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,080
For about five minutes.

421
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,700
It's like they actually got these people on the front page of various national papers.

422
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,460
It's like, wow, these reporters need to keep up with their bizarre cults better.

423
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,000
You know what I mean?

424
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,280
Well, nowadays, you can clone the little corporal in your basement.

425
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,900
Yes, sir.

426
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:42,260
Napoleon Bonaparte, one strand of Arizona to create an entire dictator from Republican roots.

427
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,780
I'm sorry.

428
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,580
If only.

429
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,480
If only we could clone people from their hair.

430
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:47,940
Huh?

431
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,860
Actually, the reason why the media went after that guy with the Raelians, he provided too much information all at once.

432
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:03,000
He was out there spilling the secrets about his own faith and nobody had any reason to buy into it because it was like.

433
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,040
Which is why the Church of the Subgenius is different.

434
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,800
Right.

435
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,700
We provide just enough faith for you to believe on your own what is real and what isn't.

436
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,520
Right.

437
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,540
Well, the thing with the applesauce duo, they used to tour together, not the same as staying in.

438
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:24,220
We but they would they would come and appear long before they were, you know, the Raelian saviors and stuff like that.

439
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:34,380
They'd like show up at high school and, you know, like Socrates bowling alley places and stuff where people would congregate and and, you know, have this meeting.

440
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,840
And people were expected to field questions, but they would never answer.

441
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,640
Some other person who looked real serious and scared would say, I mean.

442
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,200
And then he says, and then they would say what they said.

443
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,840
And that's what it was like.

444
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,440
Like.

445
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,200
You see, you see your stupid minds.

446
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,820
Stupid, stupid.

447
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:02,080
There comes a time in each man's life when he can't even believe his own eyes.

448
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,200
Take any fire, any earthquake, any major disaster.

449
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,840
Then wonder.

450
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,560
Oh, every every year, there's some movie that rips.

451
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,260
Off Bob.

452
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,260
Yep.

453
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,700
The conspiracy uses Hollywood as a tool to distract from Bob.

454
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,920
One of the most gross examples was, you know, Bob predicted the end of the world, July 5th, 1998.

455
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:28,140
Well, what movie was released July 4th, 1998?

456
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,000
Independence Day.

457
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,220
Yes.

458
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,420
From our little alien invasion.

459
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,840
And in that one, of course, the Earth men win.

460
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,480
With a computer program.

461
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,900
The aliens and the subgeniuses will win, but the humans will lose.

462
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:53,040
So now that isn't that telling us then that everybody who survived in Independence Day is actually either a subgenius or an alien.

463
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,080
And these are all mixed up in that movie.

464
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:01,500
The subgenius was the drunken head who had been abducted by aliens.

465
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,620
No one would believe.

466
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:08,340
And he martyred himself by flying his fighter jet up the tailpipe of the mothership.

467
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,740
I like these.

468
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,320
And give away.

469
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:10,660
The ending.

470
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah.

471
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:11,820
Well.

472
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,380
It's a little slim pickings for me.

473
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,020
I was going to go see it tomorrow.

474
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:15,820
Warning.

475
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,720
Spoilers.

476
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,360
Spoiler like you are saying.

477
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,700
Movie is conspiracy propaganda.

478
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:32,020
And, of course, the conspiracy does have its giant festival on July 4th with fireworks and depressing desert storm parades, as someone once wrote.

479
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:40,160
But the next day, subgenius day, as it were, is freedom from.

480
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,360
The conspiracy of the normals is independence from them.

481
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,820
That's our that's our main holiday.

482
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,660
The fifth.

483
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,140
The church.

484
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:49,500
Yeah.

485
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,300
Fifth of July.

486
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,200
You don't have to come to Brushwood in New York.

487
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:04,600
But if you do, you'll find that the orgies of X Day lead up to the supreme moment of the saucer landing and boarding.

488
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,220
Now, I've been out there on that field at seven o'clock in the morning.

489
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:10,720
Me, too.

490
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,600
Every July 5th since 1996, when we started drilling for the end.

491
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,620
There have been an unexplained mystery.

492
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,220
It's a hellish time in the sky for for subgenius.

493
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,340
For me, it's a it's hard to get up.

494
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,360
It's a few hours after I go to bed, especially right there.

495
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:38,540
Well, it's a reminder to me how how so many of my fellow subgeniuses have to get up at that ungodly hour six days a week.

496
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,660
So they're back there.

497
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,140
But to.

498
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,060
Work.

499
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,740
And that's right.

500
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,380
So what's the fourth look like then?

501
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,340
Well, how are you preparing?

502
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,160
How are you preparing for the fifth?

503
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,320
What are you doing on the fourth?

504
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,580
We do all the things that you would do if you thought it was the last day of your life.

505
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,080
Sweet.

506
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,440
Lots of sex.

507
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,220
See, we don't celebrate July 4th out there at all.

508
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,820
We are separated from planet America.

509
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,780
And we're out that we don't even hear the distant pop of fireworks.

510
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,460
That's one thing to do.

511
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,080
We have.

512
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,160
We might have fireworks of our own, but that's a different matter.

513
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,940
And they wouldn't be let off at that particular time.

514
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:27,780
Actually, how Rushwood has outlawed firework used by subgeniuses on their campground because we overdid it for so many years.

515
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:39,500
Of course, the Amish farmers were having trouble with their horses kicking down the stables because of the subgenius fireworks being so loud.

516
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:39,880
Oh, yeah.

517
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,740
Well, you're just alerting the masses that the truth is now.

518
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,100
It's the fifth.

519
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,600
Damn it.

520
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,320
The fourth is over.

521
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,780
We've been trying.

522
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,380
We've been at it for 25 years now.

523
00:25:52,520 --> 00:26:05,260
Well, no, 27 years now since the subgenius foundation first went public, trying to spread the word of slack, the truth of J.R. Bob Dobbs and warnings about the conspiracy.

524
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,700
And every.

525
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,740
If you don't.

526
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,320
If one.

527
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,340
One soul is saved by this broadcast tonight and this whole trip.

528
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,440
This whole church was worth it.

529
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,580
If one soul is saved, that 27 years is justified.

530
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,360
Justified, my friend.

531
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,540
Call in now and Pastor Stang will relieve your woes.

532
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,700
Just give us a jingle.

533
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,500
We can't promise we'll relieve your woes, but we can change your woes.

534
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:37,800
Six.

535
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,800
You're right.

536
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,660
The alphanum opened.

537
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:40,480


538
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,060
And now is the time.

539
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,580
Save yourselves.

540
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,220
Well, where the hell did you find those?

541
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,300
And now.

542
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,140
And now.

543
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,100
And now is the time.

544
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,100


545
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,100


546
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,100


547
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,660
Mission control.

548
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,960
This is Mars 205 ready for departure.

549
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,060
Uh, earth.

550
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,760
The planet Earth.

551
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,400
Roger.

552
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,240
Countdown is going.

553
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,180
T-minus five.

554
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,460
Ready for departure.

555
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:10,460


556
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:10,460


557
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:10,460


558
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:10,460


559
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:10,460


560
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:10,460


561
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:10,460


562
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:10,460


563
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:10,460


564
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:10,460


565
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,200
4, 3, 2, 1.

566
00:27:52,800 --> 00:28:08,940
4, 3, 2, 1.

567
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:28,840
4, 3, 2, 1.

568
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:58,460
4, 3, 2, 1.

569
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:10,920
Yeah!

570
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,940
4, 3, 2, 1.

571
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,660
4, 3, 2, 1.

572
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:40,140
4, 3, 2, 1.

573
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,760
4, 3, 2, 1.

574
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:40,460
4, 3, 2, 1.

575
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:48,920
4, 3, 2, 1.

576
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:57,600
4, 3, 2, 1.

577
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:39,780
4, 3, 2, 1.

578
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,300
and get to punish everybody we ever didn't like,

579
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,500
which unfortunately in most cases,

580
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,780
I'm afraid it's going to be our fellow subgeniuses.

581
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,860
So it will truly be a war in heaven at that point.

582
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,520
But somebody else pointed out that regarding X data,

583
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,040
that an X after all is just a cross that's been knocked over.

584
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,840
Not to me.

585
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,420
No, we don't have anything.

586
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,960
Believe me, got nothing against Jesus.

587
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,280
Jesus is just all right with me.

588
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,840
It's always been his fan club that gave us,

589
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,620
and not just his fan club,

590
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,060
all those other guys, Buddhist fan club.

591
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,760
Oh, I've got less ego than anybody here.

592
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,780
You know, you can't get away from it.

593
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,160
It's fundamentalism.

594
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,740
We put the fun in fundamentalism.

595
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,680
We also put the duh in fundamentalism.

596
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,840
And we put the...

597
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,220
Yeah.

598
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:40,680
The uh.

599
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,580
The ism.

600
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,480
The ism.

601
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,200
The mmm.

602
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,980
You name it.

603
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,160
You know, we put it in the fundamentalism.

604
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,280
Over and over again.

605
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,120
Anyway, our friend Joyce Levine,

606
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,420
Reverend Joyce Levine, who couldn't be here,

607
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,200
wrote an X-Day poem.

608
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,020
I don't think she's ever even been to X-Day,

609
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,100
but she's been to Starwood, so she can imagine.

610
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,040
It's just a smaller, much smaller Starwood,

611
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,780
where everybody, like a science fiction convention,

612
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,180
only they believe a different kind of science fiction.

613
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,180
Here's the poem.

614
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,980
Bare-breasted ladies run amok.

615
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,000
Seems they came by pickup truck.

616
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,580
From towns we did not know exist.

617
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,760
It's slack time here on Mother Earth.

618
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,200
All beings celebrate your birth.

619
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,180
She gave this to me on my birthday.

620
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,020
Meteors fly across the sky.

621
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,380
It's the night.

622
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,300
Cicadas sing with all their might.

623
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,340
From a lounge chair, take it in.

624
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,780
With a satisfied, dazzled grin.

625
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,780
I just thought that was a sweet X-Day poem,

626
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,020
especially since it starts with bare-breasted ladies.

627
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,920
That always gets me.

628
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,800
You know, I waited for somebody to say Bob.

629
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,300
So, can a caller call in with a credit card number

630
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,360
and become ordained right here on the air?

631
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,440
Yes, although I...

632
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,080
Man, yelling your credit card and expiration date over public airwaves.

633
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,240
Well, we'll max it out before anyone else can.

634
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:18,840
We're ready.

635
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,320
No, that's okay.

636
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,620
No, we're fine.

637
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,220
I hear King of Slash Bill T. Miller in the background

638
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,860
singing one of his X-Day songs.

639
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,640
The Flap.

640
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,800
We have a whole CD.

641
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,180
A collection of songs about X-Day.

642
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,700
It's like 30 different songs in every style imaginable.

643
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:47,740
I wrote one.

644
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,620
How do we find them?

645
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,600
How do we get them?

646
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,880
Subgenius.com!

647
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,780
Rob at the master moral controls.

648
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,820
Thank heaven for that.

649
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,300
X-Day's a-comin'!

650
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,760
We don't actually sell many CDs,

651
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,400
and it may be because we give away so much of the truth on the internet.

652
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,780
You can download the Subgenius Hour of Slack weekly show.

653
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,400
In fact, that's probably what you did to hear this.

654
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,500
Time to think about it.

655
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,720
Yes.

656
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,220
You can download the Puzzling Evidence show.

657
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,020
You can...

658
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,160
From Berkeley.

659
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,320
You can download the Suzy the Floozy show.

660
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,600
Bob's...

661
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,760
Slacktime Funhouse from WREK.org in Atlanta.

662
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,360
Put Brown as an upgrade.

663
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,560
Remember to thank food donors during your show.

664
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,220
Thank you, food donors.

665
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,300
Thanks for the delicious chips and all of that stuff.

666
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,460
Don't you just thank the UFO people when they come?

667
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,700
I mean, that's all that really matters.

668
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,400
Well, of course, we'll thank them.

669
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,580
Thanks, X's, for not coming.

670
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,860
We'll thank them in a minute.

671
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,820
Thanks, Bob, for not delivering on the end of the world.

672
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,580
Thanks for not killing us.

673
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:08,920
We'll not kill you.

674
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,960
Mr. Dog.

675
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,100
Sounding like Noble Stang is that fisherman in the story of the Thousand Knights

676
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:21,700
and a knight who uncorked a genie who, instead of giving him three wishes for letting go,

677
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:27,080
was going to squash him like a bug because it had taken so long for him to be rescued.

678
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,100
I remember that.

679
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,740
First hundred years, he thought he'd do anything for the guy who got him out.

680
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,300
He'd let him live in perpetual orgasm, you know.

681
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,380
But then the second hundred years would be anything.

682
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,320
Where is that?

683
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,640
Stupid asshole.

684
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,100
When I get out of here, I'm going to make him a demon never more.

685
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:50,040
And finally, he was let out to wreak horrendous vengeance against the poor fisherman.

686
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,880
This is that little flash movie, The End of the World, I told you about.

687
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
No, this is actually a tale of woe.

688
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,300
And in the same way, I...

689
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,180
How did the fisherman trick him, though?

690
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,980
The fisherman tricked him.

691
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,640
Wait, are you saying the End of the World is a tale of woe?

692
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,660
Oh, the fisherman got him to climb back in the bottle and then...

693
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,000
How did he talk him into it?

694
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,480
I mean, what...

695
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,600
By doubting his macho ability.

696
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,660
To alter his molecular structure.

697
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,040
And forcing him to...

698
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,320
Yeah, you're not really that powerful.

699
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,400
Because if you were that powerful, you could crawl back into that bottle.

700
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,700
And so he could.

701
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,120
And then he got corked.

702
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,600
And if you were really that powerful, you could let me cork you in there.

703
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,320
But no, you couldn't do that.

704
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:30,520
And then, immediately, of course, he sees the relative stupidity of wasting his eventual liberty on...

705
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:30,900
There we go.

706
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,720
Now, I'm showing the woman who used to play Genie in my dream, Genie, because it's always a cloud pleaser.

707
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,500
But she didn't...

708
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,740
I don't even have a navel.

709
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,900
You can go to a website and make a cloud.

710
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,620
It was illegal for women to then...

711
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,420
You can go to a website and make a cloud if you want.

712
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,540
All right, now I'm showing Bewitched.

713
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,840
But they got married, right?

714
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,320
Colonel Nelson and the...

715
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:51,840
I think they did.

716
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,240
And the host...

717
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,820
The F-Reed.

718
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,560
The air just came out of the show.

719
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,460
Cloudhouse Roundup.

720
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,840
But they went to heaven as a happily married couple.

721
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,940
And Genie was a Christian.

722
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:00,540
Heaven?

723
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,380
Oh, no.

724
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:01,860
Yeah?

725
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,820
You can't see me?

726
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,480
I can't see you.

727
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,360
That doesn't belong in this movie.

728
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,780
It's that light.

729
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,600
Oh, I see you.

730
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,580
Yeah, I see you move.

731
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,480
I see where you are.

732
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,340
Go toward the light.

733
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,020
Is this what's going on, man?

734
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,960
It's all dark here in this subspace thing.

735
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,340
Go toward the light.

736
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:22,060
For puzzling evidence, you'll be interested to know that one X-Day Morn, when the rest

737
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:26,920
of us were up at Brushwood, some subgenius in Dallas went to Dealey Plaza.

738
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:32,700
It was in the late 90s, July 5th, at 7 a.m.

739
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,840
And there was a nude woman.

740
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,420
She was frolicking around on the grassy knoll area.

741
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:41,720
That's what I'm talking about.

742
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,180
Very briefly.

743
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,500
They even got a photograph of her.

744
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,860
They were just three nerds.

745
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,880
It was X-Day.

746
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,340
Let's go to Dealey Plaza.

747
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,980
Oh, my God.

748
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,440
There's a sex goddess running around over there.

749
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,800
Maybe this is X-Day.

750
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,480
Yeah.

751
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,600
So they followed her to the ship, I know.

752
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,280
That's the kind of thing you see in Los Angeles at dawn all the time.

753
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,600
The last time I was there.

754
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,460
That's what I saw.

755
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,860
Several naked women stumbling around the streets.

756
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,860
Well, little callers, I don't know if you understand that if a bomb dropped on Berkeley

757
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,420
right now, the top of the subgenius church would just disappear.

758
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,460
And finally, it would start making some money.

759
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,440
Okay, here's the money raining down from the sky.

760
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,700
This is space money.

761
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,480
Look how pretty it is.

762
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
Oh, sorry.

763
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,200
See it twinkle and sparkle?

764
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,580
More, more, more.

765
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,000
Toxic to handle.

766
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,980
Never, never.

767
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,660
I can't hold my money.

768
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,180
Enough.

769
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,580
It'll burn right through.

770
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,100
Ow!

771
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,480
The ultimate X-Day nightmare.

772
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:48,340
The tribulation money rains from the sky and it's made of acid that burns through your skin.

773
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,580
Or a spaceship.

774
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,620
People are so desperate that they grab it anyway.

775
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,600
I go down, I get laid, I drink a beer, and then it burns through my hand.

776
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:00,880
There you go.

777
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,380
Take a drop.

778
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,080
Get that dope.

779
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,140
Let's go down here to the subgenius bar.

780
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:05,760
You can call.

781
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,060
I'm gonna go get my beer.

782
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,780
Five minutes ago.

783
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,440
I don't see what that is.

784
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,560
It's a dueling recording device.

785
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,400
Try this on your piano.

786
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,160
I just reversed that phone number.

787
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,380
You reversed the charge?

788
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,900
You want to know what the number really is?

789
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,660
There you go.

790
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,320
Sounds like a bunch of malarkey to me.

791
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,960
Oh, that was a good show.

792
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,980
Camp Malarkey is right over there.

793
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Whatever happened to Malarkey's show?

794
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,320
Is he still on the air here?

795
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,780
I think he's on the air.

796
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:37,760
I think he's on the air.

797
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,060
The bunch of malarkey show?

798
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,280
No, I think you took over that slot.

799
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,780
Yeah, I've been a long time since those...

800
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,620
The country of Kroistan.

801
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:48,820
Conan!

802
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,780
What is best in life?

803
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,400
To crush your enemies, see them driven before you,

804
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,560
and to hear the lamentation of the women.

805
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,620
That is it.

806
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,800
At X-Day, of course, we have symbolic auctions

807
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,500
where we enact this ritual among ourselves.

808
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,160
The...

809
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,020
inner subgeniuses.

810
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,940
But that is an overt form of the ordinary progress of sales

811
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,140
which has to be made

812
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,820
as part of the existing subgenius journey.

813
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:23,600
There are actual flesh auctions at X-Day.

814
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,060
Yes.

815
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,340
And auctions of all kinds of bulldada,

816
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,120
kitsch...

817
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,620
Great stuff.

818
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,180
Yeah.

819
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,580
Complete Jack Chick comic collections.

820
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,440
By the way, did you all know that there is a book

821
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,900
about Jack Chick comics?

822
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,940
By Kurt Kirsteiner.

823
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:46,320
Right.

824
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,700
By subgenius...

825
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,220
Nazi subgenius.

826
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,340
And Papa Joe Mama.

827
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,100
Yes.

828
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,420
They infiltrated Jack Chick's headquarters,

829
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,180
got to know Jack Chick himself.

830
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,400
They went to the war room where the comics are created.

831
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:00,960
Where is that?

832
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,180
In Chino, California.

833
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:04,320
Uh...

834
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,680
And in fact, Jack Chick promised our friends

835
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,700
that he would get around to doing an anti-subgenius pamphlet

836
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:20,380
as soon as he finishes his huge life work that he's still on.

837
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,860
He's like 90 years old.

838
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,060
What's the work he's working on?

839
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,640
Paintings illustrating the Bible.

840
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,660
He had a movie that they were working on

841
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,440
which is essentially kinesthesis

842
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,160
but it had to do with huge paintings created by

843
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:34,480
the...

844
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,220
good artist who works at Chick things

845
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,320
who's a black guy.

846
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,440
I forget his name.

847
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,120
Oh, Fred Carter.

848
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,460
That's his name.

849
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,620
He's made these giant paintings of Eve

850
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,420
in the Garden of Eden and so on.

851
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,720
Then they've photographed them and done kinesthesis

852
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,180
and they have a movie that's ready to come out

853
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,060
or maybe it is out

854
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,220
among the devotees of Jack Chick.

855
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:57,980
Oh, it is out.

856
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,680
Yeah, and you can find information about this great Jack Chick book

857
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,880
which, by the way...

858
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,040
It's called...

859
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,540
It cut...

860
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,660
The Unofficial Jack T. Chick.

861
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:12,220
That's available from monsterwax.com

862
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,720
I believe.

863
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,860
Monsterwax, yes.

864
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,300
Yeah.

865
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,060
I think if you do a...

866
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,380
just a search on the one word monsterwax

867
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,260
you would certainly immediately get there.

868
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,500
Like candle wax

869
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,920
but it's monster...

870
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,560
But with monsters.

871
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:29,580
Monsterwax.

872
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,540
Well, Dr. Hal, I can't wait to...

873
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,840
bring you into X-Day this next year

874
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,300
on those plane flights we always get you

875
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,460
that hover around Philadelphia for 10 hours.

876
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,160
Those plane and...

877
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,460
Yeah, Dr. Hal writes great songs

878
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,520
when he's stuck in airports

879
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,860
and hovering in planes for hours and days.

880
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:51,640
Tis so.

881
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,600
I've got to get them all recorded or noted or something or other.

882
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,700
My problem is we've got to convince Governor Rocknar

883
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,240
to pay your way to X-Day and Amsterdam every year.

884
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,520
Going back to Amsterdam?

885
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,740
Oh, he's already planned that.

886
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,900
How about you?

887
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,680
I can't plan that sort of thing.

888
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,020
It can't be an annual plan?

889
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,420
I want...

890
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:13,700
Milo's going.

891
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,980
On my epitaph.

892
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,160
Here lies an atheist

893
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,480
all dressed up and no place to go.

894
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,860
That's an old chestnut.

895
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,380
How about this one?

896
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,780
Remember, man, as you walk by

897
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,720
as you are now, so once was I

898
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,460
as I am now, so shall you be.

899
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,520
Remember this and follow me.

900
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,880
And on the one...

901
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,020
And on this grave, you then may be.

902
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,980
On the tombstone next to it, it says,

903
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,780
to follow you I'll not consent

904
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,020
until I know which way you went.

905
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,260
Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

906
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,620
Those clever Englishters.

907
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,040
So now that the writer's strike is on,

908
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,040
you guys do the show by just queuing up pages on the internet

909
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,180
full of funny quotes?

910
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:01,720
Yeah.

911
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,520
What did you do? Google funny quotes?

912
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:03,520


913
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,920
Funny tombstone quotes?

914
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,160
Funny epitaph.

915
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,520
Oh, that's right. Epitaph. That's the word.

916
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,320
Um, well, are you planning anything extra special for X-Day this year?

917
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,120
Yes, the world will be destroyed by the saved.

918
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,340
Really? This time?

919
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,440
Uh, well, some July 5th that's going to happen.

920
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,060
Maybe this is 1998.

921
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,580
That's right.

922
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,140
Maybe tomorrow is July 5th, 1998.

923
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,360
Are you ready?

924
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,000
Let's hope that.

925
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,140
That's the big question, of course.

926
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:43,180
Hey, Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along?

927
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,700
I won't do anything wrong.

928
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:53,400
Hey, Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along for a ride?

929
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,960
Oh, yeah.

930
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:18,560
My name is Chaz, and I'm broadcasting you tonight from my little holding cell here.

931
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:26,900
All quarantined, all strapped in my suit, pressure suits all pressured up.

932
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,960
Yeah.

933
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,080
And, uh, it's here.

934
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:39,320
The ship is waiting, hissing away, spewing out its little steam.

935
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,140
Waiting for the moment.

936
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,180
The final countdown.

937
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,760
And that's where we're at.

938
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:53,600
Just hours away from the final hour.

939
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,980
The final minute.

940
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,640
The final second.

941
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,340
X day.

942
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,740
Thought it'd never get here.

943
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,860
It's kind of late now.

944
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,520
We're there.

945
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,480
There's nothing else to do.

946
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:25,360
Just sit, look out the window, and wait for the light.

947
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,280
Is your pleasure ship hovering above?

948
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,240
Waiting for the final hours to pass?

949
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,340
Is your alien sex goddess waiting for the last minute?

950
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:55,340


951
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:01,620
Waiting for you somewhere in Eurasia Blue.

952
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,140
Mind.

953
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:08,840
We'll see you.

954
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,480
Goodbye, Mom.

955
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,600
Goodbye, Dad.

956
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,920
I gotta go into space.

957
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,620
One, two.

958
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,640
Hey, Blinko.

959
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:33,620
Um, Chaz and I have been planning our, which reruns we're gonna, we're gonna run since there's only another, like, week of broadcasting left on the planet.

960
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,380
Oh, God.

961
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,980
Yeah, I've done 638 hours in the past.

962
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,340
Down to a few hours now.

963
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,640
And we're gonna start rerunning number one.

964
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,800
I mean, for what radio stations are left.

965
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,560
Right.

966
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,920
And, uh, what were you plan, thinking of doing, Chaz?

967
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,580
Are you just gonna run reruns?

968
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,860
Or, like, what's your first show after the...

969
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,620
After you leave?

970
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,360
Well, I was plan... I, I...

971
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,180
Or is there, are you just gonna blow it off?

972
00:49:59,420 --> 00:49:59,980
No, no, no.

973
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,500
No, no, no, no, no, no.

974
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,060
No, no, no.

975
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:09,280
I was under some understanding that they were gonna install some black, black box, black box, black box in the studio here.

976
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,900
Uh, I don't know what the technology of this really is.

977
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,960
You know, like I say, I don't understand how a lot of this is gonna, you know, take place.

978
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I don't understand how a lot of this happens.

979
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,120
I just know that it won't fail because of me.

980
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:25,940
.

981
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,580
We all are in this together as a team effort.

982
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:33,820
We're gonna make it work.

983
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,000
And I don't know how to make it work.

984
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,740
I don't know how to do most of this mission.

985
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,220
But I do know that I can assure you that my piece of it is gonna work.

986
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,940
And it won't fail because of me.

987
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:46,780
.

988
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,480
Hello, world.

989
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,400
Hello, world.

990
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,260
.

991
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,620
Chaz here.

992
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,100
.

993
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:53,600
.

994
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:00,860
ESO Radio broadcasting live from the Pleasure Ships.

995
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:01,680
.

996
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,920
Oh, yeah.

997
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,200
.

998
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,400
Where you gonna go?

999
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,020
.

1000
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,160
Where you gonna go?

1001
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:13,960
.

1002
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,100
When the sex goddesses come for you.

1003
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:20,760
.

1004
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,700
.

1005
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:31,700
Ball.

1006
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,340
Ball.

1007
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,720
And it's so beautiful from out here.

1008
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:50,880
It's so pretty.

1009
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,140
The earth, it's just that little blue and white little marble hanging there.

1010
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,980
Gosh, that's where it all began.

1011
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,480
We'll see you.

1012
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:02,540
Goodbye.

1013
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,620
Prepare yourself.

1014
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,120
You know it's a must.

1015
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,000
You've got to have a friend in Jesus.

1016
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,200
Friend in Bob.

1017
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,400
So you know that when you die.

1018
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:17,680
Bob will recommend you to the spirit in the sky.

1019
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:20,860
Swap.

1020
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,740
On radio.

1021
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:22,640
Radio.

1022
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:23,260
Radio.

1023
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,340
Failure is not an option.

1024
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:44,360
I've been going further and further backwards in my career as I get better at what I do.

1025
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:50,460
Well, at least you got better and were able to get as far as major market broadcast radio.

1026
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,580
You have a good sign of success.

1027
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,160
I'm not a great singer.

1028
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:53,160


1029
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:53,160


1030
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:53,160


1031
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:53,160


1032
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:53,160


1033
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:53,160


1034
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:59,340
I would say major disappointment might be the word used, but he is regressing enough to grow an awful lot of body hair.

1035
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,020
I mean, I don't know if his voice is getting higher because of the operation.

1036
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,760
There was major disappointment and there was General Electric.

1037
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:06,680
Oh, there.

1038
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,440
I thought you were going to refer to the guys erection again.

1039
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,820
And then there was that girl, Bob.

1040
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:11,460
Bob.

1041
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,180
Just like a penguin in bondage, boy.

1042
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,400
I know.

1043
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,440
On X-Day, Negi will return.

1044
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:20,860
I'll be right back.

1045

00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:08,560
so uh

1062
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,380
That was from the conspiracy year 1998.

1063
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,100
Con version, anyway.

1064
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,940
Obviously not the real X-Day.

1065
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:22,540
The background music, what you're hearing now, is by the Rudy Schwartz Project.

1066
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,220
This has been Hour of Slack, number 1150.

1067
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,860
Praise Bob, and praise K-Rob.

1068
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:38,520
And now, friends, let us go back to the end of the end of 2007's Season in Hell.

1069
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,840
What's your game, Bob?

1070
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,120
Next week, I'm actually having chiropractors on.

1071
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,220
And they're all going to adjust me.

1072
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,060
They'll give you a hands-on...

1073
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:17,300
Well, you better have a couple of body mics so they can hear that cracking of the spars and timbers.

1074
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,000
That's the idea.

1075
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,680
Ship at sea in a storm.

1076
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,840
Get some contact mics going in. I think that'd be a great idea.

1077
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,920
You have to follow that up with acupuncturists.

1078
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:26,900
Yes, yes.

1079
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,960
There you have the sound effect of the whistle of escaping...

1080
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:30,840
Beats.

1081
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:31,440
Gas.

1082
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,620
Essence, as the tiny needles...

1083
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,020
What a sensation.

1084
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,000
You'd have to have a pretty sensitive mic for that, wouldn't you?

1085
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,840
Oh, it's a special effect.

1086
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:40,380
Yeah.

1087
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,400
Just to pipe in the sound effect.

1088
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,620
Last X-Day, remember, we were doing radio from on stage outdoors at this campground.

1089
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:54,060
A spider suddenly was crawling across Dr. Howell's microphone.

1090
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,080
Yes.

1091
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:00,420
And we were able to turn it up enough that you could hear his tiny footsteps across the...

1092
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:00,840
Ooh.

1093
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:01,660
Fascinating.

1094
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,240
Those mics are sensitive.

1095
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,480
And it was an exceptionally large and clumsy spider.

1096
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,520
A club-footed thing.

1097
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,940
Our final minutes.

1098
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:13,720
Oh, no.

1099
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:14,460
Thank you.

1100
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:17,320
Spiders on microphones here at Pirate Cat Radio.

1101
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,920
We're harmed during the making of this radio motion picture.

1102
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,900
I'd like to thank Reverend Ivan Stang for coming in this evening.

1103
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,920
Say thank you, Stang.

1104
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,980
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

1105
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:34,100
Dr. Howell for coming down on a night off.

1106
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:34,700
You're too kind.

1107
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:41,020
Lloyd Mongoloid for stepping in two weeks in a row after a very, very busy show on Saturday nights.

1108
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,560
I'm going to be here every week.

1109
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:43,960
Perfect.

1110
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,720
I didn't explain that to you.

1111
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:48,280
We'll make sure you get adjusted as well next week.

1112
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,800
Puzzling evidence documenting the entire evening.

1113
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,580
K-Rob on the aural stimulants.

1114
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:00,760
Oh, my God.

1115
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:04,880
About two more minutes before they literally force us off the air.

1116
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:12,780
Well, I hope the subgenius presentation you've heard tonight hasn't been confusing or off-putting.

1117
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:19,700
Remember, we're always trying to improve our presentation for you and your comfort.

1118
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,560
What do you see in the upcoming year for the church?

1119
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:30,060
Well, various hagiographical contributions, canonizations.

1120
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:31,640
We're looking forward to that.

1121
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:31,640


1122
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:31,640


1123
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:31,640


1124
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,840
Ascension to higher planes of being and feeling.

1125
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:39,060
And, of course, money flowing in like a tidal wave.

1126
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,880
You think this X-Day might be the X-Day?

1127
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,300
Well, we always feel that.

1128
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:48,760
Playing at X-Day?

1129
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,120
Ooh.

1130
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,740
You got 30 seconds to answer.

1131
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:52,960
Go.

1132
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:53,520
Yeah.

1133
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,200
Well, I guess it'll be the last show.

1134
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,020
Last show.

1135
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:57,800
You'll have to wait.

1136
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:58,960
Show on Planet Earth.

1137
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,640
We'll be there to greet the sex guys.

1138
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,260
Thanks for tuning in, ladies and gentlemen.

1139
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,620
A season hell with John Hell.

1140
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,360
See you next week.

1141
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,520
Reverend Ivan Stank, Dr. Hell, Lloyd Monga, Lloyd, puzzling evidence, K-Rob.

1142
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,420
Thanks, K-Rob.

1143
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:16,920
Thanks, K-Rob.

1144
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:24,460
Sometimes in the night when it does get a little lonely, I reach over and touch it.

1145
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,300
Then it doesn't seem so lonely anymore.
