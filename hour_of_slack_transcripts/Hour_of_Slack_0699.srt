00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:14,880
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,300
Ah, yes dear friends, and let's get right into it.

3
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:28,860
Because, you know, there's only 307 days left until Trace Eki's XXX Day, Triple X Day, friends.

4
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:34,280
I can't wait until Bob Royally screws us on that day.

5
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,080
And you're listening to Hour of Slack number 699.

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,160
That sounds like kind of a holy number, doesn't it? 699.

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,640
It's almost Bob's number.

8
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:58,100
And last week I had to run a re-run because I was so busy working on this project,

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,640
which...

10
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,660
I just finished last night, and I'm gonna...

11
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:10,680
Well, I edited the Dos Ekes XXX Day 99 videotapes, of which there were a lot.

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,580
And it's sort of intense.

13
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,400
And, of course, since this is a soundtrack for a videotape,

14
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,100
some of it, you know, you have to have been there with your eyes.

15
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,740
And I'll skip over those parts.

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,960
But mostly this show will be a compressed version of...

17
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,660
a good-for-audio bit...

18
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:37,860
of the gigantic weekend that we, the subgeniuses, spent awaiting the saucers,

19
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,120
who apparently didn't show up this time.

20
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,460
And I may drop in and narrate things.

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,840
Like, for instance, when we get to the nude, blood-bodily, fluid wrestling scenes,

22
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,680
there's some real funny narration with that,

23
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,540
but you'll just have to leave the images up to your imagination.

24
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,480
And I'm sure...

25
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,380
that...

26
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,720
that would probably be a big improvement.

27
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,660
Before we go into that, though, I have to brag about something

28
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,860
that I just found out about this morning.

29
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,600
Time.com, the web version of Time Magazine,

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,260
is conducting these polls for the man of the century, best idea of the century, worst idea.

31
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,840
And one of them is frauds and phonies.

32
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,440
And, uh...

33
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,840
And, friends, Bob Dobbs was narrated, I think, by Paul...

34
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:28,840


35
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,180
Bob Dobbs was nominated for this poll.

36
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,880
And he's number three so far!

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,520
In fact, different people have been ahead of him.

38
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,720
Uh, Dr. Laura and Joseph McCarthy, I think...

39
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,400
No, Linda Tripp and Geraldo Rivera are ahead of Bob right now.

40
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,620
Bob is number three.

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:58,760
Earlier to... or last week, O.J. Simpson and Kenneth Starr were in the number one and number two places.

42
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,760
But Bob is still number three.

43
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,200
And, friends, it may be that...

44
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,880
that, uh, we'll make Time Magazine before the end of the century, like Bob predicted.

45
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,140
Anyway, on their website, it says this about the phonies and frauds poll.

46
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,560
Over the last 100 years, in the midst of all the wonders of progress,

47
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,040
there grew a thing called hype.

48
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,620
Hype swirls and obfuscates, both hiding the truth and creating the lie.

49
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,140
It can be as harmless as the latest pop star saturation,

50
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,860
and as insidious as a two-faced government official.

51
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,740
In recognition of this phenomenon,

52
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,640
Time.com has built a list based on nominations from its web users

53
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,700
of individuals who are candidates for the title of the century's worst

54
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:52,700
scammer, con artist, media manipulator, grifter, liar, or charlatan.

55
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,600
This list originally included a number of religiously-fraudful,

56
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:57,780
and, uh, religiously-fraudful, leaders.

57
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,660
And get... look at this.

58
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,900
Look at the way they chicken out.

59
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,960
They left Bob Dobbs.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,440
He's the only religious leader on here.

61
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,400
But we are convinced by protests from offended supporters

62
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,720
that their inclusion, no matter how well justified in some cases by their behavior,

63
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,700
might stimulate an attitude of contempt for others' religious beliefs.

64
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,480
And so we remove them, let the voting continue.

65
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,240
Well, obviously, friends, you know,

66
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,360
there are some liars that anybody would think of for something like this.

67
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,780
It would be, you know, Jerry Falwell, Jimmy Swagger, Jim Baker.

68
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,200
Oh, but they're Christians.

69
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,100
You can't say anything bad about a Christian religious leader.

70
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,540
Especially if you're Time Magazine,

71
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,900
who seems to find an excuse every month to have Jesus, God, or angels on their cover.

72
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,100
Anyway, friends,

73
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,860
this music in the background is from my friend Ron Slade,

74
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,940
a tape called Entheogenesis Thermosynthesis.

75
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,460
And he plays with ESO every now and then.

76
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,560
He's a Cleveland musician.

77
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,900
And, um, anyway, friends,

78
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:20,220
let us now go directly into these audio tape recordings

79
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,100
from the video soundtrack of the new XX Day video,

80
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,390
which actually is a two-part video,

81
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,150
and I doubt if we'll make it even through the trial of Papa Joe Mama this episode.

82
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,470
But, uh, join me now, won't you?

83
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,010
And, uh, strap on those giant headphones,

84
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,110
put yourself inside that iron lung,

85
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,250
and, uh, go back to fabled Brushwood Campground

86
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,410
with me and, uh, Jesus Christ,

87
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,590
Dr. Legume,

88
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,330
Sister Susie the Floozy,

89
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,330
Irreverent Friday Jones,

90
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,750
G. Gordon Gordon,

91
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,110
Sister Decadence,

92
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,010
Doc Frop,

93
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,750
and so lo- Papa Joe Mama,

94
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,470
uh, and lo- so many, many, many others.

95
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,850
Praise Bob.

96
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,250
Oh, friends, um, I almost forgot,

97
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,090
uh, to give the website address for that time.com thing

98
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,610
where you can vote for Bob.

99
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,090
Um, I believe their web address is simply www.time.com.

100
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,110
And, um, uh, just look for their polls,

101
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,310
their 100s poll.

102
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,270
It's a beautiful, beautiful thing, friends.

103
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,250
Are we gonna let-

104
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,890
Here's some of the other people on their list of frauds and liars.

105
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:45,070
Are we gonna let Oliver North or Ayn Rand beat out Bob Dobbs?

106
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:51,230
Are we gonna let Bob Dobbs be- be- be outvoted by O.J. Simpson and J. Edgar Hoover?

107
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,870
Rush Limbaugh and William Randolph Hearst?

108
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,870
Is Howard Stern gonna get the PR that Bob should have?

109
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,150
Friends?

110
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,230
Or Don King?

111
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,150
Will he be the new Bob?

112
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:06,890
Ugh.

113
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,950
Ah, yes.

114
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,750
But,

115
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,370
if you don't vote,

116
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,770
don't complain.

117
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,210
Oops, one last thing. I was wrong, friends.

118
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,090
It's not time.com.

119
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,850
It's www.pathfinder.com.

120
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,590
That's www.pathfinder.com.

121
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,370
Slash time.

122
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,770
So, um, have at it.

123
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:34,930
And action.

124
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,670
Greetings, Alt-slack village.

125
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,390
You can come out of your tents now.

126
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,290
This is what we call the woods.

127
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,070
They are only trees.

128
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,030
There is no internet here.

129
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,270
Ah, ah, ah.

130
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,610
Welcome to XX Day 1999.

131
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,250
The world ends July 5th, 7 a.m. as always.

132
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,410
90.1 on your FM dial.

133
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,170
We put the...

134
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,650
B into Bob.

135
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,810
We put the B into Bob, whatever that means.

136
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,190
We put the O into Bob.

137
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,610
Stay tuned to this radio station for...

138
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,830
My chariot awaits.

139
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,010
...up to the minute, ground to the ground.

140
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,770
...downbreaking important information,

141
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,950
such as a black truck pulling up.

142
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,270
I should cut in here, friends, and explain that at the X-Day gatherings,

143
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,770
we have, for the last three years now,

144
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:38,510
we've had two pirate radio stations broadcasting from the campground

145
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:45,110
so that campers could listen to subgenius-oriented music or whatnot

146
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,050
whenever there wasn't anything else going on.

147
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,950
Or they could get on the station,

148
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,510
which these stations are in, like, tents,

149
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,590
and one of them is in the back of a station wagon,

150
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,310
and be DJs for a while.

151
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,170
And, oh, it's...

152
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,390
You see, we're a very democratic sort of a mind-control cult.

153
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,550
We'll let everybody be L. Ron Hubbard for 15 minutes.

154
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,890
Are you listening to 91.1 FM?

155
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,430
90.1 FM?

156
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,830
Well, you just won some fabulous prizes.

157
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,110
Come on over. Come on over to the truck.

158
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:23,490
You...

159
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,050
Yes.

160
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,650
Have a date with Jayner?

161
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,230
The Bob Nightlight.

162
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,070
Bob stuff for the whole family.

163
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,150
If you have a Bob need, we can fill it.

164
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,330
Again and again and again.

165
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,150
And again and again.

166
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,270
And, dear friends, as usual, of course, on any campout,

167
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,410
we get rained out.

168
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,230
Every X-Day, we have thunderstorms.

169
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,030
And so we had to hide in our trailers.

170
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,170
Gust of wind.

171
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,230
Tomorrow, thunderstorms.

172
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,010
The next day, thunderstorms.

173
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,330
We actually had tornadoes.

174
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,730
Do they generally hold you responsible for the weather around here?

175
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,190
Yes, yeah, they do.

176
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,210
It has nothing at all to do with the weather.

177
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,370
Well...

178
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,670
That's what he gets for calling himself Jesus.

179
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,710
Look at that American flag out there getting soaked.

180
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,010
We must save it!

181
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,510
Well, you're supposed...

182
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,110
Then we're gonna have to burn it now, man.

183
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,010
Private Ryan!

184
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,050
Now we'll have to make it roll on it and then burn it.

185
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,650
Of course, which is exactly what we did.

186
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,050
Are they causing assholes like staying there?

187
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:20,410
They're everywhere.

188
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,530
Oh, hi!

189
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,730
Hi, Ivan.

190
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,290
How are...

191
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,210
I'm not a pure subgenius, I fear.

192
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,770
It's a particular clinch of my own.

193
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,990
Would you dare to have some other short derp or stab besides Bob?

194
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,530
I'm telling you the truth.

195
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,650
We're going to blow you down.

196
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,550
I've been pouring my own tensions into it.

197
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,270
If this was Monday, you'd be dead.

198
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,830
Yes, you would have slept through X day, but it's not.

199
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,970
I'm here to tell you registration has begun.

200
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,770
You must register.

201
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:18,870
If you came in last night and signed in but did not pay your camping fee, you must do

202
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,690
so today.

203
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:29,690
If you do not have the subgenius electro-stimulo wristband, you must get it today.

204
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:35,810
Anyone without the red wristband will be shot.

205
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,470
Welcome to registration.

206
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,650
Look what I did to this guy.

207
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,970
X day.

208
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,790
Whoa!

209
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:43,370
Yeah.

210
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,430
Is that where that came from?

211
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,370
He's got a huge scar on his chest in the form of an X.

212
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:48,530
He's got a huge scar on his chest in the form of an X.

213
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:48,790
He's got a huge scar on his chest in the form of an X.

214
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,330
Oh, I'm going to be up in about three seconds.

215
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,210
It's the American high.

216
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,770
We will be ready this time.

217
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:01,750
We will be up and alert and not hung over at 7 o'clock in the morning.

218
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,990
We will stay up all night.

219
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,530
Think about the ones that would have been ruptured with that hangover.

220
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,850
The hangover they had last year.

221
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,150
Even if you're not ruptured, it'll feel like it.

222
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:12,590
Yeah.

223
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,750
I felt like I had a hangover.

224
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,050
You mean we weren't ruptured?

225
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,130
That was a hangover?

226
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:17,910
Yeah.

227
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,670
I mean, I'm not saying that we weren't ruptured.

228
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:18,730
I'm just saying that we were.

229
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:18,770
I'm just saying that we were.

230
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:18,770


231
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:18,770


232
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:18,770


233
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:18,770


234
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,910
değer häufig.

235
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:43,410
To make this reality, such a passa.

236
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:43,430
He took off the coat, rolled into the big pad.

237
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,430


238
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,430


239
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,430


240
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,830
Oh, we'd better take him off.

241
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:44,870
He'll be a fighter.

242
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,870


243
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:45,530
Pass the camera.

244
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,310
I'm going to take him off.

245
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,150
This follower took him from there and rode into the sink and looked down at the beloved

246
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,150


247
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,150


248
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,150


249
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,370
To drop off Haze to the ground and talk to us on these next enorme distance Ebola

250
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:47,670
infections, you just got erase.

251
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,670


252
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,670


253
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,670


254
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,670


255
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,670


256
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,790
We here.

257
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,610
Then he went to get time off.

258
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:48,770
Then he went after Cat

259
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,310
Smoke the brown poison ivy.

260
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,690
The green stuff is fine.

261
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,510
It should do the same thing it always does.

262
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,670
Makes your lungs bubble.

263
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,570
It's natural.

264
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,670
You know, it's our .

265
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,170
Man made alcohol.

266
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,930
God made poison ivy.

267
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:08,750
Who do you trust?

268
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,530
As Suzie the bluesy coined last year, if you believe,

269
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,810
you can leave.

270
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,950
Well, friends, I guess I'll skip over this section where they're

271
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,170
testing these elaborate potato cannons.

272
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,190
Dr. Lagume and Ed Strange and various other folks

273
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:34,130
have traditionally brought these homemade weapons to X Day Drills.

274
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,250
And these things look like Civil War cannons.

275
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,350
Great big, huge, barreled things with wheels on them.

276
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,130
You had to tow them behind a car.

277
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,330
And they shoot potatoes at other subgeniuses.

278
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,190
Well, actually, you want the I screw Lachnar.

279
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,190
Yeah.

280
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,030
Because that helps establish you as a sex god.

281
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,370
It's really worked for, well, I don't know if it has worked for

282
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,310
Pastor Craig, but everybody wants the button.

283
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:00,910
I know that.

284
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,470
I screw Lachnar and hearted it.

285
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,450
I did screw Pastor Craig, technically.

286
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,230
You got to keep up with this guy.

287
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,090
Lachnar donated $1,000 in cash last night.

288
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,230
Boy, did that brighten up the weekend of Jesus and me.

289
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,270
It ended the rain.

290
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,510
Donated $1,000?

291
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,810
He handed me $1,000 in cash that he had earned working for the conspiracy.

292
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:29,110
Plus a whole series of numerologically pertinent other dollars.

293
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,170
And 30 pieces of silver.

294
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,250
There's my 250 from last year.

295
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,230
Instead of that asshole Lachnar, now he's that cool, super cool dude Lachnar.

296
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:45,130
Tonight we'll be picking two fluids from our jugs of fluid which have been preserved over the last year.

297
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,130
What fluids will you be using tonight?

298
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,630
Uh. Well.

299
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,290
Today I think we ought to use blood.

300
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:50,810
Use blood.

301
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,070
The traditional blood.

302
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,450
And it's up to the audience.

303
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:58,950
Shall we use the greenish hue for the white spot?

304
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,170
Spot!

305
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:00,810
Spot!

306
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,390
Spot!

307
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,030
Spot!

308
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,210
Spot!

309
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:02,530
Spot!

310
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:02,810
Spot!

311
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:02,850


312
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:03,070


313
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:03,210


314
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:03,470


315
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:03,570


316
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:03,570


317
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:03,570


318
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:03,570


319
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:03,570


320
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:03,570


321
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:03,570


322
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,790
Spot!

323
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,230
That's the, uh, submission or pain and fall.

324
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,710
That's the three count.

325
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:09,930
And there are your rules.

326
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:10,830
Awesome, man.

327
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,450
Woo!

328
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,390
This is just no holes barred.

329
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,470
As we always say.

330
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,450
And, uh, now, friends, the wrestling begins.

331
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:25,990
Subgenius, uh, body fluid wrestling, which mostly is done by naked subgenius.

332
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,690
He's been a hard on Papa Joe Mama.

333
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:34,770
So, if he's willing to step forward right now and wrestle me, I'm willing to settle it in the ring so he will not have a chance.

334
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:42,070
have that painful trial and, you know, charging him with guilt and the long, drawn-out punishment.

335
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:47,250
We can just finish it right here and now, unless, of course, he's too much of a pussy to come forward.

336
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,510
Hello? Papa Joe?

337
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,150
Is that insulting towards pussies?

338
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,030
Yeah. Unless he was too much of a human to come forward.

339
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:04,130
There's a lot of human blood in that Papa Joe. In fact, I think he's a pureblood.

340
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:04,910
No!

341
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:12,170
I think he's a human because no subgenius would refuse to wrestle me.

342
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:19,710
Friday Jones suddenly disrobes, exposing her rather considerable condolence.

343
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,690
I don't see Papa Joe. Of course, I can't see anything.

344
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,430
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

345
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,550
There we go.

346
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,750
Dr. Tillis versus Bard Zippy in the blood match.

347
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,830
Oh, my God!

348
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,250
Look!

349
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,470
Look at this, like, giant slabs of meat slamming into each other.

350
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:38,890
Oh!

351
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,610
Hey, it makes me think of hamburger.

352
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,050
Oh, I want to go to McDonald's after this.

353
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,710
One, two, three!

354
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,450
Yeah!

355
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,030
Oh, man.

356
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,150
He wins!

357
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,450
Ladies and gentlemen, the Normals have fallen!

358
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,550
Bard Zippy, winner and champion.

359
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,690
You subgeniuses.

360
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,970
You can wait till it's on the side for the final bout.

361
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,030
You think you're so smart.

362
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:11,210
Now, our next event, Pastor Craig versus Friday Jones in the pit of calm.

363
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,610
Let the carnage begin.

364
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,950
Ready?

365
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,350
One, two, three, go!

366
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,930
Oh, the crafty Pastor Craig circling like a jungle tiger.

367
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:29,390
Friday Jones looking like Raquel Welch in one million years BC.

368
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,010
The beady eyed Pastor Craig versus Friday Jones.

369
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:32,010


370
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,850
And yet, look at the spunky girl.

371
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,170
Look at that spunky girl.

372
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,410
The fight back.

373
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,370
Oh, well, spunky in so many ways.

374
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:50,370
The beady nippled Friday Jones and the tiny beady brained Pastor Craig.

375
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:56,170
Oh, he's going down on her.

376
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,010
And she's...

377
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,990
But look at the mother of the beast.

378
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:01,990


379
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:01,990


380
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:07,250
The muscles are rippling under that soft, smooth, rounded...

381
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,610
Pastor Craig is falling.

382
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,850
The big round things.

383
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,790
The big round things are on top of him.

384
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,370
Sisterhood is powerful!

385
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:29,130
Now, a new fight starts with Friday Jones and Pastor Craig also fighting with Reverend Angela and Reverend Jim.

386
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:38,470
And some of these people are covered with white fluids and others are covered with red fluids when they mix together.

387
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,110
Of course, you get this lovely pink.

388
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,690
What a hideous metaphor, friends.

389
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,970
A subgenius loser drowning in pink jism.

390
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,050
I hate to think what this says for our future.

391
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,190
What a hideous vision.

392
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:50,970
All right.

393
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,190
They're at the slippery...

394
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,110
It almost resembles some sick, hideous...

395
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,110


396
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,450
...hideous form of alien sex.

397
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,950
I can't believe it.

398
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,010
This should be illegal, friends.

399
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,750
It probably is.

400
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,070
Don't call the fire marshal.

401
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,490
Don't call the ATF.

402
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,690
Don't call Child Protective Services.

403
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,250
This is a subgenius Friday afternoon.

404
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:13,750
Praise Bob.

405
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,490
And to think these people were the ones who were called brains in high school.

406
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,850
Strange to think.

407
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,730
And yet, look at them now.

408
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,790
You may think, Bob, that you were not born like them.

409
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,090
Preach of nature.

410
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:29,090


411
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,890
Oh, my God.

412
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,910
King Kong versus Godzilla.

413
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,750
Look at that fiendish grin on Friday Jones' face like some demon out of hell.

414
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,550
Reflected on Pastor Craig's dome-like top.

415
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,470
And, oh, my God.

416
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:50,710
You can't tell where one of these grappling, grippy, sweaty, bloody bodies ends and the other begins.

417
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,330
Oh, fuck.

418
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,870
Ken, I hate to see a man treated this way.

419
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,950
Look.

420
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,730
They're almost pure pink.

421
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:05,170
When you mix Connie, Allah, and a bunch of damn monkeys, what do you get?

422
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,750
A pink.

423
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,650
He refuses to say, Uncle.

424
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,350
Oh, my God.

425
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,010
Oh, Lord.

426
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,650
Pastor Craig is in the...

427
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,250
It is as if he is in the womb struggling rather than to get out.

428
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,030
Yes, he is struggling to get out.

429
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:27,330
Smeared with hideous bodily fluids, blood, amniotic bile.

430
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,670
Oh, God.

431
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,470
There's actual sex.

432
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:29,470


433
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:29,470


434
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:29,530
Oh, shoo.

435
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,010
Shoulder up.

436
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:38,750
They look like free-hole Laura Rectus trying to figure out sex for the first time.

437
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,970
Is this how Neanderthals discovered oral sex?

438
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,270
Who knows.

439
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,190
We could only speculate.

440
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,450
Will this be like, will hell be like this, friends?

441
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,690
Endless wrestling match that never, never ends.

442
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,470
I hope so.

443
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:00,990
So, we're going to have to take it to the judges to see who won this match.

444
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,730
Yay!

445
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,570
Oh, Master Craig, congratulations.

446
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,910
So, the Rainbow Love Death Match.

447
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,290
Love is important.

448
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,730
The Rainbow Love American Flag Match, where the winner shall get the privilege of burning

449
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,570
the American flag on the Fourth of July.

450
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,010
Ah!

451
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,550
Christ, Bob, God bless America!

452
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:25,710
I'm washing off the pinkness and revealing my true white yettiness.

453
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,710
The albino yeti woman.

454
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,570
Shower scenes.

455
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:38,530
Now we hear a little scene in which Susie the Floozy and Reverend Chris Lee discuss

456
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:45,210
their, what they're going to wear to the subgenius mutant prom the next day.

457
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,010
Bass is cool.

458
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,310
You're going to be such a hot bitch.

459
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:49,770
I am.

460
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,050
I never went to my prom.

461
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,350
It's going to be so cathartic.

462
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,510
I got my corduroy.

463
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:59,010
I got my corduroy, too, so I can have a little corduroy orgy later on.

464
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:04,530
Oh, I'm going to be wearing a dark velvet strapless dress.

465
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:11,530
Have you ever seen a Discordian do anything close to what we have seen here at any one

466
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,950
of the X Day drills or X Day?

467
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,490
Never seen a Discordian who gets laid?

468
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:14,510
Not at all.

469
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,110
I've met old Sam.

470
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,170
There you go.

471
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,510
Have you ever seen a Discordian who gets laid?

472
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:18,950
Yeah.

473
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:24,170
I've met Robert Ed, Anton Wilson, who invented that whole silly Discordian thing just so

474
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:31,030
that he could get laid from all the groupies who are even fatter than we are.

475
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,230
Motormax, the sex god.

476
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,650
Do you have a few words, Motormax, about the Bulldada auction?

477
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,630
Do you want to explain the theory behind it?

478
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,350
It's simple enough.

479
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,790
You come up here on stage.

480
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:48,130
Yes, you do have to come up on stage, you show them the shit that you're going to be

481
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:48,370
selling.

482
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,530
You tell them what it is.

483
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,210
You tell them whether or not you can eat it, whether or not you can have sex with it

484
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:54,930
or anything else.

485
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,390
People come up and they give you money.

486
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,370
Real money, that is.

487
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,690
We don't take any of that Monopoly money stuff.

488
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:02,910
Canadian, maybe.

489
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,610
And then you give the money to us.

490
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,250
And then you give the money to the Subgenius Foundation.

491
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,790
We're pledged.

492
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:15,370
It says inside, $100,000 to Jerry Falwell, this is what you get.

493
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,110
It reads, the old time gospel of the world.

494
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:23,210
The old time gospel hour medal of merit presented in appreciation by Dr. Jerry Falwell and the

495
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,450
old time gospel hour board of directors.

496
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,490
Yeah, you could mount it on a thing on your fireplace.

497
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:33,970
It says, in recognition of outstanding service, Dr. Jerry Falwell, and it may be gold.

498
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:40,690
Someone called them up and pledged $100,000 for that, friends.

499
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,430
Let's start the bidding at $6.66.

500
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,090
Right here, $6.66.

501
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,910
You're out here $8.80.

502
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:48,090
$6.66.

503
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,590
And $7.00 for you.

504
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,630
A thousand pesos Bolivianos.

505
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:58,070
That is the documentation that this is indeed the nosebone of Saint G. Gordon Gordon, the

506
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,010
only dual saint in the history of modern, disorganized religion.

507
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,170
G. Gordon Gordon is the oldest living subgenius.

508
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,450
He's the...

509
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,710
No, sir.

510
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:13,570
He's the only proof we have that we can even make it to that advanced age of almost...

511
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,650
Chris Lee, pass out some more beer amongst the crowd.

512
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,830
We know we're not that old.

513
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,090
We're not that young.

514
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:18,090


515
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,630
we started the bidding on a

516
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:22,010
worst birth Bible that Lagoon touched

517
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,470
and touched by Lagoon.

518
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,290
And the word of wisdom

519
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,710
inside, here it is.

520
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,870
There's a random, the random

521
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,050
Bible saying for today, quote

522
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,990
1 Samuel 16

523
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,970
and when he had brought him

524
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,910
down, behold, they were

525
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,090
spread abroad upon

526
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,650
all the earth, eating

527
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,790
and drinking and dancing

528
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,790
because all of the great spoil

529
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,790
and slack that they had taken out

530
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,510
of the land of the Philistines and out

531
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,330
of the land of Judah. Praise God.

532
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,890
Y'all hear that pointer.

533
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,590
Y'all hear that pointer.

534
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,410
Holy moly.

535
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,930
Number 28 in the greatest

536
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,690
limited edition, time

537
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,890
legend, of Arnold Palmer.

538
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,690
You can rip the head off,

539
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,510
you can launch the head, or you can launch the whole

540
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,090
gossamer.

541
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,390
It ended up turning into a

542
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,770
stand-up comedy routine.

543
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,450
Is it funny?

544
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,530
It's about a half hour

545
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:15,770
long.

546
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,570
I think it's hilarious.

547
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,490
I remember this. It was good.

548
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,490
I think I'll be in on it. We can use it for the hour of slack.

549
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,690
I'll be in $5.

550
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,730
$6. $7.

551
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,870
$5. $4.

552
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,990
$3. You're $2.

553
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,850
$2. I'll take it for

554
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:32,070
free.

555
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,670
It's mine. It's gone.

556
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,510
Jesus Christ wins his own time back.

557
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,130
We saved the church.

558
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:39,770
$6.

559
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,070
$6.

560
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,570
Little Charger being

561
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:45,870
candy.

562
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,010
Charger.

563
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,910
Look closely. This is why it is

564
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,150
bulldada. The candy is the tongue.

565
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,850
To eat it, you open the mouth,

566
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,910
extrude the tongue, and you

567
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,790
make out with it. You make kissing.

568
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,670
My God!

569
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,110
To sell children

570
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,170
on the obvious

571
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,330
alias sexual proclivity.

572
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,610
$3. $3. Right here. $4. $4.

573
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,210
The Charger of Binks. Charger of Binks with working, vibrating

574
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,650
tongue. Right here. $4.

575
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,090
And then, when I took it off, I noticed

576
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,070
that there is a strange manifestation

577
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,890
around the hole in the tire.

578
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,730
It is, in fact,

579
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:19,730
a Dobbs head.

580
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,910
And you can see it. If you just, if you look,

581
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,030
if you smoke enough froth, and you look at it hard enough,

582
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,410
you can see this Dobbs head.

583
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,150
Uh-huh.

584
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,170
So, I'm going to...

585
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,690
Show this Dobbs head to me.

586
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,910
Right here. This is the hole.

587
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,790
Yeah, there's the hole.

588
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,290
And you can see that's the pipe.

589
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,490
And you can see a grin there, and you can see that shape there.

590
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,690
Where's that froth?

591
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,830
No, it's true, friends!

592
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,550
I've never seen it before! It's...

593
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,050
Oh, my God!

594
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,150
You have to look at it. You have to cross your eyes.

595
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:47,650
It's true!

596
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,130
What do I hear for a used tire?

597
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,950
In the middle of Bob's name, right between

598
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,330
those two B's. The sacred tire of Bob.

599
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,450
Do I hear $1 for the sacred tire of Bob?

600
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,130
$0.55.

601
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,310
$0.55. Do I hear $0.60?

602
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,730
Do I hear $0.60 for the sacred tire?

603
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,890
$0.55. It also makes an excellent

604
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,030
seat. You can sit on it while you're,

605
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,190
you know, instead of sitting in the rocks.

606
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,930
You can use it as an extra meditation

607
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:11,590
stool.

608
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,110
What?

609
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,030
$0.55.

610
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,210
$0.55.

611
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,610
$0.55. $0.55.

612
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,710
$0.60. $0.60. $0.60 for the rubber tire of Bob.

613
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,890
$0.55. $0.55 going once.

614
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:21,710
Going twice.

615
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,050
Sold.

616
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,010
And that, friends, concludes

617
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,690
for this moment, the

618
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,590
Bulldada auction. We will be doing this all

619
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,090
weekend long until we die.

620
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,410
Until we leave the planet.

621
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,710
Did I say die again? God,

622
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,870
I'm sorry about that. Until we leave

623
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,950
the planet. No one's gonna die

624
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,950
here. But you will

625
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,250
not be going back home.

626
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,550
See, back in 1979,

627
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,890
there was a small company who

628
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,050
released an initial public offering.

629
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,990
And their

630
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,990
stock was called Salvation.

631
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,970
It was the church of the subgenius.

632
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,810
Initial public offering

633
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,650
sold for $10.

634
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,290
That's right.

635
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,090
That was a lot.

636
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,550
Now it's worth $30.

637
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,030
Friends, that was

638
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,330
a free bag of...

639
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,350
We're leaving behind the conspiracy.

640
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,450
We're leaving behind a world of insanity.

641
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,090
We're leaving behind a world that ever since

642
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,110
Constantius closed the pagan temples down

643
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,930
and gave the property to the Christians has been on

644
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,070
a downward slide. Our western

645
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,030
culture has been corrupted by this pernicious

646
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,610
Jewish heresy which should never have been allowed.

647
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,050
Alright, you know what I'm talking about. Oh, it's, oh, gotta have

648
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,230
that gold. Gotta get the carrot. I gotta get my piece of the pie.

649
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,210
I gotta get my piece of the pie.

650
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,390
Get your piece of the pie. Come on out and get your piece of the pie.

651
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,890
They come out. They want their piece of the pie.

652
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,230
They see it. There it is. Right in the field.

653
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,010
Right illuminated. Big frickin' neon

654
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,670
spotlight. Beaming down on it.

655
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,930
This is the pie. Not a pie. This is the

656
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,050
pie. Come get your piece of it. And they line

657
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,210
up. They line up for miles.

658
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,350
Miles and miles.

659
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,890
Spreading out in all directions. Thousands of them

660
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,650
clawing for their piece. Wanting their piece.

661
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,510
Climbing over each other's bodies.

662
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,430
Tearing at each other. Fighting.

663
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,830
This is what the rat race is. The rat race is a

664
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,870
leavening race. Everyone clawing each other. Destroying

665
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,870
each other. Just trying to get to that pie. The brilliant

666
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,990
illuminated pie that's right in the middle of a

667
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,670
field with other tables on it. Other

668
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,090
tables surrounded with other pastries and eclairs

669
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,750
and cakes and pies and everything.

670
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,950
The pie. The pie is right in the middle.

671
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,850
It's the spotlight above it. It's the pie.

672
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,810
Oh, thank God for that light. That light is shining

673
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,690
right down on that pie so you know that it's that pie.

674
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,510
That's what they're going for. I mean,

675
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,090
all these other tables out here have untouched

676
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,250
cakes, untouched danishes and eclairs.

677
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:30,990
Just free for the

678
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,190
taking that anyone could have. But,

679
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,910
but, can't count those.

680
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,730
Gotta go for the pie.

681
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,190
I found sometimes if you voice

682
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,010
the actual thoughts that are coming in your head, you tend to

683
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,090
scare people. When people start to

684
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,050
realize that you don't think like they do, they tend to get a little bit scared.

685
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,950
They tend to get a little bit afraid. When people start to see the

686
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,930
eyes rolling around, looking

687
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,990
around at the world that they don't see, they start

688
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,830
to get a little scary. Why?

689
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,050
I'm not crazy.

690
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,290
I can just see what's going on.

691
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,110
I see what they don't. I see the things

692
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,050
they don't. I see the interactions as webs.

693
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,710
I see the lies

694
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,870
boiling out of them. I see the honesty

695
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,910
cutting through that and hurting them at their soul, but

696
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,710
they can't see it.

697
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,430
I'm not crazy.

698
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,170
Just honest.

699
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,330
Crazy.

700
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,150
Oh, yes dear friends, that was

701
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,230
P. Kitty. Reverend P. Kitty.

702
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:22,870
Wonderful little

703
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,790
pie rant there.

704
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,070
That's edited

705
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,510
down some. Part of the

706
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,970
XX Day 1999

707
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,930
video. Before

708
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,970
P. Kitty, we heard a little bit of Reverend

709
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,910
Harold O'Keefe. Before

710
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,710
him, we heard a little bit of Pastor Craig.

711
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,250
And we heard Reverend Moxie

712
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,670
auctioning that tire.

713
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,850
And Jesus, of course,

714
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,170
and myself and

715
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,650
Motomac, I think, running that whole auction.

716
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:49,750
And friends,

717
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,830
we'll be back into those

718
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,810
recordings on

719
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,410
side two of the party. Thank you.

720
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,410
What I'm getting at,

721
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,350
last year,

722
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,910
on the way home from

723
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,770
X Day, I actually had a

724
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,890
UFO sighting.

725
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,870
Honest to God, I was riding

726
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,550
it was July 6th,

727
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:11,210
1998.

728
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,870
I was riding on the Amtrak train westbound

729
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,430
to Chicago,

730
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:17,950
out of Erie, and

731
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,830
saw a cigar shaped object

732
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,750
in the sky.

733
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,890
From my point of view, if I hold

734
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,690
this thing out at arm's length,

735
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,630
that's how big it looked.

736
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,610
At first, I thought it was a passenger

737
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,510
airliner that was about to crash.

738
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,770
It lost its rudder, lost its power.

739
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,750
It had no markings, had no

740
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,290
windows. As I studied it further,

741
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,830
I thought, my God, I'm going to be an FAA witness

742
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,910
called into Washington or something.

743
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,070
And, um,

744
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,230
the nose end

745
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,830
of the craft didn't lift.

746
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,310
Then it did an

747
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,070
axis shift in the sky and it shot out

748
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,810
faster than any other moving object

749
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:57,950
I've ever seen in my life.

750
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,830
This thing had the

751
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,090
maneuverability of a

752
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,310
aircraft and could outspeed an F-15.

753
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,830
This is, my God,

754
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,110
I cannot, I'm just going to

755
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,630
say it once, this is a true story.

756
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:14,990
We hear you.

757
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,750
I spent

758
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,130
the next six months

759
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,030
in a really bad

760
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,110
funk over this one,

761
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,590
this sighting.

762
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,230
And, um,

763
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,050
when I was alone,

764
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,450
my God, I cried

765
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,170
out of

766
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,730
anger and fear

767
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,050
and various other emotions.

768
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,450
But I managed to settle

769
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,470
about 85% of all of that

770
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,330
using a copy of

771
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,330
the book The Subgenius.

772
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,510
But I decided to

773
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,390
handle that problem, I decided to use

774
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,890
time control. I went back to the

775
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,790
book of The Subgenius and,

776
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,070
you know, church methods.

777
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,530
One of them was time control.

778
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,790
I decided my credibility

779
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,970
was not damaged when

780
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,370
I, you know, saw the damn UFO.

781
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,070
My credibility was damaged

782
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,810
when I joined the church of

783
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,550
The Subgenius.

784
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,590
To read from a white note,

785
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,850
last year

786
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,110
I was out just walking

787
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,850
around on a brushwood and I heard

788
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:21,070
probably one of the most stupid comments

789
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,270
I've ever heard in my life.

790
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,030
Um,

791
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,030
I, I,

792
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,050
well that's easy enough to do around here.

793
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,410
Woo! Woo!

794
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:30,970
All you want?

795
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:31,990
Okay.

796
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,830
Yeah, it didn't make enough

797
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,970
rotations there, okay.

798
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,030
I heard a woman telling her

799
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,770
friends, um,

800
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,850
you know, I wonder what some of these people are like

801
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:45,430
in real life.

802
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,910
Oh, fuck!

803
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,450
Yeah!

804
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,390
Woo!

805
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,010
And I thought,

806
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,510
lady,

807
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,030
you have no idea in hell

808
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,450
what some of these people are like.

809
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,090
Thank you, I'll see you whenever they open

810
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:03,530
the door.

811
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,350
Woo!

812
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,030
After we were

813
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,210
kicked out of, uh, the so-called

814
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,830
enlightened city of Cambridge,

815
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,310
Massachusetts, um,

816
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,170
the local newspaper described us

817
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,810
as a comedy troupe.

818
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,750
Woo!

819
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,670
A comedy troupe

820
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,150
with 10,000 members

821
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,350
worldwide. We're bigger than Cirque du Soleil.

822
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,050
Proceeds from this auction

823
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,530
will be donated to the church,

824
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,990
though you can rest assured that when the

825
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,870
exits arrive, your investment

826
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,410
will be returned a thousand-fold

827
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,330
in the blood of screaming gnomes.

828
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,570
I've got something

829
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,890
that's far more valuable than

830
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,930
pure bull data. I've got the fake bull data.

831
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,170
The bidding has to start

832
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,510
at $2 for conspiracy money!

833
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,930
He holds up a

834
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,310
$1 bill.

835
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,750
He's auctioning a $1 bill.

836
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,570
Yes, it's fine.

837
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,870
Green paper right here is hardly good for wiping

838
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,730
your ass and lining your old birdcage, but

839
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,870
just in case this really is another

840
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,030
slip-up, you'll get to have this to buy

841
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,830
a bus ticket back home.

842
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:08,850
Two bucks!

843
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,270
Come on! Fifty cents!

844
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,770
Okay, here we are, $2. $2

845
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,710
for this conspiracy money. Whatever you want,

846
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,490
you can buy it. You can do whatever you want with it.

847
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,170
One dollar!

848
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,130
No, the bidding has to start at $2.

849
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,090
$2 for anyone.

850
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,610
We have $1.

851
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,730
Okay, we're currently at the bidding of $1.

852
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,990
$2. Someone must want $2 for this

853
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,770
wonderful... Look at the artwork

854
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,990
on this thing. It's amazing.

855
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,950
The eye of the Illuminati, the eye

856
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,610
on the pyramid, on the back of this.

857
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,970
This is unparalleled artwork. This is an original

858
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,790
print. Each one has its own limited edition

859
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:41,530
serial number.

860
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,710
Signed by the Secretary of the Treasury.

861
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,130
One dollar and one cent!

862
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,850
We have one dollar and one cent!

863
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,490
We have one dollar and two cents!

864
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,190
One dollar and two cents for someone who wants

865
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,110
to make a difference.

866
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,010
A dollar and two!

867
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,030
A dollar and three!

868
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,110
A dollar and four from anyone!

869
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,690
A dollar and ten!

870
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,810
Pay for a dollar. Beautiful, wonderful.

871
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,610
You've heard of inflation.

872
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,050
This is inflation. Be inflation.

873
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,590
It's gonna double next year anyways.

874
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,070
This is all a little gondola investment for only 75%

875
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,930
additional. Do the math!

876
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,530
My god! This is a bargain!

877
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,810
A dollar and 75... Okay, a dollar and fifty

878
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:19,970
we got. Going once...

879
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:20,530
Three dollars!

880
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,870
More historically important,

881
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,970
Mont. One of the few remaining

882
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,430
bottles of sub-Guinness.

883
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,190
Take your time.

884
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,390
I want everyone to be well informed.

885
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,250
A conformed bidder is a high bidding bidder.

886
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,770
The first posse Connie

887
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:41,050
Tautus t-shirt. You'll notice

888
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,990
the styling, similar to many black metal

889
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,350
bands.

890
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,970
This is the kind of thing that you wear

891
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,790
whenever you want the men to know that

892
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,890
well, you can take it as well as give it.

893
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,010
Or whenever you want the women to know that

894
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,370
you think that's a beautiful thing.

895
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,410
I have a news flash for you.

896
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,810
The Exis might

897
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:01,070
not arrive on July

898
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,210
5th, 1999 at 7am.

899
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:04,930
Watch it!

900
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,550
Anything is possible!

901
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,630
Drop the mask!

902
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,710
Burn the pink infiltrator!

903
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,090
But if we could live every day like we've lived

904
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,930
today, then who the f*** can?

905
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:15,850
I already did!

906
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,090
I already did!

907
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,850
Ladies and gentlemen, I propose the formation

908
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,310
of a political wing of the church of the sub-Guinness.

909
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,530
This political wing

910
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:26,990
would be aimed at

911
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,690
convincing every sub-Guinness

912
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,390
to run for local office.

913
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,030
Ladies and gentlemen,

914
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,450
we can and will elect

915
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,350
Ida Stane, Mayor of Dallas, Texas

916
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,370
by 2010!

917
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,870
So what we're saying is in the space

918
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,410
of one year, let me see if I got this straight.

919
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,850
The Boston Divival, well,

920
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,030
was censored by the conspiracy

921
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,190
largely because of

922
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,190
Papa Joe Mama.

923
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,770
The Seattle Divival, well,

924
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,770
could have been better because the conspiracy

925
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,790
sent...

926
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,770
Yeah, I did mention that

927
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,870
Papa Joe controlled a guy

928
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,250
who actually seriously did

929
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,730
go gonzo the night

930
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,990
of my Divival, wound up

931
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,090
killing like two or three old women,

932
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,930
one with a rake and another one

933
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,030
with his bare hands.

934
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,330
And who happened to be present at that Divival?

935
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,430
Papa Joe Mama.

936
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,190
Now I have one other question.

937
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,850
One year ago at this time,

938
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,650
we were standing right here

939
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,750
at Brushwood waiting for the saucers

940
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,090
to arrive. Now may I ask,

941
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:33,310
who was standing right next to Ivan Stang

942
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,010
when the saucers failed

943
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:35,550
to arrive?

944
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,710
Papa Joe Mama.

945
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,250
He is the conspiracy!

946
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,330
Papa Joe! Where's Papa Joe?

947
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,310
Where's Papa Joe?

948
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,450
Two, one,

949
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,630
Guilty!

950
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,730
Kill Papa Joe!

951
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,490
Kill Papa Joe!

952
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,510
Kill Papa Joe!

953
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,030
Kill Papa Joe!

954
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,030


955
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,550
Kill Papa Joe!

956
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,930
Kill Papa Joe!

957
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,550
Kill Papa Joe!

958
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:06,090
Kill Papa Joe!

959
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,870
Kill Papa Joe!

960
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,910
Ladies and gentlemen, the woman who

961
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,970
has the most to gain by killing Papa Joe,

962
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,330
Friday Jones.

963
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:15,530
Come on up here.

964
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,850
What the damn is this? I can't feel it anywhere.

965
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,530
I am so proud of you!

966
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:21,830
Cool!

967
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,990
Fellow sub-deities,

968
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,990
I am a

969
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:27,970
sub-genius.

970
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,930
I have always tried to live my

971
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,950
life as Bob Wood. I have tried

972
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,850
to be slack and I have tried

973
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,910
to give slack and there's a

974
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,930
man who has taken slack

975
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:39,670
from me.

976
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:43,110
He has taken slack

977
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:43,850
from you.

978
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,290
He has given the conspiracy a weapon

979
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,850
that they have used to cut

980
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,990
my throat.

981
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,730
And it was just a

982
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:53,430
joke.

983
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,430
You're flunting the jury. Hold on a minute here.

984
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,550
What is this?

985
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,550
What is this?

986
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,510
There's only Bob!

987
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,950
I say we just find the

988
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:05,590
bastard guilty!

989
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,930
The Lord has

990
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,070
arrived in judicial roles.

991
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,030
I'm a lawyer and I think we ought to

992
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,570
at least present some evidence and

993
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:15,810
make some...

994
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:18,310
Good Jesus!

995
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,750
This should start with a

996
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,510
famous...

997
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,990
We call for order in the cart!

998
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,470
Order in the cart!

999
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:28,990
Order!

1000
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,010
Today,

1001
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,810
we're trying Papa Joe Mama

1002
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,550
versus, excuse me,

1003
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,950
the Sub-Genius Foundation Incorporated

1004
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,230
versus Papa Joe Mama.

1005
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,970
Papa Joe Mama is charged with the most heinous

1006
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,910
crime of causing the church

1007
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,530
to lose money.

1008
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,290
Guilty! Guilty!

1009
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:51,170
And being laid for his own

1010
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:51,730
trial.

1011
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,590
Sit, please sit there.

1012
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,790
Could the lawyers, could the

1013
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,690
two lawyers please approach the bench?

1014
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,730
How about...

1015
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,750
Mr. Joe Mama,

1016
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:04,470
where's your lawyer?

1017
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,230
Sir, for the prosecution.

1018
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,690
Mr. Joe Mama's lawyer,

1019
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:09,990
please come forward.

1020
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,650
I've got a tweet to you, Your Honor.

1021
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,870
Ivan Stang and Cowboy Dave.

1022
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,830
Oh, hold on Joe, that's right, I'm sorry.

1023
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,470
I am also

1024
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,470
defending Papa Joe Mama.

1025
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,050
You're both prosecuting him and

1026
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:22,830
defending the top.

1027
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,030
And that's just the way

1028
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,770
we do things.

1029
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,090
There's no reason that I...

1030
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,690
I mean, I mean, my

1031
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,670
Papa Joe Mama is probably

1032
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,150
good, but it was funny, at least it was funny.

1033
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,670
Please approach the bench, please approach the bench.

1034
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:39,950
Okay, come on, come back to my part.

1035
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,690
Please approach the bench, we've got to...

1036
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,010
Okay, we're both under the basketball field, so let's get this over with quickly.

1037
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,330
All right, Jonathan,

1038
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:49,170
we're about to sit down so you can go out and make a poop in there.

1039
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,270
All right, you got it, all right.

1040
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,190
You got it, all right.

1041
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,690
You can't get this shit out of the show.

1042
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,690
The prosecuting attorney

1043
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,350
will give his opening argument.

1044
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,830
Oh, that would be you and you.

1045
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,410
Gladly, oh

1046
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,410
gladly, I

1047
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,610
look upon this so

1048
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,410
called subgenius

1049
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,170
Papa Joe

1050
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,630
Mama. Oh,

1051
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,350
yes, I'll tell you.

1052
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,030
We all know what he did. In fact,

1053
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,950
well, you've heard

1054
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,610
from Miss

1055
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,490
Friday Jones.

1056
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,290
This, this, this,

1057
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,770
this emcee, who has

1058
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,930
worked so hard for so,

1059
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,130
so many years for Bob,

1060
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,950
who spent some of her

1061
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,850
entire family's

1062
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,910
fortune, everything, the money that

1063
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,770
would have gone to keep her

1064
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,610
grandmother and mother alive,

1065
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,390
was spent on my

1066
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,610
ticket, Dr. Williams, and his,

1067
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,610
his, and

1068
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,650
what did she get in return?

1069
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:52,310
A funny,

1070
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,810
funny, funny joke.

1071
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,790
Some say hell is a funny joke.

1072
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,810
Well, well, a funny joke

1073
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,930
is, is hell in your wallet,

1074
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,870
friends. If funny

1075
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,430
was all right,

1076
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,430
then Ed Gein

1077
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,630
should have his own TV show.

1078
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,390
If funny is

1079
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,630
all right, then, uh,

1080
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,330
perhaps so, uh, let's say,

1081
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:18,710
Adolf Hitler is the greatest comedian of,

1082
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,350
oh, I can't say that to Jane or Michael.

1083
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:22,850
If funny

1084
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,590
is, is all right,

1085
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,570
then, uh, the Church of the Subgenius

1086
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,610
would have destroyed the Earth last year!

1087
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:30,970
So,

1088
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,710
but, you have,

1089
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,390
you have heard the tragedy

1090
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:38,690
of, of, of Friday.

1091
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,190
We're going to give more details

1092
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,870
of the aftermath of this man's

1093
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,770
funny, funny joke. But,

1094
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,890
and this may surprise the defense,

1095
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:48,190
which includes me,

1096
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,470
but,

1097
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,590
we have the evidence

1098
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,150
on tape, and we're going to play it.

1099
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,870
In a minute, we must hear

1100
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,190
the opening arguments for the defense.

1101
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,470
Oh, oh, oh, oh, that's right. Thank you.

1102
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,530
All right, I'm also doing the defense. Please.

1103
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:05,410
I mean, the defense, it was funny.

1104
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:06,830
I think, I mean,

1105
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,030
he's a holocaust, so he thinks all the

1106
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,470
pigs should die, but let's just

1107
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:11,190
enslave him.

1108
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,550
Is that, is that enough, uh,

1109
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,670
okay, good enough. The prosecution,

1110
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,090
the persecution will call

1111
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,050
its first witness. That's you,

1112
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,470
Reverend Stanton. Call your first witness.

1113
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,530
Witness! Witness! Oh, I,

1114
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,910
my first witness will be

1115
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:28,870
the people of these American

1116
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,930
states who listen to this

1117
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:33,090
travesty of a funny, funny

1118
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,890
joke! This travesty

1119
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,890
of good publicity for Bob.

1120
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:38,890
Hey, I, I,

1121
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:41,030
I, I, sure I thought it was a funny

1122
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:41,470
joke!

1123
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:44,830
Tiny! Oh, if

1124
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,910
what happened hadn't happened, perhaps we'd all be

1125
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:49,030
giving Papa Joe a medal. But like

1126
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:51,210
I say, we'd be giving,

1127
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,050
we'd be, we'd be giving

1128
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,470
the, the, the, the,

1129
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:55,390
the, the, the, the,

1130
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:58,690
the star of the day, Mr. Stanton!

1131
00:44:58,690 --> 00:44:59,890
Mr. Stanton, do you have any evidence?

1132
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,490
Let's roll the

1133
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:03,250
tape!

1134
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,470
This is a funny call

1135
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,230
in through National Public Radio's

1136
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:10,270
Talk of the Nation.

1137
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:11,970
Thank you, Rick.

1138
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:14,610
Aaron joining us from Seattle. Joe's next in

1139
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:26,390
Hey Ray, clearly the parents were involved in this and that they aided and abated their children into getting the information that got them on this wayward path.

1140
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:31,570
They bought them the computer, the kids sent by the computer, the kids went to the internet unsupervised.

1141
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:34,850
They got hooked up with this, what's called a holocaustal sack.

1142
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:37,410
It was on their links page before that was taken down.

1143
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,930
But the holocaustal page is still up there on the internet.

1144
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:49,810
It all talks about exterminating the normals and killing the pinks and it's a big thing about pipes and pipe bombs and transsexuals and this sort of stuff.

1145
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:52,830
Any parent would see it and know that it's bad news.

1146
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:59,150
And yet, you know, with bartenders, if they see someone that's drinking a lot, they can go ahead and be liable for that.

1147
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:05,450
It seems to me that parents clearly should have a responsibility when they get hooked up with these false-blown cults.

1148
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:09,430
I mean, even the names, the holocaustals, I mean, doesn't that tell you something?

1149
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:18,410
And this is all part of that church of the subgenius thing, which is a big deal about, you know, superior mutants and supporting deviant behavior.

1150
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:26,190
When people behave this way, that's the extreme behavior that can come out of it.

1151
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:31,350
And people are responsible. It seems to me that the parents have a clear responsibility in this regard.

1152
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:39,090
But I guess, Joe, the question is, where does it go, where do we cross boundaries from simply feeling that they're responsible,

1153
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:39,910
deciding what to do, and then...

1154
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:39,910


1155
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:40,130
Yeah.

1156
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:44,890
...that morally they're responsible to where they can land up in court?

1157
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:53,870
Well, society-wise, I think we need to kind of ask ourselves is entertainment and freedom of speech worth, you know, basically getting people killed.

1158
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:57,330
This whole holocaustal thing, they're still going full force.

1159
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,030
They still have their webpages up.

1160
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:01,050
They're having a revival this weekend.

1161
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,370
You're right, Mr. Isaac.

1162
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:05,210
Right this weekend, the bodies aren't even cold in the grave.

1163
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:09,850
It's about some big, what do they call it, revival, or Friday, I think it is.

1164
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,430
Some restaurant in the Middle East or whatnot.

1165
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:14,750
And they celebrate this type of stuff.

1166
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:15,490
And then it's funny.

1167
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:19,930
And people just stand by and, oh, well, we can't do anything about that.

1168
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:24,290
Well, if we can shut down, you know, KKK people from wearing hoods,

1169
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:31,510
why can't we stop people who are advocating the same type of behavior, which is lynching and killing people, from trying new craft?

1170
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:32,810
But you killed Papa Joe!

1171
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:35,210
It's a lie, it's all a lie!

1172
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:38,270
Well, I'll respond in one way.

1173
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:39,910
Joe, you obviously know a lot about this.

1174
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,150
I know a lot about this cult.

1175
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:44,810
I haven't heard of these things.

1176
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:49,210
And it sounds horrifying by your description.

1177
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:54,170
I'm not sure I know enough to sort of concur in all of your characterizations.

1178
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,370
But I do want to say I agree with you about this.

1179
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:02,990
I don't believe the First Amendment, the right to freedom of speech, which is a very important foundation of liberty in this country.

1180
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:08,670
But I don't believe it means that people bear no responsibility for the things that they say.

1181
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:10,970
Okay, he's not a taboo.

1182
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:11,150
Enough of it.

1183
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:11,170
Enough of it.

1184
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:11,810
We've heard enough of it.

1185
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:13,350
Enough of this travesty.

1186
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,150
This was so-called publicity.

1187
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:16,810
Oh, great publicity.

1188
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:20,010
He calls it national public radio.

1189
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,430
That's a little cool.

1190
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:23,270
That's communist-controlled policy.

1191
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:24,930
It's government-controlled, I think.

1192
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:35,510
And then conspiracy propaganda that every liberal PC Nazi in Cambridge is sure to listen to.

1193
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:39,910
And then he goes and makes funny jokes about the admittedly hellenistic...

1194
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:43,630
the hilarious Columbine massacre, and the Invitational Massacre.

1195
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,170
And I'm in the Holocaust, my God, friends!

1196
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:52,490
Okay, now, how can we call this short bits funny?

1197
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:55,490
But no, what?

1198
00:48:55,970 --> 00:49:01,970
Wait until you hear some of the horrible repercussions that this poor woman went through

1199
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:07,770
for this subgenius's funny joke.

1200
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:11,010
Mr. Rothfeder, do you want to call your next witness?

1201
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,770
Fuck, what about the children? What about the kids?

1202
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,970
Okay, the prosecution rests.

1203
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,610
I have one question before we go any further.

1204
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:24,610
Mr. Mama, is Joe from Tallahassee, the voice that we heard on the tape, your voice?

1205
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:28,850
I can assure you it is not your voice.

1206
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:35,110
I'd like the defense to call its first witness.

1207
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:36,890
If I can elaborate.

1208
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:37,750
We've proven that Joe is not your voice.

1209
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:40,550
We plan to present what we term the Ted Bundy defense,

1210
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:44,970
which is, we officially acknowledge it is not us,

1211
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:51,350
but if it were us, we would explain why the culprit would do what the culprit did.

1212
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:52,450
Although we're not the culprit.

1213
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:55,510
Mr. Mama, I believe Ted Bundy was executed.

1214
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:03,510
See, that's exactly what they want you to think.

1215
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:07,750
But I've noticed there's been more serial murders.

1216
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,830
Since he's been executed, hasn't there?

1217
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:16,430
Are you saying that you want to be your own witness at this time, Mr. Mama?

1218
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,990
Would you like to speak on the charges that have been brought against you?

1219
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:22,830
I would like to point a few small points.

1220
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:23,770
Go ahead.

1221
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:25,550
Now, again, it wasn't me.

1222
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,490
All right? We all know it wasn't me.

1223
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,490
I know it wasn't me. Friday knows it wasn't me.

1224
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,750
There's thousands of Joes.

1225
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:31,850
It could have been Joe from Chicago.

1226
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:34,450
It could have been Joe from California.

1227
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,230
It could have been Joe from Philadelphia.

1228
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:36,230


1229
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:37,090
It's murdering him.

1230
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:37,470
It's murdering him.

1231
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,130
Has he even been sworn in?

1232
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:43,490
Has this lying bastard even been sworn in?

1233
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:44,070
Oh, you're right.

1234
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,690
Excuse me.

1235
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:47,330
Order, order, order.

1236
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:50,150
They go to fetch a Revelation X.

1237
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,670
We have to swear this blasphemer in.

1238
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:55,910
He is sworn in on a copy of the Revelation X.

1239
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:56,970
He plays your right hand on Doc's head.

1240
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:59,450
He tries to just put one finger down.

1241
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:00,670
Right hand.

1242
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:01,290
Right hand.

1243
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,810
Right hand, please.

1244
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:05,810
Please put your...

1245
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,350
You killed yourself, Bob!

1246
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:10,970
Do you promise to tell the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you, Bob?

1247
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:12,370
I'm...

1248
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,150
I swear to do!

1249
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:19,790
Okay, you can continue with your argument. Sit him back down.

1250
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:28,210
Well, assuming that it was this person that you claim it was,

1251
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:34,850
I think we all as subgeniuses need to ask ourselves this critical question.

1252
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:41,030
If the end of the world is July 5th, 1999, and the normals are going to be exterminated,

1253
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:45,650
then shouldn't they be warned about it? I mean, there's a regular hunting season.

1254
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:50,570
I submit that they should have a non-composting energy.

1255
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:53,870
They should have a non-composting mental field.

1256
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,130
It's clear by the look on his face.

1257
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:57,470
Are you pleading insanity?

1258
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:00,510
Yes, I'm pleading not only insanity, but also...

1259
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:01,130
Not for yourself.

1260
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:03,850
...discorporation, and also incontinence.

1261
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:04,830
And I'm not saying that you should be.

1262
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:06,810
Look, a lack of...

1263
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:07,290
Condons!

1264
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,390
Look, a lack of breeding.

1265
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:11,050
I mean, this man is seriously inebriated.

1266
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:11,990
Look at his knees.

1267
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:17,270
His knees are unshaped, and there's no reason for this man to be on the stand, accused the way he is.

1268
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,750
Can I please just say something on the spot, ma'am?

1269
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,490
Yes, you may have a few words.

1270
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:22,190
First...

1271
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:22,350
No.

1272
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:23,530
Please, dear.

1273
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:26,810
I'd like to implore the jury. It's kind of a jury of your peers.

1274
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:27,530
We don't want to hear it.

1275
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:28,830
I have asked my lawyer.

1276
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:31,850
You're the second-year lawyer?

1277
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:32,830
Yes, I do.

1278
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:32,910
I do.

1279
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:35,210
This is completely...

1280
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,250
I mean, I'd rather defend myself than to have this...

1281
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:43,130
Well, in the court of the subjeetious, you have the ability to fire your lawyer if you wish to defend yourself, but you're not a prophet.

1282
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:47,790
Well, but see, I thought, you know, I mean, this guy who's prosecuting me came in and told me he was my lawyer.

1283
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:48,870
I gave him all the information.

1284
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:49,870
I mean, we're on her.

1285
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:51,890
Silence, silence, silence.

1286
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:52,450


1287
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:54,590
She will stop.

1288
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:55,770
She's not a judge, Jordan.

1289
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:56,670
She's not a court lawyer.

1290
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:57,390
Order!

1291
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:58,410
Order!

1292
00:52:58,750 --> 00:52:59,650
Order to the court!

1293
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:00,650
Order to the court!

1294
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,810
Mr. Obama, do you wish to steal your lawyer?

1295
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:05,450
Do you wish to fire your lawyer and defend yourself?

1296
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:07,970
I gave him $500.

1297
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,350
Answer the question.

1298
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:10,410
Answer the question.

1299
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:11,690
Yeah, I want to go on fire.

1300
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:13,290
You want to defend yourself?

1301
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,610
Yeah, I want to go on fire.

1302
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:16,550
Yeah, I want to go on fire.

1303
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:16,910
My lawyer.

1304
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,190
I want my money back, too.

1305
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:21,950
If I'm a judge, I'm going to bring the kids to the king's house.

1306
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:31,090
Sir, I am turning in my former client, Papa Joe Mama, just because we, for some reason,

1307
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,790
happen to think that he's got an awful lot of money.

1308
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,790


1309
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,790


1310
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,790


1311
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,790


1312
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,790


1313
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,790


1314
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,790


1315
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,790


1316
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:33,030
I'll send those tickets to the king's house.

1317
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,030


1318
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,030


1319
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,030


1320
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,030


1321
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,030


1322
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:37,550
There's not an awful lot of pinky-winky blood coursing through his collapsed twitter

1323
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:42,850
veins, but that we can't afford to let this happen again.

1324
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:43,770
Hey!

1325
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:44,430
Never again!

1326
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,070
Never again!

1327
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:47,130
Ever again!

1328
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:48,070
Ever again!

1329
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:48,230
Ever again!

1330
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:48,990
Ever again!

1331
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:49,250


1332
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:49,250


1333
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:53,710
Once prosperous, subgenius show producer.

1334
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:58,070
Once successful, she was the apple of Bob's eye.

1335
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:01,130
The most successful of all subgenius show producers.

1336
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:02,730
Hard out now.

1337
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:02,790
Hard out now.

1338
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:02,790


1339
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:17,390
Now, reamed by this human, I hate to say it, but we cannot let this happen for devival after what is the next funny joke he'll start joking about.

1340
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,270
Thank Bob for Friday.

1341
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:19,970
Yeah!

1342
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:28,870
That's a good thing he didn't call NPR to talk about XX Day.

1343
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:33,930
Now, isn't it a fact we got those Jack Puget Storm Troopers from Paper Chute right now?

1344
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,410
Do I know who those guys were?

1345
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:36,010
Your Honor.

1346
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:37,330
They were PC Nazis.

1347
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:38,350
Order, order, order.

1348
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:40,690
Put her in the court.

1349
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:42,850
What a burger.

1350
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:47,070
Are there any more, does the prosecution have any more witnesses to call?

1351
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:51,410
I would like to call my client, Friday Jones, to the witness.

1352
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:52,950
Mr. Jones, please take the stand.

1353
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:54,430
I need to be sworn in.

1354
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:55,350
Bailiff.

1355
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:56,670
You need to swear in.

1356
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,670
The lovely Miss...

1357
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,490
Friday Jones.

1358
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:01,350
Miss Jones.

1359
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:02,310
Woo!

1360
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,070
Woo!

1361
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:03,390
Woo!

1362
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,710
I object to the description of the...

1363
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:06,430
Silence!

1364
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:07,650
...witnesses' beautiful...

1365
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:08,370
Silence him!

1366
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:12,750
If you speak out again, we'll sort him out for both of you guilty bastards.

1367
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:20,810
Now, Miss Jones, I understand that you have quite a bit of evidence that would certainly

1368
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:27,250
convict this obviously, blatantly, only a dumbass could even doubt that.

1369
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:27,910
Wait a second!

1370
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:30,790
The shatter broiled...

1371
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:31,850
Objection, Robert!

1372
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:34,250
He's referring to the judge as a dumbass?

1373
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:34,990
You'll pay him!

1374
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:37,570
You just called you a dumbass.

1375
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:39,470
He said that only at...

1376
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:39,850
Silence!

1377
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:40,330
Silence!

1378
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:41,590
Where's the duct tape?

1379
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:42,170
I heard...

1380
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:54,550
Father Joe Mama has a potato stuffed into his mouth and his duct tape's shut.

1381
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:54,890
Woo!

1382
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:58,610
We should let the jury at least...

1383
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:04,330
his peers, these marsupials, these hopping marsupials from Australia here to the side,

1384
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:08,390
after listening to this evidence, this filthy evidence,

1385
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:13,570
in the words of the poverty-stricken Friday Jones,

1386
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:18,730
who because of his despicable lack of taste and poor timing,

1387
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:22,910
has been relegated to the very gutter, to prost...

1388
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:26,510
Well, I hate to say it, but to certain forms of...

1389
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:32,170
of work that are illegal in all states except Nevada.

1390
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:36,370
Friday, go ahead if you could, if you can bring yourself to do it,

1391
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:40,850
and share with these good people what has been done to you.

1392
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:43,930
Go, girlfriend.

1393
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,190
You go. Go, girl.

1394
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:52,350
When I went to the politician who had shut down the revival,

1395
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:55,370
I asked him, you know,

1396
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:56,490
who gave you...

1397
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:59,850
this information, and what did he tell you about us?

1398
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,390
We're the subgeniuses.

1399
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:03,710
We're gonna destroy the whole earth,

1400
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:06,990
but that doesn't mean we're gonna do anything to Cambridge right now.

1401
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:07,790
Yes!

1402
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:09,530
What'd he say?

1403
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:13,110
And he gave me a printout,

1404
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:14,450
and it was,

1405
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:16,970
read at your own risk,

1406
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:19,130
the Holocaustal homepage,

1407
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:23,070
created by Papa Joe Mott.

1408
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,230
Delta! Delta!

1409
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:25,990
Come on, I'm not an objector.

1410
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:26,490
He's being...

1411
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,510
he's been acting like he's got that porcine thing in his mouth.

1412
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,970
This woman's obviously a criminal person.

1413
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,790
I know that she's a...

1414
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:34,950
I had an over-reaction.

1415
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:37,310
Oh, another outburst like that?

1416
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,190
All right, all right.

1417
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:39,130
It was a...

1418
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:39,850
It was a...

1419
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:40,950
It was a...

1420
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:41,050
It was a...

1421
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:41,790
It was a...

1422
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:45,090
Ms. Jones, please read the evidence.

1423
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:47,870
In specific...

1424
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:48,010
No!

1425
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:48,790
Eagle's coming!

1426
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:49,570
Shh!

1427
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:53,650
...referring to the revival on the webpage.

1428
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:55,150
Read it!

1429
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:57,270
News flash.

1430
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:02,790
It has come to our attention that Marilyn Manson has cancelled his tours

1431
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:05,050
out of respect for those killed in Littleton.

1432
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:10,550
We salute this magnanimous gesture on the part of Mr. or Mrs. Manson...

1433
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:10,870
Win!

1434
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:15,470
...and hope it provides comfort to those upset by the recent tragic events.

1435
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:19,930
Unfortunately, we're too greedy to cancel our tours,

1436
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:26,390
but we still want to jump on the sympathy bandwagon for various publicity reasons.

1437
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:33,430
So, in honor of those slain, we will provide extra salvation to anyone who shows up in

1438
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:34,690
a black trench coat.

1439
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:43,990
And kids, remember, killing pinks before X-Day is like taking a shortcut during a footrace.

1446
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:12,070
some things were unearthed towards the end of the trial that are...

1447
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:16,950
will have most subgeniuses, uh, wiping the floor with their dropped...

1448
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,370
