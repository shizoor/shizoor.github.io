1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,160
Bob said to party.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:08,800
Party.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,620
Party.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,100
Bob said you had to party.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,500
You had to party.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,220
You better party.

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,040
You didn't say you might if you felt like it.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,840
In and out and in and out and in and out and in and out.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,360
And I want you to take a deep breath.

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,160
Come on, Calvary, and hold it.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,720
Ready, one.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
One, two, three, four.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,280
And now, the subgenius.

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,760
Our old squad.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,660
Airplane and regulation there.

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,400
You know, it's the crowded elevator of the show.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,300
We all have to make room for each other and try not to, well,

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,980
make matters worse.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,680
We're so unblessed that we get off before reaching our stop.

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:11,300
I kind of think of our subgenius family as one big happy bunch of gibbering idiots.

21
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,780
I mean, I have to sterilize my toes.

22
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,980
They sucked my toes.

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,240
Oh, yeah, those poor, horrible, scuzzy guys.

24
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,660
They married your toes, though.

25
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,700
It was sanctified.

26
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,520
Did they really?

27
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,300
They really sucked my foot.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,780
It's precisely what did happen.

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,660
But, of course, we were terribly sorry that we had to nail her into the mummy case

30
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,800
and close the iron door.

31
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,320
And we have the videotapes.

32
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,320
You can see the video version of this show.

33
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,400
Even more stultifying and magnificent than the audio version of the show.

34
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,640
This is us up on the rooftop cafe while Bob Nelson does the dirty work downstairs.

35
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,560
We're swilling our hot buttered rum martinis,

36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,520
and our feet are up on the table as we're having a spitball session

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,280
figuring out just how we're going to put together a script for the next show.

38
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
Praise Bob.

39
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,380
Yeah, no kidding.

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,040
Praise Bob, dear friends.

41
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:29,080
And, you know, Dijkstra's law states that everybody is someone else's weirdo.

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,680
And Bob, because he seems somehow so normal to everyone,

43
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,740
is the only one who is truly weird.

44
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,880
And they said,

45
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,440
As ye hath the pipe, so shall ye smoke it.

46
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,140
And, lo, it was smoked.

47
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,340
And it was good and pure.

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,220
And all the world.

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,240
And all the world smoked with him.

50
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,340
For let he who hath wisdom know,

51
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,300
it is the wallet of a man.

52
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,560
Economicon 614.

53
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,900
And, dear friends, as we begin our show,

54
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,800
let's also reflect on the words of Magistra Beatrix,

55
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,680
who said that Bob,

56
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,400
speaking of our guru Bob Dobbs,

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,300
Bob is the,

58
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,120
spiritual fractal,

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,400
for he is made up of uncountable dots.

60
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,760
But each of these dots, in turn,

61
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,340
comprises, yea,

62
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,680
uncountable Dobbs heads,

63
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,800
each of which, in its turn,

64
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,360
is also composed of unending dots.

65
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,340
And so it goeth from lasting

66
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,660
unto everlasting.

67
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,020
And, you know, friends,

68
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,880
if you could see the universe from outside,

69
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,540
at just the right angle,

70
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,360
the best seat, so to speak,

71
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,700
why all the stars would make up

72
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,640
a huge Dobbs head,

73
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,960
a huge portrait of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

74
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,820
But I think most telling

75
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,900
and most pertinent of all of these

76
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,400
is this statement

77
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,820
by the great German philosopher Goethe.

78
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,520
Goethe said,

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,440
I believed that,

80
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,260
that I discovered in nature,

81
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,280
animate and inanimate,

82
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,660
intelligent and brute,

83
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,460
something which manifested itself

84
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,760
only in contradiction

85
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,960
and therefore could not be grasped

86
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,280
by a conception,

87
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,640
much less by a word.

88
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,320
It was not godlike,

89
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,980
since it seemed reasonable,

90
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,620
not human,

91
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,180
since it had no understanding.

92
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,600
He's talking about Bob, friends.

93
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,900
Not devilish,

94
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,060
for it was beneficent.

95
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,940
Not angelic,

96
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,720
since it often,

97
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,360
evinces schadenfreude.

98
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,580
It resembled chance,

99
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,700
since it showed no sequence.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,480
It resembled providence,

101
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,960
since it pointed at connection.

102
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,440
It could surpass all that limits us.

103
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,720
It seemed to deal at pleasure

104
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,340
with the basic categories of our existence.

105
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,640
It contracted time and extended space.

106
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,200
Only in the impossible it seemed to delight

107
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,700
and to repel the pleasure of the impossible.

108
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:28,700


109
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,080
With contempt,

110
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,020
this essence,

111
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,940
this show,

112
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,460
which seemed to insert itself

113
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,740
between all things,

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,800
to sever them,

115
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,980
to bind them,

116
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,980
I named

117
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,740
the demoniacal,

118
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,680
after the example of the ancients

119
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,960
and of those who had observed

120
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,680
the dogs.

121
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,960
Ah, yes, dear friends,

122
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,540
and you know,

123
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,720
we enjoyed,

124
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,680
we enjoyed a simply fantastic,

125
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,080
new year's subgenius,

126
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,600
devival last Thursday night here in Dallas,

127
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,240
just simply fantabulous.

128
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,340
At Club No in Deep Ellum,

129
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,720
and the preachers were in top form.

130
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,520
Half of them were babes in bondage getup, practically.

131
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,680
Praise Sister Mary Squared.

132
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,400
The video projections looked good.

133
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,720
The band of ones was truly subgenius

134
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,520
in that they were,

135
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,680
they played anti-music for the first ten minutes,

136
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,520
so that those who were sissy enough

137
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,540
to be driven away by that

138
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,000
would miss the great Doctors for Bob

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,940
lyrical ballads that followed.

140
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,540
But more importantly,

141
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,560
the most important thing was,

142
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,520
as Charlie Gilder there at Club No told me,

143
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,100
they'd never had such a good crowd ever,

144
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,680
and we were able to pay all the preachers and musicians,

145
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,400
which to me is the most critical part

146
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,440
of any religiopus event,

147
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,760
produced by our ministry.

148
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,440
Oh yes, dear friends.

149
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,880
And you know, normally the week after such a devival,

150
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,720
we play the tapes from that on the radio,

151
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,040
but I can't do that this time.

152
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,860
I can't.

153
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,380
And we're gonna have to play those best of,

154
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,660
mixed with the new Jane or Hyperclete's album,

155
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,360
by the way,

156
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,440
and Sister Susie the Floozy's Atlanta radio ministry next week.

157
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,420
Oh, God.

158
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,960
But tonight's show instead,

159
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,460
well, we discovered the most amazing thing at the devival.

160
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,500
A number of people told Willa Dobbs,

161
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
who was manning the sacred sales table,

162
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,920
that until they got the postcard or saw the poster,

163
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,880
they didn't know there was a subgenius radio show in Dallas.

164
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,980
And many of these were subgenius ministers.

165
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,340
I guess they hadn't read all of their Stark Fist magazine,

166
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,080
church newsletter.

167
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,340
Anyway, so I imagine we have some new listeners tonight.

168
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,460
Who are yet subgenie-y.

169
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,620
So for them, I've rather hurriedly actually put together a quote,

170
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,920
typical, unquote, hour of slack.

171
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,020
That is some of our best oldies mixed in with new stuff

172
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,120
from our old standby contributors,

173
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,920
plus some live ranting.

174
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,720
It's an introductory show again, you might say.

175
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,080
So let's get to it.

176
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,900
But first, I wanted to say the video tapes of the devival

177
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,540
looked great, especially the ones shot by Honest Joe Riley

178
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,920
and the selfless Bobby Self.

179
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,180
He's no Bobby.

180
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,120
Which are the only ones I've seen yet.

181
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:44,600
And Susie, the floozy's bump and grind looks riveting.

182
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,960
And the lascivious video projections behind her.

183
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,400
Oh, well.

184
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
And by the way, anybody who's listening

185
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,520
who was shooting video tapes there,

186
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,820
please call us and arrange for us to get copies from you

187
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,340
in exchange for whatever you might want from our collection,

188
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,380
because you can't imagine what visual delights might await you

189
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,300
if, like a true subgenius,

190
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,960
you share your media coverage by throwing it into the big mix.

191
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:22,040
And this show is dedicated to the girl whose four friends hated our club devival.

192
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,580
And yet she staunchly and dobsfully defended it

193
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,260
like a true warrior of the faith.

194
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,180
And we'll overhear this conversation.

195
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,480
The four other girls were going,

196
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,560
you know, how could you do this to us?

197
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,820
You made us waste our new year.

198
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,880
It's just all so ew, stupid.

199
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,620
And the hero girl was saying,

200
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,420
my God, you were there?

201
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,500
You were there and yet you didn't see it.

202
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,080
It was a fantastic show and it happened right before your eyes.

203
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,800
And yet you were blinded.

204
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,420
Well, I don't know if she said it that way,

205
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,720
but honey, if you're out there, you are truly of the blood.

206
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,120
And I'll address the Satan guys later.

207
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,020
But let's go ahead and get on with it, shall we?

208
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,320
This is Bob, and we'll be orbiting your area for the next hour,

209
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,220
carrying the message, the seed word of the faith of Bob,

210
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,000
the faith in Bob, FIB we call it.

211
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,820
Can you keep up the FIB?

212
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,320
Yes, please.

213
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,880
Fred?

214
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,320
You want to dump the main shots?

215
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,140
Thank you.

216
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,160
All right.

217
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,360
Okay.

218
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,220
The show is right up on the green lines, Doctor.

219
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,880
The show is fully on the line.

220
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,620
We will be landing on another show.

221
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,920
We will be docking with another show tonight.

222
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,040
Pardon me, you can't land on another show.

223
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,560
We've caused a nuclear explosion.

224
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,240
We'll be docking with show four from San Francisco tonight.

225
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,300
And hold on.

226
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,160
Hold on to your seats.

227
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,920
Oh!

228
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,300
Come on!

229
00:10:59,380 --> 00:10:59,920
Come on!

230
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,820
It's time to be manipulated.

231
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,240
Brother, I want to tell you something.

232
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,540
The world is tired of dead preaching preachers, dead preachers preaching dead sermons to dead

233
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:10,480
congregations.

234
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,320
They're tired of cold services and cold churches.

235
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,820
This world is hungry for reality.

236
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,700
They've had enough of Hollywood.

237
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,660
They've had enough of Nashville.

238
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,880
They've had enough of show business.

239
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,260
Believe that God.

240
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,100
Jam on it.

241
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,780
You can't hide from God because he's bigger than you.

242
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,660
He's bigger than all infinity.

243
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,820
He's bigger than all reality.

244
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,320
Come on, somebody.

245
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,520
You cannot hide from God.

246
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,060
You cannot hide from this grand, grand, grand God.

247
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,340
He's bigger than you.

248
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,940
He's bigger than all infinity.

249
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,300
He's bigger than all reality.

250
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,760
His face has been mending wrapped in more than one place in the universe.

251
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,400
The sound itself, it has a stink to it.

252
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,440
You find no mention whatsoever in there to God.

253
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,120
Well, that's kind of strange.

254
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,300
Are you saying that the Bible isn't, well, like, which Bible is credible as far as you're concerned?

255
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,080
None of them. They've all been tampered with.

256
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,480
You're saying, George, portions of the Bible are.

257
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,460
So are you saying that at one time the Bible was correct?

258
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,440
No.

259
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,760
No, ever?

260
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,200
No, ever.

261
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,860
It says in these documents that Jesus went through the crucifixion, but he didn't die.

262
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,380
It's Bob!

263
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,280
Bob brings a new destiny for the abnormal.

264
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:49,420
For Bob comes to justify our sins, to unmask the conspiracy, and to get us back the slack they stole away.

265
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,180
It's us versus them.

266
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,420
Are you going to cry in hell on earth alongside them?

267
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,140
The pink boys?

268
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,900
Or will you pull the wool over your own eyes and accept Bob into your mind?

269
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,460
Repent. Quit your job. Slack off. And praise Bob!

270
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,920
Church of the Subgenius. Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

271
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:15,120
Every time I sit down on my kingdom's throne

272
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,940
I reach out for the good book that will save my soul

273
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,420
I reach out for the good book that will save my soul

274
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,240
Praise me

275
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,140
From the gorges of the spilt sea

276
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,280
Praise me

277
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,540
From the shades of time

278
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,180
Praise me

279
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,160
From the men in black

280
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,640
It's never subgenius

281
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,200
Must have slack

282
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,280
Praise Bob!

283
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,180
Praise Bob!

284
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,080
Praise Bob!

285
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,780
Praise Bob!

286
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:59,140
Dear Bob, my life has changed completely because of your ministry.

287
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,120
Praise Bob!

288
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,280
Praise Bob!

289
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,540
They said your mind is in this jar and then they poured it down the sink.

290
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,260
No really, we're a fun crowd. You'd like us to move in next door to you.

291
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,400
To you, we'd be indistinguishable from the others you might see in your town.

292
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,760
Oh, maybe we'd have to go to the bathroom.

293
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,800
Maybe we'd have a wink in our twinkling eye or a smile or a leer on our lips.

294
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,060
But otherwise we'd look like everyday Joe Lunchbale.

295
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,640
A good, solid, honest, cream-colored working man.

296
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,060
Ready to move in next to you and send the property value soaring.

297
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,380
How about it, America? Get in step.

298
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:38,840
Well, let's try it out, huh?

299
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:46,700
We shield ourselves from discomforts of everyday, every week, every year, every life.

300
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,340
Luxuriate in cooperation.

301
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,600
No gold.

302
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:51,760
No gold.

303
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,060
But minimizing work.

304
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
Minimizing contact with the universe.

305
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,440
Thus, we do not fulfill the potential in our genes.

306
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:11,880
Cometh the Visigoth, Vandal, Hun, Pancho Villa, Conan, to reap what is still goodly in his God-given sight.

307
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:20,680
By sight shall you be known to the reppers who will replicate that which is God and discardedly non-rep rest.

308
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,900
For the bitbucket, hell.

309
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,040
Be not deceived.

310
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,180
Dobbs is not mocked.

311
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,740
For whosoever a man soeth, him also shall he reap.

312
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,560
So is my shepherd, I shall not want.

313
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,360
A six million year cycle will end in 1998.

314
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,140
Dobbs sees the world entering a new aeon.

315
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:50,080
Which, in a few years, will bring more wondrous and miraculous change and carnage, insanity, and destruction.

316
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,320
Than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.

317
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,840
Bob brings a new destiny for America.

318
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:05,160
A time of cataclysmic economic change that will offer untold riches and power to those in the know.

319
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,000
While billions of deserving conspiracy dupes fry in hell on earth.

320
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,280
Oh, you probably already knew that the U.S. government is a sham.

321
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,760
Something propped up there for you to blame.

322
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,900
But did you know that the real powers that be are not even people?

323
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:29,240
That they are actually shambling, unbelievable, unmentionable, unthinkable things?

324
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,140
They say we're here to wake you up to what the truth is.

325
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,760
I'll also tell you another thing.

326
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,200
They say, we made the mess.

327
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,620
Look around at the planet.

328
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,920
I mean, you got the air is polluted, the water is polluted, everything else is polluted.

329
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,300
We made the mess.

330
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,740
We will transmit instructions for you to clean up the mess.

331
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,080
In other words, we will tell you how AIDS was created.

332
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,560
We'll tell you what its purpose was and how you can cure it.

333
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,000
But you got to do it.

334
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,140
We're not going to do it for you.

335
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,360
This is your job.

336
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,980
You clean up your own room.

337
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,320
So they're doing this through you though, George, right?

338
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,520
Well, not just me.

339
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,120
But I mean, you and these people that you're communicating with.

340
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,640
That's correct.

341
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,400
And you're going to talk about this at the seminar?

342
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,440
That's exactly right.

343
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,880
I'll go into all of these areas, how, why.

344
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,680
In other words, they say before you can cure a problem, you better know what the problem's on.

345
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,800
And they're so vast.

346
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,100
They say, we are here to awaken you to the massive lies.

347
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,700
And it's everything.

348
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,520
I mean.

349
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,960
Now you see it.

350
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,240
And now you don't.

351
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,560
Of course you feel it.

352
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,000
But you don't really know

353
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,420
What's come over you.

354
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,600
There's something in the air.

355
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,000
What's come over you.

356
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,200
There's something in the air.

357
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,380
Just check the sensors for invisibility.

358
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,420
Become adept at stealthy stalking

359
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,740
I've got my UFO degree

360
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:18,740


361
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:18,740


362
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,460
Detector on

363
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,940
Intrusion signals flash the warning

364
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,640
That it's over you

365
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,980
There's something in the air

366
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,320
And they're watching you

367
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,600
There's something in the air

368
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,100
The cloaking device

369
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,860
The cloaking device

370
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,680
The cloaking device

371
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,360
The cloaking device

372
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,120
The cloaking device

373
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,080
There's something in the air

374
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,300
Something in the air

375
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,500
Something in the air

376
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,280
Something in the air

377
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,540
Something in the air

378
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:56,220
Stay away, new age, take control, tech, tech, tech, tech, tech, tech.

379
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:10,180
Head to head, sound waves, shock your soul, tech, tech, tech, tech, tech, tech, tech.

380
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,380
Rainbow, lip move, purple rain, tech, tech, tech, tech, tech, tech.

381
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,240
I'm just getting real superstitious, I look at the signs everywhere.

382
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,900
I got a feeling in my bones, there's something in the air.

383
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,800
There's something in the air.

384
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,160
There's something in the air.

385
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,220
There's something in the air.

386
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,460
There's something in the air.

387
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:58,940
The cloaking device, the cloaking device, the cloaking device, the cloaking device.

388
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:07,800
It is only natural that such things would occur considering the segregation of the sexes enforced by the papacy.

389
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,160
Such a thing would never happen.

390
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,760
And had never been permitted when the ways of Odin held sway across Europe.

391
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:22,680
A simple day's study of nature would've shown the blasphemy of locking man with man and woman with woman.

392
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,060
At this point we must deal with the troublesome question of demons.

393
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:36,260
Many right thinking Christians scoff at the idea of demonic existence even as they acknowledge the devils power.

394
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:44,120
power. Closed biblical study shows that demons are, in fact, electrical manifestations and

395
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:51,580
properties in the service of evil. Just as stray electrons create unstable elements,

396
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:59,580
isotopes, and deadly nuclear reaction, so demons represent malignant forms of energy

397
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:08,760
plaguing all that is orderly and wholesome. Hell? And whither, whither we? Blame it on the

398
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:17,300
Quasanova? Don't take individual responsibility. Let Congress do it. To us? If we don't grab this

399
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:23,640
little local mother, it's going to fall over. The multiple stages, as resolved into words

400
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,540
by Bob Wilson in Luminatus, are real.

401
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,440
If 20

402
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:37,720
12, exact date, exact time, is the culmination. If Rebus Canibus gets the bus. If we aren't

403
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:44,000
ready, will there be another bus? Is that rapture? What is tribulation, twixt now and

404
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:52,240
then? Is God standing with all the soul bits of self, of her himself, here and there now,

405
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:59,420
seeing all time, and this possible leap of evolution? Will we leap only by quality, or

406
00:22:59,420 --> 00:22:59,420


407
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,720
operative competition? What does the historic figure Jesus, Son of God, and Hugh Man signify?

408
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:16,340
Is the holy, ghostly, undermined mind, subconscious, racial, racial, memory, mythos, a communication

409
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:25,260
link? The precarnate being not past or future, but both from here and all one from there. Can we

410
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:25,660
remember?

411
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:44,480
In his deadening day, the dread dimes light smoking. In his great teasing chair, the dread

412
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:55,260
dimes light smoking. Piss your money away, there won't be no rainy day. Bob will sell

413
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:59,080
you all the sun. He's unlike me.

414
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,420
The Prejudice of the Dead.

415
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,600
The Holy, God.

416
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,080
The Kubin.

417
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:10,920
Thecipler.

418
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:10,920


419
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:10,920


420
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,980
The Spirit.

421
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:11,980


422
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,240
The Dojour.

423
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,620
The Katивать.

424
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:12,620


425
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:12,620


426
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:12,620


427
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,300
The

428
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,020
Theael.

429
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,400
The Ins пережicijngWANEDCHI, the

430
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:19,400


431
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:19,400


432
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:19,400


433
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:26,420
the desk in

434
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,180
Dallas,

435
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,560
Well, dread that it's smoking

436
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,320
Your mind is mirrored with those

437
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,720
Well, dread that it's smoking

438
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,860
Let up your pipe, let go the smoke

439
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,480
This is slack, it ain't no joke

440
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,940
Brace me to pop, lift up your chain

441
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,500
And you will pay to know what you think

442
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,120
But he ain't no man, he ain't no guy

443
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,760
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

444
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,180
He ain't no man, he ain't no guy

445
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:08,620
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

446
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,220
Now to continue with the tape recording.

447
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,360
We're going to see, get ready.

448
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,020
What I'm talking to you about today

449
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,860
is the most up-to-date thing that I could talk to you about.

450
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,500
We're living in the closing moments of this dispensation.

451
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,540
An old man finds it, touches it,

452
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,960
and this is the shocking result.

453
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,420
From then on, there's no stopping the bob

454
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,300
as it spreads from town to town.

455
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,440
It's indestructible, it's indescribable.

456
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,920
Nothing can stop it.

457
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,280
This town is in danger.

458
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,680
How can it be stopped?

459
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,740
Mob hysteria sweeps one city.

460
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,960
They go along the nation,

461
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,480
and then the world can leave threat of the bob.

462
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,920
Starring Stephen and a cast of exciting people.

463
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,560
Hundreds of New Yorkers at a religious revival

464
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,900
chanting the name of a modern-day prophet, Bob.

465
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,300
Oh, yes, dear friends.

466
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,600
Oh, and what a prophet he is, that crazy old Bob.

467
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,820
Well, I guess it's time for me to fill you in

468
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,500
on what you've been listening to here.

469
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,320
Wow, listen, I wanna listen to this for a second.

470
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,660
BEEP

471
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:45,720
BEEP

00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,100

00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,300


499
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,300


500
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,300


501
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,300


502
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,300


503
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,300


504
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,300


505
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,300


506
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,300


507
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,300


508
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,300


509
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,300


510
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,300


511
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,300


512
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,280
It's cool.

513
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,220
It's hot.

514
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,020
And yet it's...

515
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,060
so sinister, dear friends.

516
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,740
Uh...

517
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,920
Now I can switch my little tapes out

518
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,360
and tell you what you've been listening to.

519
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,380
Um...

520
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,540
A collage...

521
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,000
Going backwards in time.

522
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:19,980
Okay?

523
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,260
A collage from old subgenius media barrage tapes.

524
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,100
The subgenius...

525
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:31,120
song Dread Dobbs, that reggae song, is by Lost Souls Incorporated from Arlington, Texas.

526
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:40,020
The rant with flute and Robert Anton Wilson quotes was by Reverend Ficus Strangulensis,

527
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:50,740
I think from West Virginia, I may be wrong there. Some demon clips sent by Reverend Lou Minotti,

528
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:59,960
oh yes, up in Nashville, and the song Cloaking Device, the one about the UFOs, was by the

529
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:10,140
Ultimate Klingons, that's Reverend Nancy Darnell of Berlin, Germany, on vocals. And a lot of

530
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:17,100
best of hour of slack bits, with much Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence from the KPFA

531
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,720
subgenius show, and some little bit of the K-pop.

532
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:25,820
A little bit of G. Gordon Gordon heard there, G. Gordon Gordon was here this last weekend

533
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:33,740
at the show, but he was strictly doing security, and refused to come up on stage, really blaming.

534
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:45,320
And quite a few clips interspersed with that by Reverend Nick Nolan, oh dear friends.

535
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,500
So what do we do next? Heck, I've got a...

536
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,720
My...

537
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:56,900
I'm at an awkward point. A tape flipping point. But, well heck, why don't I tell you?

538
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:08,200
Who is Bob? Who... what... what indeed is Bob? Bob is tomorrow with a smile on his face.

539
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:17,120
He's progress with a pipe in his mouth. His enthusiasm, his sexuality, makes the world

540
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,720
go around. His friendly handshake meets the bar.

541
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,840
Scare me, though, but Bob is...

542
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,700
Aекотор coconut.

543
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,200
A cosmopolitan.

544
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,420
A tremendous with greatatroo...

545
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:32,780
operation..

546
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,840
What for?

547
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,320
A perfect...

548
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:35,320


549
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,540
A great rồi-jeu?

550
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,620
A great one there, King.

551
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,180
Wow…

552
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,180


553
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,700
W Jay joke…

554
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,800
Well, now, we may have to read the part again.

555
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,700
About...

556
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,940
He's part magician, part actor, part missionary.

557
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,640
He's peddler, huckster, pitchman.

558
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,760
He's the carnival barker of the world's biggest sideshow.

559
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,420
The world is his store.

560
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,080
He's one hell of a salesman, friend.

561
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,420
Oh, let's just pause and listen to this lovely music here

562
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,080
from Reverend Arnold Mathis.

563
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,040
Your pants to yourself.

564
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,440
Come on, I'll play you one more game.

565
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,920
Come on, I'll play you this.

566
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,800
Cleavage, cleavage, thighs and hips

567
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,900
From the nape of her neck to the lipstick lips

568
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,140
Chopped and channeled and lowered and lugered

569
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,900
And the cheetah sticks and baby moves

570
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,240
She's hot and ready, creamy and sugared

571
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,220
And the band is awful and so are the tunes

572
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,720
You've been bowing down to a false prophet.

573
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm those lucky enough to be fated to be in

574
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,160
I'm in.

575
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,420
Doctors for all of you.

576
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,540
Me, Doctors for Bob.

577
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,080
This music is from Food of the Gods by Arnold Mathis.

578
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,880
But you know, I just can't quit talking about old Bob.

579
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,460
You know, you can find Bob anywhere, everywhere.

580
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,620
In railroad Pullman cars.

581
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,220
In airport waiting rooms.

582
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,540
In the backs of buses.

583
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,740
On the highways.

584
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,720
Walking those downtown streets.

585
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,980
Cruising those downtown bars.

586
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,760
And cooped up in hotel rooms late at night

587
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,940
with three hookers and a jug of Jim Beam.

588
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,940
His satisfaction is a clean, fast sale.

589
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,500
To his competitors, he's death.

590
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,700
Presidents feared Bob.

591
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,980
Industrialists paid blackmail to him.

592
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,940
But their wives loved him.

593
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,080
And yet, the secretaries of alien space gods

594
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,760
make him wait in the outer office.

595
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,360
He's the ultimate salesman.

596
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,860
He's the man behind every surge of history.

597
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,080
Some Bob lost in the mists of history

598
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,380
sold the Mayflower to the Pilgrims

599
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:46,480
and taught the Indians into letting Manhattan Island go for 24 bucks.

600
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,600
Another Bob brokered tickets for the Hindenburg and the Titanic.

601
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,520
Behind every step of progress,

602
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,780
there's been a salesman peddling a dream.

603
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,200
He's a poker player, a dice shooter.

604
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:05,440
He's a politician, judge, teacher, public speaker,

605
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,380
psychologist, psychiatrist, minister,

606
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,500
petty thief, bigamist, and world dictator.

607
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,840
All wrapped up in a bundle of nervous energy.

608
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,480
He's the middleman between maker and user.

609
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,080
He's everybody's friend and no man's man.

610
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:32,080
He is the salesman.

611
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,660
He is.

612
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:41,680
The U.S. Air Force.

613
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,260
But I'm going to play this record right now from

614
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,800
Reverend Jay Condom, who wasn't in the DeVival,

615
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,400
but was certainly, well, in a way, he was.

616
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:06,580
And he's our good buddy, Reverend Jay Cotton,

617
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,160
Saint Jay Cotton, actually.

618
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,540
I mean, after all, he was co-creator of P-Dog.

619
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,320
He and his buddy, Gary Panter, have a new album out.

620
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,780
It's a British album.

621
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,700
Of course, called One Hell Sound Witch,

622
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,700
which you can actually find here and there, strangely enough.

623
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,020
And I'm going to play one little cut from this.

624
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,160
I think it speaks for itself quite plainly.

625
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,380
All right, you sex monks, come on.

626
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,520
We're going to sing punk songs for everybody.

627
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,080
So you get ready, and you kids at home,

628
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:46,880
get out your cellphones.

629
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,300
If you can.

630
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,360
What do you say?

631
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:48,960
Let's go.

632
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,780
Shies to cough.

633
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,000
God save the queen.

634
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:54,820
Carnivore.

635
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,800
The fascist reign.

636
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,540
They made you a moron.

637
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,300
Awful.

638
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,480
Protect your wife's butt.

639
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,700
God save the queen.

640
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,860
She ain't no human being.

641
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,140
There is no future.

642
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,840
And England's dreaming.

643
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:22,140
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

644
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,720
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

645
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,560
No future for you.

646
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,980
You, just you and we, God save the queen.

647
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,020
We need em', man.

648
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,180
We sure like girls.

649
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,400
God save.

650
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,860
Hey, I think we sound like real punk rockers.

651
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,880
We want to have a quarter.

652
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:46,880


653
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:46,880


654
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,040
Well, gee, I don't know, fellas.

655
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,440
I've heard some punk records, and that just doesn't sound like one to me.

656
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,620
So what do you say?

657
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,560
Let's try it again.

658
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,060
God save the queen.

659
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,920
Cause tourists are money.

660
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,080
And our figurehead.

661
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,260
She's not what she seems.

662
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,040
God save history.

663
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,500
God save your natural life.

664
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,640
Lord God have mercy.

665
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,400
All crimes are paid.

666
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,980
We're the future.

667
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,520
Your future.

668
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,860
God save the queen.

669
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,740
We need it, man.

670
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,820
We love your queen.

671
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,720
And we love you too, Mr. President.

672
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,140
Look, fellas.

673
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,560
I think there's a certain tendency.

674
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,260
There's a certain intimidation factor missing here.

675
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,160
I think our music is faster and more intense.

676
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,180
Why didn't you say so?

677
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,500
Then we'll do this one rock and roll.

678
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,260
Wonderful idea.

679
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,540
God save the queen.

680
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,380
Like we need it, dayo.

681
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,380
We did boss chicks.

682
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,080
God save, right?

683
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:08,820
Man.

684
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,340
No future.

685
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,900
No future.

686
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,620
No future.

687
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:15,620


688
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,260
No future.

689
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,220
For you.

690
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,920
No future.

691
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,000
No future.

692
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,860
No future.

693
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:29,960
For me.

694
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,360
No future.

695
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,660
No future.

696
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,620
No future.

697
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,480
For all you Kingets.

698
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,120
Have chat.

699
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,620
No future.

700
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:45,620
No future boy.

701
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,820
Well, dear friends, what can I say?

702
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,740
That's pretty bone-chilling, actually.

703
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,860
We are going to play another song coming up.

704
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,220
Oh, listen, this is also on the album,

705
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,500
for those of you who are big fans of that song.

706
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,260
Lee Harvey is a friend of mine.

707
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:14,260
That's on One Hell Sandwich by Jay Condom and Gary Panter.

708
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:20,980
And, dear friends, we're going to play some music by John Bartles,

709
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:28,680
one of my favorite independent self-producing mouseshins out there.

710
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,480
Frightening fellow, John Bartles.

711
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:38,540
Also, I guess, either he's known as Joe Schmoe or he has a tape called Joe Schmoe.

712
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:43,340
But I think Dr. Howell can introduce this one better.

713
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,020
Okay, friends?

714
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:44,360
Here.

715
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,760
I'd like to dedicate this next song to all of you who are out there listening to the show.

716
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,700
On the show.

717
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,300
It's spooky.

718
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,300
Being with us tonight here.

719
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:52,840
It's poody.

720
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:58,460
It's almost 6 o'clock, but we still have a little fun and good cheer to go around.

721
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,620
We're still trying to find out where the fun and good cheer went.

722
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,680
And we're going to see the night out with you, our audience.

723
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,160
As we all feel good about the show.

724
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,300
Feel good about our mission here on the air.

725
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,140
It's our nameless mission.

726
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,920
Ain't got no name.

727
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,120
It's just...

728
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:14,700
A mission.

729
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,940
It's what we gotta do.

730
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,940
We don't say why we do what we do, but you kinda know.

731
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,380
Otherwise, well, you wouldn't be listening.

732
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:30,620
Well, you get all them old paint cans and I'll get the old tires.

733
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,980
Go on and bring anything that you're eye desires.

734
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,280
We're gonna have a party.

735
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,360
And I ain't gonna lie.

736
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,260
Come on, come on.

737
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,440
We're gonna have a toxic fire.

738
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,520
Yep, bring that old mattress in there.

739
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,860
Oh, there it's all canned.

740
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,680
It's gonna be a blowout.

741
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,940
I'm telling you, man.

742
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,040
Bring that old wearing a cape center

743
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,800
and that old swimming pool liner.

744
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,400
Come on, come on, come on.

745
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,360
We're gonna have a toxic fire.

746
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,440
We're gonna have a toxic fire.

747
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:28,960
We're gonna have a toxic fire.

748
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,280
We're gonna have a toxic fire.

749
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,320
We're gonna have a toxic fire.

750
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,580
We're gonna have a toxic fire.

751
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,540
Throw on them old car batteries

752
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,480
and that old leaky transformer.

753
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,700
Hey, hold off on that insecticide

754
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,800
till the fire gets a little bit warmer.

755
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,340
Keep on that old asbestos till your arms get tired.

756
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,660
Come on, come on, come on.

757
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,460
We're having us a toxic fire.

758
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,040
A big toxic fire.

759
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,060
You bring the hot dogs for the kids

760
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,340
and I'll bring the beer.

761
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,420
I'll be calling in sick tomorrow.

762
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,100
I know I'll be feeling kind of weird.

763
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,500
We're going to party till they drop

764
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,780
and I ain't no liar.

765
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,860
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

766
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,840
We're going to have a toxic fire.

767
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,020
Yeah.

768
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,680
On top of old Smokey.

769
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,040
Oh.

770
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,300
Oh.

771
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:30,760
Oh.

772
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,720
Oh.

773
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:32,400


774
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,980
Oh.

775
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,600
Oh.

776
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:36,640


777
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:36,640


778
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:36,640


779
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:36,640


780
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:36,640


781
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:36,640


782
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:36,640


783
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:36,640


784
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:47,600
Well, we gotta do something to get in time

785
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:47,880
before it gets too late.

786
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,500
Jack now said,

787
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:48,580


788
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,040
Thelisted like outspoken to everybody.

789
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,400
I mean, it's a wantedader to have that

790
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:49,400


791
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:49,400


792
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,740
On the stove, kluff.

793
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,160
I'm sorry.

794
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,160


795
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:54,900


796
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:54,900


797
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:54,900


798
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,680
We have to figure out one way

799
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,420
to make it out to the front,

800
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,000
because if you were flying every two miles in the future I might even

801
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,240
try making a fire.

802
00:42:59,240 --> 00:42:59,520
Not gonna lie.

803
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,320
You have to find out a different way.

804
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,060
In the future, I might even tell you the whole story.

805
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,440
I can't do it.

806
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,540
Just ask KAREN SILVERS ABOUT her man camera.

807
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,080
Zeal.

808
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:11,400
girls too and we wouldn't dream of telling her how to wear it. We do have

809
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,480
one very practical rule though that says hair should be kept above the collar

810
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,000
while on duty just like any professional girl in uniform and there's a one big

811
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,600
regulation about those uniforms that they make a girl look like one. It's their

812
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:29,860
patriotic duty to stay looking trim and attractive. A girl in the wax looks great

813
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:33,980
because she feels great and she can take the hair off her legs with the wax.

814
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,880
About the world of travel, new friends and job opportunities she's discovered.

815
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:42,420
So please indicate and eradicate your education in your coupon or letter.

816
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,460
The world is bigger in the Woman's Army Corps.

817
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:56,200
Let me see I was looking in my sermon this morning and it said that Bob who

818
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,660
being in very nature Dobbs did not consider equality with anti Bob

819
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,800
something to be grasped, clutched or palpated, but rather spoke in his living

820
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,800
pipe like a fine burly or rum soaked shag. He himself nothing taking the very nay

821
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,480
sure taking instead the very nature of a salesman never taking no for an answer.

822
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:20,220
And being in appearance as a man he fumbled himself in the dark staining the

823
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,360
sheets and became obedient to everyone.

824
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,580
Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether this cult, that cult or

825
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,780
for that matter any cult should so be.

826
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,820
We are met on a great potter's field of that war.

827
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,920
These bland pinks living and dead shall little know nor long remember what we do here.

828
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,900
By the way I forget just what is it that we are doing here anyway.

829
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:52,700
Oh yeah right it is for we the living to confess that J.R. Bob Dobbs is dead dead dead.

830
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,180
To the infinite gratification of Jehovah one the father, senile infinitely maligned space god.

831
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,760
Jesus came here as a servant but Dobbs came as a salesman for scriptures, chapters, and verses.

832
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:11,980
And he came unto the daughters of the farmers and knew them well when there was no room for him to be by himself during the night.

833
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:18,760
And in the morning before the sunrise he continued traveling upon his route so that the franchise might not be usurped.

834
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:22,520
Yea and to this day it never hath been so.

835
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,100
Bob's is still the route, Bob's is still the franchise.

836
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:31,340
And now as sister Basilica passes out among you as she sniffs the contents of the collection plate.

837
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,760
Each and every one of you should reach down to the collection plate.

838
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:33,760


839
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:39,540
And deep down and give, give to the church of the powerful blinding apostasy.

840
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,860
Which clears no throne but exalts in its own freedom to scatter its fundaments on the earth.

841
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:49,400
Soiling the uppers of its shoes to let down the inward produced product of its concentration.

842
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,860
Fertilizing the fields of science, sorcery, art, and religion.

843
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,240
For lo the frop clouds my brain and my buckler and shield are ripped away.

844
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,280
I am naked before thee Dobbs all neck-on.

845
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,760
I am the one who has unbuckled my buckler and unsnapped my shield.

846
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,340
Which was my sole protection.

847
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,820
Yea my buckler being so unbuckled I am even as a pro-bucker buck naked before Bob.

848
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,320
Bob dashes a bucket of ice water over my loins.

849
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,880
The buck passeth not while the buck and the doe dwell in the same forest.

850
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,580
The buck is Bob, he is bucking tradition.

851
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,420
He changeth grip-bats into buckets of bucks.

852
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,960
Bucks, bucks, yea bucks, bucks.

853
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,200
But are awkward bucks, difficult to explain away.

854
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,780
I am chicken before my epoch.

855
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,180
Yea, foul like the birds of the ground.

856
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,620
Neuronitus chapter 13 verse 6.

857
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,360
Sick, sick is this world, O Bob, who hast be slimed to the ground after thee.

858
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,700
Even like unto the slugs and snails of the garden.

859
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,680
Whose chambered shell we may step on and flush inadvertently.

860
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,820
Thou art not the healer but the pharmacist.

861
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,600
For thou dost sell unto us thy remedy of slack.

862
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:00,820
And it is unto us that we pay over to you the price which thou dost ask.

863
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,840
Namely all that we have.

864
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,100
We shall put it therefore in the envelope and send it in.

865
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:09,220
For the exits are nearly upon us and the sale ends tomorrow.

866
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,320
Going out of business, all prices slack.

867
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,860
Everything must go.

868
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:18,400
So ask not upon what day shall the tithe be sent.

869
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,480
Or unless ye know otherwise, every day is Dom's day.

870
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,640
And ye never know when the master cometh again.

871
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,000
The vegetables take over.

872
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,140
The vegetables take over.

873
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,620
The vegetables take over.

874
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,720
The vegetables take over.

875
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:32,880
The vegetables take over.

876
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,320
But those are important messages.

877
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,480
That we have lost this hour and morning.

878
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:44,600
And those trying to find their religion amongst the biblographs of the tower of communication,

879
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:50,160
that this and all other situations represent.

880
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,720
Yeah, no kidding there, puzzling evidence.

881
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,060
Oh, holy grace.

882
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:01,560
Oh, holy grace.

883
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,580
Merry Christmas, kids.

884
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,460
Fantastic rant there by Dr. Howell.

885
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,460
The great Dr. Howell.

886
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,880
What is this in the background?

887
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,300
Oh, man, this unbelievable piece of tape here.

888
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:33,420
This, just very briefly, is a bootleg of Jimi Hendrix playing in a club with Johnny Winter

889
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:40,980
and with Jim Morrison very, very, very drunk on vocals.

890
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:47,020
Every now and then you hear Jim holler out something that has nothing to do with the jam.

891
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:13,240
Well, I'm not going to expose you non-Hendrix fanatics to that for too long.

892
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:22,240
I did want to mention that, yeah, you heard a wonderful, the Buckler sermon there by Dr. Howell from the KPFA show.

893
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,640
A little brief.

894
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,000
Yeah.

895
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:26,280
Yeah.

896
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:26,280


897
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:26,280


898
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:26,280


899
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:26,280


900
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:30,940
The Women's Army Corps thing there was from a Firesign Theater bootleg.

901
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,600
That's something you may not hear too often.

902
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:41,240
And also their Toxic Fire by John Bartles from the Joe Schmo album.

903
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,460
Yeah, right.

904
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,780
So what do I find?

905
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,980
What background music do I find?

906
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:06,960
Well, I think you're going to have to listen to the Subgenius Hour of Slack radio ministry of the Church of the Subgenius here on KNON.

907
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:14,240
Well, come to think of it, you may not be listening to it on that station.

908
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:24,080
But if you're listening right now, right this particular now, the real now, not the tape now, then that's what it is.

909
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,380
And, oh, I should.

910
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,280
Yeah, baby.

911
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,820
Thanks, Dr. Tim.

912
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:43,160
Like I say, next week we'll be playing the revival tapes or the vival tapes, actually.

913
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,620
The video that came from that was great.

914
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,620
And the sound on the video is great.

915
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:54,060
Now, I wish I had just the simple VHS editing equipment that I need to use.

916
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,320
I need to edit that stuff together.

917
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:00,220
You know, and I don't mean two home decks with a pause button.

918
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,340
I mean, you know, with the controller, right?

919
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,240
Clean cuts, insert edits and all that.

920
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,040
Of course, if I had something like that, I'd spend all my time cutting video.

921
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,940
Then we'd have a cable show.

922
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:21,900
Anyway, anybody who could actually, seriously, anybody can offer, donate such equipment to

923
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,040
the church and the radio station.

924
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,620
So we can make great pledge premiums out of it.

925
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:27,880
Call.

926
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,360
And any videos that you have, please let us know.

927
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,980
You are listening, of course, to the sub, wait a minute, I said that.

928
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,700
No, what I need to say is if you need more information, if this is the first time you've

929
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:49,240
ever heard anything like this and just, we're going to church or the what, please write

930
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,160
for free information.

931
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:54,020
I mean, if you just do so much as drop us a post.

932
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,020


933
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,020


934
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,020


935
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,580
Postcard with your address on it.

936
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,580
Address to Bob.

937
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,040
We will send you, we won't, don't worry.

938
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,900
We won't show up at your door.

939
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,080
Not at first anyway.

940
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,600
Not unless you invite us.

941
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,620
Just write to Bob.

942
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,620
Got that pencil ready?

943
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,260
At post office box.

944
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,840
One four zero three zero six.

945
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,120
That's one four oh three oh six.

946
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,240
Dallas, Texas.

947
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,840
Seven five two one.

948
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:24,020
Okay.

949
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,480
That's one four.

950
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:28,540
But I'm going to switch over to this beautiful instrumental music.

951
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:29,860
Huh?

952
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:37,780
Yeah, I'm going to switch over to this lovely background music by Jay Condom.

953
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:47,680
Because I wanted to tell you about, now this is some readings here from the new book of

954
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,580
the subgenius, the one that's in progress, the one we're so late with.

955
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,120
Chapter three.

956
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:58,520
Chapter three of Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon.

957
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,300
The difference between Bob and Jesus.

958
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,160
Is there one?

959
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:17,940
Prior to Jesus, the alien space god, Jehovah One, primarily used fear tactics and brute

960
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:22,980
force on his test subjects, the humans and yet himself.

961
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:32,720
And then, in biblical days, through his own direct intervention, this produced strictly

962
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:38,580
temporary mutations in us, often just the opposite of the evolutionary direction he

963
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,420
desired.

964
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:47,620
Because the insertion of a prophet or similar extra evolved catalyst often supplied Jehovah

965
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:55,480
One's test rats, surprisingly enough, with a measure of hope for improvement against

966
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:02,320
insurmountable odds, granting them a smidgen of the same force that the gods themselves

967
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:08,980
use, bringing them closer and closer to being competitors with him.

968
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:17,600
And with Jesus and later Muhammad, Jehovah One hoped to produce a better mouse race.

969
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:23,980
One which would lure and motivate his uncooperative puppets in the directions he willed.

970
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,320
He very quickly became impatient with the results and took a new tack by immaculating

971
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:38,580
the humble yet unbeknownst to him already holy salesman J.R. Bob Dobbs.

972
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:42,180
Very pronounced by some, Jaw Dobbs.

973
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:47,580
The space god had realized that previously his directives were to be the same as his own.

974
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,600
He had to be a little more careful.

975
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,100
He was afraid of the fact that the message would be garbled badly.

976
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,960
But as Rev. John Shirley tells us, Bob is the sub-Jesus, acting as a living submarine

977
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,320
in the sump of human sin.

978
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:14,520
Jesus didn't walk on the water, he cruised under it, as should we all, readying our psychic

979
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,560
torpedoes for the destruction of the world.

980
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:17,560


981
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:17,560


982
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:17,560


983
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:47,560
He was someone who knew Mes온 Flip today, young J mold suffered the worst grief they

984
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:55,300
pet project and he had chosen Bob to head it. But instead, Dobbs organized the counter-conspiracy

985
00:55:55,300 --> 00:56:03,340
and re-established contact with the Exis, trying to resell this pitiful planet right out from under

986
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:13,160
the conspiracy slave masters. It is a measure of just how non-omnipotent Jehovah One is that he

987
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:20,660
had not noticed that the modern Bob was simply the most recent of a long line of Bobs, each growing

988
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:27,660
in power with each reincarnation, stretching back to the first Bob, the High Yeti of Mutantis,

989
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:36,520
which, ironically enough, Jehovah One had himself instructed the Exis to create. How could God,

990
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:42,820
a quote, God, not realize he was spilling his trade secrets to his

991
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,140
own people?

992
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:54,380
He just happened to pick the wrong Messiah, that's all. And that, dear friends, that is how

993
00:56:54,380 --> 00:57:04,220
lucky J.R. Bob Dobbs is. He can successfully do battle with the gods themselves, without even

994
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:13,040
meaning to, without even meaning to, and yet using the powers that they gave him.

995
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:23,580
Ah yes, my friends, Bob is a watershed of the mind, the Chaos King Father of a new society.

996
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:31,820
He spent his life exhorting people to pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety

997
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:37,180
of your own delusions, as he puts it, yet his parables often have just the opposite effect.

998
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:42,580
People line up, dollar in hand, hoping to relax in the safety of his delusions,

999
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:50,800
proving to themselves by giving him money, that they too are truly stupid. Many who donate are

1000
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:56,960
lawyers, doctors, computer scientists, religious leaders, and famous artists. They intuitively

1001
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:02,720
know that as the years progress, their incomes and peace of mind will be increasingly dependent

1002
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:10,920
not on their cleverness, their critical sense, but on their lack thereof. You see, Bob's plan

1003
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,620
has succeeded financially, and he's been able to do it. He's been able to do it for a long time,

1004
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:12,920
and he's been able to do it for a long time, and he's been able to do it for a long time,

1005
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:17,420
simply by predicating itself upon the deteriorating intellectual environment.

1006
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:24,620
It appeals, ultimately, to those who have recognized that environment for what it is,

1007
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:34,160
and now try to profit from its very ineffectuality. This church of the subgenius is composed of people

1008
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:41,160
who have learned the classic textbook definition of sanity, and who can mimic its legal appearance.

1009
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:50,720
They can enjoy the exact opposite in the privacy of their own homes, and in the invisible secret workings of their careers.

1010
00:58:51,560 --> 00:59:00,620
We call this practice schizophreniatrics, and we call this show, friends, the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack,

1011
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:10,640
and why it looks like it's time, oh so sad, but it's time for us to move on, and vacate the airwaves for

1012
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,600
something new.

1013
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:27,380
We'll be no doubt a great deal nicer and prettier, but I will leave you with this heavenly music composed by the great Saint Jay Condom

1014
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:36,360
on his album, Zombo Fropland, available only from subgenius records and tapes, as far as I know.

1015
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:41,300
Oh no, it's not. It's not available from subgenius records and tapes.

1016
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,440
It's only available from...

1017
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:46,800
From Jay, but his address has changed from the one that...

1018
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,180
Oh well.

1019
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:51,440
Hey, friends, it's just a fun little family we have here.

1020
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,880
Just a family of friends.

1021
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,920
And we did have a great New Year's celebration.

1022
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,720
Wonderful time, and it even made money.

1023
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:12,260
The most important part of this, and really, the survival of any viable world.

1024
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:12,960
A very tasty strawberry toilets.

1025
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,620
Praise Bob and thank you, so much.

1026
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,200
What for, I'm not sure.

1027
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,000
Music

1028
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:30,580
Death

1029
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,000
quem

1030
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,160
Filthy

1031
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,220
Apocryphal

1032
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:42,220


1033
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:42,600
Fortune

1034
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,940
I'll wait around the train station

1035
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:58,740
Waiting for my train

1036
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:01,480
To take me

1037
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,680
Take me away

1038
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,700
From this

1039
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,740
Lonesome town

1040
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:17,220
Lonesome town

1041
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,120
Lonesome town

1042
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,380
Lonesome town
