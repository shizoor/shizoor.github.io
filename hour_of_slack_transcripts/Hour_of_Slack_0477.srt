1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
When they say, repent, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:19,680
When they say, repent, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:29,660
When they say, repent, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.

4
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:45,280
Give me that burning wall, give me stone and St. Paul, give me Christ or give me Hiroshima.

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,660
Give me the burning wall, destroy the law.

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,840
Mother feed us now, we're doing that children anyhow.

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,780
I've seen the future, baby, it is murder.

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,080
Things are gonna slide, in all directions.

9
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:13,220
There won't be nothing, nothing you can't measure anymore.

10
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,660
The prison, the blood of the world is across the...

11
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,820
...threshold and it's over, turn the order of the soul.

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:35,520
When they say, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.

13
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:45,440
When they say, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.

14
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,660
When they say, repent, repent...

15
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:10,580
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

16
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:27,020
Now, holy men have pointed out that brains are like radios that can be tuned, and the will is like a gun that can be aimed. Some aim better than others.

17
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,180
These occurrences are pure figments of imagination.

18
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:55,020
Everything you know is wrong, every note of every song, every truth you've ever known are lies.

19
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:06,120
People know what they believe, but nothing's really up their sleeve.

20
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,340
They try to hide their faith in this.

21
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,460
They try.

22
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:28,100
JFK and grassy nose, dinosaurs and hosannas, desert storms and somebody's brains are drugs.

23
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,160
Everything you know is wrong.

24
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,860
Smash a little egg with a frying pan.

25
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,840
Fry it up.

26
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,360
Cook it up.

27
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,240
Serve it.

28
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,560
Serve it.

29
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,300
Serve it on a sandwich.

30
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,880
We'll be right back.

31
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,240
We'll be right back.

32
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:49,980
We'll be right back.

33
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,020
We'll be right back.

34
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:54,020
We'll be right back.

35
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:35,240
We'll be right back.

36
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,520
We'll be right back.

37
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,820
We'll be right back.

38
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,400
We'll be right back.

39
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,040
We'll be right back.

40
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,060
We'll be right back.

41
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:11,940
We'll be right back.

42
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,500
We'll be right back.

43
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,240
We'll be right back.

44
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,760
We'll be right back.

45
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,820
We'll be right back.

46
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,100
We'll be right back.

47
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,700
We'll be right back.

48
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,200
We'll be right back.

49
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,660
We'll be right back.

50
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,060
We'll be right back.

51
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,960
word of Bob. Of course, you always have the random unpredictable audience participation,

52
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:55,140
which may include healing of the sick, sickening of the healthy, performances of, yes, anti-music,

53
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:03,900
sing-alongs, hate-alongs, and the occasional self-emolation. That's what it says right here

54
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,880
in the paper, so we've got to live up to that, and we also have to live up to that description

55
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,680
from Christina Tate, who, I'll remind you, said,

56
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:18,680
Delight in the visage of the one true slackmaster as your old life burns away and your hate-lust

57
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,620
is quenched in an endless ejaculation of loathing and scorn!

58
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:36,380
Oh, Christina. It's wonderful net, don't you see? Oh, yeah, and special guest stars,

59
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,300
Lunch Cowboy Dave.

60
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,000
Herman Neck.

61
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,240
Dr.

62
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:38,860
Chow.

63
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,200
Chaz.

64
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,500
The Einstein Secret Orchestra.

65
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:49,880
Live, right there, to be abused, right for Dr. Katad Legume, the scariest Yankee subgenius

66
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:58,500
preacher, the terrifying, mysterious Pennsylvania redneck investments, carrying a chainsaw,

67
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,460
the mystic chainsaw.

68
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:08,760
The great Dr. Legume, one of the all-time natural, from-the-gut subgenius ranters.

69
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,880
For a sweet pop music band called Forms of Insanity.

70
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,180
Oh, yeah, those guys are great.

71
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,260
Yeah, Reverend Toth Wilder's band.

72
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,880
They do a charming rendition of the old raunch song, Hey Bob Rebab.

73
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,000
Hey Bob Rebab!

74
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,100
Hey Bob Rebab!

75
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,440
Hey Bob Rebab!

76
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,600
Hey Bob Rebab!

77
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,900
Hey Bob Rebab!

78
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:04,220
The old rooster to the little red hen.

79
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,240
Coming over, baby, let pop us.

80
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,700
Oh, I can't see.

81
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:16,580
You'll have to come to the show to learn the real lyrics to Louie Louie and Frank Zappa's King Kong.

82
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,420
We have the secret videotapes.

83
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:19,720
Oh, yeah.

84
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,260
You know those totally weird tapes?

85
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:23,960
That's so genius.

86
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,900
One of those genius shows.

87
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:32,520
It was like they had these video projections that were like I was frapped to the gills.

88
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,300
But when I walked into there, man, it was like I was just.

89
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,880
It was like I was on.

90
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,140
I was on head.

91
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,340
You know, it's like I was on bleeding head on the magnetized.

92
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:47,040
It was like these these visions of like Bob entered my mind because it was like so psychedelic up on that screen.

93
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,640
And there were these guys were like screaming about hating the normal people.

94
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,340
And I was I was like, yeah, this guy handed me this pipe and it had like.

95
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,300
Could you dim the lights a little bit so I don't get too nervous and be myself?

96
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:05,720
I'm selfish.

97
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,580
Shit.

98
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,620
I may have a problem with my holding my bladder for the past seven and a half years.

99
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,960
I've been in and out of mental institutions and as a form of therapy.

100
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,460
They put me on a radio station.

101
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:27,560
And throughout this time, I was attended to by a shamanistic Indian holistic medicine man named Psychopath Finder.

102
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:36,640
But throughout this time, I was attempted to be incarcerated back in the Sebring State Mental Institution by by an evil Neo Freud.

103
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:44,880
It found me with noĞ¼e seemed to care if some some certain revalidate.

104
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,260
Now withally, I got Goldberg who told me only ï¿½çº† Grandma was dead.

105
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,860
Why, for justice me

106
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,920
Yeah, she felt great suffering there.

107
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,620
But every century, there's been men and women who we're saddened by it.

108
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,500
I'll tell you how I found Bob.

109
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,020
I found Bob in parades of Russians on Route 90 on the

110
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,620
shoreway driving by, masturbating and

111
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,140
ejaculating strange cries.

112
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,440
I found Bob in a bad onion breath in a bodega in New York.

113
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,820
I found Bob in a bad poor boy sandwich with rancid ham.

114
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:34,560
And I realized that maybe I should search, search, search,

115
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,520
search, search, search, and find religion.

116
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,840
Because after all, my life as a substance abuser was going

117
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,200
nowhere.

118
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,020
I said I'll stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby.

119
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,720
I said I'll stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby.

120
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,540
Because I'm a man.

121
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:04,640
I'm a man.

122
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:04,640


123
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:04,640


124
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:04,640


125
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:04,640


126
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:04,640


127
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,000
Because you kick him in the face, and then you get such a

128
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,700
disgrace the way you treat him, and you treat him, and you

129
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,000
treat him.

130
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,120
.

131
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,540
And it was at that time, I began to write songs for

132
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:18,980
therapy.

133
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,880
And in a hallucination and a midnight vestigial, I heard the

134
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,520
Yeti cry.

135
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,160
.

136
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:28,720
He!

137
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,840
I said I'll stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby.

138
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,720
Hey, was I cross-eyed when I started playing?

139
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,980
Dude, whoa, you're getting way out there again.

140
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,980
Good, man, because it was like, I don't know, I was going like, Bob, what is this Bob?

141
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,220
And I was going, yeah, I can dig it, because they're into slack.

142
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,460
You know, I'm like, I can dig that.

143
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,320
I could, you know, cut me some slack.

144
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,580
I'll use some slack.

145
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,080
And then, yeah, Bob, okay.

146
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:08,400
But then they started like, I suddenly, they gave me another one of those pills.

147
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,180
And suddenly I thought to myself, like, I'm a drug abuser, man.

148
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,620
I'm destroying my body.

149
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
I'm like wrecking myself.

150
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,260
And so I thought, well, I've got to get off these conspiracy street drugs, like Bob says,

151
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,680
and get one of those machines they were selling.

152
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,660
Because you could, like, turn it up.

153
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,920
It was a mind machine.

154
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,240
And it would, like, squeeze the middle of your head, man.

155
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,520
It would put you out there, man.

156
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,900
And you'd, like, see Bob.

157
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,220
You'd see Bob.

158
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,520
And then you'd turn it all the way up to 10.

159
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,600
Yeah, and you'd puke.

160
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,020
But it was cool.

161
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,600
It was like you'd puke, and it was cool.

162
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,180
You started crying.

163
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,180
Yeah, you cried.

164
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,460
Yeah, excuse me.

165
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,360
And you'd, like, you'd, like, soil yourself, man.

166
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,420
Soil it, yeah.

167
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,120
Soil it.

168
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,820
Soil it green.

169
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,240
Yeah.

170
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,080
Soil it green, man.

171
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:53,660
Yeah.

172
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:53,960


173
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,080


174
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,200
Yeah.

175
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,200


176
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,200


177
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,360
Do that.

178
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,640
That was cool.

179
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,040
And, yeah, they were selling it.

180
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,720
Soil it green was, like, 50 cents.

181
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,940
Well, I didn't do any of that stuff, man.

182
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,620
It was, like, made from normal people or something.

183
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,160
They said.

184
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,580
If I'd done that, I would have tried it.

185
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,340
They had me sign this paper.

186
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,900
I signed up for it.

187
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,020
That's what they told me.

188
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,240
I'd be on the waiting list to get some of it.

189
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,220
If I died, like, they'd, like, something about Bob's basement.

190
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,920
Something about Bob Dobbs' basement?

191
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,800
Bob.

192
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:23,820
I don't know.

193
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,720
Man, when my parents see this Bob tattoo I got on my forehead, they're gonna, like, freak,

194
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,080
dude.

195
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,980
Whoa, dude.

196
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,660
There's no tattoo on your forehead.

197
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,600
Yeah, this Bob tattoo.

198
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,040
Yeah, man.

199
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,700
It's, like, the invisible mark of the beast.

200
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,940
I got one on my hand, too.

201
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,400
Whoa, dude.

202
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,140
Where'd you get that?

203
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:39,980
You know what, Dad?

204
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,940
The subgenius revival down there, man.

205
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,320
Like, the Art Institute.

206
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,980
The factory building.

207
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,100
They were doing it, man.

208
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,060
Like, tomorrow night.

209
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,060
It's time control.

210
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,240
I was there.

211
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,260
It's tomorrow night.

212
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,100
It's time control, dude.

213
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,520
Bob made time control.

214
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,080
He invented it, like, Slack, man.

215
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,260
He invented money, man.

216
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,660
Bob invented money.

217
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,700
Wow, man.

218
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,400
Yeah, and dogs.

219
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,040
He invented dogs, man.

220
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,400
That's what they said in the alien times.

221
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,020
You did, like, Bob, Dad.

222
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,360
Of mutantas.

223
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,620
I found out I was reincarnated, dude.

224
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,500
This priestess.

225
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,640
Like, there were these priestesses, dude.

226
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,440
Dressed like nurses.

227
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
Wow, priestesses.

228
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:13,760
God.

229
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,080
Yeah.

230
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,940
And they'd come up and they'd, like.

231
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,280
They had big ones?

232
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,400
They had a whole bunch of them.

233
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:19,860
Wow.

234
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,500
I never saw so many.

235
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:21,680
Man.

236
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,540
Well, they, it wasn't that.

237
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,640
They were, they were moving, though.

238
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,740
Ah, the sausage man was there.

239
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,040
And they, they were, they were like these, this chick.

240
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,100
She, like, read my, my, my third nostril, she said.

241
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:41,360
And she said I was reincarnated from, like, this yeti master of mutantas in the days of dinosaurs.

242
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,080
And I was, yeah, I was like a king, man.

243
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:49,800
But then I misused my powers, so that's why I had to pay for it by working down there at White Castle.

244
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,940
That's what happens, man.

245
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,900
You don't want.

246
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,080
Yeah, it's like my karma.

247
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,660
But it's, you know, that's what, that's what this priestess said.

248
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,160
And I was like.

249
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,580
Wow.

250
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,660
She acted like she might go out with me.

251
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,120
She was bad, man.

252
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,080
No way.

253
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,340
I think I got some karma, man.

254
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,100
She had them, like, all over her.

255
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,060
She had them on her legs, dude.

256
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,280
She had, like, these globular round objects on her, on her ankles, man.

257
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,740
They were, like, on the side of her head hanging off.

258
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,680
It was like, it was, I was so turned on, dude.

259
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,760
She was, she was like.

260
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,240
I was like, I'm a angel.

261
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,340
I was into it.

262
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,100
I was like, man, if this Bob Church, if they're, it's gonna be like this.

263
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,460
And they have the karma with the little fingers on it.

264
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,360
The purple fingers.

265
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,220
Sometimes those globes ooze, too.

266
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,480
Yeah, man.

267
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,400
Especially the priestess chicks, man.

268
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,780
They ooze big time.

269
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,780
I knew this guy that had some, too.

270
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,860
You never knew anybody like that.

271
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,680
That had what?

272
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,300
The karma with the fingers on it.

273
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,260
The rotating karma.

274
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,520
You smoked the karma with the fingers on it.

275
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,940
You smoked good chicken.

276
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,280
Oh, yeah.

277
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,760
Wait a minute.

278
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:51,880
I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom.

279
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:51,880


280
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:51,880


281
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:51,880


282
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,820
Dude, you never tried this.

283
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,880
You smoked the chicken, and then you put, like, the 50 cents in the rotator bed, and the karma

284
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,420
comes and, like, you know.

285
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,040
Oh, dude.

286
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,860
So, and he oozed, right?

287
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,600
He oozed.

288
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,160
Yeah, that's the lubricant, man.

289
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,120
That's the KY jelly.

290
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,640
Cool.

291
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,500
Yeah.

292
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,320
Cool.

293
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,640
Yeah.

294
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:08,500
Whatever.

295
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,540
Yeah.

296
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,520
Oh, I wouldn't try that.

297
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,080
Did you try that, man?

298
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:20,420
Like, the other day, I said, hey, hey, mom, I'm getting, like, the slack has, like, shaved

299
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,100
into my haircut and back.

300
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,060
It says slack.

301
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:30,060
And she goes, hey, like, if all your friends were in it and jumped off the edge of a cliff,

302
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,060
would you, like, do it?

303
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,940
I would, man.

304
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,880
Yeah, man.

305
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,540
Yeah.

306
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,520
I did that once, man.

307
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,040
Jumped into the abyss, man.

308
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,520
Jumped into the abyss.

309
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,640
Yeah, there's things that suck your soul in there, dude.

310
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,600
If you go all the way in the abyss, man, there are, like, these, like, things that suck your

311
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:49,940
soul.

312
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,100
I did that when I was 14.

313
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,920
Yeah, there was this dude there.

314
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,700
They had, like, this devival thing, this subgenius thing.

315
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,520
They had, like, this spook house, dude.

316
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,600
And there was this trap door, and you'd go in there, and you'd pay 50 cents, and they'd

317
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,440
say, see the thing, and you'd go in there, and they'd just leave you in this room with

318
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,260
this trap door.

319
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,000
Are we gonna be...

320
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,960
And, like, the high priest would look at you and go, whatever you do, kid, like, don't

321
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,360
knock on that door three times and say, yog sa thoth.

322
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,860
And then they'd, like, leave.

323
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,680
Oh, man.

324
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,720
And you'd be in there, and you'd, like, go...

325
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,260
You gotta do it.

326
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,140
Yeah, you gotta.

327
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,860
But then I got kind of...

328
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,060
Because Bob said no, too, right?

329
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,140
But then I thought, well, but they made me pay 50 cents, man.

330
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,540
It's like something might really happen.

331
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,880
Right, like you could maybe a cop...

332
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,060
Yeah, it's like maybe, like, yog sa thoth would be invoked, you know?

333
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,480
Maybe that's the cop's marriage here, you know?

334
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,200
Or Satan or something.

335
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,120
Yeah, or they might like...

336
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,200
Yeah.

337
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,800
Or that's like, well, that's just what they want me to do.

338
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,220
They want me to buy that stuff.

339
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,120
I'm not gonna...

340
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,000
No, man.

341
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,160
No, I don't...

342
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,540
So did you do it, right?

343
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,340
I bought it.

344
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:46,620
No, man.

345
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,340
No, man.

346
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:47,840
I got...

347
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,080
I freaked, man.

348
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,240
You just got real upset.

349
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:50,600
You had a heart-tide split?

350
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,180
You had a...

351
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,460
Yeah.

352
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:51,840
Yeah.

353
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,120
Yeah.

354
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:53,840
Uh-oh.

355
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,220
It was the way the guy said it, man.

356
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:02,380
He just said, whatever you do, don't knock on this trap door three times and say yog

357
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,700
sa thoth.

358
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,640
Yog sa...

359
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,640
I don't want to say it three times.

360
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm afraid, man.

361
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,200
See what I mean, dude?

362
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,620
Yeah, I read that book.

363
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,540
It's like when they put you down in the well.

364
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,780
You can't get out.

365
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,120
It's like when you're in that box.

366
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,240
Stoop not down, dude.

367
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,240


368
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,240


369
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,240


370
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,820
You're not going down into the darkly thing, you know, abyss thing there, right?

371
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,180
Yeah.

372
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:28,720
It's like when Father McGillicuddy put you in the box and there's a little man in there

373
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,220
that bites your feet, dude.

374
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,220
That fucking little puppet head, man.

375
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,260
It's gross, man.

376
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:33,920
I hate that.

377
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,600
Something eats your feet in there.

378
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,700
I don't know what it is, man.

379
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,180
But there's something in there that actually eats people's feet.

380
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,080
It's like it's a bummer, dude.

381
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,020
Well, it sure would be a dumb in it, but maybe you should...

382
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,480
Oh, quiet.

383
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,200
Limb, limb, limb, limb.

384
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,700
How do you have any more of that glued?

385
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,240
Limb.

386
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,240
Limb.

387
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,240


388
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,240


389
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,240


390
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,240


391
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,240


392
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,240


393
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,860
Let's go start some fires.

394
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,860
Cool, dude.

395
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,060
Is this Tolo?

396
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,980
Hey, it looks like Bob said, like, kill yourself for Bob.

397
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,120
Yeah.

398
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,400
Hey, hey.

399
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,700
Let's do it, dude.

400
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,620
Oh, sure, man.

401
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,620
Bob said to do it.

402
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,240
It's Dobbs' privilege.

403
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,580
Let's do it, man.

404
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:08,700
Now, wait.

405
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,700
If Bob says to do it, we're not supposed to, right?

406
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,140
Yeah.

407
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:12,520
Yeah.

408
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,220
But we're supposed to think that.

409
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,700
He knows that we're going to think that, so it's like...

410
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,760
So we, like, trick him and go ahead and do it.

411
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,860
That's what we're supposed to do.

412
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,220
Well, yeah.

413
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,220


414
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,220


415
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,220


416
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,220


417
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,220


418
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,220


419
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,220


420
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,220


421
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,220


422
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,140
He, like, knows we have no free will of our own, right?

423
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,320
Yeah.

424
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,380
Well, he's...

425
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,660
He knows.

426
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,420
Well, I don't know.

427
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,300
We're supposed to, right?

428
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,360
Or we're not supposed to.

429
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:28,800
I can't remember.

430
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,480
I was trying to pick up that chick when they were talking about that part.

431
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,400
No, that was predeterminism, man.

432
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:45,260
So, I realized that there was room for me in some kind of religion or another, but to

433
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:45,640
religion...

434
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,120
Religion to me had always been pain and suffering.

435
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,000
Religion had always meant...

436
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,200
Yeah.

437
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:56,000
I could be either going like this, or going like this, or going like this, or going like

438
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,820
this, but I can't do it up here.

439
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,700
And it was pain.

440
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,540
It was pain.

441
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,180
Oh!

442
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,460
Beat me to a pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.

443
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,140
I ain't got religion, I got a damaged brain.

444
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:16,580
If I had a dollar for every licking that I took, I'd write the pope in Vatican and write

445
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,560
a dirty book.

446
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,200
Beat me to a pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.

447
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,200


448
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,200


449
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:26,720
for some pain beat me to a pulpit I'm praying for some pain

450
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,200
so could be anything virtual there man are we gonna be able to get virtual oh

451
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:41,960
man there's no virtue in that stuff well you know there are inherent dangers in

452
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,360
virtual reality especially for those whose only reality is virtual you could

453
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,720
become a Spanish voice Roy just like that you could end up like Dave in that

454
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,820
little tin can tied to a screen spinning through space might as well be you're

455
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,120
actually sitting in your your little coke can filled apartment instead of

456
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,380
instead of going out and running around the lake a few times you're sitting

00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,600
there tied surfing the internet it's you don't have a life you're just sitting

458
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,140
there just going from one argument to another just screaming and yelling by

459
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,340
typewriter to people you don't even know

460
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,740
you know that there are hundreds of miles there states and continents away so

461
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:28,760
you can be as insulting as you want it's a gas dude it's like it's like that that

462
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,780
first time I did the napalm with Dobbs

463
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,060
that was really funny

464
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,060


465
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,060


466
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,060


467
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,060


468
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,240
yeah

469
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,680
yeah

470
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,200
yeah

471
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,340
yeah

472
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,360
yeah

473
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,260
yeah

474
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:10,420
yeah

475
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:10,440
yeah

476
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:10,960
yeah

477
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:10,960


478
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,780
Pray for America to end tonight.

479
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,820
Pray for America to end tonight.

480
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,200
Boys and girls, you have to pray for America to end tonight.

481
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,580
You got to put your hands together and pray for America to end tonight.

482
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,060
Pray.

483
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,580
Get down on your hands and knees and bark like an animal.

484
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,920
Make animal sounds in the night and pray for America to end tonight.

485
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,540
Pray.

486
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,640
Pray for America to end tonight.

487
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,700
Amen.

488
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,880
America just ended, my friends.

489
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,880
Yes, I'm sorry.

490
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,120
The one world government won.

491
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,440
It's not just one world government.

492
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,720
Unfortunately, it wasn't Bob that owned it, but Dr. Bronner, the soap maker.

493
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,100
One world government under Dr. Bronner, a seam soap maker.

494
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,480
The seam soap maker.

495
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,300
But it's great soap.

496
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,420
Something has happened in the motorcade.

497
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,900
Something has definitely happened in the motorcade.

498
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:10,640
But friends, you know, we'll never be able to destroy America as long as the corruptigating worms are here.

499
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,300
That is the greatest.

500
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,420
The corruptigating.

501
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,260
You have touched the wrong.

502
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:17,840
You have touched the wrong nerve.

503
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,700
You have touched the wrong nerve in me, Ivan.

504
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,060
Don't ever talk about the corruptigating worms of hell.

505
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:24,940
Please.

506
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,860
And I don't think there's any man or woman in this country alive who knows the threat they represent.

507
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,660
It needs to be said, though, man.

508
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,040
Somebody's got to talk about it.

509
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,260
I mean, the conspiracy was just a cover for all of that.

510
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,600
You took a confidentiality affidavit.

511
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,760
You signed it.

512
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,600
They paid us.

513
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,200
They paid everybody.

514
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:43,900
They paid us all to make this buck.

515
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,480
That's all any of us want.

516
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,680
Huh.

517
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,240
Just a bag of prop and some money to walk on?

518
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:50,800
That's it.

519
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,020
That's all life has to offer you, pal.

520
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,460
You might as well get used to it.

521
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,100
The school of hard knocks.

522
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,840
No, we must stamp them out.

523
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,560
Oh, sure we must stamp them out.

524
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,620
We must stamp them out.

525
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,700
We will stamp them.

526
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:09,200
But if they pay us to, then that's the whole problem.

527
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,400
They've got the money.

528
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,900
All we've got is the trademark of Bob's head.

529
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,560
And one bullet.

530
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,360
One bullet.

531
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,600
And one and three nuclear weapons.

532
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,340
You know, they've got 50,000 nuclear weapons,

533
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,960
and lonesome cowboy Dave only has three.

534
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,180
And yet he dares to fight the corruptigating worms.

535
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,020
Yes, I do.

536
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,320
Day after day.

537
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,040
Day in and day out.

538
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,240
Unfortunately, the way he chooses, the weapon he chooses is...

539
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,020
Extra medication.

540
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,680
Improvisational so-called music in a terrible radio show.

541
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,720
But it's all we have.

542
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,780
That's all there is.

543
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,380
Everything outside of this room doesn't exist.

544
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,960
Because the corruptigating worms control every aspect of our lives.

545
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,560
They're down in our brains.

546
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,540
They have control of our personalities.

547
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,120
They know where we live.

548
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,520
They know where we come.

549
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:07,380
And when you walk outside of this room, friends, they're just making you think you're walking

550
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,260
down a hallway, walking down the street, walking to your car.

551
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,000
It's actually the silent radio that's making you believe all that.

552
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:15,700
You'll hear it.

553
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:15,700


554
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:20,820
You'll actually fall into a specially designed box right outside the door and be shipped

555
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:29,460
off to Malaysia for later use in the off-world colonies on our beautiful sister planet, Jupiter.

556
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,120
And she is beautiful, too.

557
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,000
She is so big and beautiful.

558
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:34,520
She's lovely.

559
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:42,620
She was so big and yet she was so hard with her chitinous outer layer.

560
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,580
I knew that she loved me.

561
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,440
We were not of the same species.

562
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,640
But I loved her nonetheless.

563
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,300
We were not even from the same planet.

564
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,980
But Bob brought us together.

565
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,920
In his great wisdom, he knew that we would be perfect together.

566
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:13,840
My Jupiterian babe with her carapace made of methane, solidified methane, and her beautiful

567
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,920
lips, yes.

568
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,540
You had a Yeti mate.

569
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,880
You had a Yeti mate.

570
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,380
You deserted.

571
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,120
And her pipe.

572
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,360
She had a pipe.

573
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,740
You had to remove it in order to use her.

574
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,160
But, oh, it left a big hole when you yanked it out.

575
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,760
And what a fine hole it was.

576
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,600
A little bit rough, like a metal file on the edges.

577
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,620
But, you know, for some of us, that's the best.

578
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,940
That's just what we want.

579
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,100
We like them that way.

580
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,660
Oh, we're doctors.

581
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,260
Oh, we're doctors.

582
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:44,880
Oh, we're doctors.

583
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:44,880


584
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:44,880


585
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:52,180
Hey, I got to work in Chicago a couple of weeks ago and got to do some more with the

586
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,820
great comedian Rudy Ray Moore.

587
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,980
Are any of you guys familiar with Rudy Ray Moore?

588
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,220
I don't know his name.

589
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,340
He does a character by the name of Dolomite.

590
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,080
Dolomite.

591
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:08,400
And he's known as the king of party records.

592
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,320
And bottle beers.

593
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,000
He's a...

594
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,920
The Shakespeare...

595
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,320
The fine book...

596
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,900
Dolomite.

597
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:14,900


598
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:20,800
A high weirdness by mail called Dolomite, the Shakespeare of black English.

599
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,700
And he does this...

600
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:30,180
I can't quote a single Dolomite line because by definition it's, as he calls it, raw.

601
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,720
It is rude and raw humor.

602
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,420
And he's a...

603
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,240
This guy's been one of my heroes for 20 years.

604
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,440
I've got all his albums going back to the cockpit.

605
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,900
This belongs to him.

606
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,500
This belongs to me.

607
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,800
Petey Wheatstraw, the devil's son-in-law.

608
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,600
I've heard of Petey Wheatstraw, the devil's son-in-law.

609
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:49,860
I've heard of that.

610
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,680
Yeah, he also did...

611
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,720
Rudy Ray Moore was also a movie star.

612
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:56,900
He was in Avenging Disco Godfather, the movie Dolomite.

613
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,440
He was in The Human Tornado.

614
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:06,800
And I mean, this guy is like a major blaxploitation film star, as well as the father, the godfather

615
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,640
of rap.

616
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:14,880
In that what Mr. Ray Moore is best known for is bellows and brags that are based on rap.

617
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:14,880


618
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:14,880


619
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,440
He's also on prison toasts and so forth.

620
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:22,060
It's a manly, hairy, steaming type of humor.

621
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,980
If only I could go into these quotes, but every single one would get this station fined.

622
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,560
Anyway, I got to work with this hero of mine.

623
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,180
You got to work with him?

624
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,580
I got to work with one of my...

625
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:42,260
His autograph, he was playing the good guy, this fireman in a video game.

626
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,860
We were acting in the filmed part of a CD record.

627
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,620
It was a video game called Dueling Fireman, produced by Run and Gun Incorporated of Chicago.

628
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,520
I play a rogue mason who's a thousand years old.

629
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:58,920
And Rudy Ray Moore is the hero who runs through burning Chicago.

630
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,740
Chicago is burning down in this game because the president, Oprah Winfrey, crashed into

631
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:09,840
the Sears Tower in Air Force One at the same time as the space shuttle did.

632
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,720
So a nuclear explosion destroys most of Chicago.

633
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:19,760
And the only thing that's left is Rudy Ray Moore and the crazed character actor, Irishman,

634
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,540
to fight the flames with their magic smoke jumpers.

635
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,900
It's like a video game that's been filmed, and you go from one little film story to film

636
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,200
story, and then there's games in between where you take on these characters.

637
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,920
And instead of killing other characters, you have to dance bizarrely.

638
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,420
That's how you get points.

639
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,700
This is a game in this new art style.

640
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:43,700


641
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:43,700


642
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,900
It's a style of spaz.

643
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,680
You might call it spaz fashion photography.

644
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,120
It's spaz fashion acting.

645
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,600
Everyone in it's cast like a Fellini movie.

646
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:59,340
Everyone is cast not for how good of an actor they are, but by how rubbery their face is

647
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,240
and what kind of a type they are.

648
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,740
So it's populated by freaks and subgeniuses.

649
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:13,000
It has cameos by such professional weirdos as Mark Mothersbaugh, Timothy Leary, who else?

650
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,860
Ferguson from the David Lynch TV show about weird TV shows.

651
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,520
And, oh well, Rudy Ray Moore.

652
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:21,980
Who else?

653
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:27,340
A bunch of rock and roll guys that I am not familiar with because I'm an old man.

654
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,420
Are there spaz actors?

655
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,260
It's spaz.

656
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,420
It's in the spaz form.

657
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:36,840
I spent most of my time in vampire makeup in front of a blue screen saying things like,

658
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,480
Step aside, ye fixed-legged earth fools.

659
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,700
Trapped, milling about in your own world.

660
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:43,700


661
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:43,700


662
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,340
In your cage of only three dimensions.

663
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,960
Your beauty god is no match for my dark purpose.

664
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,560
You know, see what I mean?

665
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,900
It's like in living-

666
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,840
It's exaggerated character acting.

667
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,240
Yeah, and it's a video game.

668
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,900
And it was cool.

669
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,260
I was getting paid and the most wonderful atmosphere on the set.

670
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:12,340
It's like the grips are standing around talking about Fellini and Bergman films.

671
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:18,700
Kurosawa did this one scene that was lit like this one where he had the fake snow.

672
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,720
And meanwhile the director and me are communicating on this level.

673
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,180
Did you ever see Evil Dead 2 when the moose head comes alive and the guy goes,

674
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,980
That's what-

675
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,240
It's kind of like that.

676
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,240
Do kind of like that.

677
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,900
A junction of different-

678
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:39,160
I had just gone to see the movie Ed Wood before doing this job and it was great.

679
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,360
And in fact, in this-

680
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,320
Have you seen Ed Wood?

681
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,680
No, I've wanted to.

682
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,660
I've been very broke.

683
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,220
I got to imitate Martin Landau.

684
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:52,700
In this video game, you get to see me imitating Martin Landau imitating Bela Lugosi saying,

685
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,860
Pull the strings!

686
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,380
Pull the strings!

687
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:11,320
Which for you bad movie enthusiasts out there on alt.fan.bad.movies, of course is that classic non sequitur,

688
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,300
sequence.

689
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,300
And then you get to see the one scene in the Ed Wood classic, Glenn or Glenda, the groundbreaking

690
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:22,620
film about transvestitism, which you will sketch your eye load full of, I bet at the

691
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:29,800
Akron revival at Cavanaugh's on Saturday night, which is like the crazed party after the Cleveland

692
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,160
light show smoke machine.

693
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,700
Yeah, we'll have all kinds.

694
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:39,120
Did you know that we're going to have like laser shows and all good psychedelic dude

695
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,520
and all that?

696
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,820
I know they're going to have-

697
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,380
Yeah, the base mind machines.

698
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,000
Smoke machine?

699
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,840
and laser machines and...

700
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,480
Mind machines?

701
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:44,960
Mind machines.

702
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,320
All the trendy techno goods.

703
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,740
What's a mind machine?

704
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,320
Have you ever taken a mind machine trip, Dave?

705
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,300
No, I have never taken no mind machine trip.

706
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,740
I'd like to know what one is.

707
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:59,420
Well, mind machines are electronic meditation assistance devices.

708
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,640
Then you made these yourself?

709
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,700
Well, I know we didn't make them ourselves.

710
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,560
We buy them.

711
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,500
You said mine are.

712
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,580
You said mine are actually levitation teleportation devices

713
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,040
having to do with a pre-funkter...

714
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,860
You said something, it was yours.

715
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,920
I forgot about that part.

716
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,580
Well, anyway, these mind machines are capable of transposing you into another key.

717
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,040
Exactly, yes.

718
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,480
Perhaps one of Solomon's keys of marijuana from Brazil.

719
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,060
Yes.

720
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:32,580
Some different state than you're in before you put the headphones on your ears.

721
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,020
Now, this is not virtual.

722
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:34,620
This is not a virtual ride.

723
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,500
It could be bad or good.

724
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,560
You could just put them on and you'd feel terrible maybe even, right?

725
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,700
Is that possible?

726
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,500
Oh, I don't think you would feel terrible unless you...

727
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,560
The muscle grows as the brain shrinks.

728
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,640
If you have a tendency to be an epileptic, it's not suggested

729
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:55,840
because it's flashing lights and it could spur on an electric trigger.

730
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,540
You could be defoiled.

731
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,140
You could actually throw a spaz action on the middle of the floor.

732
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:01,840
Why, yes, exactly.

733
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,000
So any epileptics are not advised to try a mind machine,

734
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,760
but if you're not an epileptic...

735
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,800
I don't know.

736
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,160
Really.

737
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:08,840
You're totally fine.

738
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,220
...it's not the fun thing to do.

739
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,040
Man, you love epilepsy, dude.

740
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,460
It's like this wild...

741
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,620
It's like I don't hear the music but go baby!

742
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,720
Your feet flap, don't they?

743
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,220
You put a pair of goggles on.

744
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,140
A pair of sunglasses that have little teeny tiny lights

745
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,420
mounted in the inside of them.

746
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,920
You keep your eyes closed so the lights flash

747
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,380
and you just get the impression of the lights on your closed eyelids, Dave.

748
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,820
And the sounds, in your ears are like

749
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,320
,

750
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:44,160
And the lights are blinking, and it's the blinking lights and the whoosh, whoosh, whoosh in your ears

751
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,260
that just brings you to a different state.

752
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:50,660
It brings you to far-brain, hind-brain, sync-lock.

753
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:58,680
And what people report seeing are things like fireworks and mandala amazing moving.

754
00:43:59,300 --> 00:43:59,880
Yes, it's true.

755
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,560
You see mandalas?

756
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:01,700
Oh, yes.

757
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,980
You see eyes of Nelson Mandela?

758
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,080
Mandela will appear to you as a ghost.

759
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,000
I mean, they're virtual, but it's not virtual with your eyes open.

760
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,480
It's virtual with your eyes closed.

761
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,760
Yeah, if you open your eyes, man, it burns out your retina, but that's a trick.

762
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,140
No, no, you can't open your eyes.

763
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,720
Reverend Stank, don't kill them to open their eyes.

764
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,140
You won't want to.

765
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,180
They're too bright.

766
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,020
You'd never want to open your eyes.

767
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,780
So does that really burn your retinas if you open your eyes too brightly?

768
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,560
I really don't know.

769
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,880
No one's ever been able to hold their eyes.

770
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,920
My eyes open against the scorching heat.

771
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,400
We only...

772
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,960
A transfigural occlusion occurs in the back of your brain, doesn't it?

773
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,100
If you open your eyeballs too wide, it goes right in and gives you like a body slam.

774
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,360
It reprograms you to be brutal, strong, heavy, violent.

775
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,840
It could burn the visual purple.

776
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,560
That's the way I like my girlfriend.

777
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:03,960
Well, actually, it programs some people to be loving, friendly, intelligent, and tasteful.

778
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,980
Well, who the hell wants to be like that?

779
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,140
Well, I've... we...

780
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,980
Those are the people that want their money back.

781
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,440
Like, well, let them have it.

782
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,860
All of a sudden they've decided this is a gaudy, lurid, cheap trick.

783
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,240
And they're the ones it doesn't work on.

784
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,600
Boy, I want one of those machines.

785
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:22,760
No, they just use a mind machine.

786
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,980
I'd like to hook my kids up. Yeah, I want a mind machine myself.

787
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:29,600
Oh, you did hook your kids up to them. You put them in a little box with Father McLahomer.

788
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,960
Well, it was homemade. I lined a bunch of flash cubes up on the stick and put them in the car.

789
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:33,960


790
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,940
Oh, that will cause retinal damage.

791
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,300
If you line up some flash cubes on a stick, your children will sue for divorce in a court of law.

792
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,180
You'll be sent up the river.

793
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,420
I wouldn't do it.

794
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:54,260
I mean, I did try it on... I had a few pet monkeys, and I used to make really, really high, like, 12-foot high stacks of flash.

795
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,500
Oh, yes, it's those... look over there across the river. It's those monkeys over in the trees there.

796
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,960
You can hear them. You hear... listen. Do you hear them?

797
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,040
Yeah.

798
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:03,940
You hear their...

799
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,200
You hear their cries in the background. Those are...

800
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,000
What are they crying about?

801
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:06,200
Some of them are birds.

802
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,160
Something must have happened.

803
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,200
The fast ones are birds. Oh, look, going by, there's that...

804
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,420
A monkey's leaping.

805
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,380
...a heliopter slipping into the water. Do you see it?

806
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,920
Oh, wow, that's cool.

807
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:19,960
A little heliopter over there. That's a... he's an old... that's an old grandfather of the river, I think.

808
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:20,540
Oh, yeah.

809
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,360
You can see the tick birds on his back.

810
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,600
No, no, they can't hunt for him. No, no, they can't hunt him.

811
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:25,880
No.

812
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,100
Because, well, he's been in there forever. Oh, no, and then...

813
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:32,320
If you... if you listen, we may be able to hear the... the cry of the...

814
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,160
Of the long swallows?

815
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,080
...the last yeti out in the... out in the forest here as we...

816
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,800
I'm gonna gag there.

817
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,240
Do you hear the drums? Those are the natives outside of Dob's fortress.

818
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,120
I thought that was one of the feisty monkeys pounding their breast and abdomen.

819
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,160
No, no, there's... well, they... oh, they've gone silent.

820
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,520
They've gone silent.

821
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,880
And what if the past go and collect $300?

822
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,020
Oh, no.

823
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:52,440
No.

824
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,600
The line broke. Man, this virtual reality stuff is too expensive.

825
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,300
I know, every time you get a good knob...

826
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:02,640
We were about to get to the part where the... where the natives are fighting the subgeniuses.

827
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,140
Yeah.

828
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,900
The spears come out and the drums start to pounding...

829
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,460
God, we gotta reboot it now.

830
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:07,480
...and the subgeniuses are...

831
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,020
Baba, baba, daba, daba, baba.

832
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,260
We gotta re... hey, hey, man, do you like to have a quarter?

833
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,620
No, uh...

834
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:13,180
We're gonna... I...

835
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,600
I don't. I don't even have a...

836
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:19,120
We can use my parent's credit card, man. I wanna get back in the game. I've gotta get back in the game.

837
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,500
I get an idea. Let's use my parent's credit card.

838
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,880
Let's ask the Dob's Oracle... I'll tell you what, if you got... we'll put in one quarter...

839
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:24,900
We jump.

840
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,300
...and we'll ask Bob. We'll go to...

841
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:26,840
Yes, no.

842
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,160
...go to the Dob's Oracle page and ask... we'll type in the question, you know, and ask...

843
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:38,220
Here, Bob. Bob. Dear Bob, should we use Dad's credit card?

844
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,700
Or... or we... a can of dog food. We can... or the can of dog food, too.

845
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:49,340
Look, man, he's about to talk. He says, on the night of slack, the exes will...

846
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,080
Run suplee...

847
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,240
Run... and then it said run...

848
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,280
Run em... run em...

849
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:54,600
Run em... run em...

850
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,480
...and mow em.

851
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,740
Run em and mow em? What does that mean?

852
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,660
I think it means that... what it... it's like...

853
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:00,940
Holler.

854
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:01,180
...that the...

855
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:07,180
Dob's is trying to tell us, man, that, like, in the grand scheme of things, like, our parents'

856
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,900
credit card doesn't matter. It's like the exes that matter.

857
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:11,380
Yeah.

858
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:16,420
So we might as well, like, you know, these minor earthly things, like, we can't get hung

859
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:20,580
up in them. I think that's what Bob's trying to tell us on this game, man. It's like the

860
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:20,900
Oracle.

861
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,340
What's a sec?

862
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:26,640
But I don't think Bob has anything to say. It's not like an Oracle or nothing.

863
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,000
Hey...

864
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,880
I think it's just a random thought that emerged.

865
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,700
Hey, somebody's online. Somebody... somebody just came online.

866
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,320
Look, it's a chat line.

867
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:33,400
You wanna flame on em?

868
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,320
Yeah, let's flame on em. You got that lighter?

869
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,000
Yeah, I...

870
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,560
Here's the beans.

871
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,320
Let's pyroflagellate em.

872
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,660
What are we gonna do with a bottle of beans?

873
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,060
Let's flame em.

874
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,640
They'll... they'll... they'll really know we're clever if we insult them a whole bunch.

875
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,680
I've got a new board or what? Could you have a collar?

876
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,660
She said... she said something with a head... she had a headboarder.

877
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,700
Dave, it's your girlfriend, man. Be polite.

878
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,100
Oh, she died last month.

879
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,600
Well, which one is this?

880
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,340
This must be Peggy, the ointment woman. Peggy.

881
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,560
Did you... did you bring...

882
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:58,640
Peggy Stew.

883
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,640
Did you bring the ointment?

884
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,000
Peggy Stew.

885
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,020
Look, I'm gonna come down to the CSE and I'm gonna kick all you guys' butts if you

886
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:04,860
don't answer the call.

887
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,760
Oh, let's just put our butts all in the big line so you don't have too far to move.

888
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,600
One buttock, two buttocks, three buttocks, all shaking in unison as you kick, kick, kick,

889
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,380
kick, kick like in a Broadway musical.

890
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,920
Yeah, we'll... we'll keep the lines free.

891
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:18,740
You can call now.

892
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,520
You can get through now.

893
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,560
It's like if you hang up and then call us, you'll be able to get through.

894
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,640
It'll come right in.

895
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,880
Just... just remember, don't rush, head... headlong or oblong.

896
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,980
Don't just put... put it down.

897
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:30,600
Put it down and try it again.

898
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:31,820
Yeah, don't rush into this thing.

899
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,240
I mean, before you sign up, you may want to think twice.

900
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,320
It's not for everybody.

901
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:41,640
Read them small prints and just study it first before you decide to do anything because

902
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,360
for God's sakes, you don't want to step into that abyss and never come out.

903
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:48,000
No, we don't want your family to sue us, you know, just because you couldn't handle

904
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,240
it.

905
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:53,300
And family suffrage meant, believe me, it goes long... long, long, long after.

906
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,040
Oh, it's like millions of bucks now that family just could... you deprogram one kid

907
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,300
and the family can get five million, ten million bucks.

908
00:49:59,300 --> 00:49:59,920
In all their living.

909
00:49:59,920 --> 00:49:59,920


910
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,640
And all their children and all their descendants are suddenly evacuated as just some, you know,

911
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,640
some blissful turd.

912
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,600
Something just popped right out of them.

913
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,100
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I... but...

914
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,420
Obviously, the corner...

915
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,160
The dog bit it.

916
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:12,660
...is backed.

917
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,840
Put that dog out, hon.

918
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:20,440
Put that dog outside and give it some hush puppies and some gravy and step on it.

919
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,840
Did you ever have a dog?

920
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:26,320
I had four dogs and five husqvarna's.

921
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,100
They were the like, the little totem poles that you used to drive around.

922
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:33,300
And some of them had sleds underneath for the heavy winter time.

923
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,840
I have this one dog.

924
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,160
It's like one of those wiener dogs.

925
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,060
You have a wiener dog?

926
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,840
Well, it's a cross between a Chinese Shih Tzu and a dachshund.

927
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:42,440
A Shih Tzu?

928
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:47,300
It is the ugliest little long sausage-like dog you ever saw.

929
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,320
And what...

930
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,300
It looks like Broderick Crawford on a bun.

931
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,180
I know that's in the...

932
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:58,220
When it goes outside to do its little doggy business, as doggies are wont to do, it hunches

933
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:58,940
over and it...

934
00:50:58,940 --> 00:50:59,080
Look at that.

935
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:03,880
It looks like a toothpaste tube being squeezed by the invisible man.

936
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:09,300
And you must have an awful lot of fondness for a dog that was such an absurd way of relieving...

937
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,480
You can trade videotapes of this kind of stuff on the internet.

938
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,880
It's like there's a board for everything on there.

939
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:16,960
You can go to...

940
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,020
I saw, and this is true, I've got it printed out down in my briefcase.

941
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:26,340
There is an internet message that says, bad tooth fetish.

942
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,980
Single male interested in trading...

943
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:34,360
Photos, videos involving models with very bad or no teeth.

944
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,740
He is becoming...

945
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,660
Well, I think...

946
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,500
Becoming...

947
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:44,260
The friends of the aliens lose their teeth.

948
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,380
The friends of the aliens lose their teeth?

949
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,320
Not those bad aliens.

950
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,440
Not the...

951
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,320
Friends of Bob's...

952
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,340
If you're a friend...

953
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,880
Gain their teeth.

954
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:52,380
New teeth.

955
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:52,840
Ah.

956
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,120
New and better teeth.

957
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,200
Healthy teeth on the...

958
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,160
So is that why teeth are...

959
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,140
Escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

960
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:58,420
Yes.

961
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:58,960
You will learn to...

962
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:58,960


963
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:58,960


964
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:58,960


965
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:58,960


966
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:58,960


967
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:58,960


968
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,720
You will get a brand new set as you enter?

969
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,960
Or as you...

970
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,660
You will shunt your earthly shell.

971
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,300
You will leave behind...

972
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,760
It's like taking your shoes off.

973
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,960
It'll appear...

974
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,020
Your earthly body will appear to be like a burning monk screaming in terrible agony.

975
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:23,460
But in fact, your soul, your identity will be transmutated up to the escape vessels of

976
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:28,940
the sex goddesses where you will fill the body of your healthful, youthful soul.

977
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:32,740
You will find yourself at around age 25, but with all your memories intact.

978
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,340
It's perfect.

979
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,140
So you're...

980
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,440
And you can do anything you want when you're on...

981
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:38,700
Anything?

982
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:39,020
Anything.

983
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:39,540
Anything.

984
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:43,900
On the escape vessels of the sex goddesses as a dues paying subgenius member.

985
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,420
And you can get more information about this.

986
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,980
You can be saved.

987
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:54,260
You can achieve, yes, eternal salvation or triple your money back at the subgenius...

988
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,960
Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

989
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,920
For free information on Bob's...

990
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:58,920


991
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:58,920


992
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,640
Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

993
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,580
Got your pencil ready?

994
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:11,000
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

995
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:18,120
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

996
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,020
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

997
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:21,380
Praise Bob.

998
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,080
Yes.

999
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,680
Finally, dear friends, we have come to the very bitter end.

1000
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:28,900
We are at the end of the show.

1001
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:37,220
And only now might I deign to lower myself to telling you what else you've been listening

1002
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:37,500
to.

1003
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:44,560
A time for credits and addresses because we don't want to hog all this talent just

1004
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,400
to ourselves.

1005
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,000
Nay.

1006
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:51,920
You know, not everything that ends up under the banner of Dobbs started out that way.

1007
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,340
Some of it even exists outside of Dobbs' influence.

1008
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,800
As hard as that may be.

1009
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:08,060
So have your pencils ready, friends, so you can send off for info from these fine other

1010
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:08,800
mutants.

1011
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:16,720
And rewinding back to the beginning of the show, the nice Zappa-esque piece of music

1012
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:25,200
called Everything You Know Is Wrong, back there at the beginning, that was by Dr. Bizarro

1013
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,880
and the Disgustos, who can be reached by email.

1014
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:28,880


1015
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:28,880


1016
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,120
That's iBob Digital.

1017
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,060
Got that pencil ready?

1018
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:35,860
P.O.

1019
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:39,120
Box 3405.

1020
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,260
3405 in Skokie, Illinois.

1021
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,440
60076.

1022
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,740
That zip is 60076 in Skokie, Illinois.

1023
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:56,000
And their phone number, for those of you with tape decks, is 708-982-9697.

1024
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:58,860
That's it.

1025
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:58,860


1026
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:58,860


1027
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:06,000
Now, that song was followed by a typically delicious, yet roughly recorded rant on Master

1028
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Control by the great Nenslow.

1029
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:14,820
And you can get Nenslow's very soul by writing to Nenslow.

1030
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,060
One dollar.

1031
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,220
P.O.

1032
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,140
Box 86582.

1033
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:26,440
That's Nenslow at Box 86582, Portland, Oregon.

1034
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,860
972-9.

1035
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,620
972-8.6.

1036
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,760
The Nensletic zip is 972-8.6.

1037
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,760
And if you've been reading Revelation X, then you know that you owe Nenslow that one buck.

1038
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:47,460
And then you heard, or thought that you heard, that slightly devoistic, very modernatical

1039
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:56,860
sounding industrial alien rock song, Robotopia, which is by Punch Drunk, whose CD is very

1040
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,240
good.

1041
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,100
And they're at P.O.

1042
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,340
Box 53582.

1043
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:09,680
Punch Drunk at Box 53582, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

1044
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:15,960
And the zip is 19105.

1045
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,020
19105 in Philly.

1046
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:20,520
Pah!

1047
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:21,920
For Punch Drunk.

1048
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,460
And then, pretty much for the entire rest of the show, we played recordings from both

1049
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:35,180
ESO Radio, live on WCSB Cleveland, and ESO Live on Stage at the last Cleveland subgenius

1050
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:35,900
D-Vival.

1051
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:43,860
And you can get information on other tapes by ESO by sending an SASE, what in the, this

1052
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:48,480
is getting ridiculous, self-addressed stamped envelope to ESO P.O.

1053
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,260
Box 14776.

1054
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:56,440
That's ESO at Box 14776, Cleveland, Cleveland, Cleveland.

1055
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:56,440


1056
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:57,980
Ohio.

1057
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:59,500
Ohio.

1058
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:02,860
44114.

1059
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:07,300
That's Box 14776, Cleveland, Ohio, 44114.

1060
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,980
Because ESO stands for Einstein's Secret Orchestra, and they have other tapes.

1061
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:20,880
And they are that amazing improvisational trepanation group consisting of Lonesome Cowboy

1062
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:26,180
Dave and the newly appointed cantor of the church, Chaz.

1063
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:32,960
Chaz Smith and his violinist mate, Michelle, and Todd, the breast-kneed baboon player.

1064
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:38,480
And in this particular case, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang was a guest, along with

1065
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:44,120
the beautatious Princess We Are Doe, queen of all the UFOs.

1066
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:49,480
And listeners of WCSB in Cleveland get to hear ESO every Thursday night at 10.

1067
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:54,020
But only subgeniuses got to see that live on-stage performance.

1068
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,160
More of those tapes next week.

1069
00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:02,460
And that was thanks to the sponsors of The Devival and the WCSB Subgenius Show.

1070
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:07,820
The sponsors being the Flying Lemur Bookstore of Lakewood.

1071
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:13,440
Yes, the Flying Lemur, the coolest hangout in Cleveland, be there or be square.

1072
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:19,820
And special thanks to the hard-working slackmeister, Steve Bevilacqua, for making that possible.

1073
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And to Pastor Craig in Philadelphia, who also helped pay for the plane ticket and more recordings

1074
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,540
of the live preachings from those devivals next week.

1075
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,500
We must go, time control is faltering.

1076
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,360
price stops

1077
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,140
I don't know.

1078
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:43,000
That music I was playing there at the very end was, of course, by Osric Tentacles.

1079
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:48,340
Hard to find CDs by a groovy group.

1080
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,760
Thank you, our dear listeners.

1081
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:57,760
Let's just let it die now with this groovy, mensletic theme.

1082
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,000
