00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,320
This is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

2
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:20,680
Dear friends, please stay tuned for the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

3
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,160
Tonight, starring Dr. Timothy Leary.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,060
Thank y'all.

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,420
However, in order for you to feel, you'll need more than just knowledge.

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,360
We're going to add real experiences to your database.

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,080
We want more! We want more! We want more!

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:39,860
You'll be alright!

9
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,080
No, no, no.

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,280
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sub-suggested.

11
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,400
We're having operating difficulties, which has necessitated a delay in the beginning of our Sunday movie.

12
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,700
It's a wonderful life. It's a wonderful life.

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,240
It's a wonderful life. It's a wonderful life.

14
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,380
Hello, this is Timothy Leary, reminding you that just as you need Slack,

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,760
KNON needs your help.

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,200
Send in those pledges and praise Bob.

17
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,280
Bob?

18
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,260
Bob?

19
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,620
Bob?

20
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,940
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

21
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,940
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

22
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,880
Bob?

23
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,600
That's your key phrase.

24
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,240
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

25
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,120
Wake up, puppet boy!

26
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,780
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

27
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,480
The Self Genius Hour of Slack!

28
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:16,840
What?

29
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,460
What you don't understand is that it's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.

30
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,900
You have it backwards.

31
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,800
It's better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.

32
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,180
Enjoy life like Bob.

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,080
Get the hands, Satan.

34
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,640
Please listen.

35
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,980
I only want to help you.

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,660
I've chosen you.

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,480
Hi, Bob!

38
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,520
Right, Bob?

39
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,860
Bob?

40
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,420
Bob?

41
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:45,960
Bob?

42
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,780
But there's three things I know to be true.

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,940
And that's death, taxes, and Bob.

44
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,940
Praise Bajus.

45
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,520
We're sending those little kids home.

46
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,300
Oh, yes.

47
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,840
And we're sending them home.

48
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:14,840


49
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:14,840


50
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:14,840


51
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:14,840


52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:14,840


53
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,860
It's a solid Timothy Leary hour tonight, believe it or not.

54
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,380
I think Guy was just too good.

55
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,580
I don't know what else...

56
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:29,820
So geniuses, we can get away with this sloppiness that would look awkward and unseemly in others

57
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:42,660
because we made it plain from the start that we were declaring ourselves gods and fallible,

58
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,820
but infallibly fallible.

59
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:55,200
So that any mistakes we might make were a part and parcel of the entire presentation,

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,120
one might say.

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:09,040
We may continue with an absolute lack of guilt, an absolute feeling that we have been chosen

62
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,540
by God because we...

63
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,260
said so.

64
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,760
And at this point, what else do you need?

65
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,980
I don't know.

66
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:35,520
Was there at any time an intimation that were there to be severe problems, physical,

67
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:42,740
mental, spiritual, whatever, financial, that if those problems were to exist that the Church

68
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,520
of the Sub-Genealogy would be...

69
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,140
That the Church of the Sub-Genius would be in any way responsible?

70
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,440
No, no, not at all.

71
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,340
No, as a matter of fact.

72
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,560
I believe you've signed your name to a document that states just that.

73
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,940
You did sign the application.

74
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,660
You're entirely responsible for yourself, and we granted you that privilege of being

75
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,520
solely responsible.

76
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,400
Aren't you thankful?

77
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,700
You yourself are the owner, the caretaker of your membership in the Church of the Sub-Genius.

78
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,060
You did...

79
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,500
And what you do with it.

80
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:13,500


81
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:13,500


82
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:13,500


83
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:13,600
You do what you do with it.

84
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,760
Is up to you.

85
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,340
It's your...

86
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,080
You can flush it away, or you can...

87
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,360
Freedom.

88
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,820
We have granted...

89
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,540
Cherish it.

90
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

91
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,240
Barely made that light in a legal manner.

92
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,420
Just barely.

93
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:35,080
But I think it was legal if an officer would stop me now and say, Son, where the hell do

94
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,760
you think you're going?

95
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:42,200
I'd say, Sir, Sir, Ma'am, to be completely equal about this.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,480
Officer, I'm sorry.

97
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:43,480


98
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:43,480


99
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:43,480


100
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:43,580
I'm sorry, sir.

101
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,080
I'm on my way to do a speaking engagement.

102
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,760
Yes, I've got to introduce this scientist, an old, old, old scientist guy.

103
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,800
His name's Timothy Leary.

104
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,980
I've just got to do an introduction.

105
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:06,960
I don't know why they wanted a humorist to come out and do this thing, but...

106
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,700
And that wouldn't sound good to a cop, I know.

107
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,460
So, therefore, I probably ought to be careful.

108
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,240
Yeah, yeah, I know about those shows.

109
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,160
Them shows, man.

110
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,640
I know about them damn shows.

111
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,240
Those shows.

112
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,380
Well, we've got another show.

113
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,520
Everything, of course, to the rubes, the fools, the cattle.

114
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,640
That's all they understand.

115
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,820
The impotent weaklings, the puny earth babies.

116
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,240
We might as well call them babies.

117
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:37,980
Might as well.

118
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,920
That's all they are really.

119
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,880
Infants, it's not their fault.

120
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,460
It's not that I hate them.

121
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:43,460


122
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,580
I hate them personally.

123
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,780
It's merely that their annihilation is the most logical and reasonable thing to do.

124
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,560
For a person in my situation, a god, in other words.

125
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,780
No, English.

126
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,980
But, uh...

127
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,020
Give me a break, man.

128
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,660
Have you heard the word Bob? Give me slack.

129
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,280
And then they either kill you or arrest you or they give you $20.

130
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,060
So far I've been lucky.

131
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,740
Yes, lucky indeed, dear friends.

132
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,800
It's been a...

133
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,320
Oh, a fun weekend! A really fun weekend.

134
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,280
And so fun that as a result, for anyone, any new listeners we've got tuning into the hour slack,

135
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,380
I'm sorry, this is just not going to be a typical one.

136
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:38,740
Probably last show we had 100,000 cuts per hour, like any decent Russ Meyer movie, for instance.

137
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,480
But this time,

138
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,080
uh,

139
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,560
Leary's show blew me away, friends,

140
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,520
and I'm just going to play as much of it as I possibly can,

141
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,420
although we do have with us in the studio tonight

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,140
some mighty mutants who were instrumental in bringing to town,

143
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,920
in capturing and bringing to town that eighth circuit of the world, you might say.

144
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,440
Dr. Timothy Leary.

145
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,920
We got, pointing the video camera at me,

146
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,640
the Dealey Llama

147
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,240
crawled up once again from...

148
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,520
from deep within his...

149
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,840
his, uh, catacombs underneath Dealey Plaza.

150
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,440
And, uh, Dr. John Cottrell.

151
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,000
Uh, y'all can speak up, but you have to really speak up or grab the mic.

152
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,140
And, uh, Dr. Ralph Maldonado, if that really is your name.

153
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,580
Name right out of some Robert Anton Wilson book, I would think.

154
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,580
Well, friends, anyway, uh, stand by.

155
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,540
You're going to have to sit through my introduction to Dr. Leary.

156
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,300
Just, uh...

157
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,660
Well, because it's my show!

158
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,720
And, uh, why not?

159
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,460
Uh, for, uh...

160
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:44,700
Okay.

161
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,540
Uh...

162
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,780
Oh, and we also have with us the young Llama.

163
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,800
We have a child in the studio, so good to see a kiddo here.

164
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,660
There we go, yes.

165
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,200
Reverend.

166
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,260
Just like mine.

167
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Reverend Llama.

168
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,180
Reverend Llama.

169
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,180
Yes, we're all Amish tonight.

170
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,240
Praise Bob.

171
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:05,800
Ooh.

172
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,320
I, uh...

173
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,280
I don't know about you, but it's...

174
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,400
Uh, I'm really glad to have this break from normal reality.

175
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,520
I needed one this week.

176
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:21,300
Uh, now some of you might think that my normal reality was, uh, an unattainable dream.

177
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,780
And others would think that what's normal reality for me would be an unthinkable nightmare.

178
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:35,000
But, uh, that just goes to show it's, um, more relative than Einstein ever thought.

179
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,180
And that's why we're here.

180
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,620
Essentially.

181
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:45,380
Uh, uh, as far as a straight introduction part, I guess you could say Dr. Timothy Leary

182
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:51,540
is a, uh, a startling example of, uh, adaptation in the human species.

183
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:58,520
Um, in that he has successfully had to adapt to several lifetimes worth of adventures,

184
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,060
all crammed into one.

185
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:07,880
From, uh, psychologist to, uh, infamous defender of, uh, pharmaceutical explorations on the,

186
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,400
what was essentially the front lines of a mutation war.

187
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Uh, to, uh, computer software designer as he, uh, currently doing software or, or headware,

188
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,500
um, as, as he calls it, electronic books.

189
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:30,080
And, uh, all along it's been psychological self-analysis tools, basically.

190
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,660
But fun ones.

191
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,120
That's the important part.

192
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,540
He's been, uh, making it fun and observing as a scientist the whole time.

193
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:48,380
Now, you may ask, and you should ask yourselves, why is a representative from a hideous shanker

194
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:55,800
on society, like the Church of the Subgenius, introducing a noble social scientist and,

195
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:01,020
uh, dauntless, uh, psychological explorer like, uh, Dr. Tim Leary?

196
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:07,520
Uh, it's, uh, it's sort of like the crazy street preacher encountering the, uh, uh,

197
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,820
professor of theology.

198
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:17,440
Uh, you know, but there's common ground, dear friends, much in common, uh, such as, for instance,

199
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,300
the garbage pail kids.

200
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,780
But that's gonna take a lot of explanation.

201
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,280
I don't think too many of you want to hear that tonight.

202
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,500
Uh, tune into the Hour of Slack 90.9 FM on KNON 9 o'clock Sundays to get the full explanation.

203
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,520
The, uh, what we really have in common is that both Dr. Leary and the Church of the Subgenius, uh,

204
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:37,520


205
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,420
are speaking to the mutants.

206
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,680
And, um, by definition, uh, mutants are all different.

207
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,800
So, what else do we need in common?

208
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,340
Uh, that right there is, uh, quite a lot, in a way, if you think about it.

209
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:58,520
Personally, I believe that everybody is a mutant, uh, but, uh, they, they, we specifically in the Church of the Subgenius

210
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:07,420
is trying to help out the obnoxious weirdo type of mutants, just in case there might be among them, uh, a, a,

211
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:14,460
the next Leonardo, the next Einstein, or, uh, I don't know, we may have to be satisfied with the next, uh, wild man Fisher.

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,140
I'd be satisfied with the next Jane or Hyperclete, dear friends.

213
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,300
But, uh, at any rate, Tim Leary, I'm, I don't want to draw this out too long.

214
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:31,000
Uh, Dr. Leary has provided enough food for thought to make any brain overheat,

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,860
not to mention the ordinary world itself being enough to make your brain overheat.

216
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,340
And, uh, you know, thinking about the world can drive anybody crazy.

217
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,900
Uh, and that's why the Church of the Subgenius is here.

218
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,100
That's why he's here, partly.

219
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,920
Uh, without some sort of a mental coolant, you can suffer meltdown.

220
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,080
Uh, hence the garbage pail kids, let's say.

221
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,520
Uh, or the Church of the Subgenius.

222
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,120
Bob Dobbs is the fuse that, uh, blows before your brain does, you might say.

223
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,880
Is, uh, and those things are important.

224
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,500
Because we're talking about the future.

225
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,080
We're talking about intelligence expansion and so forth.

226
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,080
And intelligence expansion has its own drawbacks.

227
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:22,520
It can also make you more vulnerable, for instance, to knowing how your brain may be being wasted by some crappy job you're forced to work.

228
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:28,400
Uh, and so there are, you know, various things you have to deal with along with this, this kind of thing.

229
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:37,180
What we're trying to do, essentially, is to keep the potential Tim Leary's of the future from becoming the Charlie Manson's of the future.

230
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,360
Not the future.

231
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:44,100
Specifically, to keep my son, Alex, from becoming the Alex in, uh, Clockwork Orange.

232
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,920
Uh, although, I always thought it was kind of cool.

233
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:57,260
Anyway, Tim Leary has a streak of contrariness that, uh, has still, to this day, keeps surprising people.

234
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:04,300
Uh, the last two interviews I read with him, for instance, were not in Rolling Stone or some New Age magazine.

235
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,500
They were in, uh, a girl's magazine.

236
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,060
A damn stroke book called High Society.

237
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,080
And an art magazine from Florida.

238
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,520
And they were great.

239
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,440
But it shows that he is not, is not, uh, trying to preach to the saved.

240
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,760
That's not, uh, his, his main thing.

241
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,120
And that is, uh, very honorable, I, I consider.

242
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,640
Uh, and in these articles, another thing that surprised me personally was that he wasn't bad-mouthing yuppies.

243
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,780
As most people would.

244
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,920
As I probably would in the same interview.

245
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,180
He was, in fact, defending the yuppie generation.

246
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,400
And putting it into, uh, the materialism that you tend to see more today than ten years ago.

247
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,820
Into a sort of, a perspective that was actually, uh, opti, very optimistic.

248
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,940
And I thought, you know, if we're in the world that this guy's coming from, that's really bucking the trend.

249
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,040
Uh, defending yuppies.

250
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,080
So, uh, that, that the love of surprises, friends.

251
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,320
Is something that we do have in common.

252
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,640
And the issue is, indeed, intelligence.

253
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,780
And, and how it's defined.

254
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,460
We want to make sure that it is less and less rigidly defined.

255
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,740
Uh, it has to be defined towards what is fun.

256
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,420
And that's pretty loose definition.

257
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,380
It depends on the individual.

258
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,240
What good are brains if they're, no, if it's not fun to use them?

259
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,040
In other words.

260
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,760
And that's, uh, his job and ours is, I guess, to keep the, uh, rigidity out of the conception of intelligence.

261
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,520
Uh, the sick, sick humor, dear friends.

262
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,480
As, and, uh, science.

263
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,880
Uh, hand in hand.

264
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,720
At least every now and then.

265
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,360
There's the OM chanting universe.

266
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,400
And the HUH chanting universe.

267
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,260
But friends, in between the HUHs, you've got to take a breath.

268
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,540
And so, obviously, there's room for both.

269
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,660
Um, we have differences in presentation.

270
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,960
Uh, because we're, our, the, the kids.

271
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,400
We've got to think about the kids.

272
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,320
They're facing strange contrasts.

273
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,900
Sort of a combination of, um, the ultimate horror of the atomic bomb.

274
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,900
Or, or, no, what atomic?

275
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,380
That was the old phrase.

276
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,580
The bomb hanging over their heads.

277
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:27,300
But at the same time, they're also facing possibilities that are boundless compared to what previous generations faced.

278
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,760
But, uh, being able to adapt to changing things isn't enough.

279
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,760
They have to be motivated to adapt.

280
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,840
They, it has to be fun to adapt.

281
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,480
And, uh, some of us, uh, have to provide, uh, uh, sick humor.

282
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,400
Some, like Dr. Leary, provide, uh, concepts that can keep people going.

283
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:56,200
And, uh, it's, they're affordable substitutes for a shrink, essentially, is, is what we're talking about.

284
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,920
That, uh, that you can carry in your head.

285
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,820
You don't have to actually go visit the shrink.

286
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,880
You just carry the concept and let it percolate.

287
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,280
And see what comes out.

288
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,620
And hopefully it's not the next Charlie Manson.

289
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:15,960
Uh, it's like the Jetsons meet the Flintstones every day, uh, here in Dallas, Texas.

290
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:22,240
And, and subgenius is what you might call where Tim Leary meets Night of the Living Dead.

291
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,020
And everybody parties!

292
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,800
That's the important thing.

293
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,840
Everybody parties.

294
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,900
So, but more than that, what we have in common, when I was reading the book Flashbacks,

295
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,260
and that, uh, made Dr. Leary a little bit more interesting.

296
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:35,260


297
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,460
I think that he was talking about, uh, Dr. Leary, a real person.

298
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,440
And that he was talking about the reactions of family and friends and kids and so forth

299
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,100
to the wild stuff that was happening to him, uh, you know, all these years.

300
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:57,480
And, which makes the person sort of real to me as, as somebody who just sort of fell into a, into a position in history

301
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,700
but took the ball and ran with it.

302
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,600
Uh, actually did it with a certain amount of responsibility.

303
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,240
Which, uh, I don't know.

304
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:11,340
Which shows in the fact that he's, he has constantly, I think, like a lot of parents do,

305
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:19,080
uh, it's kind of almost painful to recognize how important it is to set an example, to be a role model.

306
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:26,480
And he is an excellent example of survival for the upcoming little punks and scallywags of tomorrow.

307
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:35,160
Riding as he has the surfboard of pop mythology, uh, very deliberately and skillfully, consciously,

308
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:42,040
a hanging pin, dear friends, on the great curl of hipness legendry.

309
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,800
I don't know, but what's an alibi for late?

310
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,300
Come and join me.

311
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,600
It's got to be funky.

312
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,260
This Sunday at midnight on Memory Lane, it's the godfather of soul, James Brown.

313
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:04,360
Yeah!

314
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,320
James Brown!

315
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,700
Let's give him some hope.

316
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,460
Let's give him some hope.

317
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,860
And that's what it's about.

318
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:25,100
So, I also read in flashbacks that when his, uh, when he started to get all this media attention in the 60s,

319
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,440
he went to Marshall McLuhan and said, how do I deal with this?

320
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,860
And McLuhan basically said, smile a lot.

321
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,480
Whenever the TV guys are around, smile a lot.

322
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,100
And I've noticed Dr. Leary does that.

323
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,160
J.R. Bob Dobbs smiles a lot.

324
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,800
And, uh, that is a lot in common, really.

325
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,700
That's all we need to ask for, I guess.

326
00:19:45,900 --> 00:20:00,780
As the, uh, Learian slogan of make your own reality is not any different, really, from Bob Dobbs' slogan of pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

327
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,160
And, uh, friends, everything you know is true.

328
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,480
Too much is always better than not enough.

329
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:13,800
And, uh, thanks to the Athenor Group and Bob Martin for bringing in Dr. Timothy Leary.

330
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,400
Whoo!

331
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,260
Hey, Bob!

332
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,820
What are you gonna do?

333
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,880
So I realize that it's gonna get worse.

334
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,620
Millennium Madness, the next wave's gonna get worse.

335
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,680
So, who's gonna keep the boat from rocking too much?

336
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:38,040
Those of us that went through the 60s and 70s had a lot of experience in this, you know, uh, Millennium Madness.

337
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,560
You know, anything wilder than Ken Kesey's acid trips.

338
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:51,520
So, in a funny way, it turns out, and I'm coming before you tonight to remind you that it's gonna turn out that we are the practical ones.

339
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,300
We are, are.

340
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah, we gotta pay the rent, balance the budget, and, uh, we won't, uh, we won't, uh, declare war until Tuesday or Wednesday.

341
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,940
We'll take it over, yeah.

342
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,340
A little Thor-sy might help.

343
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:25,820
So, uh, be advised, you're gonna see a lot more of this, uh, uh, Looney Tunes stuff.

344
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,500
And, uh, the way to do it, of course, is, uh, the way you handle someone that's freaking out.

345
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,140
You know, give a nice sense of humor.

346
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,100
And just, you know, keep calm.

347
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,500
And, uh, I think you're all gonna remember, uh, this night as we move into the next 12 years.

348
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:56,700
Now, another thing that's happening, a way of, uh, ending the Millennium, uh, there's been a lot of chronology in the last few months about the Summer of Love.

349
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,580
Have you heard about it?

350
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,840
You know, there's a, there's 20 years ago.

351
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,620
This year, today, that Sagan and Pepper talked about the land of play and all that.

352
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,180
There's been a big media hype about Summer of Love.

353
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,940
And, uh, I've had this experience.

354
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:18,760
I have had reunions sometimes in lectures, sometimes debates with many of the people from the, uh, 60s.

355
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,400
And it's interesting to see how they're doing.

356
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,700
Uh, if you have any questions later, I'll be glad to answer to my ability, uh, questions about people in the 60s.

357
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,520
Uh, I've come to, uh...

358
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,060
Be sure to, uh...

359
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,000
Be very fond of, uh, Abby Hoffman.

360
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,840
Uh, no question he's crazy.

361
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,080
That's all right. No one's perfect.

362
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,560
Uh...

363
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:42,780
But he is, without any question, the, the super champ of rap.

364
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:44,860
Abby.

365
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,180
He's written a book called, uh, Steal This Urine Test.

366
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:48,900
Uh, any man?

367
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:57,620
And, uh, Abby, uh, feels that, uh, urine testing for drugs is like the loyalty oaths of the, uh, 50s.

368
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,440
And, uh, he feels...

369
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,620
He's, uh...

370
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,020
Abby comes to the board with these groups and he, uh...

371
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,480
He's a nonstop talker.

372
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,560
And, uh, he's got bandoliers of one-liners and cartons of facts and figures.

373
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,600
And he's an inundation.

374
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,780
And he's always right.

375
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,300
It's not fun.

376
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,960
Sometimes I have to actually come and say,

377
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,720
Okay, Abby, come on.

378
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,500
Don't sit down for a while.

379
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,140
But, uh...

380
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,900
I don't want to tell you how many helicopters the Honduras government has

381
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:25,020
and how many gallons of urine specimens the DEA has, uh, misplaced.

382
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,180
And, uh, you know, don't drop your zipper for the Gipper and Ron.

383
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:41,240
Uh, so my most interesting and educational debates, uh, this year have been with a man named Peter Bensinger,

384
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,840
who for five years was the head of the DEA.

385
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,720
Now, when they call me and say,

386
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,940
Timothy, would you like to debate, uh, this guy's the head of the Dred Terug enforcement agency?

387
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,340
Well...

388
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,960
Would David like to?

389
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,620
Well, I'll tell you, debate Goliath.

390
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,320
Bring him on.

391
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,560
It was very educational to me because, uh, we all live in, you know,

392
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,640
we don't really spend much time with people that have very different points of view.

393
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,540
And I watched this man come before a college audience, let's say,

394
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,580
700, uh, horny college students on a Friday night.

395
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:26,880
And he started talking about cocaine kills and marijuana kills and assassinations and abuse and, uh,

396
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,980
and then...

397
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,360
Boys and girls, you don't realize it.

398
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:37,280
The marijuana you're smoking today is ten times stronger than the marijuana you smoke in the...

399
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,760
Well, what do they do?

400
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:39,940
They cheer.

401
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,340
They cheer.

402
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,360
You can't believe it.

403
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,800
Eight years the head of the, uh, Illinois prison system and then for five years head of the DEA.

404
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:57,640
He had 17,000 agents and, uh, 139 stations in 72 countries, all saluting and stuff like that.

405
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:08,440
And no one had ever raised the possibility that there might be some reason why 70 million Americans smoke marijuana or take, uh, recreational drugs.

406
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,200
They never occurred to me that it's evil, it's wrong, it's against the law.

407
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,360
Case dismissed.

408
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,040
So, uh, that made it easy to debate.

409
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,260
You would say, well, cocaine.

410
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,900
You take cocaine.

411
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,860
Your heart starts to beat very fast.

412
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,880
You perspire.

413
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,960
You feel warm.

414
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,580
Undoubtedly, you feel wonderful.

415
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,760
But, uh, in a few minutes it's all over.

416
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,440
You can go to bed and see, have you ever had an orgasm?

417
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,500
I mean, they ended up dead.

418
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:54,140
This thing about death, death, death, kills, death, cocaine, a big lie, a retrodoxin, death, kill, death.

419
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,140
Uh, no, I think he's in the room.

420
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:03,640
Gee, I hate to introduce some facts here that would blow your low, Peter, but, uh,

421
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:19,420
but the facts are, you know, that, uh, if you're really sincerely worried about the health and welfare of the American people and eliminating causes of death, I tell you, uh, marijuana and cocaine are way down at the bottom of the thing.

422
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,600
We can start with nuclear weapons.

423
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,580
We can start with pollution of the air and water.

424
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,660
We can go down to, uh, AIDS, for example.

425
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:26,840
Uh, I don't know.

426
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,380
Uh, poor medical care, on and on and on.

427
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:38,040
But if you really want to have a scoreboard about, like, things people do like drugs that are killers, let's, let's, let's, uh, play the record.

428
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,740
Cocaine, they say, kills between five or seven hundred people a year from overdose.

429
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,000
That's terrible.

430
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,560
We could cut that down to a hundred.

431
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,820
No, we live in a, in a country of 250 million people.

432
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:03,520
There are going to be a hundred self-destructive nitwits that are going to overdose on mayonnaise or ketchup.

433
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:14,620
But basically, that, that, that, that's a terrible, all the cocaine deaths, so-called, are people that died with bullets because there were shootouts.

434
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,960
Still counts as a cocaine death even there.

435
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,060
So, we're going to do something about that.

436
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,940
One thing you do about cocaine is, uh, educate people honestly about cocaine.

437
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,820
The first thing you tell people about cocaine is, uh, you're going to tell them about cocaine.

438
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,240
The second thing you tell people about cocaine is that, uh, there are two forms of cocaine.

439
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:37,120
Just like there's beer and wine, or the natural fermented, uh, liquors that have, which have been around for, what, 50,000 years?

440
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,760
Beer, wine, grapes, you know?

441
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:48,660
And then there's hard liquor, made in factories and juiced up and powerful and only in the industrial age have we had hard liquor.

442
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,020
And, uh, there's a great difference between them.

443
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:56,800
Same thing as with cocaine, uh, if you, if you shoot cocaine with a needle or if you, uh, you shoot cocaine with a needle,

444
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:04,960
or you smoke it with one of those big, uh, you know, lighters that they have like a blow torch.

445
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,340
It's all very technological.

446
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,580
Yeah.

447
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,280
That's like chugging a fifth of tequila.

448
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,620
No question you're going to feel pretty, uh, wild for a few minutes.

449
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,380
No question of that.

450
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:24,640
But, uh, then you go right down and then you want more and that's bad on the, uh, very unhealthy for the body, for the mind, and for the purse.

451
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,440
So, uh...

452
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,120
And, uh, just to tell people, that's that.

453
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,860
If you shoot or smoke cocaine, it's like chug a lugging a fifth of whiskey.

454
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,300
Now, tuning cocaine is different, uh, uh, if you're tooting some cocaine, you're not going to flush another.

455
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,240
For about two, three hours, you're going to feel the top of the world.

456
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,980
You're going to be the smartest, uh, young woman or man in the place.

457
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,020
Uh, if you have any problems with self-confidence, uh, ha, ha, ha.

458
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,660
That's gone for the moment.

459
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,740
There's a scientific term.

460
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,540
I want to be scientific here.

461
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,760
Psychopharmacologist.

462
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:08,600
The scientific term for, uh, people who have toot cocaine, uh, would be, uh, loudmouth asshole.

463
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,300
If you're talking about being a loudmouth asshole, at least you're awake or you're alive in the morning.

464
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:24,800
And there's nothing in the Constitution, uh, in spite of Jed Bork, uh, that prevents people from, uh, being a loudmouth, obnoxious asshole.

465
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,420
Otherwise, we'd have no problem.

466
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:31,880
We'd have no politicians or barroom drunks or born-again Christians.

467
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,400
So, uh,

468
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:42,200
Now, then you come to, uh, if you're concerned about, uh, deaths of American people, how about handguns?

469
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,360
Ten thousand people die a year from handguns.

470
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,040
And think about handguns, they use it.

471
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,400
The th- the guys that are going around with the handgun, pow, pow, pow.

472
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,920
They're not putting the powder up their noses.

473
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,500
Mm-hmm.

474
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,760
They're shooting their wives, their lovers, their friends, and people from the street.

475
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,240
In L.A., they're shooting them on the freeway, pow, pow.

476
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:10,180
So, uh, the ten thousand there, in a sense, is worse than the, the few hundred cocaine deaths because that's, you know, a lot of innocent victims and not just self-destruction.

477
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,080
How about drunken driving?

478
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,360
Fifty thousand people a year, drunken driving.

479
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,900
And, you know, every drunken driver knows the ru- first rule of the road.

480
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,500
Get a big American car.

481
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:29,140
Well, it's the poor person in the Volvo or the vegetarian VW that gets balked around by the-

482
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,340
Uh, nicotine.

483
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,340
The three hundred thousand people a year die from effects of nicotine.

484
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,240
And, of course, the government sponsors that with the, uh, the subsidy.

485
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,580
Southern Senator Jesse Helms, you know, has to have his, uh,

486
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,320
So, um, okay, that's the death situation.

487
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,840
Now, I have a nagging feeling I forgot something.

488
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:02,360
I gotta tell you right up front that, uh, uh, my brain's been, you know, banged around a lot.

489
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,660
You can't fly out to as velocity as I have.

490
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,600
You know, you get a little fender dented out here and there.

491
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,880
Probably a few million neurons here and there.

492
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:23,480
Uh, so, there are three, you know, classic side effects of taking a lot of sex.

493
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,140
Psychedelic drugs that spend a lot of time exploring your brain.

494
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:31,640
Zooming around through your, uh, left brain to right brain, cerebral wiring and all that.

495
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:38,160
And, uh, the three, uh, side effects are, uh, the worst one is long-term memory gain.

496
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,320
That's really confusing.

497
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,220
With no guidebooks or maps on the answer.

498
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,980
And, uh, second, short-term memory loss.

499
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,540
And I forget the third, but then...

500
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,520
No, I remember the third.

501
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,920
The third thing I forgot was, remember I forgot?

502
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,380
Deaths from marijuana.

503
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,500
You know, I'm basically a scientist.

504
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,520
I'm a linguist, I'm a philosopher, I'm a psychologist.

505
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,660
I'm basically a scientist.

506
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,880
And I, you know, I like to quantify things and I like to keep score.

507
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,100
And I don't care if you felt you played well, but, you know, what's the score? Okay.

508
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,760
You know what?

509
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,540
We had, uh, used my many computer resources to do database studies of the AMAA.

510
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,640
How many deaths from marijuana?

511
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,800
Uh, UNESCO, how many deaths globally?

512
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,820
The Smithsonian Institute, how many deaths over the years from marijuana?

513
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,380
Uh, the New England Journal of Medicine, prestigious journal out there.

514
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,520
How many deaths from marijuana?

515
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,760
Well, the results came in and I got it.

516
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,660
I had to be factual with Mr. Benz here.

517
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,960
I'll be honest with you.

518
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,000
There have been...

519
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,280
12 deaths due to marijuana in the last 25,000 years.

520
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,120
It's a sad, sad statistic to report, but...

521
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:13,580
One of the cases of a court of ill-advised people that, uh, either smoke, uh, some marijuana too much

522
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:18,440
or they ate some marijuana brownies and, uh, they got the giggles and they laughed themselves to death.

523
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,000
Sad.

524
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:32,160
There are four, possibly six people that, uh, uh, ate or smoked some marijuana and, uh, they got the munchies.

525
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,940
And they ate themselves to death.

526
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,840
The scientific term for that is, uh, refrigerated blackout.

527
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:48,500
And then there are cases of, uh, four, maybe six honeymoon couples that, uh,

528
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,720
they smoked some marijuana and fucked themselves to death.

529
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,860
I don't know if you've seen that word here.

530
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,460
It's a joke, you know, I'm just gonna...

531
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,100
I'm not cursing.

532
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,780
I gave a talk one day in Alabama and the headline said,

533
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,560
I cursed a lot.

534
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,120
Well, uh...

535
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,900
So, uh...

536
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,480
I'm not cursing.

537
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:18,480


538
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:18,480


539
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,340
But listen, we gotta be serious here.

540
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,060
Uh, drugs are serious business.

541
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,660
And it's all well and good for us to, you know, take...

542
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,440
President Reagan has attacked me.

543
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,760
Firstly, he said, I'm a heatness, uh, and I encourage permissiveness,

544
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,480
and I take a flippant view towards drugs.

545
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,200
And drugs are...

546
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:41,340
I'm gonna be serious here.

547
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,700
Uh, there are...

548
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,960
One place...

549
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,320
Yeah, I'm not a very great fan of the Reagan White House, but, yeah.

550
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,300
There's one place where I totally agree with the, uh, nitwit, uh, Reagan White House,

551
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,140
and that is, say no for kids.

552
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,560
Uh, we've got, we've got to be really serious here

553
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,060
about the problem of kids taking drugs.

554
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,000
And see, it's, it's a new problem because it, it's, it's, it's...

555
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,860
It took a long time for us to figure this out.

556
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,980
See, I come from a generation where, when you were 21 years old,

557
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,800
you were just a kid, see, and, uh, the, the other authorities, you know,

558
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,300
uh, I'm talking 1930s, where, you know,

559
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,960
the older you were, the wiser you were,

560
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,320
when you got to, when you were 35, when you were 35 years old,

561
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,540
you got to see an X-rated film of the American Legion smoker, see.

562
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,060
So, uh, youth, take for granted, youth didn't know anything.

563
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,020
Even when you were 18, 20, you didn't know anything.

564
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,560
20, 30, maybe.

565
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,060
Then during the 60s, a funny thing happened.

566
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,280
This changed so that the 60s,

567
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,860
in 9 out of 10 households, everyone knew

568
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,780
that the kids knew more than the grownups, you know.

569
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,940
The, uh, about the ending of the Vietnam War,

570
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,420
about, uh, you know, the different freedoms, and see.

571
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:56,020
So there was tension there, but most intelligent, uh, parents,

572
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,240
you know, figured out, really, that there was something new happening here.

573
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,260
Let's listen to the Beatles, and hey, you know,

574
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:07,160
so that, this notion that kids know as much as, as parents, uh,

575
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,240
I know it violates the Fourth Commandment, uh,

576
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,020
I'm not, I shan't not honor the Achillean kids,

577
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,760
but, uh, you're kind of used to this.

578
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,560
You have, you know, being a little ahead of your parents,

579
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,300
but the kids today, you can't believe,

580
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:26,040
do you know how, how, how sophisticated they are.

581
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,580
Have you read, uh, Less Than Zero,

582
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,960
or have you read the Jane McInerney's book,

583
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,960
or the whole series of books about high school kids,

584
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,760
you know, uh, well, the Billionaire's Boy Club.

585
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,700
There's a bunch of high school kids that were running the billionaire,

586
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,300
uh, their offing, you know, radio, and so forth.

587
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,520
So, uh, the kids today, no question of it,

588
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,140
are,

589
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,200
incredibly sophisticated in the sense that they,

590
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,580
on, on, on TV, you know, they're X-rated and R-rated stuff on TV.

591
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,340
They're exposed to so much.

592
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,220
The movie, we don't, we're not aware of it, but, uh,

593
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,920
and, you know, eight, ten, twelve,

594
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,620
these kids, in the sense, they're tuned in a lot of stuff

595
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,120
that we don't know about, the new punk lyrics and all that,

596
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,820
but they simply aren't.

597
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,560
They're not the college kids, you know,

598
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,300
the one to Woodstock.

599
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,460
We're talking about twelve, thirteen, fourteen year old kids.

600
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,300
It's a long time to see that.

601
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,860
I even have a, uh, fourteen year old kid, so,

602
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,200
uh, and, uh, call me square,

603
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,220
I, my wife and I,

604
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,820
we've had to sit down,

605
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,000
this is the last word for this,

606
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,760
you cannot use drugs.

607
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,500
And if, you know, you talk to us about it,

608
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,740
and we use drugs, but we're grown up, then you can't.

609
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,700
When you get old enough and you get twenty-one,

610
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,960
you can make your decision.

611
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,940
You can not use drugs.

612
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,620
Uh, you can't use booze either.

613
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,480
See, there's the bar,

614
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,260
you know, you see us drink,

615
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,700
you can't drink, because your body,

616
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,520
your mind simply can't deal with it.

617
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,640
And there's a good reason for that,

618
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,760
and we don't want you to drink.

619
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,660
Uh, there's a chainsaw,

620
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,920
in the garage, you know.

621
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,780
Call me a tell-em-a-hun,

622
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,420
but you're grounded if you come here

623
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,160
without a chainsaw.

624
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,940
The car keys are gonna get you sick,

625
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,740
you know, again, you know,

626
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,600
you can't, uh, use that coffee.

627
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,240
I know, when I was growing up,

628
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,240


629
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,700
but I was a little bit of a drinker.

630
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,240
You have to, you know, you have to talk to my wife,

631
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,160
I'm old, I'll be getting around Nancy Reagan

632
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,400
and the plan to have the National Garden

633
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,140
every kindergarten.

634
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,260
You're not old enough.

635
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,560
I know I do these things,

636
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,600
you can't fuck your mother either.

637
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,660
I've got a helpful hint,

638
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,800
I ought to write something down.

639
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,880
I'm just wondering how to deal with this stuff.

640
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,040
Honesty, and common sense,

641
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,940
and honesty, of course, are the last things

642
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,140
that the people that run the, uh,

643
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,940
the government of Washington,

644
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,160
as a matter of fact, Nancy Reagan has two kids,

645
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,100
Ron Jr. and Nancy Davis,

646
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:55,900
I know them both.

647
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,780
Patty Davis, I'm sorry, Patty Davis.

648
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,280
I know them both, they're wonderful kids,

649
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,040
you can make a public record,

650
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,720
they've used a lot of drugs for a lot of years,

651
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,400
and, uh, and they've made very clear

652
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,900
that Nancy was sat down with them

653
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,540
and discussed it.

654
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,780
It was kind of a terrible thing

655
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,020
that those children did back then, you know,

656
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,640
masturbation is murder, you know that.

657
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,300
So, uh, I'm definitely on the record

658
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,760
against, uh, kids, and you've got to really,

659
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,000
of course, it's got to be family,

660
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,220
it's got to be friends, older brothers and sisters,

661
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,140
cousins, neighbors, uh, we've all got to,

662
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,220
uh, in a neighborhood, we've got to protect

663
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,200
our kids and so forth, it's our duty to our kids.

664
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,720
Now, when it comes to adults, I'm pro-choice.

665
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,380
What other position can an American be

666
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:41,860
if I, uh,

667
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,360
if I have anything that affects your body?

668
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,960
Uh, the adult American has the right to do

669
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,300
with their body or his body anything, uh,

670
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,120
that, uh,

671
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,720
here he chooses to.

672
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,540
If you leave your house and start

673
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,100
staggering around, uh, in the neighborhood

674
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,620
or in the street, yeah, bust, bust, bust.

675
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,320
Just, again, that's not common sense.

676
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,700
It's not common sense to spend six billion dollars

677
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,760
in a, uh, thought police called the narcotics,

678
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,720
EEA, burning the marijuana fields in California.

679
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,440
Marijuana is the number one cash crop in California

680
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,400
and America, so, uh, the productivity is going down

681
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,020
and then we turn around and say,

682
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,700
100 billion dollars or more to gangsters in Peru.

683
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,180
That's not common sense, is it?

684
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,720
Really, it's not common sense because it doesn't work,

685
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,720
because it's costing us hundreds of billions of dollars,

686
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,660
uh, both in foreign trade.

687
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,600
I'm protectionist on marijuana, to be clear.

688
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,200
Keep the next in marijuana out.

689
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,580
I don't know, the Japanese may not like it anyway.

690
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,580
Uh, so, uh, that's for adults.

691
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,360
And I, I tell college students, I tell you,

692
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,300
I tell college students, you know what, frankly,

693
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,280
I don't care whether you take drugs or not.

694
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,680
In fact, the more drugs you take,

695
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,840
the more trouble it causes me,

696
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,460
because, uh, your folks are gonna get hysteria,

697
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,360
Nancy Reagan's gonna bomb my, my neighborhood.

698
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,400
And, uh, furthermore, the less drugs you take,

699
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,640
the more there is for me and my friends.

700
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:28,140
So, uh, it's just not common sense.

701
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,280
I debate this guy, he says, no, no, no.

702
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,660
He knows, he knows exactly.

703
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,920
You know, you know, everybody knows.

704
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,040
All drugs, no, no, no.

705
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,560
Well, other liquor, well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

706
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,460
See, I can't say yes or no, because, um,

707
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,140
my job and your job is, of course,

708
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,700
to encourage and empower each other to think for yourself.

709
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,460
And every time anyone does or does not take a drug,

710
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,060
or does or does not do anything else with their body,

711
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,760
it's always an individual situation.

712
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,640
You may make one decision today and something else tomorrow.

713
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,040
So, I know you all know that.

714
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,060
It's one of the ways that I feel tough on drugs.

715
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,260
And that's with addicts.

716
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,220
It's well known that about 10% of the population

717
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,380
who are designed by DNA or the Gaia wisdom

718
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:09,700
or DNA of the brain,

719
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,260
or intelligence or God or whatever it may be,

720
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,060
a kid or I don't know,

721
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,580
but who are just wired to self-destruct.

722
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,400
You know what I'm talking about.

723
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,900
You see them in high school, junior high school,

724
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,680
in kindergarten, look around.

725
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,640
There are people that, they're gonna destruct on money,

726
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,440
on gambling, on sex, on cars, on drugs.

727
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,000
That's a wonderful way to self-destruct.

728
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,520
You can have flames if you want to do that.

729
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,580
And all of the publicity about drugs

730
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,060
goes to this 10% of, screw us.

731
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,360
You don't hear exposés of 90% of the American people, adults,

732
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,260
are using drugs reasonably intelligently.

733
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,400
You may get a little too drunk on New Year's Eve

734
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,100
or you may get a little bit,

735
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,540
but reasonably, 90% of Americans use drugs,

736
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,920
including alcohol.

737
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,560
Use them, you know, for the realistic, you know,

738
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,380
veteran, experienced,

739
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,000
not that you're gonna take a little risk now and then,

740
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,420
but still, there's no problem.

741
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,540
It's the 10%.

742
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,980
It causes all the problem.

743
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,860
None of that is the 10% that are on the covers of magazines

744
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,600
blabbing off about drugs.

745
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,460
They're the experts.

746
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,540
Or on the TV, I was gonna,

747
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,440
if I see another ex-addict get on TV and explain drugs,

748
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,460
I'm gonna pop out of my shoes.

749
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,900
It's so silly to assume that the people who can't do something

750
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,260
are the experts on it.

751
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,160
We in the 20th century have gone through an experience

752
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,460
which we're just beginning to understand now.

753
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,900
A new philosophy of nature that works

754
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,440
was developed around the year 1900.

755
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,660
And the history of the roaring 20th century

756
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:07,520
is a history of a species of domestication,

757
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:07,520


758
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,360
which indicated farmers and factory workers

759
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,200
learning how to live in, inhabit,

760
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:20,400
deal with this new definition of reality,

761
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,520
which is, to which we're moving.

762
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,020
Now the philosophy I'm talking about, of course,

763
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,420
is the philosophy of quantum physics.

764
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,380
And around the turn of the century,

765
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,580
there were three very cybernetic, psychedelic,

766
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,520
far-out German philosophers

767
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,040
who initiated a theory of reality

768
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,180
which is just not intuitive,

769
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,900
it's just not commonsensical,

770
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,780
it's unbelievable, it's mad, it's bizarre,

771
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,140
but it works.

772
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,080
First to mention this was Einstein,

773
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,880
who came along and said, I'm paraphrasing here,

774
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,140
that there's no absolute space or time.

775
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,780
I see you moving, but I'm moving too,

776
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,060
and my measurements of you depend on my position

777
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,720
and my velocity,

778
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,020
and direction, and yours too.

779
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,200
So there's no absolute space or time or reality.

780
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,120
It's all dependent on point of view.

781
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,640
Now that's a heart of the day.

782
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,240
See, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson,

783
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,880
and I have to mention Jimmy and Tammy,

784
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,220
are thundering out when they're preaching

785
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,780
about secular humanism and relativity.

786
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,240
There's one set of commandments,

787
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,700
and it's down in that one Bible,

788
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,880
word for word, in the dictated text,

789
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,660
that was written 4,000 years ago

790
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,380
by the one and only God,

791
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,320
and there's no room for relativity,

792
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,400
and those are not ten suggestions on Marvel.

793
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,720
And Einstein comes along and says,

794
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,680
okay, so right from the beginning,

795
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,480
the conservative moralists and religious bureaucrats

796
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,640
sensed a danger in Einstein.

797
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,480
Then to make matters worse,

798
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,680
a man named Max Planck came along

799
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,460
and said, this solid world that we see here,

800
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,280
and our bodies, and this whole thing

801
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,980
that seems so material and real and solid to us,

802
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,400
this Newtonian universe of mass and momentum

803
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,620
and work and power and action and reaction,

804
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,520
it's everything.

805
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,520
It's all made up of clusters of quanta,

806
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,180
probability little bits of an image

807
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,780
that occasionally cluster together

808
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:29,080
in structured form, but very quickly,

809
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,740
so that literally we are living

810
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,200
in a universe, and we are part of

811
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,920
and made up of a universe

812
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,440
of clusters of quanta, probability up on,

813
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,240
now that's a bad-ass trick.

814
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,680
You can grab a hand coat around you

815
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,040
and pull the whole city down on you.

816
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,020
A lot of you have been in that, but see.

817
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,220
Now, you imagine,

818
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,660
here in 1900, when this stuff started coming out,

819
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,520
nobody could understand it,

820
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,760
because these guys wrote their equations,

821
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,640
they were communicating in a most

822
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,140
Paleolithic caveman form.

823
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,360
They were writing with a chalk on a blackboard

824
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,600
in these arcades, and nobody could understand it.

825
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,480
You know, I think the typical American here in 1900,

826
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,340
remember that Grant Wood picture,

827
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,820
American Gothic, where the black there,

828
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,620
really, down to earth, Iowa, farmers,

829
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,140
and here's this Jew Einstein coming along

830
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,480
and saying, really, the gorilla did it?

831
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,680
Like this crazy Max coming along and saying,

832
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,040
well, dear, we know that we got to plow

833
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,160
on the good old Kansas earth,

834
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,560
so we don't have to worry about that.

835
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,520
Well, they had to worry about it.

836
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,220
They also had to worry about

837
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,500
Werner Heisenberg, who came along

838
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,700
and said something even worse.

839
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,860
He said that the reality is that you see

840
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,440
and that I see is totally determined

841
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,260
by our sense organs,

842
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,200
which we can only see within a certain spectra,

843
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,920
and so forth, by the equipment we use

844
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,320
to magnify a telescope's microscope,

845
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,080
and the maps or models that we use

846
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,600
to explain what we see.

847
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,060
In other words, your reality is what you see,

848
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,280
your mind is what I see,

849
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,980
your sees, and everybody makes their own rounds,

850
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,040
and that was a tough one to take.

851
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:16,180
The problem was, though, that it worked.

852
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,540
See, quantum physics works,

853
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,320
as we learned in Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

854
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:24,020
and with the, I'll tell you how it worked.

855
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,440
The task, the genetic and historic task,

856
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,020
of the 20th century,

857
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,720
for those of us that have been moving through it,

858
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,600
is this.

859
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:39,040
How to take a species of domesticated primates

860
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,340
who work in farms and in a semi-dark factory

861
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:44,100
and get them to feel comfortable and secure

862
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,660
and efficient in piloting their way through

863
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,340
and inhabiting a quantum universe.

864
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,040
Now, in situations like this,

865
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,380
where a species is inevitable,

866
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,000
you just have to keep moving and changing,

867
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,660
you can't stop it,

868
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,820
who are the people that make

869
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,640
the mysterious comfortable?

870
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,860
Who are the people that make the unknown

871
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,820
and the dark and the far beyond

872
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,300
and the scary and the frightening?

873
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,660
Who makes it possible?

874
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,500
Well, you know that there's a special cast of human beings.

875
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:21,060
They are called artists, or poets,

876
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,080
or visionaries, or dreamers,

877
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,320
or storytellers, or whacked-out scientists,

878
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,840
musicians,

879
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:29,800
who are the ones who make

880
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:29,940
the universe.

881
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:29,940


882
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:30,540
Composers,

883
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:32,460
shamans,

884
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:34,580
sagatars,

885
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,220
you know who I'm talking about.

886
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,480
The people who tell the rest of the herd

887
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,340
what's going on out there

888
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,540
is gonna be all right

889
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,140
when Ulysses sails

890
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,280
through the pillars of Hercules

891
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,520
over the wide, dark sea,

892
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,080
he's not gonna drop off the edge,

893
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,360
be of good heart,

894
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,600
go out there and sail,

895
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,760
he's gonna be all right.

896
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:56,400
It's the people who send their pledges

897
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,620
to K-N-O-N, dear friends,

898
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,020
when the tape runs out.

899
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,580
Come on, man!

900
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,440
Friends, create your own reality out of this.

901
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,080
There we go.

902
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,480
Tuesday evenings.

903
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,420
On the immense

904
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,000
brain

905
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,340
show

906
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,560
on K-N-O-N 90.9 FM.

907
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,260
It's from 12 till 2 after the vital hour.

908
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,240
Come and check it out.

909
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,980
I think you'll like what you hear.

910
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

911
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:50,280
The giant brain show, dear friends.

912
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,540
Well, gosh, I've got about seven minutes left to go.

913
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,320
Uh, I'm gonna go back to the computer,

914
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:55,420
and I'll talk to you later.

915
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,580
Uh, uh, uh,

916
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:57,260
Deedlee Llama,

917
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,260
we, what do you,

918
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:58,640
what do you do?

919
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:59,380
Do you play, uh,

920
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,260
ten minutes of Timothy Leary,

921
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,980
uh, never getting to the punchline,

922
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:03,940
or do you just,

923
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,920
do you just float on down?

924
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,940
Well, you ask those good little subgeniuses out there

925
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,300
to send their pledges in.

926
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,620
I'm looking at this chart up here,

927
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:13,680
and the last time I was in here,

928
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,860
everybody was calling in

929
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,660
and promising you were gonna send that money,

930
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,360
but that money hadn't come in yet.

931
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,780
What's the matter with you guys?

932
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,200
What do you think we are up here?

933
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,960
What do you think you are?

934
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,220
Are you really a subgenius?

935
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,340
Or are you a pink person?

936
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,460
Eh? Eh?

937
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,880
Send that money in.

938
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:31,940
We need that money.

939
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,900
We need this radio ministry.

940
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,440
You know, if you don't send that money in,

941
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,980
you're gonna have to explain yourself

942
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,100
to Jehovah One come X day.

943
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:42,940
Worse than that,

944
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,600
you may have to talk to me.

945
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,980
You shouldn't have bit fish.

946
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,080
You shouldn't have bit fish,

947
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,060
but it's too late now.

948
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,340
You're on the line,

949
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,360
and you're gonna have to,

950
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,440
you're gonna have to jump into that frying pan,

951
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:54,900
or else,

952
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,200
damn it,

953
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,400
you're gonna pinch across the fire.

954
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,520
Well, Reverend Stang,

955
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,640
I want to thank you

956
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,580
for your help

957
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,820
in bringing Dr. Timothy Leary to town

958
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,000
and having these tapes available

959
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,700
for all those subgeniuses out there

960
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,840
whose parents

961
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,060
whose parents wouldn't let them get the car keys that night.

962
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,680
That's right. That's right.

963
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,240
And also, the Athenor Group.

964
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,260
I think we need to recognize them.

965
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,080
Hear, hear. Hear, hear.

966
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,080
I certainly didn't have that money

967
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,960
to pay him to drive in Dallas.

968
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,280
That's right.

969
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,280
And, uh,

970
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:31,900
uh, I, do we,

971
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,020
can we say anything about the Athenor Group?

972
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:35,740
Uh, for those of you who don't know?

973
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,020
Well, they've got a bookstore down across from,

974
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,220
uh, Fair Park.

975
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,600
Is it okay to say it's next to the Bar of Soap?

976
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,380
Yeah, yeah.

977
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,340
Uh, we can't tell them to buy anything there,

978
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,300
because they have to send their money here to the station.

979
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:46,460
No, I would never do that.

980
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,920
They've got to send their money here to the station first.

981
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,740
But it's a good place to know about.

982
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,700
It's a, it's our civic duty to make sure

983
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,840
that they know about this bookstore,

984
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,840
which does contain such unusual information.

985
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,660
Which is, by the way,

986
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,540
a supporter of KNON 90.9 FM,

987
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,780
the voice of the people.

988
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,720
If you are people out there.

989
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,460
Praise Jeff.

990
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,880
Praise Jeff.

991
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:04,720
Praise Jeff.

992
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,760
And I just want to thank Bob

993
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,380
for this radio ministry

994
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,360
and all that it's doing all over the world.

995
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,300
And a little bit about the Athenor Group.

996
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,320
Uh, Reverend Cottrell,

997
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,920
would you say something to us about the Athenor Group?

998
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,640
Have at it, Doc.

999
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,340
Well, well, I don't really know what to say.

1000
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,820
We're the second generation Athenor group.

1001
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:23,820


1002
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,180
The first generation consisted of

1003
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,040
Marilyn Monroe,

1004
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,340
Neil Cassidy,

1005
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,420
Sylvia Plath,

1006
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,180
John Kennedy,

1007
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,760
and J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1008
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,400
Oh, that Athenor group.

1009
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:37,760
That Athenor group.

1010
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,280
They never told me the name of that

1011
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,580
because they didn't want me to come in.

1012
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,460
I wasn't old enough.

1013
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,360
You weren't old enough.

1014
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:42,900
It was,

1015
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,140
Athenor Anderson originated this group

1016
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,240
after her death

1017
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,120
by appearing to this group of people

1018
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,040
and anointing them

1019
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,940
and delivering to them

1020
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,320
the Athenorium,

1021
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,420
which preceded the pre-scriptures

1022
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,520
of the Book of the Subgenius,

1023
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,480
which J.R. Bob Dobbs

1024
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:00,980
borrowed some of.

1025
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,500
Well, well, now, uh,

1026
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,960
these teachings are eternal.

1027
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,460
These are eternal teachings, dear friend.

1028
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,600
Yeah, they go beyond other things.

1029
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,100
And they somehow end up having the same punchline

1030
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,380
in many different languages

1031
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,800
and many different religions.

1032
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,820
You still end up with that same punchline.

1033
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,400
And we ain't gonna tell you that punchline.

1034
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,000
You're gonna have to find out for yourself.

1035
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,120
Are you fishing for a song?

1036
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,260
Are you fishing for a song?

1037
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,060
Well, stay tuned

1038
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,720
because you will get those songs

1039
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,920
when Robert Wisdom comes in here

1040
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,420
with the American Music Party.

1041
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,760
Oh, the smell of fish ain't fish.

1042
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,580
Oh, somebody said fish is rain.

1043
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,220
Fish is rain.

1044
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,380
A lot to think about in the caveat.

1045
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,720
Fish can fill our brain

1046
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,720
Even we three

1047
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,000

1055
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,740
I'm going to read that number again.

1056
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,020
You got that pencil ready, dear friends?

1057
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:44,440
You can write for information from Bob at P.O. Box 140-306, Dallas, 75214.

1058
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,780
This is George Clinton taking you out.

1059
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:50,120
It's been a psychedelic evening.

1060
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:22,900
It's been a psychedelic evening.

1061
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,920
