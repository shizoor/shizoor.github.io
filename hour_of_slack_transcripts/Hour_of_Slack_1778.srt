1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,720
From the lost monasteries of ancient Tibet, amid the snow-capped Himalayan mountains,

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,220
comes the secret healing part of the subgenius power of the super-machines.

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,580
I have a holy table with pictures on it of Buddha and Christ and Maharaji, my guru.

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,080
I now have replaced him with Bob. So in the morning I say,

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:38,460
I say, good morning Christ, hello Buddha, good morning Maharaji, hello Bob.

6
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:45,900
And I see how far I have to go yet. Because after all, it is merely God in drag who's saying,

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,180
I bet you won't recognize me this way, will you?

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,560
My own first mentor in this field was a japa.

9
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,800
A gentleman named Bob, who signed me the Koh-An-Mu by mail.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,800
I'm sure that must be some sort of footnote to some sand handle somewhere.

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,520
All of a sudden I thought to myself, this holy list of Dalai Lama does not tell people to go to hell,

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,720
because if he did, they would and he doesn't really want that.

13
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,200
Exactly.

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,220
So I asked Bob, I said, Bob, what is he really saying?

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,080
Bob said to me, he said, tell him to eat shit.

16
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,740
Nothing happened, huh? Nothing happened, Bob.

17
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,800
You didn't know?

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,340
That there is no self to realize, that there is no, nothing there to be liberated from.

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,340
That's all, huh?

20
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,680
This is what I am. I'm this awareness. I'm not Bob, I'm not Aja per se.

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,660
I'm the awareness of Bob and of Aja.

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,280
I have to test it, I have to critically investigate it, I have to examine Bob, the Bob-ness in there.

23
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,400
Look for Bob. And then, if I don't find the Bob, wow, eureka.

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,380
Eureka, wait a minute. I was wrong.

25
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,640
Then, but I might still feel like that, but now I begin to realize that my feeling is an illusion.

26
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,320
My feeling is a mistake. So I sort of, I'm self-correcting.

27
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,660
I'm beginning to define my mind. It's beginning to dissolve under analysis, even as it's looking.

28
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,200
I begin to take the mind as the path.

29
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,320
The mind now is looking critically at the false sense of the mind.

30
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,140
And it's not finding it, so it's beginning to melt.

31
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,520
Hello, Bob.

32
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,840
Ah, yes, dear friends.

33
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:52,420
That new intro was not by the great Fernand and Andy Leamer, but by a new contributor,

34
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,240
Dr. Fr-

35
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,100
Phileas O. Fooey.

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,580
Or perhaps it's pronounced Phileas O. Fooey.

37
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,020
Fooey with an F.

38
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,800
A new contributor.

39
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:11,140
In fact, we have three new contributors in this particular episode of the Hour of Slack.

40
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,820
In fact, let me tell you what he says about that intro.

41
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:23,720
He says, it's been ten years since I joined the church, and praise Bob, thanks to the Wovid Terror,

42
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,360
I've had time to make some show.

43
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,000
It's some spiritual teachers mentioning Bob.

44
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:44,240
Dick Alpert, Ken Wilber, Krishna Das, UG Krishnamurti, Adyashanti, and Uma Thurman's dad, Robert Thurman.

45
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,080
He also sent a second track, which I'm about to play.

46
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,560
He says, this is from my ambient music.

47
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:05,520
This is from my ambient project, Transrational Science, with Navy pilot Dave Fravor, describing the Tic Tac UFO he encountered.

48
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,820
Hopefully it's worthy of the Hour of Slack.

49
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,600
I'll send a sacred bribe as soon as the world stops ending or my conspiracy check comes through.

50
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,500
Show forever.

51
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,620
And now this, thanks to Dr. Phileas O. Fooey.

52
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,980
And I'll leave it to everyone to, it's up to you to believe, Bob.

53
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,480
I'll say this, Bob's a normal guy.

54
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,600
Bob's not crazy.

55
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,940
He's not crazy at all.

56
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,240
Not at all.

57
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,220
That was the weirdest thing about talking to him.

58
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,440
But when you look at it and go, because I had asked Bob, I said, but now we go out, we have these things that are coming at will,

59
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,600
and there's nothing we can do about it.

60
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,060
We don't know what they are.

61
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:54,460
We have confirmed sighting by two aircrew, four of us, two planes, that said, look, this is not...

62
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,880
This is not an airplane.

63
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,280
This is not a weather balloon.

64
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,400
This is not a blip.

65
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,640
It has performance well beyond.

66
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,720
And then it became aware because it turned and it actually mirrored what I was doing.

67
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,080
It was coming down and it came up.

68
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,440
So it was obviously knew we were there.

69
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,740
And I don't know if it was picking up energy coming off the airplane or what.

70
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,320
I do know that I'm trying to lock it in actively.

71
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,860
It jammed a radar.

72
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,280
It's trying to get a range.

73
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,340
It can't do that.

74
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,140
So when it says 99.9, the radar cannot see this object.

75
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,440
Literally, if something can just shoot at it.

76
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,800
It can show up at will and do whatever it wants.

77
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,020
I'd probably at least pay attention.

78
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,120
What if you had the technology?

79
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,380
We still, if what Bob says is correct, we still don't understand it.

80
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,200
And how fast would it take us to understand it?

81
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,400
I mean, if it's driven by something that we don't even have on Earth, I think there's more out there.

82
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:48,200
And if I could get word out to anyone, especially the debunkers of one,

83
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,080
quit trying to debunk it because it is what it is.

84
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,780
It wasn't a system glitch.

85
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,480
I mean, this was a real incident.

86
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:53,880
It happened.

87
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,840
It was a real accident.

88
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:54,840


89
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,900
Number two is, let's open our aperture a little bit and start thinking outside of the box.

90
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,960
Technology like that would be a game changer for mankind.

91
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,580
Completely.

92
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,400
I mean, it would literally, I don't know, think opposite.

93
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,760
Developing technology like this, if you keep it to yourself, you've got something that

94
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,600
no one else has, and it's a huge leap.

95
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,180
I mean, it's a quantum bomb.

96
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,920
Do you share it?

97
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,540
Do you?

98
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,280
Because it's a mankind thing.

99
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,420
Or do you?

100
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:24,420


101
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:24,420


102
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:24,420


103
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:24,420


104
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:24,420


105
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:24,420


106
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:24,420


107
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:24,420


108
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:24,420


109
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,120
Or do you keep it for yourself?

110
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,880
Right now, it's not for me to decide.

111
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,560
I'm just staying.

112
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,060
But really impressive to talk to them at the level that you can, which is, for us, would

113
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,000
be an unclassified level.

114
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,380
But the stuff that goes on behind closed doors, there's reasons for it.

115
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,700
Because if a technology like that got out where someone could rapidly reproduce it after

116
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,640
all you've done, or they got it first, you take it to the atomic bomb.

117
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,380
Germans almost had it.

118
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,160
We got it.

119
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,080
Russians were working on it.

120
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,840
We got it first.

121
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,080
We got it.

122
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,980
We changed the world.

123
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,980
We literally changed the world.

124
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,260
We got it first.

125
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,380
From PR News in Washington, I'm partially collapsed throughout the area.

126
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,540
President Trump is endorsing Anne Frank's first book.

127
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,380
After some delay, the White House is now confirming the president is formally endorsing Anne Frank's

128
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:22,820
first book.

129
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:22,820


130
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:22,820


131
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:22,820


132
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:22,820


133
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:22,820


134
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,080
Without Trump, Anne Frank's cookbook might not have been published.

135
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:32,080
Anne Frank's cookbooks on baking children sitting on the PR News pile.

136
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,720
The president says the bill is a way to protect American workers who are willing to work for

137
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,460
less PR News.

138
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:45,160
The Dow 40-20-20-22-22-27-41-3-5.

139
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,660
The Pentagon says this is PR News.

140
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,820
They want to 매 House for Creators底 transcription and

141
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:05,820

145
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,580
Thank you.

146
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,760
We now rejoin our regularly scheduled program.

147
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,560
Thank you.

148
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,840
Thank you.

149
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,180
Thank you.

150
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,120
Thank you.

151
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,800
This time, this time of the month.

152
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,080
That doesn't sound like a great deal of fun to me, sitting in a hotel room all day going boom.

153
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,160
I'm not bumping right now.

154
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,160
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

155
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,980
Oh no, you don't get the idea.

156
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:10,660
I'm not bumping right now.

157
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,840
Goes on.

158
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,140
Does anyone want to switch seats?

159
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,340
Gather, gather, gather, gather to pray.

160
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,840
Gather, gather, gather, gather to pray.

161
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,840
Hey.

162
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:41,860


163
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,080


164
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,380
Hey.

165
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,340
There was a lot of praying.

166
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,200
There was a lot of praying.

167
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,580
A lot of, lot of, lot of praying.

168
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,000
Vuba, vuba, vuba, vuba, vuba, vuba, vuba, vuba, vuba.

169
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,780
Hey, you.

170
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,120
You alive?

171
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:18,580
Good.

172
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,220
Good.

173
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,340
I was not.

174
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:27,180
But, my life is fun.

175
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,740
Hey, according to the charter, as chief constable, I'm supposed to get a pig every month.

176
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,480
And two comely lasses of virtue true.

177
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,500
Keep the pig.

178
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,200
How many broads?

179
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:59,520
And I will have my own pigbo

180
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,360
Well.

181
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,320
My word.

182
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,160
What do you mean your work is done? You didn't do anything.

183
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,460
Didn't I?

184
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,060
You little...

185
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:40,320
Oh, yes, dear friends. This is Hour of Slack number 1778.

186
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:50,980
And that collage, titled Anatomy of a Sample, came to us from someone named Sheridan in Cleveland

187
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:59,460
who said he or she should have gotten this stuff to us long ago, and more of that will be forthcoming.

188
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,140
Dave's not here, man.

189
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:10,080
This is the third day in a row that we plan to do a show together, but he put it off because he's not feeling so good.

190
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,720
A lot of people are not feeling so good.

191
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:20,960
I'm fine, and I'll be reading from our out-of-print book, The Subgenius Cyclopathy,

192
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,160
and I'll be reading from the Wikipedia of Slack, the bibliographon.

193
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,460
But first I have a little news that will interest about three of you.

194
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:38,420
My imprisoned sister has the virus, as does pretty much everyone else in any prison in the United States of America.

195
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,620
My dog Buddy got bitten in the face by a rattlesnake.

196
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,740
But he's fine now and almost back to normal.

197
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,580
He would have died for sure.

198
00:15:50,980 --> 00:16:01,840
We've not gotten him rattlesnake vaccinations every year and taken him to the incredibly expensive all-night animal ER in the big city.

199
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,780
Those rattlesnake vaccinations are $120 a shot, but they actually work.

200
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,520
And no, there's no such thing for Humes.

201
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:20,920
He also had to have two anti-venom shots, which cost $1,000 each.

202
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,580
That would have been $5,000 each if it happened to me or you.

203
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,620
Plus he's in intensive care for three days, or he was.

204
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,520
So, ouch all around.

205
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,840
The important thing is he's still with us and begging for walks.

206
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:46,340
To keep rabbits out of my huge straw bale garden and snakes out of the yard,

207
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,960
I've spent the last three days installing chicken wire along the bottom of my house.

208
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:50,960


209
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:50,960


210
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,300
It's a great way to give some space for a few of my dogs to climb the chicken wire.

211
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:58,420
Yes, I know snakes can climb chicken wire, and the small ones can just slither right through,

212
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
but hopefully it's a deterrent.

213
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:08,540
And I also ordered another pair of snake guards, or snake gators as they're called, for our legs.

214
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,320
I would order four more pairs, but I'm pretty sure the dogs won't wear them.

215
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:20,040
Here in Glenrose, Texas, we're the only customers wearing masks in stores.

216
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,940
Here in Glen Rose, Texas, we're the only customers wearing masks in stores.

217
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:28,360
get extra funny looks because we wear masks made from the lower half of a Dobbs head t-shirt. So

218
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:35,200
you can see our eyes but our nose and mouth is that of Bob's maniacal grin. And we also caught

219
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:43,620
somebody selling bootleg Bob masks and shut them down. Now so far there hasn't been one known case

220
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:51,360
of Captain Trump's in our little county but I predict many in three or four months seeing as

221
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,840
how the pew packers are back to packing pews and going to honky-tonks. A surprising number of them

222
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:05,240
seem to believe that people are dying all over the entire globe just to make Trump look bad.

223
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:13,440
And yes I am tired of winning. Winning the contest of country with the most deaths

224
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,600
and the most deaths and the most deaths and the most deaths and the most deaths and the most

225
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:13,600


226
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:22,500
deaths and worst response. Now being a semi-hermit weirdo artist with a mail order business living in

227
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:28,060
the woods and married to somebody with a pension my lifestyle hasn't been affected that much aside

228
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:33,540
from constantly worrying about my sister and a few thousand other subgeniuses who don't have it so

229
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:43,140
good. Dr. Philo Drummond also lives in the woods and is self-sustaining and we both literally owe

230
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,540
our

231
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:51,820
current safety to that man Bob. Praise Bob. Okay now I'm going to read from the third testament

232
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:57,520
the Bobliagraphon which was published in 2006 and promptly forgotten when the publisher went

233
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:04,000
out of business for other reasons. You can still get copies on eBay for about a hundred bucks.

234
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:13,280
I believe I read the first half of the chapter on the conspiracy called subgenius versus them

235
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:20,820
a few hundred shows ago. So this is the second half of that chapter. Most of it's written by me

236
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:31,720
Nenslow and Onan Canobite interwoven and spliced by me. Let me preface this by saying that I don't

237
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:41,700
consider the current day Republicans and Democrats to be two sides of the same coin. The Democrats are

238
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,260
currently not deliberating. They're not deliberating. They're not deliberating. They're not deliberating.

239
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,700
They're not deliberating. They're not deliberating. They're not deliberating. They're not deliberating.

240
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,180
pouring poison into their own well just in order to make Republican snowflakes upset.

241
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:58,540
The Democrats, even the idiotic extremist ones that are embarrassments to me,

242
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:06,420
are mostly saying let's not pour any more poison into any of the wells. But that attitude seems

243
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:12,180
to be really infuriating to some Republicans who react with you can't tell me what to do.

244
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:25,000
So okay, pour away. I have my own well and it doesn't vote. But wait, if it doesn't vote, that means it voted for whoever wins.

245
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:42,400
Huh. Dang. Incidentally, I got a letter from a listener saying he wasn't going to listen to our slack anymore because it had become, quote, quote, the show is becoming unlistenable, unfortunately.

246
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:42,940
Unfortunately.

247
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:50,500
I don't want to hear a senile cat lady repeating her ice cold political opinions week after week.

248
00:20:51,540 --> 00:21:02,060
I get it. You're fixated on mundane politics. The Trump obsession is just so boring. When I hear people talking about him, I just turn it off.

249
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:11,520
I'm not going to devote my brain to thinking about a politician each and every waking minute. I'm kind of thinking maybe he already is.

250
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:35,800
I thought you were better than that man. It's sad to hear you align yourself with a dumb American political party. It's sad because your show has given me a lot of joy over the years. I'm not feeling that anymore. Maybe you aren't either. Anyway, I hope you get over it and get back to being interesting and fun. Maybe that's impossible. I don't know.

251
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,720
I responded,

252
00:21:38,720 --> 00:22:08,560
I guess you're lucky you didn't have to pay for it all those decades. I totally understand and believe me, I'm way more tired of doing the damn show than you are of listening to it. I have literal tons, well, literal pounds of killer old subgenius written and illustrated stuff from the 1990s by many people that came along after publishing got too expensive and before the internet was usable.

253
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:08,700
I don't know.

254
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:34,460
I don't know.

255
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,100
I don't know.

256
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:19,860
I'm a junior scientist living and hiking in ancient woods and creeks full of other fossils like myself and studying everything everywhere so I'll know a lot before I croak and my whole brain is totally erased.

257
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,680
Sounds like you're the one who's worked up about a dumb American political party.

258
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:25,980
MAGA!

259
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,280
So, there you go.

260
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,780
By the way, my sniffling is not due to...

261
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,680
Covfef 19, but allergies.

262
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,720
We really do live in the woods and it's serious allergy time.

263
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,020
Okay.

264
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,340
All right here.

265
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,840
I'll get to some ranting here.

266
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,460
Somewhere here.

267
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,960
Here, I'll just start in the middle.

268
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,920
The Soviet Union broke up?

269
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,480
Good!

270
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:03,280
Then by gobs, it's time for the USA to break up into the disunited states and then break up a lot more.

271
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,460
Household sovereignty is what we're talking about.

272
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:14,540
If you study chimpanzees or kindergarten children for a week, politics will suddenly make sense.

273
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,120
You mustn't let petty primate politics bring you down to their level.

274
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,240
Rise above it.

275
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,480
Inflate.

276
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:31,600
Blow yourself up and float placidly high above the middle of the road.

277
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:37,580
From whence you can survey how silly they all look.

278
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,960
Here's Nenslow on politics.

279
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,380
This is just Nenslow.

280
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:54,100
Good citizen Nenslow decided he'd spite the juvenile moron anarchists, i.e. drunks on welfare, next door.

281
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,180
And do his dash blinking civic duty and register to vote.

282
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,140
Ha ha ha.

283
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,580
Boy, it is a good thing.

284
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,940
Is that, quote, unmasked the alienation behind society's lies, unquote.

285
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,220
I guess we should have smashed the state when we had a chance, huh?

286
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:16,300
Except we've never been able to conquer the urge to guffaw.

287
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:24,960
When we run into someone so naive they have to demonstrate that their behavior is justifiable by using some sort of political ideology.

288
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,480
Politics is the stupidest thing there is.

289
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:39,420
It was invented by boring nitwits to make each other think they have some sort of control over their lives and circumstances.

290
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,920
An utterly idiotic idea that only a total boob would ever possibly swallow.

291
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:57,260
And anarchism is absolutely the dopiest, drippiest, lamest type of politics, in defense of which statement we need only remind you that it was invented by the French.

292
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,460
No anarchist will ever get the grudging,

293
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:07,000
respect of Nenslow without first acknowledging us as king.

294
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,580
So just shut up, all of you.

295
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,400
Nenslow, 1994.

296
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,400
Uh, King Nenslow.

297
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,420
King of all the anarchists.

298
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,020
The system is a self-perpetuating idiocracy.

299
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,780
Well, I think this was written before that movie came out.

300
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:44,340
The system is a self-perpetuating idiocracy that utilizes the foolproof, time-worn, good cop, bad cop technique to convince you that one side of the conspiracy is your buddy.

301
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,240
The big con gives you your own little con enemy to hate.

302
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,180
And your own little con friend to join.

303
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,000
It's set up so that we would appear to have only the two basic options.

304
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,540
Both of them slackless.

305
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:05,700
And neither of them there for any real reason but to control us.

306
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:12,960
In theory, the U.S. alone should offer almost 300 million political options.

307
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:21,700
But needless to say, they eliminated all of those in order to hide the only possible correct option, the word of Bob.

308
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,340
The terms liberal and conservative are both practically meaningless.

309
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:36,160
Like Bible passages, they can mean so many different things that they cancel themselves out in internal contradictions.

310
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,740
Each side uses the other, however, as an excuse to remove different kinds of slack.

311
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,780
One robs this kind of slack.

312
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,120
The other robs that kind of slack.

313
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,440
Whichever steals the most from you forces you to side with the one that steals less.

314
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,020
And then they have you exactly where they want you!

315
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,320
On one of these!

316
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,780
On their sides!

317
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,680
Believing one half of the conspiracy.

318
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:11,060
But we want Big Brother out of both the boardroom and the bedroom.

319
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,920
Here's some more nenzletic political theory.

320
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:26,460
If you want to see even the most intelligent and clear thinking of your acquaintances suddenly gloss over and begin repeating

321
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:32,160
whatever double or triple reverse conspiracy programming with which they've been infected,

322
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,800
just state the simple facts.

323
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,260
The conspiracy blinds its dupe with a cloud of dreams,

324
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,000
makes them think that something other than the profits of multinational corporations

325
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,700
even matters in how the world wobbles along.

326
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:54,420
I blame the fraudulent concept of, quote, rights, unquote.

327
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,440
Onan once sadly quoted to me,

328
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,940
the wisest thing his progenitor ever said.

329
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,180
There's no such thing as rights.

330
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:15,600
There are only privileges temporarily allowed because the conspiracy cannot at present turn them to profit.

331
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,680
Invisibility is your best defense.

332
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,280
There are three basic levels of conspiracy.

333
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,860
I'm going to read those three.

334
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,800
Number one, everything's going pretty well so don't make waves.

335
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,200
This keeps the vast normal majority quiet.

336
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,820
Number two, everything's totally screwed so burn it all down.

337
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,760
This gets dumbasses to make spectacles of themselves

338
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,660
so the riot police know who to get and club and arrest.

339
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,360
Who to gas and club and arrest.

340
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:58,140
Number three, lots of things are pretty screwed up,

341
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,360
but if we work real hard, we can change the system.

342
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:08,300
This keeps potentially dangerous people busy performing pointless tasks

343
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,260
like volunteer work for third party candidates.

344
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,300
And as Nenslow said in 2004,

345
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,580
all you need to know is that the people who decide how things get run

346
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,340
put different puppets on the line.

347
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,700
And that's why we're going to have to get them on stage every once in a while

348
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:30,040
and let the drones have lots of fun thinking they're the ones who decide which puppet it is

349
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,820
and that it'll make a big difference.

350
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,940
There's an illustration here of a snake with a pipe saying,

351
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,160
I can't tread on you.

352
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,540
And another picture, these are both by Lee Murr.

353
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,100
I am proud to be following orders to protect the hive.

354
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:58,100
My weapons of mass destruction can beat up your weapons of mass destruction.

355
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,620
Divide and conquer works.

356
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,920
We should know.

357
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,680
The countless smaller conspiracies, each with their own target captive audiences,

358
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:13,540
stay so busy fighting among themselves that the good old boys at the top,

359
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,540
with their pals in organized crime, have nothing to fear.

360
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,460
The minorities and weirdos compete against each other

361
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,880
while the man laughs.

362
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,080
And the burning man burns.

363
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,000
But all the while, Bob fropps and laughs,

364
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,840
trout fishing from his rowboat of tranquility in a placid lake.

365
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:39,480
While back on Wall Street, his assets' values skyrocket,

366
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:44,780
powered by nothing more than his sheer unthinking slack power.

367
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,380
You can choose to fight some specific branch of the conspiracy tooth and nail,

368
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,080
or you can choose to fight the conspiracy tooth and nail, or you can choose to fight the conspiracy tooth and nail,

369
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,400
or you can choose to avoid the entire thing by becoming a conspiracy of one.

370
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,220
As Bob said,

371
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,520
it's your conspiracy.

372
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,100
You can make it as big as you want.

373
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,020
Always remember, friends, according to Dobbs,

374
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,800
any politician who does not have a subgenius membership card in its pocket

375
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,480
is absolutely not to be trusted.

376
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,620
Any politician who has a membership card in its pocket

377
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,560
is absolutely not to be trusted.

378
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,820
And here's a picture of a real button that actually exists.

379
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,980
Don't blame me, I voted for Bob.

380
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,740
Perhaps the republic goons and the democratins

381
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,920
are already engaged in total self-destruction even as we speak.

382
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,840
Wouldn't that be nice?

383
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:50,480
Even so, they'd only be replaced by two more equally treacherous bear traps for suckers.

384
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,580
The refertarian party, maybe, versus the liberform party.

385
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,900
Certainly not patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism.

386
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,780
Anything but that, then there'd be no conspiracy at all.

387
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,460
And if it weren't for the conspiracy,

388
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,260
we would be the normals.

389
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,040
We patriopsychotic anarcho-materialists,

390
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,360
the evangelical free-fropping sex branch,

391
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,140
believe in

392
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,720
DIVERGITY.

393
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,180
Whoever kills the other guy first wins.

394
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,500
Every yard a kingdom.

395
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,960
Just as diversity is essential to a biosphere,

396
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,320
or a porno mag,

397
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,740
there must always be liberal and conservative numbskulls

398
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,260
to balance each other out.

399
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:43,580
As long as the great pendulum of history keeps on swinging

400
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,880
and isn't stuck on one side,

401
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,640
that's a good sign.

402
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,700
The scurrying earth fools seem to require these distractions

403
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:57,300
as they scamper about performing their silly little mammalian puppet acts.

404
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:03,360
But we must learn to rise above the false little conspiracies,

405
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,520
dangled like easy answers before our blinder tubes,

406
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,520
oh, our droogies.

407
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,700
There is only one true conspiracy.

408
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,720
The conspiracy of normals.

409
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,440
As Bob Dobbs said to Onan Canobite in 1980,

410
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,040
How many conspiracies does it take to totally oppress

411
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,160
all subgeniuses everywhere for all of history?

412
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,380
One.

413
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,220
Mutants must agree to disagree.

414
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:44,760
Mutant A can look the other way when El Presidente

415
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,140
conducts secret wars,

416
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,420
loots savings and loans,

417
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,400
makes deals with terrorists, etc.

418
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,440
And Mutant B can look the other way

419
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,860
when El Presidente sneaks out with his illicit girlfriend.

420
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,220
But what in the name of God did all those brave soldiers

421
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,220
die for in all those wars?

422
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,000
For the freedom of little old ladies and frustrated eunuchs

423
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,940
to castrate everyone who happens to somehow possess normal sexuality?

424
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,120
The freedom for crazy fundamentalists to decide what happens to them?

425
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:25,340
The freedom for the American drug dealers to

426
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,040
to addict children to the most insidious drugs

427
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,460
while destroying the lives of adults who use medications

428
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,520
that happen not to be patentable?

429
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:42,620
Did all of those brave soldiers die just so that a secret royal gang

430
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:46,120
of fat, bald, white guys could make a living?

431
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,400
And make yet more money?

432
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,420
Well, like those white crosses at Arlington Cemetery

433
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,220
spell out when viewed from an airplane,

434
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,740
there's plenty more where these came from.

435
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,820
And as Uncle Sam says as he points at you from that poster,

436
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,220
I want your money.

437
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:24,240
And the music in the background was from Kenneth Anger's movie,

438
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,920
Lucifer Rising.

439
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,120
Very, very weird underground movie.

440
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,920
Music by Bobby Boussoulet, who's one of the Manson killers.

441
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,500
This was recorded in a prison.

442
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:45,520
And Ken Anger specifically told me in person after I asked,

443
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,100
I said, I'm going to go to prison.

444
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,100


445
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,980
He told my grandmother, I'm going to arrest theز

446
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:46,980


447
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:46,980


448
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:46,980


449
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:46,980


450
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:46,980


451
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,720
not to use this music with anything because it's

452
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,680
sacred music that goes just with Lucifer Rising

453
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,180
but,

454
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,460
as Bob asked,

455
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,580
I asked, is anything sacred?

456
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,220
And now this.

457
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,220
Oh, hi.

458
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:13,400
Hi.

459
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,080
What are you doing here?

460
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,220
This mess is my mind.

461
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,700
You make it difficult

462
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,540
not to be unkind.

463
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,800
You're talking in circles

464
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,740
who don't understand.

465
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,260
And why is this object

466
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,100
you place

467
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,060
in my hand?

468
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,220
So you can levitate

469
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,120
since when can you do that?

470
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,920
I wish you'd stop it now

471
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,560
or you'd frighten me again.

472
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,260
There's shooting laser beams

473
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,680
and teleporting too.

474
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,040
You can do anything.

475
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,780
I'm very nice to you.

476
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,960
You're talking in circles

477
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,220
who don't understand.

478
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,200
And why is this thing

479
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,240
that you place in my hand?

480
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,260
While you were my lover

481
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,180
I knew what to expect.

482
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,620
You ate up all my baby bells

483
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,960
and never washed it.

484
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,020
You're a little bit too much.

485
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,020


486
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,020


487
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,020


488
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,020


489
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,020


490
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,860
But your heart is Roman.

491
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,460
Go and have a good time

492
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:16,460


493
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,360
even if you're the best on the world right now.

494
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:27,120
Are you going to be alright?

495
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,300
My band has gotten better.

496
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,060
Now it will get better

497
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,360
if you are at least a little stronger.

498
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,500
Where can I use thatcolored hairbrush

499
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,160
when I wear 안기?

500
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,000


501
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:48,560
I liked you better when you were a memory instead

502
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:57,760
You're talking in circles I don't understand

503
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:06,180
And what is this trust that you've placed in my head?

504
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:13,720
You're laughing at my voice, our lives unclear

505
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:22,220
I thought that we had an arrangement, my dear

506
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:31,520
Well, that's yet another new contributor, David Morrison,

507
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,840
with that song, What Are You Doing Here?,

508
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,160
which was made...

509
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,440
mixed by the Rudy Schwartz Project.

510
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,180
How about that?

511
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,300
And now, back to 22X Day with Dr. Howe.

512
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,680
I'd also like to point out, as far as the long,

513
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,460
torturous, humiliating bus rides,

514
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,100
that's the access to medical care for maybe like 75% of Atlanta.

515
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,060
Oh, yeah, but that's true.

516
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,420
Actually, the funny thing is,

517
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,160
my sister actually knows,

518
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,160


519
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,160


520
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:06,760
she knows that.

521
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,140
She's probably one of the few people

522
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,240
who actually does understand the conditions

523
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,420
in the rest of the world

524
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,120
and does know that actually she's got it pretty good.

525
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,140
It could be a Turkish prison.

526
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,400
I was about to ask, so she's been abroad?

527
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,440
Well, no, you wouldn't go abroad.

528
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,260
She has a little bit, but she's mainly,

529
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,000
she's a well-read person.

530
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,060
She's got a scientific background.

531
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,820
With the family, right?

532
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,140
You know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

533
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,860
She knows history.

534
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,580
She's finished the Baroque cycle a second time.

535
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,540
I'm on my fourth reading of that.

536
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,020
Well, I was pretty impressed.

537
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,660
It was about 3,000 pages long.

538
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,780
Oh, the new Neil Stevenson book, Fall, is unbelievable.

539
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,900
I hate him so much, I had to buy that book the day it,

540
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,940
the day I read that it had come, it was coming out.

541
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,540
And I got it that day.

542
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,980
Oh, yeah, August 19, Which means it's,

543
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:14,800
It was the year of August.

544
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:15,160


545
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,700
By the way, I used to read Wow Affate and jim Adler

546
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,180
to many places back in the lata.

547
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,520
Ever since I got I contour and connectivity

548
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,600
And I mean like I shy off too I think

549
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,220
I don't know about him now.

550
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:32,380
I'm a rat guy, me and my parents both are rats again.

551
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:32,380


552
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:36,660
Yes, but if his fingers were gone, he would find a way to continue writing.

553
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,540
Promise.

554
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,620
He'd dictate it to a eunuch who would write it for him.

555
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,800
Yes, yes, yes.

556
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:50,120
Speaking of eunuchs, I need a new chimpanzee, a nutless chimpanzee at the office.

557
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,840
The one we've been using, Professor Yeti, is wearing out.

558
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,560
He's old. He's an old guy.

559
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,580
You need a new nutless chimp?

560
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:04,160
He wears a black Greek fisherman's hat.

561
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,380
A silver muzzle.

562
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,660
Yeah, yeah. He's the one that makes the membership packs.

563
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,060
You need a new one?

564
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,980
I need a new nutless chimp to do the chimp work.

565
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,080
Actually, the chimp work is my favorite part of it.

566
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,240
It's the only time I get to really just listen to stuff for fun.

567
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,440
Yeah, what's with needing a new one? I thought you liked that part.

568
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:28,760
Yeah.

569
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:35,940
Well, it was a little tricky doing the 200 memberships last week in three days.

570
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,660
The sudden swell of last-minute membership.

571
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,980
My neck is a bit stiff. I'm a little damaged.

572
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,780
We forgot a few things.

573
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,320
Like a hammer. And tarps.

574
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,880
And a tablecloth to hide our shame.

575
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,860
To hide our shame.

576
00:43:59,140 --> 00:43:59,600
Really?

577
00:43:59,600 --> 00:43:59,780
Yeah.

578
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,860
We usually do have that.

579
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:08,440
You know, I've had to get ready. I've had a pack for X-Day 24 times now.

580
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:16,220
Not just for X-Day, but usually for X-Day, then followed immediately by Starwood.

581
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,720
Right. Well, it didn't used to be that way.

582
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,720
But now they're married. X-Day and Starwood got married.

583
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,280
Yes. We like it that way. Sometimes.

584
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,420
Sometimes.

585
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,340
Joined ecumenically.

586
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,760
Joined at the festival.

587
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,760
X-Day is a lot easier, you guys.

588
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,900
At the wrists and ankles.

589
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,460
It's a lot easier. We don't even have to think about insurance.

590
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,020
Or chem toilets.

591
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,780
Or making a profit.

592
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,300
Those things never even enter the picture. Not anymore.

593
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,440
Or being a prophet, refiled in your own land.

594
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,260
Yes, being a prophet.

595
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:56,760
Right.

596
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,220
I told you not to give me any more pollen.

597
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,320
Oh, I forgot about the pollen. That's right.

598
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:03,860
Yeah, yeah.

599
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,120
A pollen of Jesus.

600
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,100
Yeah, that would be good.

601
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:07,740
Yeah.

602
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,100
Yeah.

603
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:09,700
Yeah.

604
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,440
Yeah.

605
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,080
Yeah.

606
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:14,960
Yeah.

607
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:17,600
Yeah.

608
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:17,620
Yeah.

609
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:18,100
Yeah.

610
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:18,800
Yeah.

611
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,160
Yeah.

612
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,160


613
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,160


614
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,160


615
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,160


616
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,160


617
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,160


618
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,160


619
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,160


620
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,160


621
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,160


622
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,160


623
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:22,540
Yeah.

624
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,980
Yeah.

625
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,020
Yeah.

626
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,420
Yeah.

627
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,700
Yeah.

628
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,400
Yeah.

629
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,120
Yeah.

630
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,000
Yeah.

631
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,920
Yeah.

632
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,860
Yeah.

633
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:51,820
Yeah.

634
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,380
Yeah.

635
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,940
Yeah.

636
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:54,180
Yeah.

637
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:54,980
Yeah.

638
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:55,280
Yeah.

639
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:55,480
Yeah.

640
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,300
Yeah.

641
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:57,400
Yeah.

642
00:45:58,900 --> 00:45:59,420
Bye.

643
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,980
Bye.

644
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,720
Bye.

645
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,600
Bye.

646
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:57,840
Bye.

647
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:03,420
That was The Psychoskeletons.

648
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,220
And now,

649
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,000
another collage

650
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,720
by Sheridan.

651
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,060
The Psychoskeletons

652
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,400
by Sheridan.

653
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,320
The Psychoskeletons

654
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,400
by Sheridan.

655
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:56,960
The Psychoskeletons

656
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,000
by Sheridan.

657
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,920
The Psychoskeletons

658
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,160
by Sheridan.

659
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,640
The Psychoskeletons

660
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:34,640


661
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:34,720
The Psychoskeletons

662
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,940
by Sheridan.

663
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,500
The Psychoskeletons

664
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,780
by Sheridan.

665
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,340
The Psychoskeletons

666
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:57,160
by Sheridan.

667
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:10,180
Thank you, Sheridan, for that collage.

668
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,220
And friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

669
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:20,760
If you need more information about the Church of the Subgenius or anything we've been playing or pretty much anything ever,

670
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:32,400
you might look at subgenius.com, which then gives you links to a million Facebook pages.

671
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:38,780
The number of Subgenius Facebook pages is too damn high.

672
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:46,100
For those of you who are imprisoned and can't get on the Internet or whatever,

673
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,580
you can write to us and request things.

674
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,740
At subgenius.com.

675
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,940
Or you can write to Post Office Box.

676
00:52:52,240 --> 00:53:04,000
We'll just make it to Subgenius at Post Office Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

677
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,900
I inherited the P.O. Box 807.

678
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,400
It used to be my dad's.

679
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:16,340
And I tried to get 808 because 808 spells Bob.

680
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,080
But I couldn't.

681
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:22,100
And I got some other Bob haddock.

682
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,380
And praised Bob.

683
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,800
Oh, here's some other subgenius news.

684
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,100
No X Day, no Starwood at Wisteria.

685
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,560
Of course X Day will happen.

686
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,620
The X's know our addresses.

687
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:45,140
And we can rupture at home or go camp out in the woods.

688
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,060
I would say, though, on July 5th,

689
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,280
at 7 a.m.,

690
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,060
don't be indoors.

691
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:55,280
If you are a subgenius minister,

692
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,120
even if it's pouring rain,

693
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:01,800
make sure there's not a roof over your head at exactly 7 o'clock.

694
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,960
The way we're lifted up may be more literal

695
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:13,160
than even some Christian fundies think of their rapture.

696
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,240
There may also be decompression

697
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,060
as you rise up into the sky.

698
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:18,060


699
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:21,420
There's a chance you'll be in the upper atmosphere and you might explode.

700
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,920
But don't worry, don't worry.

701
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,780
You're just, uh...

702
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,480
I mean, that's just like casting off an old shoe.

703
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,020
They'll have a new shoe for you when you are on the saucer.

704
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:41,440
Which, by the way, is not so much a saucer as a reality that you get to run.

705
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:47,160
So hope you don't freak out when it happens.

706
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:47,880
Heh heh.

707
00:54:48,640 --> 00:55:03,600
Yeah, it's true. Wisteria is officially closed down. That's the campground that we use for both these festivals. It's closed down for July. Probably a wise move. Things are about to get worse.

708
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:15,660
However, stay tuned because we'll be doing all kinds of broadcasts and Zooms and teleconferencing and all that kind of crap.

709
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:24,820
I went to a paleontology meeting last week with 40 people using that Zoom app and it actually worked.

710
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:29,920
Of course, they weren't subgeniuses, so they weren't all talking at once.

711
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,880
We'll see how that works.

712
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,280
As we shift gears for X day.

713
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:41,320
As it is, there are forums that you can visit.

714
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,780
There's the subgenius diaspora chat.

715
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:51,220
It's just a general chat sort of thing for texting.

716
00:55:52,160 --> 00:56:00,200
And then there's the Saturday weekly meetings every day at 4.20 Eastern Time.

717
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,500
There's a special place.

718
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:12,500
You can go on Zoom and hang out with the host, Pastor Pressure and Princess Wee and me and various other subgeniuses.

719
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:20,320
It's really a whole lot like standing in the road at X day, which is the best thing about X day.

720
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:23,500
And nobody's really talking about Bob or X day.

721
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:29,480
They might be talking about shoes or cats or, you know, you just never know.

722
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,480
But the important thing is that subgeniuses that are doing this.

723
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:32,820
They're chatting.

724
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,040
And most of them are really cool.

725
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,200
Probably all of them are.

726
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,400
They just aren't all cool to each other.

727
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:47,480
You see, for every subgenius, there's always at least one that seems designed just to tick off that first subgenius.

728
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,120
It's a lot more than one of those in my case.

729
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,660
And I'm sure that goes both ways.

730
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,360
So thank you, Ken Anger.

731
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,680
And don't sue me for using that music.

732
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,400
And now this.

733
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,360
Anything you guys think of anything created.

734
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:16,940
No.

735
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,420
No.

736
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:20,780
No.

737
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,180
No.

738
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,000
No.

739
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:24,120


740
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,880
Let's do the X's Cove.

741
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,340
Let's do the X's Cove.

742
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,460
Let's do the X's Cove.

743
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,260
Let's do the X's Cove.

744
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:53,040
Let's do the X's Cove.

745
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,040
Let's do the X's Cove.

746
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:44,640
Let's do the X's Cove.

747
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:12,480
Let's do the X's Cove.

748
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:50,640
Let's do the X's Cove.

749
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,920
Let's do the X's Cove.

750
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:46,620
Let's do the X's Cove.

751
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:10,220
Let's do the X's Cove.

752
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:43,480
Let's do the X's Cove.

753
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:09,280
Let's do the X's Cove.

754
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:40,240
Let's do the X's Cove.

755
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:07,280
Let's do the X's Cove.

756
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,240
Let's do the X's Cove.
