1
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,980
Oh

2
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,040
Oh

3
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,420
Oh

4
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,900
Oh

5
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:05,900


6
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,120
Oh

7
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,280
Oh

8
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,500
Bob

9
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,360
Love you

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,360
Love you

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,560
Love you

12
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,680
Love you

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,540
Love you

14
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,860
But let's leave things

15
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,440
Of this world behind

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,040
And walk now down the path of Bob

17
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,980
For this brief minute of slack

18
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,680
From the church of the

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:29,980
South

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,380
of genius.

21
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,300
Friend, the devil is tearing the family apart.

22
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,700
But what the devil uses to do it with is nine to five jobs.

23
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,900
Conspiracy, corporate, pink situations where mommy and daddy get up in the morning and

24
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,800
go to work and they kiss the kids goodbye.

25
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,880
It's the first time they see them during the day, kiss them goodbye, kind of a simultaneous

26
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,320
goodbye and hello.

27
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,700
Then they get home about seven o'clock, ticked off to use the polite term after a long drive

28
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,020
back out to the suburbs.

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,840
They get home, they kiss their kids hello and good night and they go to bed.

30
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,720
And the other churches dare to say the breakdown of the family is because the kids see a little

31
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,540
tittering, stupid, sexy gags on television or because of the new permissiveness where

32
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,300
men are allowed to do things with other men.

33
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,400
That's a bunch of holy hooey, I say, my friend.

34
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,500
I say, oh, why not legalize pornography and ban work?

35
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,800
Work is what takes the parents away from the kids.

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,720
Most of these kids these days grow up.

37
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,480
They don't have parents.

38
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,740
They got some kind of robot scarecrows.

39
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,340
No, friend, let there be slack.

40
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,540
This is the worst crazy sect I've ever been in.

41
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:50,460
You'll soon detect, friends, that this episode, number 1850, is a rerun of coincidentally

42
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,080
number 850 from 2002, a time when I was still ambitious.

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,160
I was desperate and robust enough to go gallivanting all over the country constantly like a crazed

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,400
cowboy preacher, doing live shows in bars and occasionally theaters.

45
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:16,060
That time is past, but that's okay because you can still learn how to spell the name

46
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,800
of Bob.

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,000
negative side effect

48
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,680
I fotto think that you went proclaiming it.

49
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,940
Ganga

50
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,900
I stress that out.

51
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,960
All I really knew was that a guy was cool.

52
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:46,960


53
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:46,960


54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:56,780
I don't wanna strange biliL

B

80
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,140
We want to be more than just a group

81
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,440
Oney, oney, oh, oh, oney

82
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,140

Oney, oney, oh, oney, oney

Big ass bop, big, big ass bop

85
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,900
Big ass bop, big ass bop

86
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,920
Big ass bop, big ass bop

87
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,900
Big ass bop, big ass bop

88
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,620
Big ass bop, big ass bop

89
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,700
Big ass bop, big ass bop

90
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,380
Big ass bop, big ass bop

91
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,700
Big ass bop, bop, big ass bop

92
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,940
Oney, oney, oh, oney, oney

93
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:21,940


94
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:21,940


95
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,200
Oh, name.

96
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, name.

97
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,900
Yes, friends, that was a total remix of B.O.B.,

98
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,280
the song by Dr. Onan's Wotan Band

99
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,020
that everyone always thought was Devo.

100
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,560
And for not bad reason, as you'll soon see

101
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,820
as we progress into this great spaz music month

102
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,800
on Hour of Slack.

103
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,400
Yes, this and the next couple of shows

104
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,000
will be mostly music, friends,

105
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,320
almost like real radio shows.

106
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,280
But wait until you hear what has been crammed

107
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,020
full length into the church of the subgenius.

108
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,640
Indeed, friends, all the cramming made this

109
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,980
particular show late.

110
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,700
And I don't apologize.

111
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,140
During the last few weeks, we,

112
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,500
that is, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stank,

113
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,760
have spouted and spewed our way through

114
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,560
the subgenius revival in Indianapolis

115
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,060
and then the week-long 5X Day Drill

116
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,520
and then the week-long pagan hippie event Starwood

117
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,660
and then the wedding at Ground Zero

118
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,740
in New York City of the sex executioner from Noir

119
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,480
and his lovely bride, Andrea.

120
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,520
And then, then, friends, the devotional

121
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,700
or Devo convention in Cleveland last Saturday

122
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,740
and last Sunday, another defival,

123
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,820
by some accounts the greatest yet,

124
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,520
in Akron, Ohio, crucible of mutation.

125
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,520
And at each of these subgenius events,

126
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,000
about a dozen people each handed me CDs

127
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,860
to play on this show.

128
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,540
And I downloaded some of my old,

129
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,860
old-timey music favorites from Blobster.

130
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,880
All manner of songs and songs, friends,

131
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,720
that I couldn't afford when they were LPs,

132
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,120
but now I can in their illegal MP3 bootleg form.

133
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,120
And so, tonight and coming up,

134
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,020
we have new and old from Occupant.

135
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,020
Little Theodore, the Great Groovy Neptune,

136
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,340
Johnny Cash, Mark Mothersbaugh, Captain Beefheart,

137
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,560
Onan's Floatan Band, Sister Melodious Chops,

138
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,520
Elvin.

139
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,580
And I'm your host, Chris Costello.

140
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,820
The original cast of Guys and Dolls

141
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,320
and this great new band that played at the Akron defival

142
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,820
heard in the background called the Amino Acids.

143
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,380
And perhaps most startling and X-rated of all, friends,

144
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,240
a new album, actually a two-disc set from Reagan's Polyp.

145
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,760
Yes, Reagan's Polyp's new album or set, Love Overdrive.

146
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,960
It's kind of a best of.

147
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,000
And before I play this Reagan's Polyp song,

148
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,320
I should mention that this is a real album available on Amazon.com

149
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:33,180
with slick packaging, including liner notes by none other than me

150
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,580
and the famous folk singer, Bob Dylan.

151
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,400
Very strange, friends, but so is Reagan's Polyp.

152
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:47,000
This song is called Develop Revolutionary Consciousness.

153
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,200
verbally retarded.

154
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,380
We

155
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:06,380


156
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:06,380


157
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:06,480
I can let you drive.

158
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:06,480


159
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:06,480


160
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:06,480


161
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:06,480

168
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,260
I am starved for the touch of this snake

169
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:33,720
I will die if I don't have a taste of the poison arrow

170
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:44,440
Surely with the force of my years of education

171
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,720
I can fend off the needs of the flesh

172
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,380
With the blood of the yak on my lips I scream out

173
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,420
And I know that the face of my world

174
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:14,420


175
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,180
Enthralled is a metal mask like the acid line

176
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:27,040
Face of Lana, turn of airing down like a horrible machine

177
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,180
Rushing my fragile skull

178
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,260

Schò!

181

This water is an infirmary

182
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:57,460
Turn off the light

183
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:57,460


184
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:57,460

Thank you.

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:44,680
Thank you.

189
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:14,900
Thank you.

190
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,380
Thank you.

191
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,780
Thank you.

192
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,220
Thank you.

193
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,300
Thank you.

194
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:45,800
Thank you.

195
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,000
Thank you.

196
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,140
Thank you.

197
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,300
Thank you.

198
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,480
Thank you.

199
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,380
Thank you.

200
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,660
Thank you.

201
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,080
Thank you.

202
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,620
universe divide

203
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,000
And when I reach the other

204
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,560
side

205
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,100
I'll find a place

206
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,100
to rest my spirit if I

207
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,400
can

208
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,820
Perhaps I may

209
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,140
become a highwayman again

210
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,780
Or I may simply

211
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,220
be a single drop of rain

212
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,520
But I will remain

213
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,280
And I'll be back again

214
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,420
And again

215
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,700
And again

216
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,960
And again

217
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,100
And again

218
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,160
And again

219
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,940
And again

220
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,180
And again

221
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,100
And again

222
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,060
And again

223
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,000
And again

224
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:34,380
You can't count on God for Jack!

225
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,240
He pretty much told me so himself!

226
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,420
They call you Lady Luck

227
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,500
Lady Luck

228
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,600
But there is room for doubt

229
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,240
At times you have

230
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,260
a very unladylike way

231
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,900
of running out

232
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,760
You're on a date

233
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,260
with me

234
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,460
The pickings have been lush

235
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,240
And yet

236
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,440
before this evening is over

237
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,000
you might give me the brush

238
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,500
You might forget

239
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,220
your manners

240
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,560
You might refuse to stay

241
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,580
And so the best that I

242
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,500
can do is to stay

243
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,360
And so the best that I can do is pray

244
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,900
Luck be a lady tonight

245
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,080
Luck be a lady tonight

246
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,720
Luck if you've ever been a lady to begin with

247
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,740
Luck be a lady tonight

248
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,760
Luck let a gentleman see

249
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,120
How nice a dame you can be

250
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,520
I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with

251
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,620
Luck be a lady with me

252
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,820
A lady doesn't leave her escort

253
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,360
It isn't fair

254
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,100
It isn't nice

255
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,120
A lady doesn't wander all over the room

256
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,620
And blow on some other guy's dice

257
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,640
So let's keep the party polite

258
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,120
Never get out of my sight

259
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,660
Stick with me baby

260
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,520

Luck let a gentleman see

275
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,280
How nice a dame you can be

276
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,500
I know the way you treat it

277
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,720
All the guys you've been with

278
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,000
Luck be a lady with me

279
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,060
A lady wouldn't flirt with strangers

280
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,320
She'd have a heart, she'd have a soul

281
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,460
A lady wouldn't make little snake eyes at me

282
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,120
When I've spent my life on this road

283
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,000
So let's keep the party polite

284
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,620
Never get out of my sight

285
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,160
Stick with me, baby, I'm the fella you came in with

286

Luck be a lady

289
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,660

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,020
I don't know what it is

300
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,900
Ends with a B

301
00:23:59,460 --> 00:23:59,460


302
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:00,940
Timeינ

303
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,800
Ten seconds, Bob

304
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,860

Occupant is really Onan Canobite, the great subgenius, and his friend Mitch.

321
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:37,080
And this song coming up is an old, it's actually a song by Devo, which you won't recognize unless you're a real spaz like me.

Occupant.

323
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,300
Occupant.

324
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,480
At the moorown, down in Youngstown, bodies in the street.

325
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:23,960
Occupant.

326
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,580
Occupant.

327
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:25,580


328
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:25,580


329
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:25,580


330
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,620
At the Moor Down, noon in downtown, bodies with no feet

331
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:35,520
At the Moor Down, down in Youngstown, bodies got the blues

At the Moor Down, noon in downtown, bodies with no shoes

A napkin head wound in a fifty-five dodge, didn't mean to do it

334
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,720
But a sidewalk run in the loom, they summoned in the one, he had to lose it

At the Moor Down, down in Kentown, got the Acubeat

At the Moor Down, the Robotech sound, got to move your feet

337
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,740
It's a retro sound, you can spread around, the way the Spark Boys used to do it

338
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,580
Yeah, it's time to use it

339
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,700
Sure, after all the fall, an acupunct's here to prove it

340
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:47,560
At the Moor Down, down in Youngstown, bodies in the street

At the Moor Down, noon in downtown, bodies with no shoes

344
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:11,780
An acupunct's here to prove it, a napkin head wound in a fifty-five dodge, didn't mean to do it

345
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:17,680
But a sidewalk run in the loom, they summoned in the one, he had to lose it

346
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:23,420
At the Moor Down, down in Youngstown, bodies got the blues

And now an old favorite of mine

354
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,360
By Elvis Costello

355
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Whose bass player was into Bob

356
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,660
Mother, father, I'm here in the zoo

357
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,400
I can't come home, cause I've grown up too soon

358
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,620
I got my sentence, I got my command

359
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,280
They said they'd make me major if I met off any man

360
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,400
I could be a carpenter, carpenter, but it's mere

361
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,620
I'm a general manager, I'm a large establishment

362
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:48,520
They pass them the fives on the back and put some to the ride

363
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,900
But I never thought they'd put me in the good squad

364
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,280
They come to look you over and they're giving you the eye

365
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,000
Good squad

366
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,960
The white suits are called out to play, you better say goodbye

367
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,160
Some grew up just like the dads and some grew up too far

368
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,800
Some go drinking with the lads, some don't grow up at all

369
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,180
You must find the proper place for everything you see

370
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,860
But you'll never get to make a lampshade out of me

371
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,720
I could join a chain of males or be the best of the league

372
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,260
But looking far I like your girl to put me in the peak

373
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,800
They pass them the fives on the back and put some to the ride

374
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,240
But I never thought they'd put me in the good squad

375
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,580
They come to look you over and they're giving you the eye

376
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,140
Good squad

377
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,300
The white suits are called out to play, you better say goodbye

378
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:15,360
I was gonna say goodbye

379
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,480
Goodbye

380
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,300
theseak

381
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,460
But I remember millones

382
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:33,700
Good to see you

383
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,720
humanities

384
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,720
queer

385
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,720
spiritual

386
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,820
I never thought they'd put me in the good squad.

387
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,080
They're going to take it over and they're giving you the eye.

388
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,480
Good squad.

389
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,420
No answer to come out to play.

390
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,680
You better say goodbye.

391
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,420
You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless.

392
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:27,100
You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

393
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,260
Time religion, don't give me no affliction.

394
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,340
That old time religion, it's good enough for me.

395
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,880
Ah, it's good enough for you.

396
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,160
Well, come out to show them.

397
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,980
Come out to show them.

398
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,560
Come out to show them.

399
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,700
Come out to show them.

400
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,900
Come out to show them.

401
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,100
Come out.

402
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,460
Come out to show them.

403
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,080
Come out to show them.

404
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,080
Give me that old time religion.

405
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,080
Give me that old time religion.

406
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,580
Give me that old time religion.

407
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,160
It's good enough for me.

408
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,540
Without your new affliction, don't need your new restriction.

409
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,100
Give me that old time religion.

410
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,860
It's good enough for me.

411
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,680
Moonlight on the mind

412
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,780
Nobody wants to play with me

413
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,340
Just because I'm never happy

414
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,820
All the other kids are going up and down slides

415
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,300
While I sit here and philosophize

416
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,040
I've got a world of my own

417
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,880
I see things as they are

418
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:23,860
Nobody can tell me what to do

419
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,860
Not even you

420
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,680
Nobody wants to play with me

421
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,460
Just because I am not friendly

422
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,840
All the other kids are playing funny games

423
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,800
While I sit by myself and examine my brain

424
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,800
I've got a world of my own

425
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,380
I see things that you don't

426
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,620
Nobody can tell me

427
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,320
What to do

428
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,080
What is good

429
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,820
Though you wish you could

430
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,520
Nobody wants to play with me

431
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,340
Just because I am not sexy

432
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,420
All the other kids are fooling around

433
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,680
While I'm several miles above the ground

434
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,540
I've got a world of my own

435
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:33,400
I see what is not there

436
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,540
Nobody can tell me how to feel

437
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,240
And all that's real

438
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,200
Nobody wants to play with me

439
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,600
Just because I have no family

440
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,400
All the other kids have wives and jobs

441
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,520
While I live in a house of my own

442
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,340
I play in the garden and think and stop

443
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,500
I've got a world of my own

444
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,200
I see sadness and dirt

445
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,620
Nobody can tell me what is right

446
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,060
Try to fight

447
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,000
Nobody wants to play with me

448
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,480
Just because I am not sexy

449
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:29,480


450
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:29,480


451
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:29,480


452
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:29,480


453
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:29,480


454
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:29,480


455
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:29,500
Just because I am not sexy

456
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,920
Just because I am old and ornery

457
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,360
All the other kids have grandchildren

458
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,180
They chatter and they squabble

459
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,980
But I ignore them

460
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,960
I've got a world of my own

461
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,560
I see all that I am

462
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,500
Nobody can tell me why I live

463
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,480
You have nothing to give me

464
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:08,880
This world is specialize on me

465
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,720
Little Theodore!

466
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,900
The Great Little Theodore!

467
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,420
And friends there is new old Little Theodore available

468
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,840

469
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,300
Actually an old album we have done on CD

470
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,580
Called Beneath the Uber Putts

471
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:32,200
by little Theodore at yahoo.com.

472
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,240
I should spell Theodore, spelled F as in Frank.

473
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,360
Y-O-D-O-R.

474
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,980

479
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,480
For little Theodore at yahoo.com.

480
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:10,100
And now, friends, well, you're hearing in the background the Amino Acids who played at our Akron Revival.

481
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,040
You can hear more of them at theaminoacids.com.

482
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,660
That's www.theaminoacids.com.

483
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,800
And now, friends, a song with...

484
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,480
For some reason, deep personal meaning to me.

485
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,500
I'm not sure why.

486
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,040
The King, Elvis.

487
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,520
Oh, I used to be disgusted

488
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,100
And now I try to be amused

489
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,220
But since the wizard got roughed

490
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,180
I'm not sure why

491
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,180


492
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,620
You know the angels wanna wear my red shoes

493
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,400
But when they told me about the side of the parking

494
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,480
That's when I knew that I could not refuse

495
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,620
And I won't get any older

496
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,500
Now the angels wanna wear my red shoes

497
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,360
Oh, I was watching while you're dancing away

498
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,980
I look at Rex, you're in the echo and sway

499
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,240
How come everybody wants to be your friend?

500
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,040
You know that it still hurts me just to say it

501
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,940
Oh, I know that she's disgusted

502
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,260
Oh, why's that?

503
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,240
Cause she's feeling so abused

504
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,000
Oh, that's too bad

505
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,860
She gets tired of the lust

506
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,460
Oh, I'm so sad

507
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,220
But it's so hard to refuse

508
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,980
Can you say that I'm too old

509
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,320
When the angels have stolen my red shoes?

510
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,440
Oh, I said I'm so happy

511
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,240
I can't believe it's over now

512
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:55,240


513
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:55,840
I'm gonna die

514
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,300
She said, drop dead then left with another guy

515
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,960
That's what you get if you go chasing out the vengeance

516
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,860
Ever since you got me punctured

517
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,600
This has been my sentence

518
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
Oh, I used to be disgusted

519
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,260
When I tried to be amused

520
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,680
Since the wings had gotten rusted

521
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,700
You know the angels wanna wear my red shoes

522
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,460
But when they told me about the side of the parking

523
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,240
That's when I knew that I could not refuse

524
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,740
And I won't get any older

525
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,460
The angels wanna wear my red shoes

526
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,560
Oh

527
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,900
I won't get any older

528
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,740
The angels wanna wear my red shoes

529
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,960
Red shoes

530
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,660
The angels wanna wear my red shoes

531
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,560
Red shoes

532
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,220
The angels wanna wear my red shoes

533
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,220
Red shoes

534
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,800
The angels wanna wear my red shoes

535
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Red shoes

536
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:54,800


537
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:54,800


538
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,220
Red shoes

539
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:55,220


540
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:55,220


541
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:55,220


542
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,260
The Angels wanna wear my red shoes

543
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,380
I'm walking in a wonder wonderland

544
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:24,160
Asked for some water, all I got was sand

545
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,900
There's a nine pound hammer beating in my skull

546
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,920
Laying down tracks on the road to hell

547
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,680
I'm walking in a wonder wonderland

548
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,180
Asked for some water, all I got was sand

549
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,440
There's a nine pound hammer beating in my skull

550
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,760
Laying down tracks on the road to hell

551
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,040
There's a nine pound hammer beating in my skull

552
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,220
I wanna take you to my heaven's road

553
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:47,020
I wanna f*** with you until I'm too old

554
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,960
I wanna fuck my head and death on the road

555
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,140
I wanna f*** with you until I'm too old

556
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:54,140


557
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,160
I wanna f*** with you until I'm too old

558
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,440
I wanna f*** with you until I'm too old

559
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:31,440


560
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,080
The mathematics of the equation just don't add up

561
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,620
It's a paradoxical situation

562
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,120
And while my c*** is in elation

563
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,120
My soul is in...

564
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,120


565
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,960
My soul is in... purgatory

566
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,420
And praying to the demon god at Radio Shack

567
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,040
To give me peace and make the neighbor's dog

568
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,040
Stop telling me to murder the innocents

569
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,240
In the cracks of the sidewalks in New York City

570
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,740
The Great Groovy Neptune, dear friends!

571
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:28,520
www.neptune.itgo.com

572
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,320
A new CD from the Great Groovy Neptune called Turpentine Enema

573
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,260
Proof that there's still hope in Texas

574
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,240
And friends, stay tuned for yet another killer remix of a classic tune

575
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,180
By Dr. Onan's Wotan Band

576
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:52,480
Followed by a new, traditional Celtic song

577
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,540
About computer online affairs by sister Melodious the Chops

578
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:00,100
But now, Onan's Wotan Band!

598
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:57,700
You make out with the girls, when you're beat up to the hills, pick a ball, pick a ball.

599
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:17,780
Pick a spad, pick a bop, pick a spad, bop, pick a spad, bop, pick a spad, bop.

600
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,720
O-Nay, O-O-O-O-Nay...

601
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,280
Here it comes...

602
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,780
He's comin', bud...

603
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,180
Go come...

604
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,860
Go come and take your slack away...

605
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:48,680
It's Bob

606
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,660
When you see a flock of birds, think of Bob

607
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,920
When you just run out of words, think of Bob

608
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,720
When a ring falls round your collar

609
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,740
When you hear a given holler

610
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,820
When you write checks for one dollar, think of Bob

611
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,580
When you write to the subgenius, think of Bob

612
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,520
B-O-5-2-1-4-0-3-0-6, think of Bob

613
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,800
When you cast your mojo hexes

614
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,680
When you ride through Dallas, Texas

615
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,600
When you're all die-lexing, think of Bob

616
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:52,060
B-O-5-2-1-5-0-7-0, think of Bob

617
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:58,300
B-O-5-2-1-5-0-6, handsome

618
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:58,300


619
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:58,300


620
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,140
B-O-5-2-1

621
00:48:59,140 --> 00:48:59,420
B-O-5-2-1

622
00:48:59,420 --> 00:48:59,420


623
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,900
B-O-F

624
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,660
B-O

625
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,220
B-O-F

626
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:05,640
B-OF

627
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,380
B-OF

628
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,860
B-O-F

629
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:22,260
Take it to that big bad Bob, heaven in the sky.

630
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:23,960
One dollar.

631
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,580
That's right, just send us your one dollar.

632
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,060
One dollar.

633
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,900
You get a lot more for your money.

634
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,600
Heck, one dollar, you get Bob.

635
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,380
One dollar.

636
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,140
Bob.

637
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,260
And Bob's the best Bob.

638
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:15,980
I'm Bob.

639
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,240
No, I'm Bob.

640
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,200
No, I'm Bob.

641
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,480
No, I'm Bob.

642
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,780
No, I'm Bob.

643
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,720
No, I'm Bob.

644
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,500
No, I'm Bob.

645
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,020
No, I'm Bob.

646
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:25,500
No, I'm Bob.

647
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,280
No, I'm Bob.

648
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,360
No, I'm Bob.

649
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,400
No, I'm Bob.

650
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,580
Listen here, Malachi.

651
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,920
Time for a religious donation.

652
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,540
Hand over your wallet.

653
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,360
But Lord, we are a poor and simple folk.

654
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,220
Poor?

655
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,500
Aw, crap.

656
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,400
We're a poor and simple folk.

657
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,340
The online world makes me want to care.

658
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,380
And I will go with the lights unfurled to meet my Charlie there.

659
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:33,400
Well, some will wear their sexy things and turn the lights down low.

660
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:38,340
Some will grab a brew or two and drink them as they go.

661
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,400
But me, I'm nothing.

662
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,800
I'm the kind of girl to go for a boulder party.

663
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:50,120
But you won't, or if you will, I'm going online for Charlie.

664
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:07,900
I'm going online for Charlie.

665
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,180
Well, some will fly to Cameroon.

666
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:20,260
See you later, Frauen.

667
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,240
And if I'm old, you may not hear

668
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,180
when I'm coming online for you.

669
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,120
He sends me streams of thrilling thought

670
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,180
He opens up my gate

671
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,940
He touches me where he should not

672
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,900
And I can hardly wait

673
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,720
Some like hair that strains apart

674
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,480
Others the beat of a party

675
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,020
You ready now?

676
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,080
But I don't care, just let me start

677
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,640
Going online for Charlie

678
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:16,720
Going online for Charlie

679
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:22,020
Going online for Charlie

680
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,320
Charlie

681
00:53:44,520 --> 00:54:05,100
Going online for Charlie

682
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:32,960
Going online for Charlie

683
00:54:50,020 --> 00:55:05,080
Going online for Charlie

684
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:35,080
Going online for Charlie

685
00:55:35,100 --> 00:56:05,080
Going online for Charlie

686
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:24,960
Going online for Charlie

687
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:05,080
Going online for Charlie

688
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:34,480
Going online for Charlie

689
00:57:35,100 --> 00:58:05,060
Going online for Charlie

690
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:35,080
Going online for Charlie

691
00:58:35,100 --> 00:59:04,420
Going online for Charlie

692
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,340
Going online for Charlie
