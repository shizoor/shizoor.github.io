Little
Donnie was
in Moscow
one day
lonely little
trumpet boy
you know
what they
say
it's a
very long
since he
had a
special
surprise
he had
some
spittle
on his
chin
a little
twinkle
in his
eyes
took out
his phone
and punched
a few
numbers
woke up
Vlad his
girlfriend
she
from a very deep slumber
Said he had some rubles and a lot of spare time
If these ladies had a diaper and some nursery rhymes
Nice action out the back side, baby
Get out the rubber sheets and get a good view
Nice action out the back side, baby
Lean back and open your mouth before they spew
Now everybody knows that he's a pussy-grabbin' fascist boy
Deutschland, Deutschland, Uber, Ryan
But they ain't seen his genocide when he's playing coy
He lets out a little squeal when he's gettin' his way
His nipples perk up and his belly starts to sway
Headed to the toilet when he's done
With his hookers by his side
They're gonna bring some discipline
But Trumpy will abide
A gentle yellow spray and a cascade of dung
Donny Boy's so happy when it's rollin' off his tongue
Nice action out the back side, baby
They got a presidential treat for you
Nice action out the back side, baby
Beg and crawl like the little worm you are
Here comes your poo
Trumpet board giggles when they fetch out the whips
Trumpet board giggles when they fetch out the whips
He got stubby little fingers wipin' urine from his lips
Starts to get excited when they're reachin' for his balls
But the glove slides off because they're just too small
Nice action out the back side, baby
What's all that stuff that be squirtin' on you?
Nice action out the back side, baby
Tilt your head and open your mouth
Here comes your poo
Here comes your poo
Here comes your poo
Nice action out the back side
Trumpet board music
Thank you
The Rudy Schwartz Project
Nice action from the back side
on the new CD, Tango Lessons in a Fascist Whorehouse
which is on DC Jam Records
More from that album soon
But here, recorded live at 19X Day Drill
Saint Andrew the Impaled
Now here is the natural response
to whenever you're faced with this prospect
They say reconcile with the wife
I say fuck it
They say fix the holes in your life
I say fuck it
Might seem I'm leaving in a rush
But a man can only take so much
So I grabbed just some of my stuff
And I said fuck it
I said fuck it
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
I said fuck it
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
And if you don't agree, my friend
Don't make no difference in the end
Cause in the end, all I have to say is
Fuck it
They say get to work on time
I say fuck it
They say write a clever rhyme
I say fuck it
Cause here's one thing that I've observed
To rhyme some words don't take much nerve
And it might seem quite absurd
But I say fuck it
I said fuck it
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
I said fuck it
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
And I don't care if I lose my job
I don't care if I become a slob
My conscience has been robbed
And I say fuck it
Oh, now we're gonna fuck it in this key
They say you gotta pay your bills
I say fuck it
They say you can't be drinking swill
I say fuck it
Cause if I could afford better than swill
I'd probably be able to pay my bills
But then again, I might just say fuck it
I said fuck it
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
I said fuck it
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
And if you got a better way
Go tell me on some other day
Cause on this day all I have to say is fuck it
They say you love your enemies
I say
Fuck that
They say try to keep the peace
I say
Fuck that too hard
Cause I gotta tell you girls and boys
This angry man's gonna make some noise
And it truly is a joy to say fuck it
They say watch what you eat
I say fuck it
Put the lid down on the seat
I say fuck it
Cause I'm gonna live just how I do
I don't need no advice from you
Cause when I hear advice I say fuck it
I say fuck it
I say fuck it
Fuck it
I said fuck it
And if you think my song is crude
Or you're put off by my attitude
There's one thing you can do
And that is suck it
They say
Composing into this song
I say fuck it
The Great Andrew the Impaled
Live at X Day
And now a little mashup we've been saving for a year
By Reverend Joe Jeziorski
Me?
I'm a preacher
I'm the Lord's servant
I want to inform you that
Moses said that sodomites should be stoned
Stoned
It's right there in the book of Leviticus
Every sodomite needs to be stoned
Stoned
A century ago
Cocaine was the only thing that was stoned


Cocaine was put in Coca-Cola
Cocaine flavored up Coca-Cola
They were actually using cocaine
The sodomites
Has done the exact same thing
That Coca-Cola has done
Except they've done it with semen
Male semen
And the truth is now coming out
A sodomite named Bahamas Mama
Discovered that semen
Flavors up coffee
And it makes you think
You're having a good time
Drinking that cup of latte
With the semen in it
I'm not making this up
And it flavors up
The coffee
Soda by latte
Soda by latte
A number of people think
That drinking semen is a good idea
You know a number of people
Think that semen tastes good
You've got a little idea
There's millions of people
Around the world
Who really think that
The taste of semen is good
They've discovered
That since people like semen
And there's so many people
Drinking it from one another
Why not put it in our coffees?
Soda by latte
My question is
Where are they getting all this semen?
They're getting this semen
From a homosexual
Soda by masturbation squad
They're getting this semen
From lesbos
Faggots
And muffin dimes
Queers
Soda by latte
They're getting loads and loads
Of male semen
It flavors up our coffee
Soda by latte
Millions of people around the world
Think that semen is good
And that semen tastes good
You're looking at one
Soda by latte
I'm a preacher
I'm the most successful pimp
On planet earth

Who's your daddy?

She brought me a hamburger.
Formed into a ball.
That was just fun.
I had no ball.
She told me a hamburger has a special protocol.
Extruded through a tube.
Tasty brochettes to feed the bones.
Whole meat.
Fresh for 1 cent.

The man in the hot nilde boots wears a crotchless thong.
Eh, eh, eh, eh.
His spatula glistens and the sun betwixt adoring throngs.
A família laureado.
Then,합니다...
The crisgo hits the pan of this strange,
floppy, scrotumed man.
The dream.
He's a half-gum, he no-brims with meat
And that's for every man
Hamburger baby, baby
Hamburger baby, baby
He brought me hamburger
Enough to feed the nuns
I left the tray on the dungeon stairs
They told me hamburger
Answered all their prayers
They were such stupid fucking guys
I'm a hamburger, I'm a hamburger
I'm a hamburger, I'm a hamburger
I'm a hamburger, I'm a hamburger

I'm a hamburger, I'm a hamburger
I'm a hamburger, I'm a hamburger

I'm a hamburger, I'm a hamburger
I'm a hamburger, I'm a hamburger

I'm a hamburger, I'm a hamburger
I'm a hamburger, I'm a hamburger
I'm a hamburger, I'm a hamburger
I'm a hamburger, I'm a hamburger
I'm a hamburger, I'm a hamburger
I'm a hamburger, I'm a hamburger

This next song is a song called Have Life.
It goes a little something like this.
All right. It goes exactly like this.
Not exactly.
That was Pilgrim Speakeasy.
I've been waiting a year to play that one, too.
But this next one is brand spanking new from the Rudy Schwartz Project.
Yes!
Sweet that pack of noodles
In the nobleness
Or at the snow bar
When you want to find me
You have to dress up
In all the little bars
You read my name on all the ice
And on the windows of the bistro
A tapas de coin, that's my palace
Where I find my friends in the evening
My friend, it's me
I'm happier than a king
I'm happier than a king

I'm happier than a king
I never get soft
In all this
I push myself
In the shoulders
I cross my sweet thoughts
Why?
Why be a jerk?
My dick, my dick
It's enough to be a dick
As painful as I am
I'm really a little...
I want to make money
I'm going to kill myself
I'm 9 hours

I only have moi
Probably 30cent Street-onne-τό
Also another wage , though, once a vậy pas g Charles S壆 rime

And before that, Burn Bridges.
What a coincidence.
Now back to 19X Day Drill with St. Andrew the Impaled ending
after numerous starts and parts.
His great subgenius song Saucer Built for One.
As seen on YouTube channel Revstang.
Where was I? Eight?
Now Saucer Built for Eight.
I know that sounds just great.
But I'm starting now to recognize a trend.
I'd bettered out for nine and then I changed my mind
so fucking kids I'm skipping ahead to ten.
And my saucer built for ten.
A mobile pleasure den.
A hedonistic hoedown on its way.
To that sexy slack filled place.
A way up there in space.
We were promised we'd be ready come X Day.
Now a saucer built for ten.
You might think that's the end.
But I hate to let down my subgenius brethren.
So I put an extra door as I put some bean bags on the floor.
Now I'm proud to say my saucer seats eleven.
Oh and my saucer for eleven.
We got, uh, my saucer seats eleven.



My libido won't be ebbin'.
In fact I might become a better lay.
Cause I'll learn from the best.
And I'll practice on the rest.
As we all make each other.
Come X Day.
Now a saucer for eleven.
Oh my this place is gettin'
to be one where it's hard to hear yourself.
Over all the grunts and moans.
So I put in some headphones.
That'll be perfect for my saucer built for twelve.
Yeah my saucer built for twelve.
Uh.
Uh.
Oh dear Bob the smell.
And the furniture all has a sticky sheen.
But if that ain't quite enough.
Well I hate to say it tough.
I ain't workin' on a saucer for thirteen.
No my saucer built for twelve.
Will suit us all real well.
As we go tearin' across the Milky Way.
As we go tearin' across the Milky Way.
And no one's gettin' off.
And no one's gettin' off.
Well everyone's getting off.
And no we'll never stop.

Unless we go by that moon of Saturn.
And it's all methane.
Like it has methane weather.
Like liquid methane.
And methane like you know ice.
And there's like water ice in the mountains.
Cause I wanna drop a match on that.
I mean like I know nothing will happen.
Cause there's no auction.
But I don't know no.
Nothing will happen.
So I think it'll be kind of exciting to do.
Until we reach our new home.
Come extend.
Stay.

Stay.

That's D-R-U to you.
Thank you so much.

You can buy it.
Come talk to me.
Enter the empire!
I am an ordained minister
in the church of the subgenius.
Praise Bob.
I'm also a writer and speaker
warning the public about Bob Dobbs
and his cult of the subgenius
when I'm paid to do so.
And that is subgenius approved activity.
And I am not a subgenius.
I assure you.
You see, subgenius is the first 100%

Can I get a praise Bob? Yes. Praise Bob
from the hearts of your crotches and from the
billfolds bending nearby to touch them
with gold. Praise him
from the cutting edge of your prehensile
apocalyptic hackle spots.
I've prepared for tonight's sermon
by pouring over a few verses from the
blasphemora, partaking of the
holy sacrament of habifrop zipilops
not a drug,
ardently reconfirming my queer bisexual
orientation, and now I'm ready
to preach against preaching.
And if any of you start
hoping that means I blow my brains out
for the big finale, I apologize
in advance for disappointing you.
Thank you.
I am Watt the fuck and I preach the holy
trinity of father reason,
his loving son tolerance,
and the blessed holy spirit
of how you worship is none of my goddamn
business. That is a trinity that
can save the fucking world.
Slack out.

So give me slack, oh give me
Give me slack, oh give me
Give me slack, oh give me
Yeah, give me slack
Yeah, give me slack
Fuckin', fuckin' lady, can't you get your control
Over your own eyes
Fuckin', fuckin', save the safety of your own conscience
Over your own eyes
Fuckin', fuckin', save the safety of your own conscience
Over your own eyes
Relax in the safety of your own conscience
Give me slack
Give me slack, or kill me
Yeah give me slack, or kill me
Yeah give me slack, or kill me
