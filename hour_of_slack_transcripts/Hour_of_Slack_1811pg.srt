1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040
An ideology that regards itself as non-ideological, that presents itself as the natural center, the very fulcrum of civilized modern life.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,280
The self-genius power of the self.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,040
This may well be the most powerful and most dangerous ideology we have ever known.

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:30,480
I'm not denying the virtues, far from it. We're all beneficiaries of the cult of the elite.

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,780
But if we deny its dangers and the all-consuming power of its propaganda, then we...

6
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,720
I bet nobody ever said that to you.

7
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,700
Oh, by the way, Bob, thanks for the aspirin.

8
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:52,020
Hiya, friends. Bob Dogg here, sooner and soper operator of Bob Dogg Dog and Dogg Hot Dog.

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,700
Bob Dogg's son and foot tires, and that means shoes and mean shoes, means industry.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,120
Yes, there's rain on the streets again, and where there's rain, there's rain-washed streets.

11
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,740
I ought to know I'm Bob Dogg, high chick, and it's my privilege to put shoes on your best friend just like he was my own son's car.

12
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,720
Here's a pair that'll make the road blush. Wide, they're wider than the car.

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,560
And safety wrap before their box is stored forever, and that's a long, long time.

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,360
One second can make the difference, friends.

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,280
But don't believe me unless you don't care how much it costs.

16
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,740
And I like that kind of man.

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,120
And if you are, you're the kind of man I like.

18
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,740
And I'm going to keep it that way, even if I have to offer you a deal that had to be turned down to be offered to you.

19
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,600
And remember this tomorrow when you're awake.

20
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,620
You don't have to come to Bob Dogg.

21
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,900
You can drive around on lemons, for all I care.

22
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,440
Like they say, if you live in the water, you don't need a boat.

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,960
But if you do, give me the first chance at its feats, and you'll drive away a happy toe.

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,920
Thanks for looking at me. I'm Bob Dogg, and I'll be back.

25
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,640
Well, sir, ma'am, thing.

26
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,880
This is a pretty...

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,440
Word-heavy episode.

28
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:00,160
With new, very old, rare material from the Firesign Theater.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,000
As heard just now.

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,780
There's also some old-timey ESO swamp radio from the year 2001.

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,320
That I guarantee is very directly Firesign-inspired.

32
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,880
As are most of the subgenius shows.

33
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:27,280
And we continue with samples from the soundtrack of Sandy K. Boone's movie,

34
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,900
J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

35
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,880
as currently seen on many streaming services.

36
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,440
See dobbstown.org for all current info.

37
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,040
Indeed, we play that soundtrack now.

38
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,020
Everyone staying?

39
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,640
Another gun.

40
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,560
We said, you've got a religion.

41
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,600
Now you've got to have the tent revivals.

42
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,940
You know, you can't just say you have a religion.

43
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,960
You have to have this gathering of the faithful.

44
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,280
It was a sad day for mankind.

45
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,660
It was a sad day for mankind.

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,220
When man stopped.

47
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,040
Started sticking with his head and walking on his feet.

48
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,020
So, kind of, boy, let it back up.

49
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,840
Oh, yes, baby.

50
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,560
I could feel an emanation.

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,820
I could feel an eye just burning into my eye.

52
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,320
I could feel a man staring at me and grinning at me and stretching his eyebrows.

53
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,140
Yes!

54
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,040
I could feel that man saying he wants to testify, Bob!

55
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,620
A divival is a subgenius revival.

56
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,980
It didn't sound good to say revival, you know.

58
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,880
Divival sounds a lot better.

59
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,900
It actually sounds kind of like devil.

60
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:43,120
They were a way for us to act as if we were rock and roll stars or preachers or something.

61
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,380
Thank you, Bob.

62
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,420
For closing my memory.

63
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,260
I was the one who was supposed to get up on stage and do stuff.

64
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,200
I actually had terrible stage fright.

65
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,880
I wasn't interested in that at all.

66
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:02,080
But a Dallas character who later ended up calling himself Reverend Buck Naked,

67
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,920
the subgenius thing really clicked with him.

68
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,280
The worst crime is serving the conspiracy.

69
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,960
And the penalty...

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,980
He was ready to get up on stage and preach.

71
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,320
The penalty is worse than having your gonads cut off.

72
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:16,800
Oh, no!

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,300
Yeah!

74
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,060
The penalty is worse than having your head cut off.

75
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,380
Eventually, I didn't really like the way Buck did it.

76
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,740
And the rest of them are wrong and you're the only one that's right.

77
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,740
And that's how you're supposed to feel.

78
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,180
So I started doing it.

79
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,960
Before we start the services, we should have our...

80
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,960
Just a moment of...

81
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,140
A moment of sacred noise.

82
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,140
Thanks to the subgenius thing, I discovered I wasn't alone.

83
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,280
There were weirdos all over the place.

84
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,560
There were very normal people who just talked nutty stuff about the Church of the Subgenius,

85
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,980
which made them very easy to, you know, to relate to and get along with.

86
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,000
I remember seeing all these bands and stuff and I thought, you know,

87
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,800
these guys are loaded, these guys are drunk.

88
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,680
And I saw Doctors for Bob perform.

89
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,540
And I thought, these guys are clinically insane.

90
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,340
Anti-music is a...

91
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,080
It's a concept of unfettered expression, musically and sonically,

92
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,780
to try to create this sound that trained hands can't do.

93
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,840
You have to go totally on instinct.

94
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,260
And that's what we did with Doctors for Bob.

95
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,780
It was kind of this lovely, lovely thing.

96
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,280
It was a Looney Tunes fraternity.

97
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,760
And you had to kind of enjoy guys to be a part of it.

98
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,900
The way that I view the Church of the Subgenius is that in a way it is the patriarchy

99
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,080
strained through a cheesecloth.

100
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,360
It was a boys club.

101
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,280
And I was attracted to it because I wanted to meet the boys.

102
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,840
It is finally taking itself by the hair and turning itself inside out

103
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,520
and looking at the world with fresh eyes.

104
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,700
And that's why I think it's such a special place for special people doing special things,

105
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,640
having special feelings.

106
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,540
And we hope to have that.

107
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,120
I think it was this way of saying, it's them and not you.

108
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,000
You know, don't you worry if the world or the conspiracy is getting you down.

109
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,760
You know, you come stand by me because you're one of ours.

110
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,740
The conspiracy's major effort is to take your slack away

111
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,220
and to sell you a false version of it, which they manufacture.

112
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,800
Well, I'm afraid we all discovered the conspiracy probably our first day of school

113
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,920
when the other kids made fun of you for using the wrong color crayon

114
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,900
or you're not doing it right.

115
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,180
It was important that we encapsulate everybody's best enemy

116
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,320
into something that could be easily distilled into like one thing.

117
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,040
Something that people could say, yeah, I understand that.

118
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,780
We're all victims of that, you know.

119
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,200
Anything that we do, we're not going to do it.

120
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,260
Anything that bothers you is the conspiracy.

121
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,800
It's a little bit the thing that assassinates presidents

122
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,840
from book depository windows.

123
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,420
It's a little bit the suppressed saucer technology

124
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,000
that is owned by the European Union.

125
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,380
But it's also just when it's too hot on the bus.

126
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,900
In 1953, Jehovah One, the alien space god,

127
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,020
informed Bob Dobbs that there was this conspiracy

128
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,700
of normal people robbing the slack of the subgeniuses for centuries.

129
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,640
But that on July 5th, 1998, at precisely 7 a.m.,

130
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,360
the men from Planet X would come, rupture up the dues-paying,

131
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,640
believing subgeniuses and give them the power to wreak revenge

132
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,940
on all the normals.

133
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,460
Next thing you know, you've got the doctrine for an entire religion.

134
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,780
Oh, yes, Bob can set free the winos.

135
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,200
He can set free the prisoners.

136
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,000
Do we have any more testimonials from the crowd?

137
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,900
I found the image of Bob's head in a bedpan,

138
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,100
and ever since, you know, it's just been Bob all the way.

139
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,300
Saved by the image of Bob in a bedpan.

140
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,680
Our tendency is to just let everybody throw in,

141
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,300
so we don't really have any rules.

142
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,880
I was once a degenerate, but Bob saved me.

143
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,380
Amen! Amen!

144
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,620
We encouraged people to form their own schism,

145
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,260
you know, join the church and send us money,

146
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,040
but immediately rebel against it.

147
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,900
Well, there's always a split in the church,

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,820
and if there wasn't, we'd create some,

149
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,160
because you can't have a church without schisms.

150
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,640
And the more schisms in a cult, the better.

151
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,900
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to inject this campground with some real hate.

152
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,560
Yes!

153
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,800
What would you like to bring to you?

154
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,940
The great Papa Joe Mahalo.

155
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,180
Yes!

156
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,500
One of the major magnets of religion isn't the common love of something,

157
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,020
it's the common hatred of something.

158
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,420
That's what brings everybody together.

159
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,980
So I just wanted to kind of offer that sort of alter ego,

160
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,580
the sort of anti-Bob, if you will, in the Church of the Subgenius.

161
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,380
There are two distinct branches in the Church of the Subgenius.

162
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,840
The highbrow, evangelical branch,

163
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,400
led by Ivan Stang and his philosophical followers.

164
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,220
Some of the subgeniuses were looking at me as kind of the do-gooder.

165
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,720
I was a little too easy on the normals.

166
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,440
I didn't really want to destroy the whole world,

167
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,960
I just wanted to loot it, get all the good comic books.

168
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,040
Well, other people really do hate the normals.

169
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,760
The evangelicals and the holocaustals represent two sides of the Church.

170
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,480
Now, the evangelicals believe that all the pinks need to be enslaved

171
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,660
and can still serve a purpose,

172
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,660
just after the final judgment in which Earth is liberated

173
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,840
from the chains of pink and conspiracy rule.

174
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,960
Now, the holocaustals, we're kind of a more traditional fundamentalist, if you will.

175
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,620
We believe that, you know, you do need to eliminate and exterminate all the normals.

176
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,620
Not everyone in the Church of the Subgenius gets along with one another,

177
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,060
because it's the group for people who can't join groups.

178
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,820
I've often tried to explain to people about Church of the Subgenius,

179
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,000
that the subgenius is going to be very smart, talented people,

180
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,380
but somewhere along the line they've got a personality problem

181
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:50,960
that keeps them from joining in and being sociable and popular and normal.

182
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,240
The society that they've got involved is ME,

183
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,240


184
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,240


185
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,240


186
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,500
It's not just the radio shows and the noise that annoys you.

187
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,820
It's not just the bobbies with their vacant robotic dogs,

188
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:35,820


189
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:41,620
smiles. It's not just the art hags and performance fascists clutching at the

190
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,640
Godhead. It's not just the psycho babble and the

191
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,780
endless miles and miles and miles of wasted tape.

192
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,220
It's not just the blissed-out winos with stained trouser crutches and corroded

193
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,320
zippers. It's not just the shark-like doctors

194
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:05,740
cruising the crowds of normals like Barracuda trailing the awful barges. It's

195
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,720
not just the morally bankrupt conspiracy trying desperately to climb

196
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,840
on Bob's wagon in a futile attempt to denature the 200 proof word of salvation.

197
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,160
It's not just the Jane of device howling alone and unheeded in the contemporary

198
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,840
wasteland while children suck on stones. It's not just the media zombies who

199
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,220
hunch in front of their FM receivers every night trying to decipher the shows

200
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,420
that dare not speak their minds. It's not just the stark

201
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:35,720
philip mcgacken of the dark and the dark of the dark. It's not just the stark

202
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:35,720


203
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:35,720


204
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,060
reconvening headhunter or chances at fertile in great

205
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,160
hardship. It's not just the super humaliating

206
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,720
localУI-er ands 게ipsed搭 mediants of slayers whose

207
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:43,720


208
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,360
universal stockbrokers. It's not just the perкусive

209
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,560
popular andünk trabalhar on the streets. It's not just the ever lasting

210
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,760
death profes at the cabinet park. It's not just what he ousted hisons in the

211
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,600
Lancaster arena. It's not as if this character deserves us stalkers to

212
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,840
go get once your Bernie Sanders b tiefka maa. It's not as if maybe there's such an

213
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,780
acting beginning he picked up hisences as gentle profession and

214
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,840
maybe some people would consider the evaluation McMune to accept

215
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,700
him for indelible footprints. But that officer is willing or more likely

216
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,920
on a job a stronger, I'mcents an irgendwann over his ass the

217
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:11,500
It's not just the inane tape correspondences that go on and on and on and on and on.

218
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:23,720
It's not just the smug, self-righteous, born-again fundamentalists who want us all to live according to their moral code, which was written by tribal savages back in the Stone Age.

219
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:31,420
It's not just the hate-filled zealots who murder a scientist to spare a guinea pig or a laboratory monkey.

220
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,460
It's not just the government that lies, cheats, robs, and kills the very people whose rights it is supposed to secure.

221
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:47,720
It's not just the bad movies, bad television, bad books, bad fashions, bad music, and bad taste.

222
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,600
It's not just a system that's so corrupt, top-heavy, and tainted with greed that it's raping our very planet.

223
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,400
It's not just the overfed, bloated, paranoid demagogues with their bloody minds.

224
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,400
It's not just the bloody fingers on the doomsday buttons.

225
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:10,660
It's not just the complete absence of love, charity, kindness, faith, honor, and slack.

226
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,440
It's not just the hip wimps milling all around you with smarmy smiles and sticky fingers.

227
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,660
It's not just the collapse of civilization that we have come to know and despise it.

228
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,120
It's not just the fact that everything we are and everything we do

229
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,400
is dictated by a double helix.

230
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,380
It's not just the double helix of deoxyribonucleic acid.

231
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,920
No, dear friends, it's more than all that.

232
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,860
But the Church of the Subgenius offers you alternatives.

233
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,980
Glanscaping, time control, acupointing, fornicationalism,

234
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,380
and a chance to ride the Dobbs wave as it sweeps across the luck plane.

235
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,680
Eschew normality, shun the conspiracy, and get right with Bob.

236
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,060
He's still got that frog mixture.

237
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,300
And he's a dinkum square shoe.

238
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,940
Maybe he isn't the best, but he's all you've got.

239
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,520
Dr. G. Gordon Gordon performing the extremely rare,

240
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,920
it's not just the, number two, which I forgot even existed.

241
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,420
It was on Hour of Slack number 89,

242
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,090
whereas this is number 1811.

243
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,650
Probably that was recorded in Bolivia.

244
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:41,930
Now we're going to go back to this rare old Firesign Theatre material.

245
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:47,330
Now, if you never heard of them and yet enjoy Subgenius Radio,

246
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:52,690
you might want to look at FiresignTheatre.com

247
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,610
and let me note that the theatre there is spelled the British way,

248
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:02,530
with R-E at the end instead of E-R.

249
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,070
FiresignTheatre.com.

250
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,430
That is where you can find access to many new and old albums,

251
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:14,330
such as the one I'm playing from called Dope Humor of the Seventies.

252
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,390
There would probably not be any kind of Subgenius Radio

253
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:25,330
or possibly even church outreach without the Firesign Theatre.

254
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,490
World domination really only comes into its really golden age

255
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,690
with Richard Nixon, I think.

256
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,750
Well, no, I think Jack Kennedy.

257
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,350
No, Kennedy really was the man who really made it possible.

258
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:42,630
He was the first man to take a real liberal's, like, super electronic vision.

259
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,710
He was the kind of guy that would be,

260
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,770
he was the first president to own a Sony tape recorder.

261
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,250
You know? He really was.

262
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,630
If our advisors aren't there, somebody else's advisors will be there.

263
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,930
Right. I mean, like, if Harvard doesn't get in there first,

264
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,070
Yale's going to get there.

265
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,230
I mean, he's got a good real vision.

266
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,450
It's good to have the touch football competition.

267
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,570
Absolutely, right.

268
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,230
Political touch football is what it is.

269
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,290
But look, Richard Nixon, man, I mean,

270
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,150
Richard Nixon is much better than Lyndon Johnson ever was.

271
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,030
Oh, I agree.

272
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,490
I thought Lyndon Johnson was good, man,

273
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,390
especially all that killing and stuff like that.

274
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,110
But Richard Nixon has outdone him.

275
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,570
Let me tell you one thing before you get into Nixon.

276
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,490
No, go right ahead.

277
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,850
Just very flashed on it yesterday, I just wanted to mention to the folks,

278
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,990
like, President of the United States gets shot,

279
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,390
the guy who's supposed to do it only gets to say one thing,

280
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,050
which is, I didn't do it, and then he gets shot on television, right?

281
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,210
And nobody says anything about it, basically.

282
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,030
It just goes down.

283
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,670
And then the next president, everybody in Washington is scared to death, right?

284
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,110
Everybody's going around saying, well, that guy gets shot,

285
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,890
and then the guy's got shot on television.

286
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,410
Nobody said anything about it, and they got the Supreme Court to say it's okay.

287
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,530
I better keep my mouth shut.

288
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,550
It's wonderful, man.

289
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,870
It's the closed-mouthed administration.

290
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,990
The closed-mouthed, right, the silent generation, right?

291
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,590
Me scared of Nixon?

292
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,630
No.

293
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,030
You know who he sends around, you know, to lean on you?

294
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,830
Lyndon Johnson.

295
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,150
Lyndon Johnson, right.

296
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,230
I come from the big man.

297
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,690
He was in Newport Beach yesterday attending the wedding of his niece.

298
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,930
And he has a perfect attendance record, by the way.

299
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:05,390
Yes, he does.

300
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,850
He goes to all family functions, no matter where in Southern California they occur.

301
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,630
Oh, and if he's not there personally, he has two or three of his boys there.

302
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,790
Right, right, right.

303
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,750
I'm sorry, I will not be able to...

304
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,930
You mean the little Eisenhower kid?

305
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,510
Yeah, the little Eisenhower kid, the one with the submachine gun.

306
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,810
I am not going to go to that assassination.

307
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,390
I'm not going to go to that assassination roundup.

308
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,150
But I am going to send David and Bobby Eisenhower.

309
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,950
And I am going to send the National Boy Scout boys.

310
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,770
Look, oh, it's just wonderful, man.

311
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,210
Who's that kid, David Eisenhower?

312
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,570
He's got the same name as another president, you know?

313
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:37,930
That's right.

314
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,830
And he goes around...

315
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,730
They're related closely.

316
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,110
No, no, no.

317
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,110
Eisenhower was the chancellor of the German Republic after Hitler.

318
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,190
That's right, that's right.

319
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,210
Yeah, he took over war-torn Germany, I think they call it.

320
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,590
Post-war-torn Germany.

321
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,750
Dear Chancellor Chrysler.

322
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,550
And built it up to the major state that it is today.

323
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,510
War-torn...

324
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,050
He did a good job, done well, too.

325
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,930
Heil Volkswagen.

326
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:55,630
Right.

327
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,510
That's his first name, Volkswagen Eisenhower.

328
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,610
I hear the marks are doing well.

329
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,410
Yeah, yeah.

330
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,450
So are the Munches.

331
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:01,870
Right.

332
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,070
They got all the angles.

333
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,870
I left an opening for both of you, did you notice that?

334
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,230
Yeah, that's right.

335
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,110
We got your marks.

336
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,430
We came in separate.

337
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:07,970
That's right.

338
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,750
We've got to look for our marks for all the angles.

339
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,510
That's right, for all the angles so we can lay it on the Munches, you know what I mean?

340
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,210
Down in Munchen.

341
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,390
That's where all the Munches are.

342
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:20,910
And that's where all the Munchen, man, that's where old Dorothy, man, gets...

343
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:20,970
Munchkin?

344
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,190
Sure, of course.

345
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,730
...gets caught in this tremendous political hurricane in Kansas, bleeding Kansas, gets

346
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,210
lifted up with the House of Representatives and lands in Munich.

347
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,230
That's what the Wizard of Oz means.

348
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,230
Get out of here.

349
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:33,550
Of course.

350
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,190
God, boy.

351
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,970
Get out of here.

352
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,750
Oh, look, look.

353
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:41,150
Why don't you go join Susan Perlmutter, whoever wrote that article?

354
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,430
A bunch of Jewish critics, that's all you guys are.

355
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:44,810
You're obscure.

356
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:45,690
That's right.

357
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,330
And Dr. Seuss is all about the takeover of the Japanese and does you know what?

358
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,590
I'm glad we got rid of him.

359
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,090
Boy.

360
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,310
What a drag.

361
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,950
Mr. Intellectual, they call him.

362
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,310
No, the critic is.

363
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,050
It's terrible to get into that sort of thing.

364
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,470
The critic is a guy who pans for salt.

365
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,830
Disillusioned a bunch of kids.

366
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,470
Yeah.

367
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,010
By the way, is that kid still tied to the tree out there?

368
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,350
No, no, no, no, no.

369
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,430
Say, Sebastian, you mean?

370
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,130
The cheetah got him.

371
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,210
The cheetah got him?

372
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,890
Yeah, right.

373
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:09,390
Oh, wonderful.

374
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,550
We try, we, when we're doing the radio show, we tie a kid to the tree outside.

375
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,230
Yeah, right.

376
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,050
And so then, you know, that's an old African method and then the tiger comes along and

377
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,970
then you shoot the tiger.

378
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,590
That's right.

379
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:18,870
Yeah.

380
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:19,450
Yeah.

381
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,630
And then somebody else shoots you.

382
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,170
It's a macho game, right, actually.

383
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,010
Yeah, it's a good game.

384
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,670
It's a swell game.

385
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:23,970
Sure is.

386
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,090
I like it.

387
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,530
It's called the President Nixon game.

388
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,230
The President Nixon game, right, which is you take a small country, tie it to a tree,

389
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,830
right, and wait until, and wait for China to come and eat it, right?

390
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,290
Right, right, right.

391
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,570
And then you eat China, right?

392
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:34,770
Right.

393
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,130
Let's go down and eat a little Chinese.

394
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,670
I don't be silly.

395
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,470
Of course I don't.

396
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:45,330
But that's because you're smart and you spent all that excess money that you make on trips

397
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,490
to Amsterdam and stuff like that, don't you?

398
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,310
Yeah.

399
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,930
That's what, that's what the rest of us do.

400
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,450
You know, you gotta have a write-off.

401
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,810
Yeah, intelligence, yeah.

402
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,430
Yeah, mind.

403
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,430
That's got a lot to do with it, isn't it?

404
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:55,930
Yeah, sure.

405
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,110
That's what, no, that, Bob never said that.

406
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,490
Nah, Bob never said that.

407
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:01,870
That ain't doctrinal.

408
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,230
He never told me anything.

409
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,730
Bob never said you had to have a brain.

410
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,630
In fact, he said just the opposite.

411
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,630
He said to just float with it, man.

412
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,590
Just, just feel your way along.

413
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,230
Don't be linear.

414
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:13,830
Feel your weight, yeah.

415
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,910
But you have a whole photographic view.

416
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,310
You feel the weight holding you down.

417
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,130
You don't want to be linear.

418
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,830
It's like you're being locked in a box.

419
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,910
Yeah.

420
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:19,910


421
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:19,910


422
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:19,910


423
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:19,910


424
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:19,910


425
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:19,910


426
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,290
It's not a box, man.

427
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,190
It's just like the way it goes.

428
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:22,750
Yeah, man.

429
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,590
It's not, it's not a road or a grid.

430
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,750
It's more like a cloud.

431
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,110
Yeah, it's like a, it's like an arroyo or a canyon.

432
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,350
It's like a, no, it's like a beaver's tooth.

433
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,370
No, it's like a hamstrung muscle.

434
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,330
Yeah, that's right.

435
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,570
The neurons don't really do that much.

436
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:39,930
It's like a neuron.

437
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:45,430
The things they don't even know about this go off the neuron.

438
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,630
No, they don't know each other.

439
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,470
They can't even talk to each other.

440
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:48,750
It's all the real fancy stuff.

441
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,890
Sometimes they're so lonely and so busy.

442
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:49,890


443
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:49,890


444
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:49,890


445
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:49,890


446
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,010
They're sitting right next to all the other neurons.

447
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,290
Yeah, sure.

448
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,290
Dave, get your hands off that neuron.

449
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,730
Quit playing with your neurons.

450
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:57,910
Look at that.

451
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,770
Look at him.

452
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,750
He's just like a chimpanzee in a cage.

453
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,250
Manipulating like it was home or something.

454
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,890
Just beating his neurons again.

455
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,770
Ripping his neurons.

456
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,410
Very, very light.

457
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,490
You can use a whisk.

458
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,070
Ew, it's gross.

459
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,710
It's squishing chemicals out of him.

460
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,590
The whisk I've got is a Scandinavian plate has-

461
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,830
Ew, gross.

462
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,530
There's serotonin all over everything.

463
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,590
Lepithymine, spring testing, and other morning, afternoon-

464
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:19,870
Hey, Dave, you're going to get a little bit of a headache.

465
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:19,870


466
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:19,870


467
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:25,790
Dave, will you plug your ears and quit leaking out your damn neuronic-

468
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:27,310
Pus.

469
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,670
Chemical brain cell pus.

470
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,210
It's neuronic pus, man.

471
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,370
Ah, neuronic pus.

472
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,710
Somebody called this show a bunch of neuronic pus, and I think they meant moronic pus.

473
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,550
I don't think they meant it.

474
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,250
I would agree.

475
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,730
I would tend to agree with that characterization.

476
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,190
Hello there.

477
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,210
It's time to play Truth and Consequences.

478
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,610
Roll up the carpets, push back the chairs, and join us in having a load of laughs and

479
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,550
lots of fun.

480
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,750
You look like a likely candidate for the first question.

481
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,530
Step up to the mic.

482
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,170
What's your name?

483
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,470
Good.

484
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,930
Now, here's the first question.

485
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,170
What large race of people still ride in buggies?

486
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:04,970
Oh, I'm sorry.

487
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,050
But what large race of people still ride in buggies?

488
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,150
It's babies.

489
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,230
And now for Private Joe Smith.

490
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,470
Private Smith's great yearning is to be a psychiatrist.

491
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,590
And here is his golden idea.

492
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:27,690
Give your all, Private Smith, because I'm informed that several officers of the American

493
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,790
Medical Association are listening in.

494
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,410
And if you do a good job tonight, you might find a scholarship to some medical college

495
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,330
waiting for you when you leave the army.

496
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,870
Now here's the problem.

497
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:42,610
You're a fashionable psychiatrist, and you're sitting in your office with a woman patient.

498
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:47,610
This is your desk here, and you'd better wear these glasses to make you look professional.

499
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,590
All right.

500
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,790
Go ahead.

501
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,610
And now, madam, just what seems to be the trouble.

502
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,990
Oh, doctor, I just don't know how to begin.

503
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:00,010
I can rumba and conga like a mad thing, but I just don't know how to begin.

504
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,050
Uh-huh.

505
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,770
Now, madam, you know what you're saying.

506
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,030
Well, you see, doctor...

507
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,050
Oh, doctor, your beard, it's dipping in the ink well.

508
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,810
But, madam, I have no beard.

509
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,110
Now, don't you fret.

510
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,790
You're a lot worse than the people who talk about you.

511
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,390
Amen.

512
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,270
Now, madam...

513
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,430
Well, doctor, you see, first of all, I suffer from a constant obsession that my husband

514
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:18,570
and I have with the doctor.

515
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:18,570


516
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:18,570


517
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:18,570


518
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:18,570


519
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:18,590
And I'm not sure if that's true.

520
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,290
I'm not sure if my husband is untrue to me.

521
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,110
Well, perhaps he is untrue to you.

522
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,450
Oh, but you see, I'm not married.

523
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,930
And I also have a constant obsession that I'm not being followed.

524
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,870
Well, that may not be a delusion, madam.

525
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,870
How old are you?

526
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,410
That's a secret between me, my mother, and my draft board.

527
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,390
Oh, no.

528
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,370
Oh, doctor, I don't know what to think.

529
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,230
Sometimes I think I'm quite crazy, and then again I think I'm perfectly sane.

530
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,970
It's the uncertainty of it that's so terrible.

531
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:40,450
What?

532
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,930
Madam, your stories are over.

533
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,150
You're crazy.

534
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,950
Have you any other obsessions, madam?

535
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,110
Oh, yes, heaps.

536
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,210
Why, right this minute, I think I'm soaking wet.

537
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,110
Mine glimmel!

538
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,030
For heaven's sake, don't drip all over my knees.

539
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,510
Oh, Germans again, my heart.

540
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,710
Excuse me.

541
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,550
I've just had a hard day.

542
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,490
Oh, I'm so glad.

543
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,110
And doctor, I have another obsession.

544
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:02,650
Yes?

545
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,650
Right now, I think there's a tiger in back of me.

546
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,750
A big tiger?

547
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:06,210
Huge.

548
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,170
You see him moving around?

549
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,250
Oh, no, he's asleep.

550
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,970
Well, perhaps we'd better lower our voices.

551
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,870
We might wake him.

552
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,430
What am I saying?

553
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,230
Madam, say no more.

554
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,090
I understand.

555
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,370
I understand your case thoroughly.

556
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,350
Madam, I have here a little word association test.

557
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,810
When I read a word, you say the first word that comes into your mind.

558
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,230
Are you ready?

559
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,750
Very well.

560
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:27,250
Dog.

561
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:27,650
Dog.

562
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:28,150
Hitler.

563
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,670
No.

564
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:30,650
You're right.

565
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,450
You're right.

566
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:32,970
You're wrong.

567
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,550
No, that isn't it.

568
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,630
Don't repeat the word I read.

569
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:36,990
Now, look.

570
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,970
Just say the first word that comes into your head, all right?

571
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:40,730
Dog.

572
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,950
No, not yet.

573
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:42,650
Not yet.

574
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,830
Wait till I do it now, okay?

575
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:44,290
No, okay.

576
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,850
Now, what is the first word that the word dog brings to your mind?

577
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:47,970
Hitler.

578
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:48,090
Oh, Hitler.

579
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,670
You're right.

580
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,430
You're right again.

581
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:50,630
That's good.

582
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,150
I was right before.

583
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,250
I'm right again.

584
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,330
I'm not crazy.

585
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:53,830
What did you say?

586
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,750
What did you say again?

587
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,210
Again.

588
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,390
Ah I'm going crazy.

589
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,730
No, doctor, doctor, I can't help you.

590
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,570
I'm going crazy.

591
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,330
I can't help you unless you help yourself.

592
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,350
You'll change sex.

593
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,230
Now, why don't you take a nice hot bath?

594
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,550
Here, take one of mine.

595
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:08,710
That's funny.

596
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:09,750
That's funny.

597
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,810
But I couldn't take your last, bud.

598
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,110
Heavens, it's late.

599
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,470
I can't stay another minute.

600
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,370
I hate to eat and run, so I'll just walk.

601
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:16,990
Cheerio.

602
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:17,350
Cheerio.

603
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:17,950
Cheerio.

604
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:17,950


605
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:17,950


606
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,650
Oh, that's fading a little. Wait a minute.

607
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,290
Let me... You skipped my line here.

608
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,250
Ah, you're stepping on the tiger's tail!

609
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:24,990
Silly boy.

610
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,690
If he doesn't mind, why should you?

611
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:28,890
Bye-bye.

612
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,590
Horsely to himself.

613
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,530
I must pull this horse together.

614
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,410
Madam, wait, wait.

615
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,990
That will be $25.

616
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,370
Oh, no, no. I really couldn't take it.

617
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,150
But, madam...

618
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,190
Oh, well, if you insist.

619
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,750
I might as well be rich as the way I am.

620
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,730
But hurry, hurry.

621
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,230
Where did you learn to read?

622
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,510
Excuse me.

623
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,410
Let's see, a 10, a 20.

624
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,490
You thought that was funny, huh?

625
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:51,350
Crazy.

626
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,190
25. You'll wait for me until after this.

627
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,530
We'll go out for a drink.

628
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,770
I'm off to you again.

629
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,850
Now just do everything I told you,

630
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,570
and don't worry.

631
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,570
Bye-bye.

632
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,750
Bye-bombs.

633
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,730
Oh, I'd like to go to the lake.

634
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,670
I'd like to go to the stage.

635
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,170
Go walking around.

636
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,810
And people will have a number.

637
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:17,270
Let's go.

638
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,990
Greetings.

639
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:30,650
I have to do the BF.

640
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,330
Excuse me.

641
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:39,050
All right, so I had really loose nerves in here recently.

642
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,670
Did you ever hear anything about manufactured lead nhiều?

643
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:44,690
I don't think so.

644
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:44,930


645
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:44,930


646
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:44,930


647
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:45,250
I have to go.

648
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:45,530


649
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,490
What do I know?

650
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,690
immediately started to take back to the friend,

651
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,810
and it was just such a great way to communicate.

652
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,270
Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocritans,

653
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,210
these pink boys, these normals

654
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,290
who have made normality the norm?

655
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,830
Doug was in Berkeley, and I was in San Francisco,

656
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:09,050
and we turned on KPFA and heard ourselves on the radio,

657
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,010
which was a little moment of discontinuity

658
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,790
because how could we be on the radio

659
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,890
when we were here listening to it?

660
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:20,930
And it turned out this fellow had gotten a hold of one of Doug's tapes

661
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,990
and was just filling his show out with it.

662
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,410
We contacted him and invited ourselves onto his show,

663
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:32,490
and at some point it became Hour of Slack,

664
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:38,010
which was a great name because the show is actually 90 minutes long.

665
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:45,450
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

666
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,570
And this gave us a body of cassette tapes

667
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:52,070
that made us sound a little more developed than we really were.

668
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,410
Nobody had met each other to that point.

669
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,430
No real events or anything.

670
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,950
It was all just a male media network.

671
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,130
There were finally enough people who were curious about each other

672
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,010
and becoming actual friends that we wanted to meet.

673
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:12,250
So we decided we were going to have a convention in Dallas.

674
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,410
Have you ever wondered about your neighbors?

675
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,290
Maybe wondered about the weird thumps and bumps

676
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,310
or chants emanating from their apartment?

677
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,710
Well, they may be followers of Bob.

678
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:28,290
That's the fastest growing cult here in the Southwest.

679
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:33,810
Somehow or another, Channel 4 News got wind of this subgenius thing.

680
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:38,050
Ivan was like, you know, really resisted at first.

681
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,710
I was married to a school teacher.

682
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,190
We didn't want to get my wife in trouble or get Philo fired,

683
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,270
plus Philo's parents.

684
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,310
Didn't know anything about this whole subgenius thing.

685
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,370
They were very religious.

686
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:54,250
I didn't ever want to do anything that was going to embarrass them in public.

687
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:57,190
Even though I had this really strong need to rebel,

688
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,750
I wanted to kind of do it privately.

689
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,470
The church is so omnipervasive

690
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,250
that we couldn't possibly get into the dogma

691
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,370
in any less than three or four hours.

692
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,730
I thought, man, you know, a secret identity is a good thing.

693
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,770
It's the Church of the Subgenius, and they're holding a revival.

694
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:15,870
My name's Scott.

695
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,790
I'm a Cisterno Docs from Little Rock, Arkansas.

696
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:23,270
This is my cousinly evidence representative, Doug Wellman, Oakland, California.

697
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,650
I'm Pulver Greenies from the Wise Foundation in San Francisco.

698
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,350
Deep in the heart of San Francisco.

699
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,990
People came from all over the country.

700
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,350
I'm from Houston, and I came to learn more about Bob.

701
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:38,370
Bob is like a super salesman.

702
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,710
He can sell you anything, and I bought it.

703
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,370
I just kept hearing the word Bob, Bob, Bob.

704
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,790
It would wake me up in the middle of the night.

705
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,870
I'd wake up doing jumpers.

706
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,290
I'd be doing jumping jacks.

707
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:46,910
I wouldn't know why.

708
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:52,070
Devo was in town, and Mark Mothersbaugh came by.

709
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:56,150
It was only by chance that I started receiving mail from the Subgenius Foundation,

710
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,650
and I realized who Bob was.

711
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,570
Two of the guys from Devo are at the convention.

712
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,530
I thought, this is really cool.

713
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:10,190
Everything was completely like a parallel universe

714
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,030
to what Devo had been doing back in Akron

715
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,910
and now was trying to foist upon the world.

716
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:20,950
This was big time, major, grade A proof positive

717
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,810
that it had been going on somewhere else.

718
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,330
There's a good Bob, and there is a bad Bob.

719
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,950
There's a big, tall Bob, and there's a little, short Bob.

720
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,770
There's a kitchen Bob, and a living room Bob.

721
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,870
There's an anti-gravity Bob.

722
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,470
And where is Bob leading them?

723
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,270
When you first look at it, some people go,

724
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:43,690
oh, I get it, this is a takeoff on weird cults and conspiracies.

725
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,770
Then they look a little bit deeper,

726
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,610
and if they're really an attuned sort of person,

727
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,210
then they realize, oh, I get it, this really is a weird cult

728
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,430
with cosmic wisdom and dogma that I've been needing all my life.

729
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:59,910
And that's usually when they write their first check.

730
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,390
Kelly Lane, Channel 4 News, Dallas.

731
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,050
As the song says, different strokes for different folks.

732
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,690
Doug's been standing out in the sun too long, I think.

733
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:11,850
I lost my ass on that.

734
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,670
It was disastrous for me personally.

735
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:21,890
It hurt my job and probably my marriage.

736
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:26,110
He was struggling to make money.

737
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:30,750
And I have to admit, for me, that was probably the time in my life

738
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,570
when I had the least amount of trouble earning an income.

739
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:39,470
I was in the perfect position of being desperate enough

740
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:43,570
to do low-budget promotion for a weird cult.

741
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:44,850
Start fist.

742
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,430
7,000 of them.

743
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,930
That's a lot of weird...

744
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,010
It certainly is.

745
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,470
I kicked in a few bucks now and then,

746
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:57,390
but for the most part, he was the guy that was shelling out his money.

747
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,250
You should make a film about slave labor.

748
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,070
That's what I'm doing.

749
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:02,810
Yeah.

750
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:06,770
I was kidnapped in my native country of Africa

751
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,890
walking down the street.

752
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:12,990
And these white people came up and told me to get over here to America

753
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,830
and fold these damn envelopes.

754
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:21,410
It was like a carrot was being dangled in front of me personally all the time.

755
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,170
This thing could be big.

756
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:28,210
We were aware that we were sort of influencing other people.

757
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,110
That was exciting.

758
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,330
You didn't know who, but you could kind of tell other people,

759
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,650
like, what's that Bob thing you're doing?

760
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,750
I kind of wish I had found the Church of the Subgenius

761
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,570
when I was a teenager living in East Texas,

762
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,310
a little town where the state prison was.

763
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,870
You know, it's nothing but Baptist church.

764
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,470
There's churches everywhere, which my family didn't go to,

765
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:51,050
so we were sort of the oddballs.

766
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,070
What do you do to earn a living?

767
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:54,670
You mean work?

768
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,370
What the hell is the kind of work you have to do to earn a living?

769
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,730
All it does is fill the bellies of the pigs who exploit us.

770
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,830
They look at you and say, oh, you're not getting anything done.

771
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,350
You're a bum. You're a slacker.

772
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,730
You're disengaged.

773
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,850
You know, all the put-downs that people throw at people

774
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,930
who seem to be living their own lives,

775
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,290
kind of following their own passions.

776
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,530
What is this, some kind of psychic TV-type parallelism?

777
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:29,050
Well, we all know the psychic powers of the televised image,

778
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:32,990
but we need to capitalize on it

779
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:36,110
and make it work for us instead of us working for it.

780
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,250
That's a threat, you know.

781
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,230
That's a threat to the conspiracy.

782
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,850
That's a threat to the mediocrity machine

783
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,830
that is the modern capitalism.

784
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:46,270
That's a threat to the capitalist world.

785
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:50,150
Other creative people started coming into this church.

786
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:55,670
There was a guy who owned a record store in Amherst, Massachusetts.

787
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,950
I think he's the one that told me about the subgenius.

788
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,750
I was told at one point that I was the only person

789
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:07,070
who had paid his dues to the subgenius every single time they asked.

790
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,770
The effect they had on David Byrne,

791
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,010
the effect they had on the residents,

792
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,470
the effect they had on Paul Reubens,

793
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,870
even people who were not in the church,

794
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,590
even people who didn't know,

795
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:21,670
were building on subgenius tropes and sensibilities.

796
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,690
It was very flattering.

797
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,630
Some of these people were like our heroes.

798
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,390
So to be recognized by your heroes,

799
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,230
it's a real ego boost, you know.

800
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,370
We actually got big heads and stuff.

801
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,570
There is a patrolman in Boston

802
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,790
Free the Anthropology 7

803
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,690
who has formed an organization called something like

804
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,950
the Patrolman's Friendship Association.

805
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:51,170
And the standard bearer and the emblem is a pig called Fuzzy.

806
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,270
And he says that Fuzzy the pig,

807
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,750
representing all the policemen and the people who like policemen,

808
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,010
is better than all the hippies.

809
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,670
Well, we work in this group manipulation program

810
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,870
and start with pigs, groups of pigs.

811
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,870
With any success, doctor?

812
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:12,550
No.

813
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,050
But it's just an experimental program,

814
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:22,310
so we expect some fallbacks before we can really get rolling with it.

815
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,670
And the government grants are going to last us for years,

816
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,210
so we don't care.

817
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:30,250
Is there any possible social use of the garbage?

818
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:30,730
No.

819
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,370
No social value there either?

820
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,870
The pigs eat it, but then they make more garbage.

821
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,290
That's right.

822
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,150
Although they're very clean little animals.

823
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:43,070
But the patients confronted with a gaggle of pigs find it difficult.

824
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:43,770
Doctor?

825
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,730
Doctor, can you tell me this?

826
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:53,730
Are you wearing those glasses because you think that I'm going to hit you?

827
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,710
No, Jim.

828
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,130
You have paranoid delusions.

829
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,970
Well, I can't believe that.

830
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,270
Let me see your hand.

831
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:03,850
What? No.

832
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:04,990
What?

833
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,290
Get your hand out of your pocket slowly.

834
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,630
I'm not going to hurt you.

835
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,370
Face the carp.

836
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,270
Just put your hands up.

837
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,450
I'm just talking about pigs, Jim.

838
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:13,750
You're just talking about pigs.

839
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:13,750


840
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:13,750


841
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:13,750


842
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:13,750


843
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,910
Is that your pants leg?

844
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,550
That's a third leg.

845
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,090
I'm just talking about pigs, Jim.

846
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:18,710
You must be a taper.

847
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,250
Jimmy.

848
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,170
All right. Okay.

849
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,770
Let's get back to pigs, gentlemen.

850
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:23,890
Let's keep it civilized.

851
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:28,190
Well, we want to help him find his direction and growth.

852
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,670
Now, I'm at the polar extreme.

853
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,890
Who are the others?

854
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:37,610
We've been trying to find this out ever since the tenants of Freud

855
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,990
were thrown out of the building that he owned.

856
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:49,470
We're following a Newtonian science, represented, as you were, by the cow culture, and it's

857
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,210
long outdated.

858
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:56,030
Let's start our science with naturalistic observation of pigs.

859
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:02,950
Doctor, what you have said here has changed my life.

860
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:10,610
From now on, I think I'm going to have to make a drastic fallback and turn around in

861
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:10,970
a cyber-movement.

862
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,770
I think I'm going to have to change my cybernetic sense in order to be able to just lick your

863
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:14,210
shoes.

864
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:14,890
Thank God.

865
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,210
Thank you, Jesus.

866
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,090
After all, I just like that.

867
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:23,630
I'd like to tell you right now, in front of this syndicated show, and we're reaching 60

868
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,790
million listeners, I would like to tell everybody that I love you, Doctor.

869
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,990
Jim, I think you have accomplished something important.

870
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,070
This is beautiful.

871
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:30,930
This is real.

872
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:31,590
This is beautiful.

873
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,990
You've changed my life in a way in which I can't...

874
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,870
There it is, Jim.

875
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,670
Are you trying to...

876
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:39,650
Pigs.

877
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,010
Pigs.

878
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:40,950
Pigs.

879
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:41,210
Pigs.

880
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,290
Now, hey, you, you know what this is.

881
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:42,310
It's the first time now we have an entire film made on Netflix together.

882
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,130
I think we may have earned a little bit more media attention in the time when no one has

883
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,050
anything to say.

884
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,110
I think I've done it before.

885
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:06,950
You'veier than that, right?

886
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:14,610
today will cause you instant sainthood and martyrdom. You will be lifted on high, so

887
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:23,590
there's no reason to cry, children. Each one of you are a little bum, armed and ready to pop.

888
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:39,710
I feel like I could pop all night, baby. I don't know if I can walk to town with this.

889
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:48,530
You're my radar love, hon. The implantation devices make sure that each child walks the

890
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:53,570
straight and narrow path to his destination. The objective or target at which he or she

891
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:59,130
is known and controlled is to make sure that each child removes itself as it removes the

892
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:04,390
target, so there are no witnesses and no disclaimers allowed past the curfew now.

893
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:21,150
What do you think, Dave, about the fact that, damn it, they're not even going to hide anymore,

894
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,550
are they? No. No. No, they're just...

895
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:27,610
Just right out there. We're having an oil problem right now. We're not making enough

896
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:33,270
money to who knows what. They're just not even going to hide it anymore. No. They're just going

897
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:39,230
to rape everything they can in the four years they have, or only two, really, because they know

898
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:45,270
they're going to lose the Senate. Oh, Jeb's son will be the next Bush emperor, and then...

899
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:52,030
Jeb's son? You mean the little Puerto Rican kid? Yeah, yeah. The one granddad called the little

900
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,850
brown one?

901
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,690
His father called him the little brown one? Yeah, George Bush Sr.

902
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:01,190
Oh, is that the little brown one? The little brown one, right?

903
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:06,170
Well, I'm glad he's spreading his genes around and kind of like one of the folks now, but...

904
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:10,070
That's good. You have a brown child. How did that happen?

905
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:16,410
You know, I realized that I was serious when it sunk in that I really was trying to learn

906
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:19,610
Dutch from that little Berlitz book. You mean you're saying you're actually

907
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:23,150
thinking of repatriating the feces? Well, you know...

908
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:23,370
Sure.

909
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,430
I don't want to be part of the empire. I know what you mean.

910
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:34,770
I don't want to be on the Death Star. I grew up believing that America was the rebel forces.

911
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:41,510
And now it's like, well, the rebel forces, this is the Death Star, man.

912
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:48,370
Howdy, folks. Come on down to America, Inc., where you'll be forced to pay for everything.

913
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:53,430
But it's not. It's convenient, friends. This is the most convenient.

914
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:54,050
Ah, memories.

915
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,110
They used to shoot at us. Now they shoot near us.

916
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:05,630
Well, I heard about the more friendlier bullets that they're using on the kids these days.

917
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,350
Well, they don't think they were using friendly bullets in Cincinnati.

918
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,510
I heard they use the little bouncing bullets.

919
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:17,010
Not in the West Bank of Gaza, they don't.

920
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,870
No, no, no. They're using really lead bullets still.

921
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,070
Yes, there's still lead.

922
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:23,370
And even the Army. What do you think about this? The Army has switched to a...

923
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:30,130
The Army has switched to a bullet that is environmental friendly.

924
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,910
It's some sort of other... It's not lead.

925
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,450
It's biodegradable bullets.

926
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:34,870
Yeah.

927
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:35,750
Oh, my God.

928
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,850
The family still has to pay for it.

929
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,910
So that we only kill humans, not the earth.

930
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:41,710
They probably got a big conservation tax break for that.

931
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:42,450
Yeah.

932
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,970
The idea, of course, being, you know, this is the way...

933
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,730
Think of the research that went into that.

934
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:51,370
Gentlemen, the world of the future will be a clean war.

935
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:52,430
A war.

936
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,550
A war that you and your children...

937
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,130
Children can stand to fight.

938
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,330
An effectively deadly bullet, but yet...

939
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:00,050
You know, somebody had to not repent.

940
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,270
Easy to mop up after.

941
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:08,290
In order for that bullet to be developed, somebody had to not repent or quit their job or slack off.

942
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,010
That's the age-correct way of thinking of it, yes.

943
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,330
There was a point where somebody could have repented, quit their job and slack off,

944
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,570
and then somebody else would have had to develop that bullet.

945
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,150
Said, no, sign the check and put it in my rectum right here.

946
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,450
Well, if I don't fill up this bullet, somebody else is going to do it,

947
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:22,910
so I might as well not repent.

948
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,370
Can't quit my job or slack off.

949
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:25,730
I got to tell you guys something.

950
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,350
I'll be known as the guy who developed the environmental bullet.

951
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,710
The environmental bullet.

952
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:32,270
Yeah.

953
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:36,770
You know, the guy in the Doobie Brothers who's supposedly a missile defense expert?

954
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,710
Bend over and spread them, baby.

955
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:43,970
Here comes my environmentally cool bullet.

956
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:44,450
I love it.

957
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,130
Thank God I've been shot.

958
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,410
I can almost see the future of America.

959
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,250
As my life oozes out here on the sidewalk,

960
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:59,770
thank God for the safe, clean bullet that just ended me.

961
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:01,150
Ended you?

962
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,170
Did I?

963
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,390
Did you end?

964
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,030
Did I end at that moment?

965
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,730
No, you know, we have a friend who was in a band who's kind of like,

966
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,090
this song is just important today.

967
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,370
Why aren't kids, like, marching and stuff?

968
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,290
For what?

969
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,690
Yeah, they're not shooting them yet.

970
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:16,970
Stop.

971
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,450
Once they start shooting them, they're going to go.

972
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:20,110
You're thinking of the old America.

973
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,930
This is America Incorporated.

974
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:22,310
Right.

975
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:22,890
You know what?

976
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:25,910
We don't actually, I mean, come on, man.

977
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:29,910
Do I have to spell it out as many of my employers?

978
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,930
There are no disagreements in corporate America.

979
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,610
Come on now, get with the program.

980
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:39,170
Read from the same page and remember the talking points.

981
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:41,930
Point number one.

982
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:44,810
Things are better than they've ever been and worse than they've ever been.

983
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,430
All the kids know today is they want their job.

984
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,670
Well, that's all there is.

985
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,790
There's the job and there's the...

986
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:52,090
And the drudgery.

987
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,230
The life.

988
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:54,270
Well, sort of.

989
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,350
And the job.

990
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,310
Well, the job.

991
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:58,470
I'm not going to rock the boat.

992
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,430
I want the job.

993
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:02,290
Chaz, you told me you're not only going to rock the boat,

994
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:06,130
that you were going to rocket butt that boat right into another world.

995
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:07,070
Rocket butt that rocket boat.

996
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,270
I mean, I'm just...

997
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:09,250
You're getting wanted to go.

998
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,510
You're wanting to really climb on there and go to a world

999
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,870
where people actually think normal or something.

1000
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:14,570
I don't know.

1001
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:15,590
Yeah, definitely.

1002
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:19,990
It's becoming very important to build that rocket.

1003
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:20,810
To get off.

1004
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:21,130
To get off.

1005
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:21,710
To get off.

1006
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,130
It's becoming very, very, very important now.

1007
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:24,890
Yeah.

1008
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,590
I want to get off.

1009
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,030
I don't want to stick around here.

1010
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:31,310
Exactly.

1011
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:35,170
I just did buy a house in Cleveland.

1012
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:36,770
I'm building my own Amsterdam.

1013
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:40,970
Yeah, but you also built yourself a nice canal boat in your mind.

1014
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:41,510
You know?

1015
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,850
With the little hair and green thing in the front.

1016
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:44,330
You know?

1017
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:49,290
I'm also learning foreign languages.

1018
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,670
So that they'll let me...

1019
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:52,130
Go there.

1020
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:54,410
Are you learning Enochian babbling?

1021
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,210
Well, I've been living in my house for five years.

1022
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,770
And for five years, I've been installing...

1023
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:02,510
Each day, I dig out a little area in the foundation area.

1024
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,070
Trying to skate?

1025
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:06,450
And put in another composite rocket motor.

1026
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:13,070
So the house is about two-thirds now completely surrounded and strapped with rocket motors.

1027
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,430
So in another year or two.

1028
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:18,010
But the timing is so fiendishly important, dude.

1029
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:21,650
So devilishly tricky to get every rocket to go off.

1030
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:22,230
At once.

1031
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:23,190
You don't...

1032
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:26,730
What happens if half of them go off and the other half don't?

1033
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,210
Oh, you have a kind of...

1034
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,250
You've got a tilted house, dude.

1035
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:29,810
Really?

1036
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,610
The Mish Fire is just going to send that thing...

1037
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:32,630
Might end up in Arkansas.

1038
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,850
Well, you would hope it would end up in Arkansas.

1039
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:38,990
Well, I'm not in the middle of Lake Erie.

1040
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:39,690
It doesn't matter.

1041
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:44,570
As long as I reach seven miles per second in any direction, that'll be...

1042
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:45,570
Even down.

1043
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:46,870
I'll be able to get Earth orbit.

1044
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:51,090
Chaz, I'm afraid you don't want to go seven minutes per second in any...

1045
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,130
I mean, seven seconds...

1046
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:54,590
You know, that speed in all general directions,

1047
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:55,450
because that would be...

1048
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:58,990
You would be exploding up if you were, you know, not ahead of direction.

1049
00:46:59,090 --> 00:46:59,890
It can't happen here.

1050
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:03,310
It can't happen here.

1051
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,230
I've been checking it out for a while, baby.

1052
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:10,350
I'm telling you, my dear, that it can't happen here.

1053
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:13,250
Camtas!

1054
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:14,510
RFI!

1055
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:15,950
I've been checking it out.

1056
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:18,230
Checked it out a couple times.

1057
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:20,790
Yeah, it's happening.

1058
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:21,610
It's happening here right now.

1059
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:25,290
And as we watch the sun go down on our democratic freedoms,

1060
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:28,330
the freedoms that we've taken for granted for so long...

1061
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:29,470
Oh, no, but we still have all those freedoms.

1062
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:32,470
They're even more convenient than ever, as long as you...

1063
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:35,790
As long as you tow...

1064
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:36,690
...the line.

1065
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:41,470
...and left out in the back for three or four days until everything's nice and...

1066
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:44,390
As long as you want what they want, you can have anything you want.

1067
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:45,590
We want what they want.

1068
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,210
But I want what Bob wants.

1069
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,730
I want what we all want.

1070
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:53,110
I want a worldwide cataclysm.

1071
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:56,450
I want chocolate pudding delivered to me by aliens.

1072
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:02,810
And I want some female chocolate pudding delivered as frequently as possible.

1073
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,630
As the old salivary glands can move.

1074
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:05,990
Sometimes they...

1075
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,830
They don't move.

1076
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:11,770
Of course, that's not the first part of it.

1077
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,230
That's the end of it.

1078
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,190
The first part is much more laconic and obscure.

1079
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:17,070
I mean...

1080
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:20,350
Well, that's more artistic, you know, when you're obscure.

1081
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,490
And hard to understand.

1082
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,030
That's more artful.

1083
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:29,670
And, you know, Dave, if we were a little more artful, we'd probably be getting paid a little better.

1084
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:32,250
But instead, we're...

1085
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:33,970
You just...

1086
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:37,830
Low-grade showbiz clowns.

1087
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:41,570
We might as well be the guys that sweep up behind the elephants at the circus, you know?

1088
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:42,490
Well, we do that, too.

1089
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:45,970
The dwarfs with the little pooper scoopers.

1090
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,030
Well, we also do do that.

1091
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:48,610
Yeah.

1092
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,590
I mean, at least I've been going...

1093
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:51,050
I mean, back...

1094
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:51,350
I don't know.

1095
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,130
Some people think they're too good to work.

1096
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:57,650
But, you know, as long as I'm getting a paycheck, I don't mind what tumbles out of there.

1097
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:58,770
I've seen worse things.

1098
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,470
And I've picked up worse things.

1099
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:05,430
You've stuck your arm all the way up worse places than where that came from.

1100
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:06,670
Yes, that is true.

1101
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,630
I don't want to go into the grim details.

1102
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:12,790
You tried to get your head all the way up into worse places.

1103
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:13,390
But I...

1104
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:17,490
I was almost a microcephalic baby from that incident.

1105
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,650
And I was almost returned to my native...

1106
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:24,390
home in Canada and buried alive there for the whole incident.

1107
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:25,050
It was just...

1108
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,170
I don't want...

1109
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:27,510
I don't know.

1110
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,150
In London, it struck a compromise.

1111
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:33,950
That's in England, you know.

1112
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:36,650
Dodger Stadium, it struck out.

1113
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:38,910
In Munich, it struck first.

1114
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,630
Take your head down.

1115
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:49,970
Chaz is trying to bring back the fake rebellion of the 60s,

1116
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:50,330
which...

1117
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:54,470
Which, of course, was actually co-opted from the very beginning.

1118
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:55,230
Okay, you start.

1119
00:49:55,410 --> 00:50:01,330
The John Lennon glasses were trademarked before John Lennon was even born.

1120
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:04,170
For Jack Kerouac and Cassidy and all those guys.

1121
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:06,110
It was all planned out ahead of time.

1122
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:09,070
Were actually mind-controlled for quite some time.

1123
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,110
Yeah, but what good did it do?

1124
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:11,890
Not a damn thing.

1125
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:12,950
It was early in the morning.

1126
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,210
The energy was so, so weak.

1127
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:18,390
The poor people below could hardly stand to look up.

1128
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,370
Their necks were craning.

1129
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:20,310
But still, it looked...

1130
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:21,010
It looked like it was...

1131
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:21,830
Wait.

1132
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:22,810
This is...

1133
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:25,290
Dave, you're stuck in the 60s, man.

1134
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:26,250
No, man.

1135
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:26,950
I'm not stuck in the...

1136
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:27,590
Get with it, dude.

1137
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:28,730
It's the 90s.

1138
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:29,210
No, wait.

1139
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:30,570
I need reading glasses.

1140
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:30,930
It's the...

1141
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,150
The aughties or the zeros or the...

1142
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:34,710
Yeah, it's the new...

1143
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:35,630
It's the modern age.

1144
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:36,630
What is that feeling?

1145
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:37,770
It's contemporary.

1146
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:38,350
It's new.

1147
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:38,850
It's now.

1148
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:39,210
It's...

1149
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:45,110
Muscles rise up in your neck and the back of your brain tingles like there's a little teeny...

1150
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,510
A chameleon in the back of your neck.

1151
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:50,110
What is that feeling when your shoes drop?

1152
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:50,310
What is that feeling when your shoes drop?

1153
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:52,770
What is that feeling when your shoes drop off as you're walking down the street and they wave goodbye to you?

1154
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:54,150
What is that feeling?

1155
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:55,450
What is that feeling?

1156
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:01,150
What's that blue stain in your undies?

1157
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:05,250
Have you been keeping bad company again?

1158
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:09,470
Have you been hanging with those who hang too far?

1159
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:11,410
Yeah.

1160
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:12,490
Yesterday I bought a new car.

1161
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,890
Today I bought a new horn for it.

1162
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:15,830
Herb Alpert.

1163
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,470
You know, the sick thing is,

1164
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:20,290
Rowan and Martin's laugh-in was...

1165
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:22,950
It's actually kind of the hippest thing going at the time.

1166
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:25,090
I can hardly afford to buy my groceries.

1167
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:26,970
Oh, all of a sudden.

1168
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:29,430
Then...

1169
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:32,030
I put out all the lights and played Robert Goodway...

1170
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:32,750
No, said Bill.

1171
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:37,830
I've been standing here for three hours with my panties upside down and no one's noticed.

1172
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:45,970
Dean hopped up about convulsively, anxiously pulling on his arms.

1173
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,210
It made me wonder if the college boy had thanked him.

1174
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:50,270
Or what he was saying.

1175
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:53,430
I don't know what he was trying to do with all the strange, strange radio equipment.

1176
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,290
No, actually, it's in Idaho.

1177
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:56,870
Would you mind saying that again?

1178
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:58,130
Idaho?

1179
00:51:58,730 --> 00:51:59,830
That's frightfully interesting.

1180
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:00,730
We pronounce it Ohio.

1181
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:04,370
Oh, I've always wanted to make a cowboy.

1182
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:05,890
I mean, meet a cowboy.

1183
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,230
Really?

1184
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:08,450
Really?

1185
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:09,790
I yelled across the river.

1186
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:12,190
Well, you won't see me too for too...

1187
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:14,250
Yeah, there was a mist and men are tonight,

1188
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:17,410
and the streetlights didn't come on the freeway till Vine Street,

1189
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:20,190
and me and an old friend were talking about Allegheny,

1190
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,230
and pulling boats,

1191
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:24,390
and there was people hanging themselves down steps, I guess,

1192
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,310
but mostly good things.

1193
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:27,470
Good things.

1194
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:28,490
And hello, JD.

1195
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:29,250
Hello, Robbie.

1196
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,470
Hello, everyone.

1197
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:35,230
My parents say I don't know what good clean fun is.

1198
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:36,150
And they're right.

1199
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:37,590
I don't know what good it is.

1200
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:46,770
It's just a shame that polygamy never caught on among the married people of this country.

1201
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:48,870
They should make fun of polygamies.

1202
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:49,390
Polygamies?

1203
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:51,470
They can't help it if they're not told.

1204
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:00,110
Hey, how about that?

1205
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:02,650
Your name's in big lights up there on that marquee.

1206
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:03,250
So is mine.

1207
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:03,510
Yeah.

1208
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,330
This man was confused.

1209
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:11,070
He was pointing and asking questions, and I just couldn't answer what...

1210
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,510
I had no idea what he was talking about.

1211
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,030
We really learned the three R's.

1212
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:16,690
Reading, writing, and rhythm.

1213
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:18,610
Specifics?

1214
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:20,810
Barking and playing with ourselves.

1215
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:25,690
These are the new rules.

1216
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,910
This is the new regimen for a new human race.

1217
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:33,550
One that will not only conquer the stars, but conquer the bars.

1218
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:38,590
With the waiting thud of their own furry feet, they'll smash down every door,

1219
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:44,050
and you'll be behind it, standing there, guarding, standing tall for America.

1220
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:46,230
Really?

1221
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:46,830
Really.

1222
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:47,270
Man.

1223
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:49,950
That really moves me, Dave.

1224
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:51,590
I'm so glad that...

1225
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:52,790
It's just a tear gas.

1226
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,370
...you can't say such a sincere...

1227
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:56,610
Oh, man.

1228
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:59,030
It's the tear gas and the mind control, man.

1229
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,330
I don't know what I'm saying.

1230
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:01,190
I'm crying.

1231
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:03,470
Oh, man.

1232
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:03,710
I...

1233
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:04,590
Can you hear me?

1234
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:05,210
Get it together, man.

1235
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:05,990
It sounds like Mambo music.

1236
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,550
You're on the air.

1237
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:06,890
It's...

1238
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:07,190
Oh.

1239
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:07,630
Come on.

1240
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:08,210
Come on.

1241
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,750
None of this emotional baloney.

1242
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,530
Get it...

1243
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:12,010
Get your act together, man.

1244
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:12,310
Hey, guys.

1245
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:13,710
You know, I was wondering...

1246
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:18,670
The funny thing about doing a late night show like this and getting a lot of, you know, really...

1247
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:18,850
I'm not sure if I'm doing a good show or not.

1248
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:20,270
...out there callers.

1249
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:26,130
Last night, little Jimmy Spliff called three times and he was, you know, doing his own

1250
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,890
variety of rocket science.

1251
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:32,490
But here at the, you know, the Kingdom Dome, there's a lot of complaints.

1252
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:38,170
You know, we've had problems before, but we're going to hang in there as long as we can.

1253
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:43,110
I mean, as far as I'm concerned, the gallows have been built, so let's keep hanging.

1254
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:46,050
And nobody's going to...

1255
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,750
Nobody's going to talk about your shoes or say that...

1256
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:53,470
You know, you left the eggs in there too long or there's just, you know, some problem with you.

1257
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,510
You know, everyone's going to just be cool with that.

1258
00:54:56,850 --> 00:55:01,010
Hey, who were you hot for on the Laugh-In, Rowan and Martin Laugh-In show?

1259
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:02,590
I liked Goldie Hawn.

1260
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:02,910
Chaz.

1261
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:05,270
Yeah, I figured you'd be the Goldie Hawn.

1262
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:08,730
There was Judy Karn, which is a little cute English chick.

1263
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:09,430
Nah.

1264
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:10,570
Nah.

1265
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:11,750
I liked Joanne.

1266
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:12,970
Joanne Worley.

1267
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:13,750
Me too, man.

1268
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:15,150
I was really into...

1269
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,210
I understand.

1270
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:16,830
She was kind of...

1271
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:17,050
I understand.

1272
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:17,950
She was kind of large and...

1273
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:18,450
And...

1274
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:18,730
And...

1275
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:18,730


1276
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:18,730


1277
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:18,770
And...

1278
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:19,230
And...

1279
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:19,310
And...

1280
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:22,350
Kind of heavy-boned and loud and obnoxious.

1281
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:28,670
But that wide, wide, wide mouth just invoked...

1282
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:29,750
The Queen of Hearts look.

1283
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:31,130
You like that Queen of Hearts look?

1284
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:34,970
Off with their heads and referring to your structures down there?

1285
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:35,430
Yeah.

1286
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:36,650
I don't know what it is.

1287
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:37,410
I don't...

1288
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,410
I can't put the two and two together.

1289
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:41,050
Her laugh was just very infectious.

1290
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:42,590
There's no doubt about it.

1291
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:48,510
I wonder where she's at now and how large and old...

1292
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:52,310
And she's in the old actor's home in Pasadena, California.

1293
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:56,590
Sitting out in the backyard watching the Cupid pee in the pond.

1294
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:00,630
Yeah, she's had her last turkey sandwich for today, though.

1295
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,370
She's going back in sight for her meds.

1296
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:07,610
Does that little boy ever finish peeing?

1297
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:09,950
Or does he just be that forever?

1298
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,470
Hasta la semana próxima.

1299
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:13,490
Keep your back to the wind.

1300
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:15,030
Keep your hat tight.

1301
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:17,190
Keep sucking in saddle.

1302
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:17,450
Claro.

1303
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:20,850
Quedan tus cajones en el...

1304
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:21,850
...carcel.

1305
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:29,470
...barrio.

1306
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:39,610
Quedan cerdentio v sophomore.

1307
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:39,650
Don't even look as it'll hit him.

1308
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:39,650


1309
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:39,730


1310
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,110
... in this tent.

1311
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:40,130
... Veneto.

1312
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:40,130


1313
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:41,730
... Bel coming.

1314
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:41,730


1315
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:41,730


1316
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:42,510
... tell me what happened to her.

1317
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:42,610
... Demiフ lapsed and electrified from theeton.

1318
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:42,610


1319
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:42,610


1320
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:42,610


1321
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:42,750
Me ayу y

1322
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,030
... ayu y

1323
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,650
... Ihr

1324
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:46,650


1325
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:46,650


1326
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,610
... Life, be it.

1327
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:51,530
... Boo.

1328
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:58,430
Purple haze, all in my brain

1329
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:02,770
Little things just don't seem the same

1330
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:07,130
I'm acting funny, but I don't know why

1331
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:11,310
Excuse me while I kiss the sky

1332
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:17,770
Purple haze, all around

1333
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:22,310
Don't know if I'm going up or down

1334
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:26,390
Am I happy, am I in misery?

1335
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:30,990
Whatever it is, that girl put her smell on me

1336
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:39,050
Oh, purple baby, purple baby

1337
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,230
Purple haze

1338
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:11,870
Wine glass in the invisible coffin

1339
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:14,770
Held by snipers with ice slippers

1340
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:17,650
Oh, purple baby, purple baby

1341
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:17,750
Don't know if I'm going up or down

1342
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:17,750


1343
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:17,750


1344
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:17,750


1345
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:17,750


1346
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:17,750


1347
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:47,750
I'm acting funny, but I don't know why

1348
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:04,130
I'm acting funny, but I don't know why

1349
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:04,730
Alice is a light in my life

1350
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:15,090
Don't know if I'm going up or down

1351
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:16,950
kereta in the night

1352
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:21,890
There is no O in subgenius.

1353
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:23,370
Praise Bob.

1354
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:25,810
That does have an O.
