00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:08,240
Hello my friend, so happy to see you again.

2
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,680
What do you mean by that?

3
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,260
I'm trying to tell you, sir, that it is very possible

4
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,120
that a very elite, very illegal,

5
00:00:59,540 --> 00:00:59,980
and very powerful person,

6
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,040
and well-funded command of special agents

8
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,040
are operating as deep covers in this country

9
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,640
and around the world.

10
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,040
And they are operating with full termination powers.

11
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,380
There's a pack of wolves in the lion's den.

12
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,100
They're licking their chops and making their plans.

13
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,740
There's a flock of sheep on a nearby hill.

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,020
Ain't a knife they're going to make, they kill.

15
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,600
They're going to learn their lion's talk real smooth,

16
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,980
play the part of the rams and ewes,

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,440
dress like sheep so the flock receives them,

18
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,760
make those sweet little lambs believe them.

19
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,800
Because when the sun goes down and they'll

20
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,200
feed the hungry wolves with a scheme to keep,

21
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,520
they'll deceive the flock while the sheep doesn't sleep.

22
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,560
They'll pull the wool over the eyes of the sheep.

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,720
They'll pull the wool over the eyes of the sheep.

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,040
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:10,620
which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius power of the light.

26
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,060
Well, what does it mean?

27
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,740
Seems almost a message coming from space.

28
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,000
But behind this strange signal, there's an alien intelligence that knows all.

29
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,160
My efforts to expose them have been discovered,

30
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,340
so I, the hunter, become the hunted.

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
All my adult life through four presidents has been spent

32
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,360
in a twilight world of covert intelligence for my country.

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,820
We are the moles who cannot come in from the cold.

34
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,680
We call ourselves the 39 Steps, a fanciful code name.

35
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,520
Our assignment, neutralize the three pied pipers of rock music.

36
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,080
Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, and Jimi Hendrix.

37
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,740
Perhaps to bring them to午 you got our most梱

38
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:18,040
All yarn we need am intent is the

39
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,620
See you next time.

40
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,540
Good night, goodbye.

41
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,500
Ladies and gentlemen, last June 11th, five times this year,

42
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
God has shown me we're fixing to have a racial war.

43
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:48,120
The Ku Klux, the Skid Heads, the Black Panthers, the Malcolm X,

44
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,660
all of these gang leaders and gang kings in these cities

45
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,420
is fixing to start a war in this nation.

46
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,580
And it's going to be quick.

47
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,360
He showed me they'd be in 61 in this same revival.

48
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,100
He showed me three heads would rise up in this country,

49
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,720
and this country would be split three times.

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,720
This country is fixing to be divided.

51
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,980
This country is fixing to go down in war.

52
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,380
If you can't walk it.

53
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,160
Nothing through this racial war and violence,

54
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,060
then our nation was weakened.

55
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,200
Duh.

56
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,900
We was told pot.

57
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,580
And our enemy took advantage of our weakness.

58
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,200
Came in.

59
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,560
Then the wolves will eat them one by one

60
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,640
until the evil deed is done.

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,040
These grateful, cunning, wicked hearts

62
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,320
can't wait until it's time.

63
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,940
When the sun goes down

64
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,460
and the

65
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:53,780
sun goes down

66
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:53,800
they'll reap

67
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,940
on the wolves

68
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,100
with a scheme to keep.

69
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,180
They'll receive the prize

70
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,300
while the shepherds will see.

71
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,440
They'll pull the wool over the eye with a sheath.

72
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,840
They'll pull the wool over the eye with a sheath.

73
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,840
Everybody says sex is obscene.

74
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,060
The only true obsession is war.

75
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,260
I believe only in a god

76
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,600
when it's stood on a dance.

77
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,780
Isn't that something?

78
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,060
Ha!

79
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,260
Gosh...

80
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,920
Bobobopop Bob!

81
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,680
Bop.

82
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,360
Bob.

83
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,160
Bobobop Bob pop up.

84
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:31,560
Bob.

85
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:31,860
Bob.

86
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,120
Bobop.

87
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,780
They'll woo the wool over the eye of a sheath.

88
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,080
They'll woo the wool over the eye of a sheath.

89
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,220
Minnie.

90
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,580
They've got to woo the wool.

91
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,180
Oooh.

92
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,140
Amy.

93
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,860
هم

94
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:47,860


95
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,300
Sheep.

96
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,860
In 1 Corinthians 6, verse 9 and 10, it says,

97
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,100
Surely you know that the people who do wrong will not inherit God's kingdom.

98
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,600
Do not be fooled.

99
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,000
Those who sin sexually, worship idols, take part in adultery,

100
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,040
those who are male prostitutes or men who have sexual relations with other men,

101
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,380
those who steal or greedy, get drunk, lie about others, or rob,

102
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,300
these people will not inherit God's kingdom.

103
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,800
Some people just don't understand.

104
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,560
Well, look, find yourself first, and I'll take you too.

105
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,560
Find yourself first, don't you leave your food.

106
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,820
We're given this gift, don't you know, the ability to understand.

107
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,800
Yet no one wants to understand.

108
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,040
We're given the ability to read.

109
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,360
I mean, read Nietzsche, read Thomas Mann, read Spengler, Joyce, Rimbaud.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,960
Everything's out of whack.

111
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,040
People just worry about money now and deny their inner self.

112
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,480
Money, money, they walk through the night crowd,

113
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,160
protected by money, lulled by money, dulled by money.

114
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,040
No least single object anywhere that is not money.

115
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,240
Money, money everywhere, and still not enough.

116
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,880
And then no money, or little money, or less money, or more money.

117
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,740
But money, always money.

118
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,520
And if you have money or you don't have money, it's the money that counts.

119
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,460
And money makes money.

120
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,940
But what makes money make money?

121
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,560
I say, what the hell?

122
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,240
I gotta die into the world like the clowns.

123
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,060
Right, clowns?

124
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,280
Right.

125
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,100
Push!

126
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,840
I'm gonna die into the world like the clowns.

127
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,760
I'm gonna die into the world like the clowns.

128
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,620
I'm gonna die into the world like the clowns.

129
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:18,280
I looked and I saw a nuclear missile in New York City, in Manhattan.

130
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Oh, at least it was only one.

131
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,980
This time I seen the eyeball melted in the hole.

132
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,280
The flesh fell off the face.

133
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:31,640
I saw, it looked like five, ten million people in Manhattan killed by this bomb.

134
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,620
I mean, New York City was destroyed.

135
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,260
I saw Washington, D.C., a missile hit it.

136
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,980
It was destroyed.

137
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:47,840
Cincinnati, Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis.

138
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,040
I saw Atlanta, Georgia, the missile hit right at the...

139
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,640
I saw Atlanta, Georgia, the missile hit right at the...

140
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:53,640


141
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,540
It's a lot of missiles.

142
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,320
It's a lot of missiles.

143
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,540
And I saw the Lord just let me have an open view of Atlanta.

144
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:07,340
I seen Atlanta didn't have all the expressways then, but I saw Atlanta had all had expressways

145
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,480
leading out of the cities.

146
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:17,980
Every direction Atlanta had huge expressways, interstate, leading out of the city.

147
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,600
And I saw folks was trying to get out of Atlanta and ever toward Birmingham.

148
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,620
It was a lot of missiles.

149
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,360
I saw the

150
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:32,760
South, toward the North, toward the West, every expressway was jammed in the traffic.

151
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,320
But bumper to bumper and the radiation was catching up with them.

152
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,240
People got out of the cars and they started running.

153
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,880
And their legs had fallen off.

154
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,440
Whoa.

155
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,640
They had no legs.

156
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,120
Their heads and their tongues would consume away, and their bodies would just burn.

157
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,380
While he was running, I'd see him running with half the meat,

158
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,300
the face just running down.

159
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:04,360
The face would be as flame, running, running.

160
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,260
They was caught.

161
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,780
They was destroyed.

162
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,080
I saw it hit down the railroads in Birmingham, scrap metal and steel.

163
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,940
I seen heads.

164
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,200
I seen heads.

165
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,280
I seen New Orleans, Louisiana hit the railroads there,

166
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,860
and I seen human heads, arms and legs going through the air.

167
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,900
She ain't got no legs.

168
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
I saw it hit Houston.

169
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,780
Launch that head.

170
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,520
San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth, Tulsa, Oklahoma.

171
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,960
Yeah, I'm crazy.

172
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,800
As a busy bug about Jesus Christ my Lord.

173
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,860
He's the very best thing that's ever happened to this old country.

174
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,860
He's the very best thing that's ever happened to this old country.

175
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:48,860


176
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,600
You may not want to hear what God's got to say.

177
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,200
You may think I'm something else, but this thing's at hand.

178
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,680
This thing's at the door.

179
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,720
We're fixing to have that racial war that's going to weaken us.

180
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,220
This thing's at hand.

181
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,500
Give him your life and you'll be crazy about Jesus like me.

182
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,320
I'm crazy about Jesus like me.

183
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,400
Because the professional pornographers and smut dealers,

184
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:15,920
I'm crazy about Jesus like me.

185
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,360
They're always going to lie down and just give up.

186
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,880
They're going to test every law of the land.

187
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:27,780
They're going to find loopholes and ways and means to push the products that they want to push.

188
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,380
They're going to find loopholes and ways and means to push the products that they want to push.

189
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,040
You've heard it said that the pendulum swings from one extreme to the other.

190
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,120
Many people have been saying optimistically

191
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,060
that we've had all the nudity, filth and smut the nation can stand

192
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,500
and that the pendulum is about to swing the other way.

193
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,900
David Wilkerson says in his book, The Scientists Of��Squad,

194
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:45,900


195
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,880
that he wishes that were true but he fully believes from his vision that the flood of filth

196
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,020
that he's seen coming is the same kind of flood spoken of by the prophet Nahum.

197
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,640
And in Nahum 3, chapter 3, verses 5 and 6 it says, Nahum 3, verses 5 and 6 it says,

198
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,760
Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will discover thy skirts upon thy

199
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,980
face, and I will show the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame. And I will cast

200
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,760
abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and I will set thee as a gazing-stock.

201
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,720
That doesn't sound very good.

202
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:32,080
I feel so pure, so strong, so new, Henley. You and I together, not any man or woman together.

203
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,440
Henley, I'm going to demand everything of you, even the impossible.

204
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,640
Because you encourage it. Maybe I should get down on my knees and worship you.

205
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:58,620
I'm going to undress you, vulgarize you a bit, lift up your dress.

206
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,740
No, Henley, not here.

207
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,480
I'll teach you things, humiliate you a little,

208
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,140
wrap your leg around me.

209
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,120
Ah, hmm, remarkable.

210
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,180
Reagan's Pollock.

211
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,440
I like to talk the way to say all janitors about pleasure.

212
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:47,320
Any woman in a brown uniform vacuuming a supply closet deserves to hear of how I take my pleasure.

213
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,520
I use products exclusively designed at the Colorado-Little-Town Institute of Technology for clean-activity.

214
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,600
Manufacturing personal devices of unspeakable filth since 1951.

215
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,540
My favorite product is this.

216
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,140
The corn annulator.

217
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,420
It gives clean-activity.

218
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,400
It has a literal meaning to the phrase, tear yourself anew.

219
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,300
I have already installed four new orifices in my body so that I may intervene so that the six creatures at once,

220
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,700
transfixing my body with old men of delicious sensations emanating from the depths of my brain,

221
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,940
is a source of pride.

222
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,600
Pleasure is so important.

223
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,600
Pleasure is so important.

224
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:46,800
And as if any human would come up to ground or arrest a crying pilot,

225
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:46,860
its chase avoid Comedy Carrot Lag will never beanten before.

226
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,160
Ken Duncan.

227
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,160


228
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,160


229
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:53,560
pen outels know it.

230
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:53,560


231
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:53,560


232
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:53,560


233
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:53,560


234
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:53,560


235
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,820
Judas плохо jeerninged at Eb maravilest Hubert Dumbledore's

236
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,240
the killer's fall cookingcedes.

237
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,400
Other manufacturers have MarKorean Wal entrance stamp- enemity for The Stranger nos Beat.

238
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,080
Thank you.

239
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,920
At first it was the Quintet.

240
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:02,920


241
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,500
Where better punter at chuck youuring rhoven porch.

242
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,420
Sure.

243
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:06,460


244
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,100
Guard duty.

245
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,400
sources Ul versus a pronounced general jury.

246
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,200
This is what the Lord has showed David,

247
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,140
was there to be a temporary setback for smut.

248
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,460
But again, the Bible seems to indicate in the last days

249
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,100
that the hearts and intentions of men are towards evil,

250
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,420
and they love pleasure more than they love God.

251
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,860
So things are going to continue to deteriorate.

252
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,060
So in page 50 in the book On the Vision by David Wilkerson,

253
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,920
he talks about the sin of Solomon is coming.

254
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,960
It's coming, it's coming, it's coming.

255
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,060
Oh, I feel so much better having done that.

256
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,980
Well, we will dip back into some slack in a moment here

257
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,840
after we've all kind of rearranged our clothing and that kind of stuff

258
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,600
and kind of popped over the waves in the background.

259
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,800
I'm kind of inundated with slack myself.

260
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,720
I feel it.

261
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,920
Oozing and flowing through my body.

262
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,800
I feel like a sponge, and I haven't really absorbed enough yet

263
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,860
to have a real good night.

264
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,740
And I'm kind of wondering if folks out there are soaking it up or what.

265
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,820
Are they saturated?

266
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,080
Well, I know that water in your ear isn't usually really good,

267
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,660
but if you lie down and let it run out, it's kind of a pleasurable sensation.

268
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,900
Yeah, almost like the trickle-down theory, but it really, really works.

269
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,600
Right.

270
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,500
So trickle-out theory, perhaps.

271
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,940
But one of the things that the Lord showed David Wilkerson is that

272
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,600
the sins of Sodom will be repeated again in our generation.

273
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,400
And, of course, the homosexual attacks by the Sodomite mobs

274
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,980
trying to molest innocent people.

275
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,120
If you go back into the book of Genesis and remember Abraham and Lot,

276
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,020
their relationship and how Lot lived in the city.

277
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,140
And one day the angels came to visit Lot,

278
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,600
and the men of the city pounded him, tried to knock down the door of his home,

279
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,720
trying to get in there and have relations with the angels.

280
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,920
And, of course, that's one of the major reasons.

281
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:03,920


282
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:08,820
The reason that God destroyed those two cities was because of their sins.

283
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,940
But the Lord has shown him that during our day and time

284
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,880
that there will be wild, roving mobs of homosexual men

285
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,800
that will publicly assault innocent people in parks and on the streets.

286
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,560
And, again, you know, when this was written back in the early 1970s,

287
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,980
that sounded pretty far-fetched.

288
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,580
Who would ever believe that things could degenerate to that point in America?

289
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,560
Right.

290
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:33,920
Right.

291
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


292
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


293
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


294
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


295
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


296
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


297
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


298
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


299
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


300
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


301
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


302
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


303
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


304
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


305
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


306
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


307
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


308
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


309
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


310
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


311
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,700
And, again, as we look at what's going on in the national scene and the news

312
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,620
and radio and newspapers, this is not as far-fetched as it once seemed.

313
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,800
And, again, I believe that this is something the Lord showed David Wilkerson

314
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,380
that's going to happen, and we can see how it can be.

315
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,480
The groundwork is being laid for that.

316
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,540
Laid for that.

317
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,080
Laid for that.

318
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,320
Laid for that.

319
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,720
Laid for that.

320
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,040
Laid for that.

321
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,820
Now we're going to do a song for you, and it's called

322
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,740
Split Level Love Crime in Space.

323
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:00,960
Let's go.

324
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:01,860
Let's go.

325
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:02,860
Let's go.

326
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:03,920
Let's go.

327
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:03,920


328
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:03,920


329
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:03,920


330
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:03,920


331
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:03,920


332
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:03,920


333
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:03,920


334
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:03,920


335
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,540
Let's go.

336
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,880
Let's go.

337
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,020
Let's go.

338
00:18:54,260 --> 00:19:03,380
Let's go.

339
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:31,740
And there they were

340
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,880
They were all about me

341
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,300
Large, surely moving salesmen

342
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
And mammoth middle managers

343
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,720
Corn-fed, beef-fed, farm-bred monuments to metabolism

344
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,940
Flying from dairy states to beef capitals to commodity centers

345
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,520
From Fond du Lac to Dubuque

346
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,280
Their huge briefcases stuffed with meat

347
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,220
Clinching beefy deals with muscular handshakes

348
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,880
Their faces were florid mountain rushmars

349
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,720
With aviators

350
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,540
Spectacles and sidebirds uniformly metallic

351
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,180
Their eyes, bovine, the size of Dutch plates

352
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,840
Reflected their low country ancestries

353
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,940
Their hands were steam shovels

354
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,060
Their shoes, big as our tiny neurotic New York family car

355
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,200
I'm not talking fat, although flesh is essential in Chicago

356
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,680
I'm talking big-boned, as the apologists say

357
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,720
I, a tiny under-Northic

358
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,200
New York warrior, had been injected into the enlarged heart of America

359
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,020
Airports like abattoirs are white

360
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,200
All this moving meat

361
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,200
These great bodies laughing, phoning, making valuable contacts

362
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,900
Astonished me

363
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,780
I was overwhelmed by the size of everything and everybody

364
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,200
Their huge bigness

365
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,860
I had to sit down

366
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:57,980
But where?

367
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,780
Everything I said engulfed, engulfed, engulfed!

368
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:00,780


369
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,720
I had to sit down, but where? Everything I said engulfed, engulfed, engulfed!

370
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,620
I was a baby opossum

371
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,760
Writhing in a tablespoon in a golden nature guide

372
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,380
I felt fear, tininess, and hunger

373
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:16,260
I decided the only way to become as big as the big people was to begin eating

374
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,020
In the Infinite Coffee Shop

375
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,540
My eyes struggled to take in the polyptych menu with its thousand offerings

376
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,460
Eggs with legs

377
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,560
Friendly forks and spoons marched across it

378
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:29,880
Good morning!

379
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,340
Barnyard suggestions!

380
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,620
What? I thought

381
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,120
Wanna meet this chicken in the hayloft in half an hour, fella?

382
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,700
But these were not that kind of barnyard suggestions

383
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,280
Here in big people land

384
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,280
Land to lots of wholesomeness

385
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,740
They were suggesting I eat the following

386
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,060
One

387
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,720
Three strips of bacon

388
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,940
Two pancakes

389
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,500
Two eggs, any style

390
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,660
Two sausages

391
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,340
Juice, toast, and coffee

392
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,660
Two

393
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,640
Six strips of bacon

394
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,040
Five pancakes

395
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,840
Four eggs, any style

396
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,120
Three sausages, juice, toast, and coffee

397
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,960
Or three

398
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,180
Twelve strips of bacon

399
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,580
Nine pancakes

400
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,540
Seven eggs, any style

401
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,680
One and a half gallons of juice

402
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,300
Three pounds of toast

403
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,640
And a bottomless pit

404
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,600
Which I took to be a typographical error for pot

405
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,740
Of coffee

406
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,140
Thus emptying any barnyard I could imagine of all life

407
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,580
Again, I was lost

408
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:29,860
I was lost

409
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,860


410
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,860


411
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,860


412
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,860


413
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,860


414
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,860


415
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,860


416
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,860


417
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,860


418
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,860


419
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,860


420
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,860


421
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,860


422
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,860


423
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:29,860


424
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,200
I felt I was visiting Karnak

425
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,900
I pleaded for half an order of toast

426
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,080
Eight pieces

427
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,960
Outside the window

428
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,220
Far away

429
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,960
Chicago was dawning

430
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,100
Obsidian towers

431
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,080
An art deco pipe organ

432
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,860
Sprouting from the gold prairie

433
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,000
Lake Michigan still dark beyond

434
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,960
A brachycephalic woman was seated opposite me

435
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,180
Biting big things

436
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,940
Her teeth were the size of horse teeth

437
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,640
She said we could see into the next state

438
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,360
She was eating such big things

439
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,440
And so quickly a wind was blowing at our table

440
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,480
I turned from this and peered out through the clean air

441
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,680
Into the next state

442
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,820
In the far distance I saw great shapes

443
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,340
Which I knew weren't mountains

444
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,660
But my giant Midwestern relatives

445
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,400
I am too small ever to visit

446
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,220
Now I was filled with huge toast

447
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,640
I crawled minuscule back through the tubes to the gate

448
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,220
I bought a newspaper

449
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,260
And my money looked puny and foreign

450
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,800
In the vendor's big paw

451
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,380
In the chairs of big people land

452
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,360
My feet never touched the floor

453
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,820
I began to open the Sun Times

454
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,520
But it was big

455
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,280
Here it wasn't even Sunday

456
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,080
And I was suddenly engaged in a desperate battle

457
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,260
With what seemed to be a colossal duvet

458
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,060
A mural made of incredibly stiff paper

459
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,020
It unfolded and unfolded

460
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,860
It was a whale passing by

461
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,380
It covered me and all my possessions

462
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,880
It surged over the pillar ashtray

463
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,640
And began to creep like fog over the gentleman next to me

464
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,860
Help, I said

465
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,880
Excuse me, what's your paper there?

466
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,600
He said

467
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,220
His tongue was the size of my dog

468
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,040
I was exhausted

469
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,340
I could do nothing but wait for my plane to be announced

470
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,120
I watched the big people

471
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,680
What is it like to move about the world

472
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,080
To travel free of the fears of the tiny

473
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,600
The fear of being crushed by all the big things

474
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,120
Big people make and use

475
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,100
Not just newspapers and barnyard suggestions and airplanes

476
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,900
But their big companies and their eternal truths

477
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,840
And the endless statistics of baseball

478
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,480
The airport was hugely hot with big people warmth

479
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,740
Warmth from the roaring heaters of their big roaring cars

480
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,360
From the blazing campfires of their substantial vacations

481
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,720
And I thought

482
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,660
Perhaps a few of these big people were glistening

483
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,200
And glowing not only from tremendous breakfasts

484
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
And the excitement and reward of business

485
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,700
But from their still warm, still tousled beds of large love

486
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,900
Now if you read the ancient Sumerian mythology on the same topic

487
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,360
You'll find that not to be the case at all

488
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,140
That the story ends up in a totally different way

489
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,180
I know, it's by the time it got to the Babylonians

490
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,380
From the Sumerians

491
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,080
It's totally bastardized

492
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,340
Like a black dog with a white streak on its forehead

493
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,640
And all of a sudden there's like, yeah I know

494
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,600
The dog with the eyeball and everything

495
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,520
All of a sudden, you know

496
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,920
Yeah, and then everybody's all of a sudden

497
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,800
They're worshipping three dollar bills

498
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,040
And George Wallace and Peanut Man

499
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,240
We need to get back to worshipping the bulls

500
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,400
That's right, the bulls

501
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,320
The bull of Mithras is what we need to worship

502
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:40,760
Bull cult

503
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,020
We need to fall down on our hands and feet

504
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,040
And gather around in a warm little circle

505
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,200
So our buttocks all touch

506
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,220
Very just lightly enough

507
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,440
We need to start putting our doors on our roofs again too

508
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,780
Yeah, what the hell

509
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,600
Because not only does that

510
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,860
Because that keeps the wild animals out

511
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,220
And it keeps the sunlight in

512
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,400
And just think of it

513
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,520
At any grand moment

514
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,140
You could have a grand mal seizure

515
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,300
And just open your roof door

516
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,660
And take a flying leap

517
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,780
And end up you know where

518
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,380
That's right

519
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:04,740
Yep

520
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,680
Out of this place in the denotations

521
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,220
Your little garden out there and everything

522
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,660
Yep

523
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,020
Your little, your little

524
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,260
Your old peyote garden

525
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:11,520
Defeat garden

526
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,880
Peyote garden

527
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,380
Yep

528
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,500
That's all I want is a peyote garden

529
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,240
That's all I want is a couple rocks with my little peyote garden

530
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,160
And a little, a little blue statuette

531
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,000
A little rock garden

532
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,520
Yep

533
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,460
A little rock got to go with it

534
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,440
Remember Taz

535
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,280
Always remove the fuzzy stuff

536
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,920
Off of your little peyote gardens

537
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,460
Yeah

538
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,660
Because if not

539
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,320
You may be saying

540
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,700
Yeah it's like you know

541
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,880
Natural cyanide or something

542
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,220
Yeah

543
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,680
FCCIA-nide

544
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,120
Yeah

545
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,760
So make sure you

546
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,220
Make sure you pull the fuzzy stuff

547
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:38,620
Yeah

548
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,960
Because you could be in for some bad transmissions

549
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:41,940
Yeah

550
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,700
Phew

551
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,200
We know about them don't we

552
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,500
Yeah

553
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,480
I remember that one time

554
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,860
We've been having bad transmissions for five or six years

555
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,100
Yep

556
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,500
Yep

557
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,400
It's going on big

558
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,660
Well 12 years now

559
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,440
It's going on 12 years

560
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,220
We've been transmitting

561
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,440
We've been ejaculating poorly

562
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,080
Yeah

563
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
And I always knew

564
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,680
And I always knew somehow

565
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,020
Into the Cleveland

566
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,760
It could lead to this

567
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,280
Yep

568
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
You leaving

569
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,420
And me too

570
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,320
Leave to this

571
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:02,640
Yep

572
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,320
We put our nothing into this town

573
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,300
And what did it get us

574
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,620
A large rawhide belt around both of his shiny testicles

575
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,980
So that what might happen

576
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,400
What

577
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,380
Well in a few years he might be evacuated of all his emotional problems by simply not

578
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:18,640
caring

579
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,280
Because you know the vets used to say out there in the wilderness you just tie a rubber

580
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,080
band around your forehead and your brain just it kind of dries up and goes away

581
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,600
That's how we give our

582
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,140
Far away

583
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,960
Far away

584
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,980
Far far away station

585
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,280
Far far far far far far far

586
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,420
What

587
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,180
What

588
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,680
What

589
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,000
I didn't say that

590
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,540
I didn't I didn't think you said it I I was just kind of inquiring if somebody else was

591
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:45,760
here

592
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,280
Johnny

593
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,060
Johnny's here

594
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,740
Johnny Trudeau

595
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,560
Johnny

596
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,880
Johnny

597
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,480
Johnny

598
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,380
Johnny

599
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,260
Johnny

600
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,260


601
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,260


602
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,520
I dreamed I was in our Park

603
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,560
With real bad breath

604
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,060
Red breath

605
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,160
I dreamed I had

606
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,480
A belly full of BB gun 에

607
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:08,680
beside

608
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,280
And I played possum

609
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,320
With possum gravy

610
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,360
And a lizard stands still

611
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,780
At the Army Navy Store

612
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,960
Oh roll on buddy

613
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,240
Oh roll on buddy

614
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,640
Don't you roll so slow

615
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,380
Got your hangnails

616
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,620
Back in Kokomo roll

617
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,720
Soldered some Eskimo pies

618
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,200
Onto my neck

619
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,120
There you go

620
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,140
Drink a little drinky

621
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,180
And slobber like heck

622
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,780
Come on, everybody sing along.

623
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:01,800
Oh, yes, that was a little snip there

624
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,720
from Brain Rot Radio Theater

625
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,640
originally broadcast at WCSB in Cleveland.

626
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,040
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Charles, or Chaz.

627
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,320
Yes, Chaz, the Chasm Smith.

628
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,380
Before that, Reverend Gobi

629
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,300
talking about big people land.

630
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,240
She's the girl who said,

631
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,920
His tongue was the size of my dog.

632
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,080
And the music, the hate-filled,

633
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,620
the hateful music that we've heard on and off

634
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,700
is by Reagan's Polyp.

635
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,500
That's a band that Pope Sternodox is involved with

636
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,680
up in Little Rock, Arkansas.

637
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,000
There'll be some more Reagan's Polyp

638
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,920
coming up in more ways than one, no doubt.

639
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,300
Oh!

640
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,660
And you heard a little bit of

641
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,400
Reverend Velveteen Sly

642
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,140
and her psychoacoustic show,

643
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,520
but most of it has been a subgenius edit

644
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,380
by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang of

645
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,240
just some things we happen to catch on tape

646
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,120
here and there.

647
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,100
The great Reverend David Terrell

648
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,680
preaching and some anti-sex league material

649
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,400
from one of those rival cults.

650
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,780
I don't know which one.

651
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,280
I don't know.

652
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:20,780
I don't know.

653
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,600
I don't know.

654
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,080
I'm too full of hate this show, friends,

655
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,280
to talk very much.

656
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,840
You really, even you don't want to hear.

657
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,420
You really don't want to hear it.

658
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,420
That part of it is that I'm sick and tired

659
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:39,080
of hearing about rumors that Bobbies say

660
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,720
about the church, you know, on internet

661
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,080
and, I don't know, their little gossips to each other.

662
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,240
I don't care if they talk about doctrine

663
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,280
and their personal foolishness.

664
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:51,460
I don't care if they talk about the foolish

665
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,860
interpretation of doctrine.

666
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,120
That's no problem.

667
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,520
It's when they start telling stories about us personally.

668
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,320
God, somebody said, my friend told me that the new book

669
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,400
of the subgenius is going to be gender free.

670
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,440
I think that's, it was a letter from a woman.

671
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,660
She said, I think that's terrible.

672
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,900
I have the right to be a sexist if I want to.

673
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,140
We're going, yeah, yeah, you're right.

674
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:14,980
Gender free.

675
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,820
Yeah, now wait a minute.

676
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,540
Which church did you think this was?

677
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,280
There are sections that are perhaps, you know,

678
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,280


679
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,500
perhaps what you might call gender free for a good reason.

680
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,560
But then wait until you get to the Connie chapter

681
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,580
or the chapter on the sex.

682
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,700
Sounds just like this.

683
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,100
Epidemic, a homosexual epidemic.

684
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,760
It talks about a homosexual epidemic.

685
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,880
David says that there's only two forces that hold back

686
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,440
the homosexuals from completely giving themselves over

687
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,120
to their sin.

688
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,380
One is rejection by society, and two is the opposition

689
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,400
by the church.

690
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,260
So again, these two areas are coming together.

691
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,120
One under major attacks by the pro-homosexual forces,

692
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,560
trying to have laws passed, recognizing them as a minority,

693
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,900
acceptance into the military, so forth and so on,

694
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,660
trying to force acceptance by society.

695
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,560
Then the other area that they're attacking is in the church.

696
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,700
And of course, many liberal church people are coming down

697
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,120
the side of the homosexuals saying there's nothing wrong with it.

698
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:17,260
So as these two forces are being attacked and worn away,

699
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,180
then the homosexuals are coming more and more to the forefront.

700
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,120
And of course, David goes on to say on page 51,

701
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,460
he says, when society no longer rejects their sin as abnormal

702
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,280
and fully accepts them and encourages them in their abnormality,

703
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,480
when the church no longer preaches against it as sin,

704
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,500
then there is no longer any hindrance to the homosexual forces.

705
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,720
The floodgates are open.

706
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,060
And David says in the middle of page 51, he says,

707
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,540
I have seen in this vision that these two roadblocks are being swept away.

708
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,260
And he says,

709
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,480
so again, we see that, you know, 20 years ago, that was unthinkable.

710
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,120
But today in 1993, we can see that the floodgates are being opened

711
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,360
and this sin is becoming rampant upon our society.

712
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,360
And again, we have to understand that as Sodom and Gomorrah were judged

713
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,560
and destroyed, that unless America repents, unless the church wakes up,

714
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,800
unless we become salt to our society,

715
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:16,720
a dangerous period of time is coming upon this generation in America

716
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,600
and for our families.

717
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,340
And in the entry of these readings and the

718
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:30,800
mal conferring of Shalom on the deception of God,

719
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,960
welcome to the New Testimony of the New Testament.

720
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:37,020
Let us rise with a sound of prayer and Hoy!

721
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,420
Hum zi shem.

722
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,720
Al Adonai Greek.

723
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,160
Dar Hir Sechen family!...

724
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,220
¶¶

725
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,840
¶¶

726
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,500
¶¶

727
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,580
¶¶

728
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,460
¶¶

729
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,440
I saw this nation during this time was disarmed.

730
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:21,220
¶¶

731
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,340
How many of you have heard my vision of a nation disarmed?

732
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,000
That disarming us now, all this is a propaganda.

733
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,280
This nation is making a mistake.

734
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,100
This nation is making a big mistake.

735
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,820
Our past president and this president,

736
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,680
I saw them cutting our defense, they disarmed us.

737
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,520
I saw all these army bases closed.

738
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,200
Then, not now, but then, I prophesied.

739
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,640
At that time, we were building arms.

740
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,340
We were building our army.

741
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,580
We were building defense.

742
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,400
But because our president breathed in a strong defense,

743
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,880
I was prophesied.

744
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,680
We were disarming this nation.

745
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,880
It's happening now.

746
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,240
Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday,

747
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,440
I heard, I saw a vision yesterday morning.

748
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,700
You get my tape last night.

749
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,280
You get this vision.

750
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,900
I saw a vision yesterday morning.

751
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,140
I heard a voice said the voice of the prophet

752
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,100
will be heard no more at all in her tongue about America.

753
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:23,180
The voice of the handmaid and the voice of the servant

754
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,880
will be heard no more at all in her.

755
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,240
Said the day of her desolation is at the door.

756
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,000
Said America is fallen.

757
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,200
America's fallen.

758
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,340
That's all the time we have today for Evangelist David Terrell.

759
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,180
We destroyed and we created the universe

760
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,680
and you didn't even know it was happening.

761
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,680
We did it while you slept.

762
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,280
You thought you were safe.

763
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,780
You thought you were in the 21st century.

764
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,480
Or maybe 20th.

765
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,180
But you were wrong.

766
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,000
We brought you all the way back to the Paleolithic times.

767
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,180
To cavemen.

768
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,800
To fire.

769
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,340
And water.

770
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,960
And dinosaurs.

771
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,040
And lots and lots of...

772
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,580
...paleo.

773
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,080
...paleo.

774
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,080


775
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,080


776
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,080


777
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,080


778
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,080


779
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,080


780
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,080


781
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,080


782
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,080


783
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,080


784
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,080


785
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,080


786
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,080


787
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,760
Blood.

788
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,080
Volcanoes.

789
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,360
And destruction.

790
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,940
Not on some other planet.

791
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:26,660
No.

792
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,720
Not in outer space.

793
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,320
No.

794
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,260
We rocketed far away and came right back.

795
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:39,200
But landed a long, long time ago.

796
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:44,440
It was so long ago before anything was ever here.

797
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,860
Before anything existed.

798
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,080
We destroyed everything.

799
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:54,820
In 20 minutes we destroyed everything that had ever been placed on this planet.

800
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,560
And in a couple of hours we brought it back.

801
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,180
It was hard.

802
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,640
Oh, it was very hard.

803
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,940
We had to learn the alphabet over again.

804
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,920
We had to learn colors, numbers.

805
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,700
We had to learn what were the basic needs of humans.

806
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,980
We didn't even know what the hell a human was.

807
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,560
All we knew is that we were alive.

808
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,740
Thank God.

809
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,300
Or thank the goddess.

810
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,820
We weren't even sure what existed anymore.

811
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,320
Now, like I said, I didn't do this all by myself.

812
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,320
I had some help.

813
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,580
I had some help from my friend.

814
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,280
And here's a little message that he left for you.

815
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,480
Gobi, this is Commander Bleepo.

816
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:46,960
What?

817
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:46,960


818
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,200
We just changed big time.

819
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,200


820
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,380
As we return from our mission together I think it's important that we point out a few facts.

821
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,440
Having defeated the forces that we defeated, it's important that we bear in mind

822
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,580
and go back to what the Colossal Stone made a Only option.

823
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,680
wir brauchen

824
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:16,900
I want you to always remember that Slack is the most important thing outside of life,

825
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:16,960
everything changes fundamentally.

826
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:16,960


827
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:16,960


828
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:23,160

835
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,500
strange bacterias in his nostrils may prove harmful to our alien but it is

836

841
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,760
they could drive in their condition they'd be here now okay well I guess

842
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,680
we'll have to go to them well I don't know if we can do that because according

843
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,340
to Federal Communications Commission regulations we have to stay here

844
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:38,040
broadcasting our show he's right you know under paragraph 26 sub paragraph 5

845
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,560
clause 3 and the sentence number 1 it clearly states that under paragraph 26

846
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:43,560


847
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:50,220
this is that sort of law and the conditions are the same as that of North

848
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:50,240
America or West D. C

849
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:50,240


850
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,800
energences stem from super4 chips are two cases where they dry up 협

853
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,120
On the scope.

854
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,400
Let's go.

855
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,080
Follow us over there.

856
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,460
To this very historic site.

857
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,120
Fire a signal rocket.

858
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,500
There's Moses 1 being launched from the pod bay.

859
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,060
Now, Moses 1, Moses 1, this is Jesus.

860
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,360
All out of formation.

861
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,520
The light hand of Jesus on the bow.

862
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,040
Jesus, you've turned off your targeting computer.

863
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,720
And Moses from the ground inspires.

864
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:32,480
There we go.

865
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,620
We have commie dogs on the scope.

866
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,680
Commie dogs?

867
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,440
Yeah.

868
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,560
Fire commie dogs.

869
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,860
Carson, you will die the death of a flaming underwater torch.

870
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,600
You will die the death of a thousand screams.

871
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,240
Get that fly away from me.

872
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:50,820
A perking target.

873
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,420
Stay on target.

874
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,060
I said the fly let us fly.

875
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,180
I said the fly let us flee.

876
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,320
So they flew to the front.

877
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,760
My God.

878
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,100
They must have been carrying pamphlets.

879
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,200
Heaven, a picture of fulfilled desire.

880
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,540
And heaven.

881
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,280
The headline scream.

882
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,420
A picture of a soul unfound.

883
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,480
Death of 3,000 innocent men, women, children, and pets.

884
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,700
Oh, who cares about them?

885
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:21,940
The strange hypnotic power of the submittal's mind over matter.

886
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,620
Who cares about those little cults?

887
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:29,140
You're speaking of the Boston white fly epidemic, which is now a so far ancient history that no one cares.

888
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,660
The targeting computer is now buzzing.

889
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,580
That's all we need.

890
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,500
All I saw was heavens drop.

891
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,080
3-9-6.

892
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,580
Targeting from the side.

893
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,540
Using the side looking radar.

894
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:46,620
Sir, I'm afraid if we can't stop the targeting computer from malfunctioning, the automatic self-destruct may activate itself.

895
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,060
Boy, I hear that.

896
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,720
I'm ready to implode myself.

897
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,040
I'm coming down and coming down hard.

898
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,320
Don't you have any rocket fuel to help me out?

899
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:55,600
Over.

900
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,520
Your attention, please.

901
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,380
The auto self-destruct mechanism has been activated.

902
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,320
Looks like a direct hit right on the message center.

903
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,560
We now have 30 seconds till auto self-destruct.

904
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,360
Oh, Papa Joe Mono.

905
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,440
Papa Joe Mono alert.

906
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,640
Unfortunately, this message is 30 seconds late.

907
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:13,920
27.

908
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,540
25.

909
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,660
That was a good year.

910
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,500
23.

911
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:21,740
21.

912
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,440
We hide from the light.

913
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,920
You now have 18 seconds till auto self-destruct.

914
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,940
Now all I need is one second in my duel with you, sir.

915
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:33,800
15.

916
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,960
He's determined to count down to the ultimate doom.

917

1003
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,220
Также,

1004
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,640
archaeology

1005
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,780
talk show and see all kinds of strange perversion being talked about and spread and there are people

1006
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:16,200
being sympathetic to their their strange views but again these are things the lord has showed

1007
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:23,000
david is coming to pass and we need to wake up and no longer be lukewarm now again we invite you if

1008
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:23,800
you have a um

1009
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,080
i'm pumping a hot steel hog and roaring rapids of revenge

1010
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,320
uh

1011
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,240
ah

1012
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:03,860
ah

1013
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,260
ah

1014
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:07,600
ah

1015
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,000
ah

1016
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,460
uh

1017
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,380
ah

1018
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:16,580
ah

1019
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:16,580


1020
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:16,580


1021
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:16,580


1022
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:16,580


1023
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:16,580


1024
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:16,580


1025
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:16,580


1026
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:16,580


1027
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:16,580


1028
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,280
Yes, the birth of the universe.

1029
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,760
Maybe it was just our solar system.

1030
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,560
We didn't know.

1031
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,740
All we knew is that everything was gone

1032
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,240
and that we had just...

1033
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,200
The place was demolished.

1034
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,920
There was no house left.

1035
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,180
There were smoldering ashes,

1036
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,540
bits of twisted, disintegrated metal,

1037
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:55,080
dead bodies, bones, piles of flesh everywhere.

1038
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,540
We didn't know whose flesh it was.

1039
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,400
We didn't know who we had killed.

1040
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,680
We just knew we had killed them.

1041
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,880
And we couldn't put the magic together.

1042
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,200
We didn't have the tools.

1043
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,620
We didn't even know what the alphabet was then.

1044
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:14,940
We had to create and give rebirth to the universe.

1045
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,580
Just the two of us.

1046
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,180
It was the hardest thing.

1047
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:27,500
Because we were dealing with such evil forces.

1048
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,200
Oh, such evil things.

1049
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,400
They were coming.

1050
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,000
Or they had already arrived.

1051
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:42,480
Or maybe they were there before we even got there.

1052
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:47,140
And they just slowly drew off of our energy

1053
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:47,780
and...

1054
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,380
pulled themselves

1055
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:51,240
up,

1056
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,720
out of the atoms of the floor,

1057
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,940
out of the atoms, molecules in the air,

1058
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,160
from the dog,

1059
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,280
drawing energy

1060
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,200
off of every carbon-based thing.

1061
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,980
Because that's what it was based on.

1062
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:08,880
It was based on carbon.

1063
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,860
They wanted our carbon.

1064
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,760
That's what life is.

1065
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,660
We had to keep on reminding ourselves.

1066
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,400
That's what life was.

1067
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,880
Life is based on carbon.

1068
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,500
Carbon.

1069
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,420
Ashes.

1070
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,000
Volcanoes.

1071
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,060
Oh, and those volcanoes were fierce.

1072
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,440
But we battled them.

1073
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:35,880
We did.

1074
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,460
We had a little help from these little devil people.

1075
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,840
Little devil dogs, actually.

1076
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,380
They had these little dogs.

1077
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:47,380


1078
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,960
They had pointy ears and these eyes.

1079
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,080
They glowed red.

1080
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,460
It was the strangest thing.

1081
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,360
But they helped us.

1082
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,960
They saved us from the volcanoes.

1083
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,200
Yes.

1084
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,680
They're our friends.

1085
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,940
We sure like those devil dogs.

1086
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:00,280
Don't we?

1087
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:01,700
Bleepo.

1088
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,800
But we were confused.

1089
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,360
Because we didn't know who we were anymore.

1090
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,540
We were always

1091
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,220
just like these.

1092
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:24,460
Just sounds.

1093
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,660
And we always felt for them just like us.

1094
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,220
We're always thinking how they

1095
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:36,380
stuff them with Nur Parasol or my dad,

1096
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,660
who doesn't believe.

1097
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,000
com Ross.

1098
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,900
Jen Green.

1099
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,360
Michelle Edison.

1100
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:05,800
Did the devil donks take our bodies, or did they just infest our minds?

1101
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,640
Well, we didn't know.

1102
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:13,960
I looked like Gobi to Bleepo, and Bleepo looked like Gobi to me, but we weren't sure.

1103
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,040
We didn't know whose vision was being affected.

1104
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,120
We didn't know whose vision it was.

1105
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,120
Was it ours?

1106
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,640
Was it the devil donks?

1107
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,600
Was it Bob's?

1108
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,620
Where was Bob?

1109
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,480
Why wasn't he helping us?

1110
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,200
We never wanted it.

1111
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:32,160
We never wanted the world to end.

1112
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,980
We never wanted to destroy it.

1113
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:40,640
We never wanted the devil donks to come, but they did.

1114
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,800
And we couldn't find Stang.

1115
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,840
To help us.

1116
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:50,720
We thought we had destroyed even any memory of the Church of the Subgenius, and we have.

1117
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,280
But we brought it back.

1118
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,720
Because we are good.

1119
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,340
We are.

1120
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,240
And so we recreated the universe.

1121
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,940
It was quite a simple process.

1122
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,400
It wasn't that hard.

1123
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,340
It just took some time.

1124
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,280
It took some paper.

1125
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,860
And fire.

1126
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,100
And water.

1127
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,360
It took...

1128
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,380
Just a little bit of sex.

1129
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:28,820
Just...

1130
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,820
Just a little bit of sex.

1131
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,600
Not a lot.

1132
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,840
You don't need a lot of sex to recreate the universe.

1133
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,920
Just the tiniest bit of sex.

1134
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:43,920


1135
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,080
As long as it's good.

1136
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,840
That creates planets.

1137
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:56,180
That creates stars and suns and hot, burning creatures.

1138
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,760
Drifting and floating.

1139
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,160
Free from gravity.

1140
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,180
Coming out of us.

1141
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,040
Coming from us.

1142
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,680
What we created.

1143
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,420
Out of our pores.

1144
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,720
Out of our eyes.

1145
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:13,640
Fire burning from the palms of our hands.

1146
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:13,900
Fire burning from the palms of our hands.

1147
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,520
Fighting off evil yet.

1148
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,580
Shooting out like rays of light.

1149
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,920

1151
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,600
Thank you.

1152
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,820
I Titanic you have the freedom of the universe of fear.

1153
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,580
So, what did you do this weekend?

1154
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,440
I bet you had a really good time.

1155
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,460
I bet you watched some television.

1156
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,220
Huh?

1157
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,980
I bet you watched some sports on television.

1158
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:56,640
Well, we realized the complete nonsense, nonsense of television.

1159
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:00,280
We didn't even know how to operate electric lamps anymore.

1160
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,480
What good is television if you don't know how to operate an electric lamp, you know?

1161
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,060
You might think that I lost my voice because I, you know, destroyed the universe,

1162
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,940
but no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1163
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,820
There's nothing nearly as exciting as that.

1164
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,720
But I can tell you one thing that is exciting.

1165
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:26,040
This is very, very exciting.

1166
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,180
Midget Man, Midget Man, what to do with Midget Man?

1167
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,120
Midget Man, Midget Man.

1168
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,240
What to do with Midget Man?

1169
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,440

Here East the arts

1195
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,840
Yes, yes, yes

1196
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,620
Yes, it wasn't sexy, it wasn't foxy

1197
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,980
It wasn't sexy, it wasn't foxy

1198
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,280
It wasn't sexy, it wasn't foxy

1199
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,620
It wasn't sexy, it wasn't foxy

1200
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:25,760
Yes, yes, yes, yes You were so sexy, you were so folly

1201
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,480
That's optimum lethality.

1202
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:13,100
And this is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, dear friends.

1203
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:22,960
And we'd like to give you a post office box number you can write to for further information on the other materials of the Church of the Subgenius.

1204
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:32,680
But you don't even have to write out Church of the Subgenius or Hour of Slack or even Subgenius Foundation on that self-addressed stomped envelope.

1205
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,940
But just stomped envelope, that's right.

1206
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:51,440
Just write that to Bob at post office box 140306 in lovely Dallas, Texas.

1207
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,240
405-214.

1208
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,540
I'll give you that number again in a minute.

1209
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:07,780
Our special guests this evening have been Little Reverend Gobi talking about the end and rebirth of the universe.

1210
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,960
Reagan's Polyp, our special musical and medical guest.

1211
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:18,340
And various real idiots.

1212
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:22,060
And that's box 140306.

1213
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,760
Dallas, Texas.

1214
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:29,600
75214.

1215
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,540
Praise Bob.

1216
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,080
Not so fast, slow and easy.

1217
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,520
Not so fast, slow and easy.

1218
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,900
Not so fast, slow and easy.

1219
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:39,180
Not so fast, slow and easy.

1220
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,660
Not so fast, slow and easy.

1221
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:48,640
Because it's pretty clear about what God says is going to happen to people who pervert themselves in this way.

1222
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,780
But the main thing that we need to remember is that...

1223
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,800
You can have freedom through this.

1224
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:01,120
That God is an all-powerful God.

1225
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,100
And he can deal with that.

1226
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,620
And he can forgive you for that if you ask for forgiveness.

1227
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,400
And it's a powerful addiction.

1228
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,680
Somewhat like drugs, I would guess.

1229
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,460
But there's a demonic influence there.

1230
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,680
And again, Jesus said that he came to set the captives free.

1231
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,840
And so people that walk in that lifestyle...

1232
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,800
Despite the claims that it may be...

1233
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,940
Hereditary or caused by genes or something of that effect...

1234
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,740
That's simply not true.

1235
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,740
And Jesus can set you free.

1236
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:35,040
Right now we're going to take a call from one of our listeners.

1237
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,680
Mary from Irving.

1238
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:37,320
Go ahead, Mary.

1239
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,400
Yes.

1240
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:46,220
It just sickens me that they are talking about the expense of health care so badly.

1241
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,520
But they don't do anything to change it.

1242
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,780
You know, they're condoning this homosexuality.

1243
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,740
And all this stuff going around.

1244
00:58:55,860 --> 00:59:02,260
And all this bugger on TVs and stuff that our kids are exposed to.

1245
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,000
And that men wind up molesting children and everything.

1246
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,380
Why don't they change some laws and stop all this filth?

1247
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,260
So that we can have a better life for our children.

1248
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:14,800
Okay.

1249
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,560
That's true, Mary.

1250
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,060
Thank you for your call.

1251
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:19,460
And then we'll talk to you.

1252
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,740
Address that issue, okay?

1253
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,800
Okay. Thank you.

1254
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:22,220
Thank you.

1255
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,000
Thank you.

1256
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,700
That's true.

1257
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:30,560
One of the major problems with the Clinton health care plan coming up is how to deal with these epidemics.

1258
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:39,400
And, of course, with AIDS breaking out and spreading to not just the homosexual community but the drug users.

1259
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:46,400
But it's also becoming one of the fastest spreading forms of venereal disease like syphilis or gonorrhea.

1260
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:52,780
And they're saying that within the next few years that the major spread of AIDS will be through health.

1261
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:12,940
But being a society is going to have to lay down some fundamental while people are stuck in this level of pandemics and the efforts of the government are.

1262
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,880
And as we get back to the talk on white-white setups and how to get people out to work, I just want to point out that there is a little bit of�만

1263
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,200
in the White House that's kind of the forewarned that let's not

1264
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:19,540
but that's what our laws are going to be working for is to allow a lot of people to be, values, all fighters,

1265
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,560
ビъьтіcьынëєло.

1266
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:24,820
the word we've got to no longer be lukewarm or play it safe we've got to go

1267
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:30,240
into the to the society and take up the cross of Jesus Christ and preach it and

1268
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:35,000
teach it and stand for it and confront people with their sins and pray for God

1269
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,560
to pour our revival short of that there's really no hope for America

1270
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,780
so let me tell you now

1271
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,380
I am
