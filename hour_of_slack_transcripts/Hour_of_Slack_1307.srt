1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,740
Somewhere in the forbidding tundra mountains of Lapland, high above the Arctic Circle,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,640
a group of mining engineers were prospecting for copper.

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,560
But what they unearthed was a story. A story that was to terrorize the whole world.

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,440
I'm in there and have to dig life with father, and I mean Father Slack.

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,120
What is that red button over there, dear?

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,660
Go ahead, please.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:34,340
Once upon a time, in a famous story, a girl named Alice got very curious about a little white rabbit who passed by.

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:43,380
She followed him and soon found herself falling down a very deep hole into a strange place called Wonderland.

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,280
This is the voice of Colossus, the voice of God.

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,640
The choice is yours. Obey and follow.

11
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,820
Live or disobey and die.

12
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,180
Quiet numbskulls, I'm broadcasting.

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,640
The SoulTunes.

14
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,220
Our...

15
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,220
Squad.

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,740
Bum! Bum! Bum! Bum! Bum! Bum! Bum! Bum!

17
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,520
To help carry on our important work, I want you to join the secret squadron.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,680
I want your blood.

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,260
I want your soul.

20
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,620
And I want them both right now.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,280
I want you to get up now.

22
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,640
I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.

23
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,080
I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell,

24
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,300
I'm as mad as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore!

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,600
But now at the beginning of the 1980s, I want to make another personal prediction.

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,280
The 1980s will be the most catastrophic decade in the history of man.

27
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,780
And yet no one who will accept what God has to say has to be afraid.

28
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:21,760
As a matter of fact, you can be so excited that every day can be a day where you are not only optimistic, but saying, this might be the day.

29
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,720
This may be it.

30
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,620
And in the meanwhile,

31
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,400
Bum!

32
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:36,120
has promised that as we claim his promises, he will sustain us even in the darkest hours of history and give us a way out.

33
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,820
Well, for a start, I'm gonna sit here and get smashed out of my mind.

34
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,500
And I also have it on very good authority that the world is coming to an end.

35
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,480
So I thought I'd go home and watch it on television.

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,180
Typical.

37
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,800
Yes, typical.

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,440
Now that's a little rough.

39
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,700
And that doesn't sound too good to the polished ears of the people.

40
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,920
I'm gonna go to the

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:15,460
Yes, you're right.

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
It is gruesome.

43
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,140
Who then speaks for man?

44
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,360
I do.

45
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,120
I am the spirit of man.

46
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,100
Mob?

47
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,220
They should all drown in lakes of blood.

48
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,560
Now they will know why they are afraid of the dark.

49
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,540
Now they will learn why they fear the night.

50
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,460
Keep me covered, Mob.

51
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,960
Your time is fast approaching.

52
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,180
So they say.

53
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,420
And your cycle has ended.

54
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:51,400
And those who are in to know will be alive for a shower of riches, wealth, and power.

55
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,380
Oh boy.

56
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,340
Sign me up.

57
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:00,560
When the prophecies of hundreds of madmen and kooks from time immemorial come to pass.

58
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,360
And when you join, you'll get two spare car keys as well as credit card keys.

59
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,700
These keys are made especially for your car door.

60
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,380
Many makes and months.

61
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,020
They are as thin as a credit card.

62
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,420
And they slip neatly into your wife or her bra.

63
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,640
And you never ever get locked out of your vehicle again.

64
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,220
What kind of a bargain is that?

65
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,880
And only the Church of the Subgenius brings you this astonishing extra.

66
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,100
Can I have two?

67
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,000
Which looks hidden like an Easter egg in the vast design of subgenius artifacts.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,720
And it's a money back guarantee.

69
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,540
Yee-haw.

70
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,660
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

71
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,240
And if you order today, you'll get Bub L. Butt.

72
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,120
Not only blows bubbles from his behind, but makes farting noises at the same time.

73
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,880
He's a one-man entertainment center who will keep everyone amused by his multi-talented tricks.

74
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:11,940
To activate your farting noise humor, mail Express Activation Card 113-B to Flatulent Subgenius.

75
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:18,120
The Firesign Theater is proud to take you back to the feast of the starving women.

76
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,180
The Oils and Snails Festival at San Climaron.

77
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,800
May I have some music, please?

78
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:46,820
That hot winter, that cold summer, I broke a bottle of wine over her head.

79
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,700
Heh.

80
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,580
She was lying on her back playing with herself.

81
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,920
Skirts up over her head.

82
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,800
She reminded me of my mother, that cold winter, hot summer under the sea.

83
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,960
At San Climaron looking for clams.

84
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:12,640
Seeking out the little air bubbles in the sand, digging them up with a big spade and dropping them into the bucket and cracking them open.

85
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,160
Spreading them gently and eating them in the raw.

86
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,960
That wonderful summer, that hot winter, that cold summer.

87
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,020
San Climaron.

88
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:42,060
Climaron. Climaron. Climaron. Climaron.

89
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,220
The winds grossly.

90
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,160
The sludge, the cold.

91
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,500
Climaron. Climaron. Climaron.

92
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,580
Climaron. Climaron.

93
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,180
Spreading the sweet, the fever.

94
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,900
Well, let me go get you drinks.

95
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,160
That afternoon I gave Dick the order to alert and send the 82nd Airborne.

96
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,200
And to do the same with two Tactical Fighter ships.

97
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:29,880
squadron. Good man. I'll order the C-141 pack for a desert operation. Now, let's see. First,

98
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:36,580
you'll need a declaration of war. That way, everything you do will be nice and illegal.

99
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,940
Okay. Sign here. They did it.

100
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,240
Well, I couldn't wait. I just had to see you. Don't you understand, Bob? I'm not going with you.

101
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,200
What do you mean? I don't love you, Bob.

102
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,160
I'm not sure I ever did. Come on, come on. Let's hear the rest of it.

103
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,600
Sorry, Bob, but your dream has become my nightmare.

104
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,580
Well, Bob, you sure do have a high burn rate with women.

105
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,800
Maybe I ought to take a break from that high maintenance kind.

106
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:31,660
Maybe you ought to give me a try. I'm somewhere right between high key and low key.

107
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:40,680
Just a little bit hokey. Accent on the ho. How come you never took me for a tumble, eh, Bobbo?

108
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,600
Hmm. So, come here often.

109
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,100
Why?

110
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,600
One, two.

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,760
What's that?

112
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:50,760
Wow.

113
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,740
On the wings of a snow white Bob

114
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,660
He sends his pure sweet cum

115
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,600
A sign from above

116
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,180
On the wings of a

117
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,300
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

118
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,320
Once cum

119
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,420
Girl

120
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,040
No

121
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,420
He sends down his

122
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,720
Cum

123
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,180
On the wings of a

124
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,000
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob young

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
A snow

126
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,240
boy

127
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,180
He sends his

128
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,240
ange

129
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,220
Full everything

130
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,280
No

131
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,620
ha

132
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,700
Bob bob

133
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,900
panda

134
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,460
ah

135
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:46,160
yest inspirins and when I show our slack number one thousand three hundred Пред Toaderen

136
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,120
is dedicated to our good friends and prayer partners,

137
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,300
Dr. Philo Drummond, Reverend Dr. Uncle Onan Canobite, and Azo,

138
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,160
whose birthday today is May 1st, when this show is being recorded.

139
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,460
Happy birthday!

140
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
Happy birthday, and Princess Wee is here,

141
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,580
and we're going to read a story to you in a second.

142
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,120
First, I should mention that last song,

143
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,700
Wings of a Bob, was by the great Lemur.

144
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,520
Susie the Flusie was heard before that,

145
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,300
and before that, the Firesign Theater from Radio Hour, Hour No. 1.

146
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,740
Before that, puzzling evidence with Dr. Philo Drummond.

147
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,920
Happy birthday, and Dr. Howe.

148
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,740
And later, we'll hear a song by Onan.

149
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,240
But first, friends, I have a manuscript here.

150
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,780
This was turned in by Reverend Teeters Laverge

151
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,340
of the church.

152
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,600
He's been, well, I'll just read it.

153
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,500
The title is The Agent and Mr. Dobbs.

154
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,840
And actually, the manuscript is from October 1962.

155
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,560
But these papers were found on the body of a transient party clown

156
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,980
in the city of Albany, New York, in 1989.

157
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,100
The papers had been meticulously taped back to the church,

158
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,660
and were put together after an apparent attempt at shredding them.

159
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,220
Some pages are missing.

160
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,840
The party clown was determined by the county coroner

161
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:29,200
to have been killed by being force-fed copious amounts of silly putty,

162
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,760
some of which still had a cartoon imprint

163
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,500
of a pleasant yet disturbing face

164
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,620
of a smiling man with a pipe clenched between his teeth.

165
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,080
Now, here is the manuscript.

166
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,800
As I said, this is from 1962,

167
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,420
so you'll have to forgive some of the dated terminology

168
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,240
used by the agent who wrote this.

169
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,960
I'm skipping over a part where he was dropped off

170
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,580
at the Dobbs house or mansion.

171
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,960
The knocker on the huge oaken front door

172
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,960
was a rather heavy, rusty iron piece

173
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,660
in the shape of a dollar sign.

174
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,540
I banged it down thrice and awaited an answer.

175
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,720
Soon, the door creaked open,

176
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,360
and in front of me stood the tallest colored man

177
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,740
I have ever seen,

178
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,440
even taller than Agent 541.

179
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,280
However, he had a very high, squeaky voice

180
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,980
that resembles a certain cartoon mouse.

181
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,880
He asked me my business,

182
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,040
and I replied that I had an urgent appointment

183
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,840
with Mr. Dobbs.

184
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,620
The man answered,

185
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,380
answering the door seemed fairly out of it too,

186
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,720
and replied back that the sky was pretty damn blue today.

187
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,980
Again, I had to wait a few minutes

188
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,400
until he asked me my business,

189
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,480
but before I could answer,

190
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,640
he was ushering me into the cavernous building.

191
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,640
Once inside, I noticed that it was rather well-appointed

192
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,560
with both new and antique furnishings,

193
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,620
which to my eyes seemed to come from all corners of the earth

194
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,780
and were set about in no discernible pattern.

195
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,440
There were piles,

196
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,100
piles of paper,

197
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,860
and stacks of money everywhere.

198
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,360
What caught my eye, though,

199
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,740
was the incredible amount of junk laying about the place.

200
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,400
This Mr. Dobbs, it would seem,

201
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,320
had a habit of collecting useless objects

202
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,040
found by the side of the road.

203
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,480
Finally, after walking through many hallways,

204
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,780
I was shown to a door and told to walk in,

205
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,180
but I was expected.

206
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,700
I did as told.

207
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,540
The room I entered was the most sane

208
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,060
that I had so far seen,

209
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,100
a typical den that any well-cultured man

210
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,560
may have in his home.

211
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,420
Mr. Dobbs was sitting in a large leather armchair

212
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,500
with his back to me,

213
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,620
a billow of smoke coming up from his front.

214
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,400
I slowly walked over to him.

215
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,100
He said nothing, but with his right hand,

216
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,600
he motioned me to sit on a folding metal chair

217
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,780
adjacent to him.

218
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,300
He seemed to be engrossed in a television program.

219
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,660
It was Leave It to Beaver,

220
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,460
a wholesome program.

221
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,040
Suddenly, he began to speak.

222
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,060
I do love this show.

223
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,560
That Ward Cleaver is one relaxed man.

224
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,700
Connie doesn't like me to watch this program.

225
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,340
She thinks it's pornographic,

226
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,400
but that's why I like it.

227
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,280
He fell into a deep silence,

228
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,280
intently watching a commercial

229
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,540
and nodding his head in time with the jingle.

230
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,620
When the commercial ended,

231
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,860
he turned to me and asked,

232
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,900
What can I do for you, young agent?

233
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,580
I noticed then,

234
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,300
that even though the upper half of his body

235
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,180
was clad in a dark suit with white shirt and dark tie,

236
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,200
the bottom half of his body

237
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,100
was clad only in wingtip shoes.

238
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,460
It was very disturbing

239
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,920
and put me off for a moment,

240
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,660
but I'd been warned by my handlers

241
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,320
that this Mr. Dobbs

242
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
had many tricks up his sleeve,

243
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,820
and I took this as his way

244
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,280
of making a person uncomfortable.

245
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,600
I regained my composure and told him,

246
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,460
Mr. Dobbs, the agency I work for

247
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,620
has a request for you.

248
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,420
When suddenly, Mr. Dobbs,

249
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,380
got up out of his chair

250
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,480
and walked over to a well-appointed wet bar

251
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,120
and poured a tumbler full of what he claimed

252
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,060
was the finest scotch,

253
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,440
saying it was from Malaysia or Canada or somewhere.

254
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,440
My memory begins to get hazy here.

255
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,560
It was not scotch at all.

256
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,840
It smelled like grape,

257
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,220
but tasted, for the life of me,

258
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,200
like gasoline.

259
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,740
He bade me to drink.

260
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,040
Knowing that he's an important partner,

261
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,820
I tried to force down a sip.

262
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,360
Then, Mr. Dobbs did the strange,

263
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,200
strangest thing.

264
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,880
He started to do what I believe

265
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,480
is called a hula dance,

266
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,480
yet he was humming some tango to himself.

267
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,580
Even though I was warned

268
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,940
about his eccentric behavior,

269
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,960
I can't abide a half-naked man

270
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,160
dancing in front of me.

271
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,680
Yet I was transfixed.

272
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,960
I know now that I must have been drugged.

273
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,680
He danced for a while,

274
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,100
too close to me for my waning comfort.

275
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,260
My heart beat faster,

276
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,200
and the rank smoke

277
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,340
from his pipe seemed to make my head swim

278
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,580
and my vision fade.

279
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,060
I thought I was about to faint

280
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,680
when my heart nearly burst

281
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,400
as I felt a pair of hands

282
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,340
starting to massage my shoulders.

283
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,260
I looked up to see

284
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,620
a beautiful blonde

285
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,620
with a perfect perm smiling down on me.

286
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,600
I took this to be his wife, Connie.

287
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,620
She said,

288
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,120
Don't fret.

289
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,420
Bob likes to dance on Fridays.

290
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,040
She continued,

291
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,600
Now, now, dearie,

292
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,260
we mustn't mess with our company.

293
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,500
Mr. Dobbs ignored her

294
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,660
and continued his lewd dance.

295
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,780
Connie bade me to ask Bob

296
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,940
what questions I may need to ask him.

297
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,840
I started out by getting straight to the point,

298
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,620
reminding him of the troubles with Cuba.

299
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,540
Mr. Dobbs then did the queerest thing

300
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,520
I'd seen him do yet.

301
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,660
He ran over to a big wooden box on the bar,

302
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,640
opened it,

303
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,680
and pulled out a huge novelty cigar.

304
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,640
He then proceeded to insert

305
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,580
said huge novelty cigar

306
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,120
up his

307
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,740
neither port.

308
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,580
The cigar spontaneously ignited

309
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,580
and Mr. Dobbs blew smoke rings

310
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,960
out of his ears.

311
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,540
Surely this was an illusion

312
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,300
or a hallucination from my drugged state.

313
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,800
I found myself mesmerized

314
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,580
by Mr. Dobbs' antics.

315
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,060
Connie's back rub and the scotch

316
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,440
I found myself taking a liking to.

317
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,480
Connie's hands reached down to my

318
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,580
left hand.

319
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:39,860
I was in a lap

320
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,800
as I watched Mr. Dobbs

321
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,260
preach about economics

322
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,580
and Cuba and war

323
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,740
and how it all tied together

324
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,160
all the while bent over

325
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,740
with a huge cigar puffing away

326
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,060
in his nether port.

327
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,200
That is the last I remember

328
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,300
of that evening.

329
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,460
The ensuing lie detector tests

330
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,980
and truth serums have borne that out.

331
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,460
I awoke the next morning

332
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,760
late, I believe,

333
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,800
with a cool breeze fluttering

334
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,760
through pastel pink curtains.

335
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,060
I had the worst hangover

336
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,340
I'd ever experienced.

337
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,860
I cannot fully describe the sensation.

338
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,480
It was somewhere between

339
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,580
getting a root canal

340
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,760
and the high of three martinis.

341
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,120
I was startled to notice

342
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,960
that Connie Dobbs was nude

343
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,180
lying next to me.

344
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,660
I tried getting up

345
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,900
but soon regretted it

346
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,160
by the dizziness it caused

347
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,200
and worst of all,

348
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,300
I saw what was laying next to Connie.

349
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,220
All I saw was its shoulders

350
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,320
and a cheap bouffant wig on its head.

351
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,680
Its skin was gray.

352
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,040
I don't mean sickly,

353
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,800
human gray.

354
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,360
I mean gray as gray can be.

355
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,900
Its body shape was all out of whack, too.

356
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,920
Then I had fleeting memories

357
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,020
of a wild sexual encounter

358
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,720
with Mrs. Dobbs

359
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,500
and something else.

360
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,680
I remember having intercourse

361
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,160
with orifices that were

362
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,500
not human.

363
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,180
I must have shuddered

364
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,260
for Connie rolled over

365
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,100
and picked up a glass

366
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,120
of some clear liquid

367
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,960
off the nightstand

368
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,920
and two tablets.

369
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,800
She demanded I take them

370
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,220
for they would make me feel better.

371
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,880
I inspected the tablets

372
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,440
and though they resembled

373
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,740
your basic aspirin,

374
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,580
they were had embossed on them

375
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,500
the word pills

376
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,640
spelled P-I-L-S.

377
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,900
Afraid of being drugged again,

378
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,380
I tried to hide them in my cheek

379
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,480
but when I drank the liquid

380
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,820
they just slid down my throat.

381
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,880
Within minutes,

382
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,500
reality started to fade

383
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,900
and some sort of orgy began.

384
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,500
The last thing I remember

385
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,480
was Mr. Dobbs dressed as a clown

386
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,080
with no pants on, of course,

387
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,400
attempting to take my virginity.

388
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,400
I still have nightmares about this

389
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,380
but as they say,

390
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,600
my country right or wrong.

391
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,780
Weeks passed

392
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,760
that I have little memory of.

393
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,900
I know this only because of the date

394
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,200
in which I was retrieved

395
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,920
by the agency.

396
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,120
The Dobbses and their minions

397
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,460
kept me pretty well

398
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,360
fropped up as they called it.

399
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,600
The next event

400
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,320
that I have any clear memory of

401
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,780
was of taking a ridiculously

402
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,340
long elevator ride

403
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,360
deep into the earth

404
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,660
at the Bobco Mining

405
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,860
and Soylent Green Consumption.

406
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,060
It was a very long ride

407
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,060


408
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,060


409
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,260
to get to the Mining Consortium

410
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,740
in Wyoming.

411
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,860
We must have been on that elevator

412
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,000
for three hours.

413
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,940
One of Dobbs' minions

414
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,940
took my watch during the orgy

415
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,940
and refused to give it back

416
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,700
saying Bob doesn't pay enough

417
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,280
and he had to get some stuff

418
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,040
for a weekend party

419
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,640
he and the Kennedys were having

420
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,600
with one Dr. Oswald.

421
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,160
When we finally alighted

422
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,780
from the elevator

423
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,740
to my surprise

424
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,060
we were not in some mine shaft

425
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,960
as I expected

426
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,560
but in a huge, vaulted warehouse

427
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,040
full of novelty goods

428
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,860
that were being sold

429
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:38,860


430
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:38,860


431
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:38,860


432
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:38,860


433
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:38,860


434
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:38,860


435
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:38,860


436
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,700
stacked and sorted

437
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,900
by strange, short men

438
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,140
shrouded in sack rags.

439
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,580
Bob claimed that they were

440
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,680
ex-Nazi scientists

441
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,040
working on some

442
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,540
quote,

443
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,320
super-duper extra-secret

444
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,260
unquote

445
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
project for the government.

446
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,260
I could clearly see that they were

447
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,460
not men at all

448
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,800
but slaves of some unknown species.

449
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,380
By this time

450
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,820
I had found it to my better judgment

451
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,500
not to doubt Mr. Dobbs

452
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,680
at least not out loud.

453
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,120
We took a golf cart type of vehicle

454
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,960
down a long, winding corridor.

455
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,140
Mr. Dobbs not once paid any attention

456
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,160
to where he was driving.

457
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,500
He decided to at that time

458
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,520
ramble on and on

459
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,180
about some mysterious substance

460
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:22,900
he called

461
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,800
slack

462
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,740
all the while puffing insanely

463
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,720
on his pipe

464
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,380
the bowl of which soon glowed

465
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:28,980
a bright red.

466
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,520
During this journey

467
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,980
we ran over three

468
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,700
of Bob's slave men

469
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,400
and nearly hit countless others.

470
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,860
Mr. Dobbs was oblivious to eating

471
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,540
and was hard to eat.

472
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,020
We finished our trick

473
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,860
and ran back to our homes

474
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:45,980
admit the danger

475
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,540
Dici,

476
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,120
I flew to the

477
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,920
as you all saw

478
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,720
I had picked up

479
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:57,720


480
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:57,720


481
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:57,720


482
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:07,880
words

483
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,800
I can barely describe it.

484
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,340
It was a total mess and stank of the tobacco that he constantly smoked.

485
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,540
In fact, I never saw Mr. Dobbs without that infernal pipe clenched between his teeth.

486
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,000
It was only after a few minutes of adjusting to the stench and the mess of the office

487
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,400
that I saw something that horrified me.

488
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,220
The place had several severed human heads strewn haphazardly all over.

489
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,140
Now, I've seen some terrible sights in my life,

490
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,180
and I suspect that if I'm on the Dobbs case, I will see worse.

491
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:41,680
But what made me gasp was that the heads were not of random humans,

492
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,060
but of public figures that we would all recognize.

493
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,980
I saw the heads of...

494
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,360
And this section was carefully cut out of the original report.

495
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,480
And one was actually singing.

496
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,420
It begged me in a tenor to please kill me.

497
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,080
Surprisingly, in the state I had been in, I did not faint.

498
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,880
Instead, with all the smoke from Bob's special tobacco mix, I started to laugh.

499
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,160
This got Bob...

500
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,180
Bob all worked up.

501
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,520
He started to jump around inanely and laugh.

502
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,820
He then proceeded to use one of the heads, not the singing one,

503
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,600
in a most foul manner.

504
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,280
Bob bade me sit down on a chair that was stacked high with papers.

505
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,640
I looked at the stack and back at Bob, wondering what he expected me to do.

506
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,040
By this time, I'd begun to get in the spirit of the situation

507
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,700
and laughingly knocked the stack of papers on the floor.

508
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,860
Mr. Dobbs didn't seem to mind.

509
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,800
In fact, he stared down at the mess I made,

510
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:37,380
and said,

511
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:37,840
Thanks!

512
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,560
Picked up a sheet of paper, saying he'd been looking for this contract for quite some time.

513
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,060
The glyphs on the sheet were of no known human alphabet that I have ever encountered.

514
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,240
For some reason, this worried me,

515
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,840
and reminded me of the slaves I saw working for Bob,

516
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,100
and that dreadful night with Mrs. Dobbs,

517
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,020
and that strange gray creature.

518
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,280
I did not have much time to consider the implications,

519
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,600
for Mr. Dobbs wadded up the paper,

520
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,960
tossed it in a corner,

521
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,080
and told me to follow him.

522
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,200
This time,

523
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,680
we did not take the vehicle,

524
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,360
but instead walked down dark and dank corridors,

525
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,320
which had a gradual downslope.

526
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,240
Being without a timepiece,

527
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,500
I cannot estimate the amount of time we walked,

528
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,000
but it seemed like hours.

529
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,580
Here, I must admit,

530
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:26,400
my perceptions of time had been warped by constant exposure to Bob's tobacco.

531
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,720
Mr. Dobbs finally guided me to our final destination.

532
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,820
What I saw in that final circle of hell,

533
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,480
I cannot,

534
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,820
I will not reveal.

535
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,320
Through all the pressure that the agency could bear against me,

536
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,760
a loyal, true blue agent and American,

537
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,620
I found it in our best interest to keep some things secret,

538
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,940
even from the boss,

539
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,500
the man in the dress.

540
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,120
I do this for the good of our nation,

541
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,520
and out of fear,

542
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,660
for what Mr. Dobbs revealed to me was so horrific,

543
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,440
so humorous,

544
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,260
so bizarre,

545
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,760
so unchristian,

546
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,180
so baffling and dangerous,

547
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,380
that I hyperventilated through the inane laughter

548
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,580
that was my only defense,

549
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,400
lest I totally lose my mind.

550
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,600
The last thing I remembered that day was Mr. Dobbs dancing around my prostrate body

551
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,140
he was prancing, really,

552
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,080
and mimicking my insane laughter with his own even crazier chortles.

553
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,640
He spoke no words,

554
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,840
he just laughed,

555
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,460
but his laughter seemed to speak volumes to my inner mind.

556
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,800
I laughed, I wept, I urinated in my undergarments

557
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,780
for Mr. Dobbs had somehow relieved me of my slacks,

558
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,720
when, I do not recall,

559
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,780
I awoke, I'm not sure when,

560
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,120
on a garbage-strewn beach in some tropical or subtropical location.

561
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,980
I recall the sound of ocean waves breaking on the shore

562
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,500
and that of a mambo band.

563
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,840
I almost choked when I was offered a daiquiri by the dictator

564
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,740
F blanked out C blanked out,

565
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,880
probably Fidel Castro,

566
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,520
who was sitting next to me on the beach towel.

567
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,340
I drank the beverage only out of a severe thirst.

568
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,800
It was tasty, however, you can't beat good Cuban rum.

569
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,540
Sitting on the other side of me was Dr. Oswald,

570
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,820
who was removing the cash from my wallet,

571
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,720
mumbling about,

572
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,820
that damn Bob never pays me on time.

573
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,480
I was so overwhelmed that I did nothing to counter his actions.

574
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,340
And friends, at this point,

575
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,720
I, Reverend Stang, must cease reading from the document

576
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,580
The Agent and Mr. Dobbs,

577
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,040
brought to us by Reverend Teeters LaVerge.

578
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,780
I've gotten a little ways with it,

579
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,480
but I'm going to switch it back to Part 2.

580
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,800
It goes all the way up to Part 6 so far.

581
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,480
However, I have a piece of music here that I think will be

582
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,320
extremely pertinent to the subject matter.

583
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,360
This is Reverend Angry Larry.

584
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,380
You know I live a life of danger for the FBI

585
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,780
Keeping tabs on our nation on the land on the sea in the sky

586
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,080
And every single night before I go to bed

587
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,160
I get down on my knees and say,

588
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,320
Bob, I'm a secret agent man

589
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,840
Secret agent man

590
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,740
Secret agent man

591
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,340
They give me a number

592
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,120
But they take away my name

593
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,500
I got one hell of a job to perform for the U.S. of A.

594
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,760
Got the responsibility of our nation's top security

595
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,820
But every night and day

596
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,120
I salute the flag and say

597
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,640
Thank you, Connie, cause I'm

598
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,200
I'm a secret agent man

599
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,700
Secret agent man

600
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,720
Secret agent man

601
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,140
They give me a number

602
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,080
But they take away my name

603
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,660
You know they got me doing this, doing that

604
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,800
A little bit of something else

605
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,400
Fighting cavities of evil

606
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,120
Safeguarding America's health

607
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,680
But I'm an afternoon paper

608
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,240
I don't get up off my ass

609
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:33,960
I don't get up off my ass

610
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,520
Thank you, Stan, cause I'm

611
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,960
I'm a secret agent man

612
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,500
Secret agent man

613
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,420
Secret agent man

614
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,760
They give me a number

615
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,880
But they take away my name

616
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,500
Secret agent man

617
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,480
Secret agent man

618
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,860
They give me a number

619
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,000
But they take away my name

620
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,280
Secret agent man

621
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,780
Secret agent man

622
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,000
Secret agent man

623
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,540
Secret agent man

624
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,500
Secret agent man

625
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,840
Secret agent man

626
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,280
Secret agent man

627
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:28,900
Secret agent man

628
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,540
Secret agent man

629
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,920
Secret agent man

630
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,540
Secret agent man

631
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:31,700
Secret agent man

632
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:31,700


633
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:31,700


634
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,940
Secret agent man

635
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,020
Secret agent man

636
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:38,620
Secret agent man

637
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,120
Secret agent man

638
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,100
Secret agent man

639
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:51,900
is from the soundtrack of Kenneth Anger's movie Lucifer Rising,

640
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,500
rather a rare piece.

641
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,260
And now let's just see what we have here.

642
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,180
Let's see what we have.

643
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:04,560
Ah, it's just what I thought it might be, one of those singing heads.

644
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,380
A wafting from your third, towards your third nipple.

645
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,280
My third nipple, yes, my extra-numerary nipple.

646
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,200
Super-numerary nipple, sorry.

647
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,160
Extra-numerary means you can't be counted.

648
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,580
Right, super-numerary means it's from the planet Krypton.

649
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,500
Thank Dobbs for that.

650
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,540
Thank Dobbs, I'm a secret agent, man.

651
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,040
You guys are out of sync.

652
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,180
See, we were...

653
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,360
I remember the oomph-wah part.

654
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,340
I know the oomph-wah part.

655
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,100
She's good at the oomph-wah part.

656
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,780
That's her specialty, the oomph-wah part.

657
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,260
Your perverse-pective, your own individual perverse-pective.

658
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,800
So what were the agents really trying to confine themselves to

659
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,320
as they rode down the humble highway of driftage and of lies?

660
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,060
I don't think the agent really knew what...

661
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,660
why he had been assigned to the Dobbs case.

662
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,660
Although, boy, does it get complicated.

663
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,980
In the next installment, at one point,

664
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,200
he's at a party in a horrible, horrible dive

665
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,680
with President Kennedy, Nikita Khrushchev,

666
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,700
who he's in a drinking contest with.

667
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,800
Figula, figula.

668
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,060
Richard Nixon is chasing a little dog

669
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,160
around the...

670
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,400
The bar.

671
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,020
Well, he later ends up barbecuing him, the dog.

672
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,740
Well, that makes more sense.

673
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,800
And, of course, the aforementioned Dr. Oswald.

674
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,240
It's a really complex...

675
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,820
I mean, Teeters has not managed to translate the whole thing yet,

676
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,400
so we're up to a part six,

677
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,580
but we don't know how many parts there are going to be

678
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,600
because they're still trying to piece together

679
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,040
all the shredded remnants.

680
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,660
Well, what were the original artifacts?

681
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,580
Were they in Punic or Carthaginian or something like that?

682
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,620
No, it was...

683
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,640
Let's see, what did it say at the beginning?

684
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,220
No, it was in English.

685
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,300
It was a report from an agent from 1962.

686
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:34,760
He refers to the boss as the man in the dress,

687
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,520
so I'm assuming he's an FBI agent

688
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,460
and he's talking about Hoover.

689
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,080
Right.

690
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,800
Or he could be talking about those weird nights

691
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,040
when JFK would dress up in Jackies, really,

692
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,160
really fine Dior originals from France.

693
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,880
Now, come on, that's not so weird.

694
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,760
Well, it's not so weird.

695
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,680
Don't you...

696
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,700
Well, I mean, didn't you like to pull your cousin's underwear

697
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,460
out of the drawer and dress up in it?

698
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,520
Well, I like to...

699
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,440
I have sniffed some panties in my days.

700
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,940
And they were clean, too, and they were in a drawer,

701
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,720
but I don't know, the allure, the thrill, it was...

702
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,060
I don't know, when you were 13

703
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,900
and you could smell a grown girl's panties

704
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,960
without getting caught in it.

705
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,020
Well, I was waiting on the onion just to see if I could...

706
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,720
This morning...

707
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,360
No, they didn't smell like onion.

708
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,620
That has been declared perfectly masturbatable now

709
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,120
in the book of Standards and Practices.

710
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,800
So it's, like, now considered okay

711
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,360
to abuse one's...

712
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,180
touch oneself while going through

713
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,580
one's female cousin's clothing.

714
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,340
So it's funny you should mention that.

715
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,520
It had already been part of a survey,

716
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,640
a government survey.

717
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:49,240
It is, however, not okay to break into one's home

718
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,740
and take the panties and smell them.

719
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,200
That cat burglary is illegal.

720
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,080
That's stealing.

721
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,240
And that's panty-raiding,

722
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,160
and it's also a crime punishable

723
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,960
by years of self-inflicted misery and confusion

724
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,200
and sometimes a vaster malaise

725
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,700
that purports to the society at large.

726
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,120
Now, Dave, this is starting to sound like a confession, man.

727
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,020
Oh, I...

728
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:13,820
Hey, man.

729
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:14,640
It's okay.

730
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,860
What's with that, man?

731
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,300
You may confess to your priest,

732
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,960
your sacred scribe, which is me in this case,

733
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,100
but I'll just go and tell everybody.

734
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,840
I'll just put it all over the Internet

735
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,200
as soon as you tell me.

736
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,400
Well, I think you should,

737
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,240
and that way I can face up to it in a manly way

738
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,100
because if not, it's just more hiding under the pillows,

739
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,940
thumb-sucking, fuzz-snatching

740
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,420
from the nearest yellow blanket,

741
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,580
crying in the rain, cursing the stars.

742
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,420
It's painful.

743
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,340
I mean, it isn't painful right now,

744
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,180
but, I mean, the experience is painful.

745
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,560
The Buddha said life is pain.

746
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,060
Well, they all say that, don't they?

747
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,860
Except for Dobbs.

748
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,680
Dobbs kind of says it too, doesn't he?

749
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,420
Kind of?

750
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,120
Yes, he would say life is pain

751
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,300
for those who have yet to...

752
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:07,980
Pay.

753
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,980
...become subgenius ministers in that one way

754
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,380
that we don't talk about

755
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,660
on this public-supported stage.

756
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,500
And Frank Zappa says don't eat this yellow snow,

757
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,420
but don't suck the yellow blanket either.

758
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,040
Jawohl.

759
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,980
So you know Professor Zerhatz of Vienna,

760
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,460
you're associated with his work.

761
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,540
Yes.

762
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,700
Yes.

763
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,680
Yes.

764
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:35,820
Yes.

765
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:36,480
Yes.

766
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,460
Yes.

767
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:37,780
Yes.

768
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,300
Yes.

769
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:38,480


770
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:38,660
Yes.

771
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:38,880
Yes.

772
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:38,880


773
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:38,920
Yes.

774
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:38,920


775
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:38,920


776
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,080


777
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:39,280
Yes.

778
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:39,520


779
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:39,520


780
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:39,520


781
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:39,820


782
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:39,900
Yes.

783
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:39,900


784
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:39,900


785
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,780
Yes.

786
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:41,780


787
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:41,780


788
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:41,780


789
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:41,780


790
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:41,780


791
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:41,780


792
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:41,880
Yes.

793
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,340
Yes.

794
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:42,840


795
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,560
Yes.

796
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,580
Yes.

797
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,400
Yes.

798
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:48,780
Yes.

799
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,100
Yes.

800
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,480
Yes.

801
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,360
Yes.

802
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,500
Yes.

803
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:58,860
Yes.

804
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,180
Yes.

805
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,120
Yes.

806
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,240
Yes.

807
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,000
your jaw feeling?

808
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,460
Dave, the last time we saw you,

809
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,800
which was about four years ago,

810
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,540
you had a bandage on your forehead all the time

811
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,560
because of the weeping third eye problem.

812
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,720
I think it hadn't quite grown into an eye yet.

813
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,400
So all it could do was wink and weep,

814
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,300
but it wasn't seeing, and you had it covered up.

815
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,520
It was kind of like a...

816
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,380
How did that turn out?

817
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,880
It's kind of like an elephant's trunk is what it reminded me of.

818
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,060
It was very small, but as it got bigger,

819
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,700
it started to drift forward with that peculiar roll,

820
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,960
like an elephant's trunk.

821
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,040
I got very nervous because, as you know, I'm a poor refugee,

822
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,540
and we can't afford help from various relief agencies

823
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,840
that don't want to fork out.

824
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,700
So what I did was I tried soaking it daily, as I was told,

825
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,840
a good way to get out of seeing the doctor.

826
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,260
But I didn't know you had to do it three times a day.

827
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,120
And, of course, I didn't know you could, like, maybe skip three days

828
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,100
if you weren't in the mood or too lazy or out of it.

829
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,020
And you had to soak it in Genkom on top of that, right?

830
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,260
Yeah. It draws it out. The Genkom draws it out.

831
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,920
Yes, it's a Genkom compress.

832
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,320
And actually puts it on a canvas afterwards and frames it.

833
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,340
But...

834
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,800
I kept on, you know, worrying about it, but not doing nothing.

835
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,020
And it got bigger and bigger, and it was alarming people

836
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,400
because it would stick out of the bands. It was so big.

837
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,860
And one night I had a bunch of other problems.

838
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,760
Like, there were people that were contacting me,

839
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,020
claiming to be secret agents and all this other stuff

840
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,560
that I couldn't quite comprehend, and I got real scared.

841
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,820
So I was in one of these real fretful moods,

842
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,320
and I just started pushing on this thing as hard as I could.

843
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
And it did hurt.

844
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,780
It hurt quite a great deal, but an enormous amount of flotsam

845
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,180
came billowing out in a very humorous way,

846
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,300
as anybody who's popped a cyst will remember.

847
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,420
An ill-humour, yes.

848
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,680
Yeah, I mean, you can hit photographs that are across the room.

849
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,880
Yeah, the humours actually come squirting out,

850
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,020
and they smell like death itself.

851
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,640
Now, this only... That's what alarmed me.

852
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,180
This one part smelled like death, and I...

853
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,880
Oh, this is out of me now.

854
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,400
But the other part was pristine.

855
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,300
It was clean and clear, and almost smelled like baby's saliva.

856
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,620
It was very, very, very clean-smelling.

857
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,000
And there were, like, pieces of stuff that didn't make sense.

858
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,960
They were, like, flat.

859
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,560
Like some sort of vertebrae or something.

860
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,020
Platelets.

861
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,060
Platelets.

862
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,400
Perhaps.

863
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,240
Could they have been very large, single-celled animalcules?

864
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,380
Could have been.

865
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,920
Did they move?

866
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,440
Did they wriggle?

867
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,760
Yes, they did.

868
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,460
Is it good?

869
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:03,800
Yes.

870
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,260
The alien implant part?

871
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,640
That's what I was thinking.

872
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,920
It was some kind of microbial alien implant.

873
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,460
Yes.

874
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,320
A thing unto itself.

875
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,140
That's the first thing that would occur to some people.

876
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,460
That's what it sounds like to me.

877
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,480
Well, you're the expert, Princess We Are Doe,

878
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,520
queen of all the UFOs.

879
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,040
Oh, she has a favourite movie now.

880
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,860
We saw the 1957 movie Queen of Outer Space recently,

881
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,540
which was filled with space.

882
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,620
Princesses.

883
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,120
And tonight we're going to, we'll probably watch the end of

884
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,180
Frankenstein vs. the Space Monster.

885
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,820
Hold that further away from the microphone.

886
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,580
I love that.

887
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,480
Princess We was waggling her tail right next to the mic.

888
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,460
I associated the sound with those outer space princesses' hats

889
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,300
that went boing, boing, boing over their heads.

890
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,820
Now, Dave, so you had this illness,

891
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,420
but you were too poor to go to the doctor, right?

892
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,580
I was told that I could go to the doctor and say,

893
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,120
I demand assurance of care,

894
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,260
which means they technically won't let people die on the street,

895
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,980
that they have to do something.

896
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,300
And many people do do that.

897
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,180
They say that and they sign the forms.

898
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,060
But I was also afraid of those things that look like palette knives,

899
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,240
only they're real sharp.

900
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,580
And those other things that have like, they're real long on one end

901
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,440
and they have a compression thing on the other end and they stick it in you.

902
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,680
Well, and then...

903
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,440
And plus, anytime you go into a hospital,

904
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,400
you're risking exposure to the mutant antibiotics,

905
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,700
which are worse than the infection you came in with.

906
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,580
Definitely.

907
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:49,180
It is a true, true fact that hospital infections are...

908
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,440
There are more of them than there are ones outside of the hospitals.

909
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,740
So you're actually safer outside.

910
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,440
You could just be in the parking lot and get treated out there.

911
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,120
Absolutely.

912
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,680
That would probably be better.

913
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,620
Just pour some whiskey on that wound.

914
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,500
Give him a...

915
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,940
A shovel handle to bite down on and start cutting.

916
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,020
Saw that third eye elephant trunk off of his forehead.

917
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,160
Slap a bandage on it.

918
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,280
Pour some more whiskey on it.

919
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,860
Okay, now put all that hot poker on there.

920
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,100
You cauterize that wound.

921
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,860
That feels good.

922
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:26,720
Well, it does seem like it's getting harder for a poor man to get a break.

923
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,820
Even a moderately in-between man.

924
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,180
No, there are none of those left.

925
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,360
There's only the rich man...

926
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,820
Or, well, the...

927
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:35,600
What?

928
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,680
About 400 or 500 rich men.

929
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,660
And then the rest of us.

930
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,740
And we're all poor.

931
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,280
On this day...

932
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,880
I told you I was going to read another thing.

933
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,320
Here it is.

934
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:50,240
On this day, it behooves us to remember the words of Martin Niemöller.

935
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,720
First, they came for the communists.

936
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
And I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist.

937
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,460
Then they came for the trade unionists.

938
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,740
I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist.

939
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,720
Then they came for the Jews.

940
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,420
And I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew.

941
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,660
Then they came for me.

942
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,560
And there was no one.

943
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,620
No one left to speak out for me.

944
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,880
And I added.

945
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,000
Then they came for the mutes.

946
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,040
But, um...

947
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,480
Mr. Niemöller wrote his poem decades ago.

948
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,520
It might read like this today.

949
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,360
And this is something our friend Zaphod sent us.

950
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:19,820
But I...

951
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,320
He doesn't know who wrote it.

952
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,120
And I don't either.

953
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,480
But get this.

954
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,800
First, they declared corporations were people.

955
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,720
And I didn't complain because I'm already a person.

956
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,380
Then they made unlimited money.

957
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,400
Speak!

958
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,000
And I didn't complain because the American dream says I'll be rich someday too.

959
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,480
Then they commandeered the means of production by shipping our greatest strength, manufacturing, overseas.

960
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,520
Because they don't have bothersome unions over there.

961
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:51,120
And I didn't complain because Walmart has cheap stuff.

962
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,060
Then they bought Congress so they could write the laws.

963
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,220
And I didn't complain because I can't be bothered to vote.

964
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,140
Then they bought the Supreme Court so they could cement their rule.

965
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,920
And I didn't complain because I don't have time to pay attention.

966
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,520
Then they bought the news so that they could convince everyone it's always been this way.

967
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,440
And I didn't complain because it's always been this way.

968
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,000
Then they manhandled an election.

969
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,440
And I didn't complain because I'm not from Florida.

970
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,380
Then they lied us into wars.

971
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,220
And I didn't complain because I'm not a soldier or an Iraqi or an Afghani.

972
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,840
Then millions died for profit.

973
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:32,520
And I didn't complain because the graphics on the news were totally awesome!

974
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:32,900
And I didn't complain because the graphics on the news were totally awesome!

975
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,400
Then they started locking people up because they said they could.

976
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,480
And I didn't complain because nobody locked me up.

977
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:44,440
Then they started spying on everyone because they said they could.

978
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,100
And I didn't complain because I'm a real American.

979
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,560
Then they came for the worker.

980
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,120
But thanks to supply-side trickle-down economics, I don't have a job.

981
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,420
This truth is self-evident.

982
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,480
This truth is self-evident.

983
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:02,500
This truth is self-evident.

984
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,040
And they watch until there's nothing left.

985
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:20,080
And I sit in silence and watch.

986
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,320
Shallow mixed with black, as a deterrent.

987
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,840
Everything in this room isffeness, as indecision, and tie, but still xi'un has appeared.

988
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:24,920
Everything in this room isffeness, as indecision, and tie, but still xi'un has appeared.

989
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,540
Nothing in this room isöffen sounds.

990
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:25,620
Nothing in this room isoffen sounds.

991
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:25,660


992
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,520
I don't understand why this star is coming in and out of everywhere a professor

993
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,360
the professor that knows who the��� wahtc and those that would know who themile

994
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,700
You know, I didn't get thatSwitch ran.

995
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,260
I just saw an idea, of a linesend tinkering with the administrat Miche.

996
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:32,500
I normally listen all the time of something that the inf bers a way be butterfly class

997
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,240
any little animal.

998
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,240
I wish I could say everything would be better,

999
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,400
but it never will be better.

1000
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,240
Because when they

1001
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,120
come for you, they actually

1002
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,500
come for you.

1003
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:45,720
Yes.

1004
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,440
Yes.

1005
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,600
Tell me

1006
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,680
about it. No, wait. Don't tell me about it.

1007
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,240
We're on the radio.

1008
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,740
I do believe...

1009
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,060
Obscenity is...

1010
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,360
We can't start being obscene

1011
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,440
until 11 o'clock, and we'll be

1012
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,980
in beddy-bye by then.

1013
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,940
Being obscene at home,

1014
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:05,960
I hope.

1015
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,500
Feeding your feet, putting little Cheetos between your

1016
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,600
toes, and watching your favorite

1017
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,160
filicum.

1018
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,500
Yes.

1019
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,240
I do concur

1020
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,280
that that piece that you

1021
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,440
read was quite astute.

1022
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,120
I mean,

1023
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:22,940
quite astute.

1024
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,960
And I had even fantasized

1025
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,260
about encapsulating my feelings

1026
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,200
recently, and now I feel

1027
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:30,960
as if my

1028
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,360
rags have been thundered,

1029
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,980
or my nose has been closed,

1030
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,560
or whatever the phrase is.

1031
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,120
My thunder's been stolen,

1032
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,580
and therefore, I can't reign.

1033
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,380
I can just watch it and enjoy it.

1034
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,860
Well, if you can enjoy it,

1035
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,380
that's great.

1036
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,840
No, I can't really enjoy it.

1037
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,700
See, that's the thing.

1038
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,060
We don't know what to do about it.

1039
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,420
What are you going to do, run for president?

1040
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:56,960
Heh.

1041
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:57,640
Heh.

1042
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,720
Just think of the...

1043
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,660
abject...

1044
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,280
abject...

1045
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,700
feelings of...

1046
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,980
feelings of abject...

1047
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,520
failure in all of us when we hear that.

1048
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,220
We realize that there's nothing we can do

1049
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,540
with a capital N.

1050
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,380
Our leaders are stupid,

1051
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,640
so I'm going to run for president.

1052
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,080
Yeah.

1053
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,780
Donald Trump,

1054
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,800
2011.

1055
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,260
He actually said that, Princess Lee.

1056
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:25,940
Yes, I know.

1057
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,600
If they still had Monty Pythons,

1058
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,160
fa-tang, fa-tang, wing-wing-wing,

1059
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,840
he didn't say this,

1060
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,800
so I'm going to run for president part.

1061
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,220
Princess Lee has a fa-tang, fa-tang, fa-tang part thing.

1062
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,580
I do have that.

1063
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,420
On the end of her tail.

1064
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,200
But, but, but you've stolen my thunder,

1065
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,000
Reverend Stan!

1066
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,600
You've stolen my thunder again!

1067
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,320
Give it back or Thor will demand it

1068
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,480
from you at a later time

1069
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,120
in a place where you won't like it,

1070
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,140
like over the commode.

1071
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:53,860
Please.

1072
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,760
I don't want your thunder to be stolen.

1073
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,140
Please don't let that story feel...

1074
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,540
like your th-

1075
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,400
th- your thunder's been stolen.

1076
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:03,940
It's not.

1077
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,080
And thanks to many, many of those

1078
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,600
who could not be here tonight

1079
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,180
because they, uh,

1080
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,200
were somewhere else,

1081
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,360
we can only relay the message

1082
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,620
that we've come here to relay,

1083
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,960
and, and it is

1084
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,860
that your thunder is one of your most

1085
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,080
precious bodily fluids.

1086
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,080
Not only number one and two

1087
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,480
are involved in this tacit pact

1088
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,320
with the devil,

1089
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,560
but three and four and other numbers,

1090
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,800
these are super narrow,

1091
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,040
narrow, narrow,

1092
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,860
numerary numbers.

1093
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,400
It's funny you should mention that.

1094
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,080
Because later on in that,

1095
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,480
in that agent's report,

1096
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,800
the, I think in part four,

1097
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,160
Bob, Mr. Dobbs is described as

1098
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,540
suddenly saying,

1099
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,460
I have to go do number three.

1100
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,160
And he puts his head inside

1101
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,820
some kind of a device and makes horrible,

1102
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,600
horrible noises for a long time.

1103
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,880
And whatever number three is,

1104
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,520
it makes him feel a lot better

1105
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,580
after he's done it.

1106
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,420
Well, it's the evacuation of the angst,

1107
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,760
nausea of this existence.

1108
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,380
That's what Bob is releasing as much

1109
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,720
as we would do mid-defic,

1110
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,600
you know, things and bodily fluids.

1111
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,220
Some people misunderstand what Church

1112
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,980
of the Subgenius is all about.

1113
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:23,800
They hear that word,

1114
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,760
and of course, since they're pinks,

1115
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,500
all they hear is the word genius.

1116
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,340
They can't put together what we're really saying,

1117
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,220
subgenius.

1118
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,880
And one of them on the internet,

1119
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,760
one of the, one of the silliest said,

1120
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,640
and I think he meant this,

1121
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,200
I hate people who think they're better than everybody else.

1122
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,660
And one of the subgeniuses pointed out,

1123
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,340
said, what you're saying is you're better than us.

1124
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,460
And that kind of sums up the standard kook worldview

1125
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,900
in just two sentences.

1126
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,580
I hate people who think

1127
00:48:58,580 --> 00:48:59,820
they're better than everybody else.

1128
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,580
And that's why I'm better than all of you.

1129
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,020
Well, that's the, that's what,

1130
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,620
I guess that's what it's all about.

1131
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,060
Neatly done, number one.

1132
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,700
When you hear that, I mean,

1133
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,060
you realize that everyone is a victim to this ploy of the,

1134
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,600
oh, whatever they are, whoever they might be

1135
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,920
and wherever they might really,

1136
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,060
really come from their origination is not our concern

1137
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,260
at this moment, but we all know what it does

1138
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,560
to us subconsciously.

1139
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,780
How it takes, doesn't give,

1140
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,360
how it pees where it frees,

1141
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,140
it feels like,

1142
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,120
it how it.

1143
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah.

1144
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,380
Yet the big it.

1145
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,580
It.

1146
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,220
The combine, the machine, the conspiracy, the man.

1147
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:44,400
Something.

1148
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,280
The man's man.

1149
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,120
You know.

1150
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,660
The you know takes this, you know and sticks it in the you

1151
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,020
know,

1152
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:54,960
and then.

1153
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,780
I think we all know what happens then.

1154
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,560
That's another one.

1155
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,320
It doesn't take much to know beyond that, does it?

1156
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,280
What's the next step, Commander?

1157
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:13,760
The next step is to learn more of the word of Bob at every chance you get.

1158
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,800
Because you never know when it's all going to be snatched away from you.

1159
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:21,300
All of it. The whole internet. The whole system of communication.

1160
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,980
All of it could go down instantly.

1161
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:30,480
Innocently. Overnight. One special internet bomb could put everything out of whack.

1162
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,700
And then where would you be?

1163
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,480
Why, you'd be out on the street getting exercise.

1164
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,360
You'd be off your butt.

1165
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:44,760
You'd be forced to think for yourself instead of copying this extremist that you're reading on the internet

1166
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,840
who'd tell you exactly what you most wanted to hear over and over and over again

1167
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,200
until it becomes, why, true.

1168
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,180
And what do you think we're doing now, my friend?

1169
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:02,500
Telling you that you are better than everyone else just because you're a subgenius.

1170
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,860
Of course, we're only talking to the subgeniuses when we say that.

1171
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,360
Many listeners may not have joined the church.

1172
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,980
Those who are listening at this moment.

1173
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:17,260
And those who did join the church were not all subgeniuses.

1174
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,820
But we're not saying we're better because we're smart.

1175
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,720
Or more moral or more ethical or handsomer.

1176
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,720
Certainly not.

1177
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,080
No, we're just better.

1178
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,060
That's all.

1179
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:32,820
And why?

1180
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,640
Because we've got Bob and they don't.

1181
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:39,120
Or rather, Bob has us and Bob doesn't have them.

1182
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,520
Doesn't want them.

1183
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,620
Doesn't want their paltry cabbage and gravel.

1184
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,980
He doesn't need pink money.

1185
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,040
He wants green money.

1186
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:51,620
Yeah.

1187
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,560
He takes a look around.

1188
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,260
He sees green.

1189
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,320
He says, that's the color of money.

1190
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,480
I can hear it in the back of my skull.

1191
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,380
It's like somebody's been tapping me with a blue foreskin.

1192
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,700
Some angel's been looming over my head, barking strange commands.

1193
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,440
But I don't care.

1194
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,200
I don't listen.

1195
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,620
I pay attention.

1196
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:09,580
Sure, yeah.

1197
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,300
I know they're telling me to do the right thing.

1198
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,660
Sometimes it's not always the right thing.

1199
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,400
But yeah, yeah, I listen.

1200
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:17,780
Close enough.

1201
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,780
Certainly close enough to the right thing.

1202
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,020
Close enough for subgenius work.

1203
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,100
That's what she said.

1204
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:32,660
Well, I was surprised they didn't poison everybody and the whole crew the way things were going.

1205
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,200
The whole group was out of wine, so to speak.

1206
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,840
They refused to call in.

1207
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,480
They didn't visit the safe houses regularly.

1208
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:49,600
And when it came to following around this Dobbs character, which you'll notice is on page 300 of the memorandum.

1209
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,000
I already sent you the back page.

1210
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,240
Yeah, that's the one.

1211
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,060
There he is there with the pipe and the whole routine.

1212
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,040
There's a couple of photographs.

1213
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,300
Already been memorized and shredded.

1214
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,500
It's all taken care of.

1215
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,300
That's been pre-planned, you see.

1216
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,440
The overture was the epilogue.

1217
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:12,380
The prologue was prolonged so that we'd have it our way.

1218
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,060
You understand what I'm saying?

1219
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:14,220
Our way.

1220
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:20,360
The way of Bob, my friends.

1221
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,020
Yes.

1222
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,300
And, uh...

1223
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,420
Uh, yes.

1224
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,840
Dear friends, if you want to know more about J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1225
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,520
why, all you have to do...

1226
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,240
This is only if you want to know more.

1227
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:43,880
You can look at a website called subgenius.com.

1228
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:49,360
Not to be confused with subgeniaus.com, which is a silly one.

1229
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,360
Uh...

1230
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,520
This is Doctors for Bob.

1231
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,840
This is Doctors for Bob in the background, by the way.

1232
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:59,360
What we were hearing earlier was instrumental music from the Twilight Zone.

1233
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:06,960
It actually was music from the show, the Twilight Zone, not music composed in the literal Twilight Zone.

1234
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:12,760
What we're listening to now in the background was composed in the literal Twilight Zone,

1235
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,620
but was not used on the television show.

1236
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:18,480
It's one of my favorite bands, also, I might add.

1237
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,580
Me too.

1238
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,600
One of the original band that wouldn't die.

1239
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,360
You know, I have...

1240
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,280
Songs?

1241
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,700
Well, this is the...

1242
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,840
The title is Can't Hide.

1243
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,160
You can't hide from Bob.

1244
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,120
You can't hide.

1245
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:37,280
But I don't want to quote the lyrics because the person who wrote half some of the lyrics has been unpersoned.

1246
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:43,760
The other half, I could do the part that Sterno wrote, but I don't know which ones are which.

1247
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,820
That's Sterno on the bass.

1248
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,100
And, uh...

1249
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,540
Gordon X on guitar.

1250
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,200
And Martin and Linda on keyboards.

1251
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,220
So...

1252
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:02,240
I don't think they let Snavely in the band, even though he started the band.

1253
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,280
Oh, well.

1254
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,540
But that's all for the Subgenius History course.

1255
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,300
And we're running out of time here.

1256
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,900
It's about five minutes for the hour.

1257
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:12,240
And I wanted to play a birthday for...

1258
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,840
It's Onan's birthday, Dave.

1259
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,640
Onan Canabite's birthday.

1260
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,120
It's also Philo's birthday.

1261
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,520
But I've already played a little Philo.

1262
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,000
Happy birthday to those fellows.

1263
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:21,660
And it's...

1264
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,660
It's Azo the Friendly God's birthday.

1265
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:24,900
Yes, our rival...

1266
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:30,540
The rival cult, the cult of the living bull, was born on this day.

1267
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,100
May 1st.

1268
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:35,960
But I don't know when, what year that bull was born.

1269
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,180
I think it was born 5,000 years ago.

1270
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,880
In the temples of Sumer.

1271
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,900
The year zero.

1272
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,660
Oh, oh, oh.

1273
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,860
Oh, oh, oh, man.

1274
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,140
That's right.

1275
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,880
P.O. Box 181.

1276
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:52,940
417.

1277
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,380
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1278
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:57,820
44118.

1279
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:03,260
That's where you will find the big O between the two blessed Bs.

1280
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,140
Be not egregious.

1281
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,840
Send now or reply soon, please.

1282
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,540
But of course.

1283
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:18,940
And now we shall, as I said, we're going to play the song by the great Reverend Uncle Dr. Onan Canabite.

1284
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,940
This is his remix.

1285
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:21,640
Actually, this is...

1286
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:21,640


1287
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:29,820
This is part two of the remix of his masterpiece known as B.O.B.

1288
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,400
Thank you, Dave, and goodbye.

1289
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,320
Okay.

1290
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:33,700
Okay.

1291
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:35,280
Okay.

1292
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:39,800
Okay.

1293
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:40,380
Okay.

1294
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:40,680
Okay.

1295
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:40,680


1296
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,040
Okay.

1297
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,040


1298
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,040


1299
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,360
Okay.

1300
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:42,360


1301
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:42,400
Okay.

1302
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,080
Okay.

1303
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:43,320
Okay.

1304
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,140
Okay.

1305
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:44,140


1306
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:44,140


1307
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:44,140


1308
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:44,140


1309
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,840
Okay.

1310
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,520
Okay.

1311
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,580
We'll be right back.

1312
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:39,400
We'll be right back.

1313
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,260
We'll be right back.

1314
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,380
We'll be right back.

1315
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,040
We'll be right back.

1316
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,560
We'll be right back.

1317
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:47,440
We'll be right back.
