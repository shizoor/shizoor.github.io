Bob hates you.

150
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,060
J.R. Bob Dobbs has answered all of my prayers.

151
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,900
He even told me go and fling myself down the stairs.

152
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,540
I did it on alert, but now I'm glad.

153
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,660
Bob loves me and I love Bob.

154
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,380
He hates you.

155
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,260
You may love Bob, but Bob hates you, Dave.

157
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,500

158
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:24,680

159
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:24,920
He hates you.

160
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:24,960


161
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,200
He hates you.

162
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,200


163
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,200


164
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,460
down the stairs for fun.

165
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,360
Oh, I love Bob, and Bob loves me.

166
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,700
We're sweet and slimy just like little bees on a tree.

167
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,320
And he told me on Valentine's Day,

168
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,460
and I'm sending flowers and chocolate.

169
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,720
And he loves me anyway.

170
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,460
I said, Bob loves me, and I love Bob.

171
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,320
He hates me.

172
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,180
What could be more pure?

173
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,880
It's the purest form of love anyone could imagine.

174
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,280
He answers all my letters.

175
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,340
He calls me up and leaves messages on my phone.

176
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,520
He's always with me.

177
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,600
He's always with me.

178
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,340
The computer does all of that, Dave.

179
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,100
Don't be a sucker.

180
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,000
Bob loves everyone except you, Dave.

181
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,340
Because you were so stupid as to believe him

182
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,500
when he said he loved you that first time.

183
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,580
He tells that to all the boys, believe me.

184
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,520
Bob loves me.

185
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,820
It's not a torture kind of thing.

186
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,700
It's pure and beautiful and selfish.

187
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,760
Oh, I love Bob.

188
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,300
Stop, stop, stop telling me you don't love him.

189
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,220
This is what Bob meant when he said,

190
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,720
pull the wool over your own eyes.

191
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,620
I can't see anything.

192
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,880
Oh, I'm going blind.

193
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,280
I'm going blind.

194
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,120
But you can still see Bob in your mind's eye, can't you, Dave?

195
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,400
My mind.

196
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,220
You never stop seeing Bob in your mind's eye.

197
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,960
I can't stop.

198
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,700
Such as it is.

199
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,200
My mind?

200
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,200
What there is of it.

201
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:01,860
What?

202
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,340
What?

203
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,200
Your mind.

204
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,420
Your mind is no longer your friend.

205
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,920
I'm a physical person.

206
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,820
I'm in love.

207
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,580
I'm in lust.

208
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
I'm in love with Bob and I don't care what you say.

209
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,400
I love Bob and Bob loves me.

210
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,900
Bob does love a fool.

211
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,900
That's true.

212
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,860
Bob loves the fools of this world and truly the king of fools.

213
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:22,860


214
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:22,860


215
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:22,860


216
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:22,860


217
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:22,860


218
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:22,860


219
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:22,860


220
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:22,860


221
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:22,860


222
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:22,860


223
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,800
This lonesome cowboy Dave.

224
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,220
Now performing the greatest guitar solo in the universe.

225
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,540
Rock out, baby.

226
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,040
Play it, Dave.

227
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,500
I don't hear the music, but don't make me go crazy.

228
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,560
What do you mean, which one?

229
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,760
I thought there was always strings.

230
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,780
And you see, friends, you'll see how the love of Bob has freed Dave from that

231
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:52,840
mental state of mind.

232
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,840


233
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,840


234
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,840


235
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,840


236
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,840


237
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,840


238
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,840


239
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,840


240
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,840


241
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,840


242
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,840


243
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,840


244
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,840


245
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,520
He's a real life around him.

246
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,960
He pays no attention to, uh, the, what other people might think of him.

247
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,100
Sure they think he's a, a, a fool, an idiot, a bad person.

248
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,660
There's a half-janger.

249
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,940
I'm blue value.

250
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,320
But he's happy.

251
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,080
You can hear the simple happiness in his voice.

252
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,360


253
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,420
He's a form of things.

254
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,460
I, I can't begin to express how happy I am when I think about it.

255
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,580
Oh, don't think about it.

256
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,800
You won't be so happy.

257
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:22,840


258
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:22,840


259
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:22,840


260
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:22,840


261
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:22,840


262
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:22,840


263
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,560
You'll stop and think about it.

264
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,320
Now, will you, Dave?

265
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,020
Why are my pants all wet and what's wrong with me?

266
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,300
And how come I can't close my mouth or open my eyes?

267
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,840
And why doesn't Bob ever call a writer, answer my letters, or leave anything on my message

268
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,220
machine?

269
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,380
You're not losing your faith now, are you, Dave?

270
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,580
That would be a great sin, a grievous sin indeed.

271
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,300
To lose one's faith.

272
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,160
To lose one's faith in Bob.

273
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:52,820
I'm so sorry, Dave.

274
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:52,820


275
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:52,820


276
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:52,820


277
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:52,820


278
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:52,820


279
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:52,820


280
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:52,820


281
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:52,820


282
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:52,820


283
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:52,820


284
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:52,820


285
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:52,820


286
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,200
No.

287
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,820
I'm not that good.

288
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,240
He has no faith in Bob.

289
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,560
Bob has no faith.

290
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,680
He has no faith.

291
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,580
Meaning, he only has a head.

292
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,360
He cannot have a faith in a head.

293
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,000
It's what to the words of God.

294
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,620
Jonas had two faces on his head.

295
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,840
Neither one of them were looking at the same thing at the same time.

296
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,640
Bob Eggo and them.

297
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,060
Bob?

298
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,120
How?

299
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,580
It was an accident.

300
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,860
Bob kills pigs dead.

301
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,300
Bob kills pigs dead.

302
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,780
Bob.

303
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,800
Bob kills pigs dead.

304
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:22,800


305
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:22,800


306
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:22,800


307
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:22,800


308
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:35,140
kill big dead Bob kill big dead Bob kill big dead Bob kill big dead kill

309
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,560
angry

310
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,660
angry

311
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,800
angry

312
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,560
angry

313
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,360
killed Kunst

314
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:51,920
killed downwards

315
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,400
Volleyball

316
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:54,920
saw

317
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,560
Who

318
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,640
kill big dead

319
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,400
Brand

320
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,760
bomb

321
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:00,980
skill

322
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,560
heat

323
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:01,960
that

324
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,320
tää

325
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,600
Bob, Bob, Bob's, Bob's own Bob's head.

326
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,140
Bob, Bob's, Bob's own Bob's head.

327
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,760
Bob struggled again for air while smelling his rank body odor.

328
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,780
Bob knew it was wrong.

329
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,280
Bob, Bob, Bob.

330
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,060
A beer and a good laugh and then a good night's sleep.

331
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,960
My bourbon Kentucky.

332
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,360
Bob, Bob.

333
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,340
Too much beer.

334
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,120
Bob asked, how is your daughter?

335
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,100
I would ask her, but she's still unconscious.

336
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,720
Bob, Bob.

337
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,480
Some big punk something out of a nightmare.

338
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,340
Fly legs and spider heads through his brain.

339
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,120
One sip and I'm gone.

340
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,980
Oh my God.

341
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,000
Then he got down to it.

342
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,040
Bob, perfect round black hole.

343
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,820
Bob, entry positions in the rear.

344
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,340
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

345
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,020
Bob, Bob's, Bob's own Bob's head.

346
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,580
Bob, Bob's, Bob's own Bob's head.

347
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,120
Oh my God.

348
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,740
might remember Bob, Bob's own tragic moment.

349
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,320
Holy shit.

350
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,320


351
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,540
I never cried.

352
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:16,540


353
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,300
Behind a knife well, old school in college with noviolog.

354
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:20,960
Captain detective equivalent.

355
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:26,820
I finally remembered all my horny defects.

356
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,180
Do it.

357
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,500
And it drew me to come see.

358
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,920
And the sewage, it formed a message.

359
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,500
It said 13013.

360
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,440
I then heard a voice from Doves Town

361
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,300
Gently saying, follow me.

362
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:00,580
There's a froth farm down the valley

363
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,740
There's a froth farm past the rain

364
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:12,060
There's a froth farm in your sorrows

365
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,440
When your mind is going insane

366
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:23,300
There's a froth farm when you're burdened

367
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,280
There's a froth farm when you're burdened

368
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,700
There's a froth farm where you stray

369
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,400
There's a froth farm, heavenly froth farm

370
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,720
For kill me, it is safe

371
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,740
Sometimes my friends forsake me

372
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,400
And I'm tempted to despair

373
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,460
When I summon

374
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,280
When I summon my friends

375
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,480
When I summon my friends

376
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,960
And I hear

377
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,060
You would pay to know exactly

378
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,160
What it is you really think

379
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,020
And I'll guarantee you, my brother

380
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,500
You are probably hoping

381
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:27,960
There's a froth farm down the valley

382
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,780
There's a froth farm past the rain

383
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,860
There's a froth farm in your sorrows

384
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,100
When your mind is going insane

385
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,560
There's a froth farm when you're burdened

386
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,080
There's a froth farm where you stray

387
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:00,500
There's a froth farm, heavenly froth farm

388
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,040
For kill me, it is safe

389
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,420
There's a froth farm, heavenly froth farm

390
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,920
For kill me, it is safe

391
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,180
There's a froth farm, heavenly froth farm

392
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,200
For kill me, it is safe

393
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:32,660
There's a froth farm, heavenly froth farm

394
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:49,400
For kill me, it is safe

395
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:07,960
There's a froth farm, heavenly froth farm

396
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,100
For kill me, it is safe

397
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:16,880
There's a froth farm, heavenly froth farm

398
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,380
For kill me, it is safe

399
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:35,240
There's a froth farm, heavenly froth farm

400
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,260
For kill me, it is safe

401
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:49,360
There's a froth farm, heavenly froth farm

402
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,360


403
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,260
For kill me, it is safe

404
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,920
There's a froth farm, heavenly froth farm

405
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,260
For kill me, it is safe

406
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,060
There's a froth farm, heavenly froth farm

407
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:16,360
For kill me, it is safe

408
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,860
Thank you.

409
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,340
Thank you.

410
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,280
Big, pure love.

411
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,500
I love you.

412
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,380
That's all, folks, for now.

413
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,640
Yes, dear friends.

414
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,200
We've been

415
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,720
collecting old Bob songs

416
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,120
from 2008 to today

417
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,140
lately, because we haven't assembled

418
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,040
our yearly Bob song album since

419
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,080
2007.

420
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,280
And I'm going to give some credits

421
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,260
here as soon as

422
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,060
I put you on

423
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,000
by putting on Lonesome

424
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,080
Cowboy Dave.

425
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,240
It sounds so different

426
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,400
and far away.

427
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,900
I'm sorry.

428
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,080
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,120
Yeah, I'm

430
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,080
in a pickle tonight.

431
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,320
Really?

432
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,700
Yeah, I'm in a natural

433
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,240
kosher dill pickle right at this moment.

434
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,100
See, I have

435
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,860
come in contact with various

436
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,400
extraterrestrial entities.

437
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,700
I've heard that before.

438
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,660
Beings. I don't know if they're the nephilim

439
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,000
or the nephilim or whatever it is

440
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,080
or anything like that.

441
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,220
But give me secret arcane sciences

442
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,040
to which I can

443
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,080
tap into at any time.

444
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,760
It's a brotherhood of

445
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,240
swine.

446
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,000
You know, there's a mentally ill guy

447
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,100
who leaves me a message saying pretty much

448
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,480
the same thing on my phone

449
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,140
40 or 50 times

450
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,640
a week.

451
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,620
He also sends you pictures of himself

452
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,060
walking around in an athletic supporter

453
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,260
or nothing else, I think.

454
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,740
I wish.

455
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,020
No, we haven't seen anything like that, Dave.

456
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,880
But is

457
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,240
what you're saying, is what that song

458
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,960
that we just heard said, which is

459
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,440
that not even Bob can save you now?

460
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,360
No.

461
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,500
Yes.

462
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,380
I don't like that.

463
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,680
I don't like it either.

464
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,800
In fact, it makes me want to sing my

465
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,500
I Love My Nipples song,

466
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,140
which I just recorded a couple days ago

467
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,240
and I really wanted to play, but I'm

468
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,700
at six now, which goes like this,

469
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,360
but it's not very, very interesting.

470
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,200
My little fucking crab lice.

471
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,880
It's doing themselves to here.

472
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,380
Did you hear that, did you?

473
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,280
I heard something about crab lice.

474
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,460
Oh, boy.

475
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,240
I hope.

476
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,940
I hope.

477
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,180
I hope.

478
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,500
I hope.

479
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,060
I hope.

480
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,460
I hope.

481
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:18,460


482
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:18,980
I heard my song.

483
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,800
I love to sing to my nipples.

484
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,100
I love to sing to my knees.

485
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,660
All sandwiches were made for sucking.

486
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,180
Big hairy pimples were hocking.

487
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,720
Put down in the trees.

488
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,360
What's going on?

489
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,800
Is this like a new wire recording that you made, Dave, using actual wire?

490
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,520
That's pretty hard to hear.

491
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,860
Did you cut me off?

492
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:09,580
No.

493
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,060
No.

494
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,680
No, I was about to.

495
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,580
Yeah, I didn't blame you.

496
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,920
I wouldn't blame you after hearing the first parts.

497
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,440
Also, I hope I didn't let a dirty word flip by there.

498
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,160
I hope not, too.

499
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,200
I couldn't really understand any of it.

500
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,160
I hope not, three.

501
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,940
I have to do credits.

502
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,780
Yeah, friends, let's backtrack just a second.

503
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,760
Hold on, Dave, while I explain a couple of things.

504
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,120
As I said, we've been collecting old Bob songs together to make new Bob song albums,

505
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,560
which we will put on the internet.

506
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,660
Because nobody buys CDs anymore.

507
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:56,520
And the instrumental we were just listening to was When the Saucers Come by Brain Leak.

508
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,360
And I don't know whether that was Reverend Brain Leak, son of Kay Wren and Eggplant,

509
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,780
but they're in our thoughts anyway.

510
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,160
They sure are.

511
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,380
Before that, a song, the Bluegrass song, A Frop Farm in the Valley,

512
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,460
was the Mutant Mountain.

513
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,560
The Mutant Mountain Boys recorded it last X day.

514
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,400
Before that, a weird thing about Bob's body odor was by Heart Ignition.

515
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,420
The little chant, Bob kills pinks dead,

516
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:33,040
was the Swingin' Love Corpses from Dr. Philodrumon and his relatives back in the day.

517
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,960
We heard, I love Bob and Bob loves me by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

518
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:44,340
And Einstein's Secret Orchestra recorded the year at WCSB about 100 years ago.

519
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,680
Sounded like babies.

520
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,780
Yeah, we all sounded like babies.

521
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,840
That was the Baby Dave and the Baby Stang and the late Baby Chaz playing.

522
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,740
There was a weird collage-y thing called, well, it was by Christian Blatter.

523
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,980
It was very collage-y and rocky.

524
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,780
And before that, Mutant Mountain Boys again, with the song Bob is Watching You,

525
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,320
recorded in the parking lot of the Beachland Ballroom by yours truly at a devotional.

526
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:21,880
And the song Dread Dobbs, the reggae Bob's hymn, was by Lost Souls Incorporated.

527
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,060
We also heard PR News and Intro by Lemur.

528
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:31,620
And Slackmaster Sarcastro did a little $1 collage.

529
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,640
And praise Bob, and now we're back.

530
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:42,940
So stay tuned on subgenius.com for new Subgenius Bob song albums.

531
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,540
Okay.

532
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,980
The final slice of Jabberwock was near heard, too, by the way.

533
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,560
Aw.

534
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,080
Little snippets and snipes and little perpendicular angles that everybody can crawl out of and go,

535
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,380
my brain hurts.

536
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,020
Does your brain hurt, friend?

537
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,040
Does your brain leak?

538
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:11,260
Does your brain weep and dribble like as heard here on Microphone 2?

539
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,360
That's your cue.

540
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:14,700
No, Dave.

541
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,820
Does your brain gently weep?

542
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,320
It's only one thing you can do.

543
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,480
Make a punishment hole of about 15 yards by 20 degrees in diameter

544
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,040
and place the unborn snippet in the bottom of the barrel.

545
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,880
After reducing it down to a fine powder and an ilky substance remains,

546
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,420
then it is time to take out and complete the albedo portion.

547
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,140
The Raccoon.

548
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,860
Once a...

549
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,520
Magma!

550
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,160
How you doing, Magma?

551
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,280
Do you...

552
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,980
Do you force it on now?

553
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,320
Is it later?

554
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,740
Yes, it's later and now.

555
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,860
Well, you've done slack thought.

556
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,420
You've removed yourself from the temporal thermometer.

557
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,220
That's the reason why you can say that.

558
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,340
But you can't say it again because you've already said it twice.

559
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,920
So if you go back and forth and back and forth,

560
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,300
then time starts up again.

561
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,840
That's true.

562
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,680
Did Bob back in time you, Dave?

563
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,480
Did he come along and back in time you?

564
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,540
Did he?

565
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:28,920
Yeah.

566
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,700
He came, he snuck up from back in time me

567
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,100
and jumped into the future as well at the same time.

568
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,160
That's when the permissive organs came out.

569
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,780
I had to bomb for you.

570
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,100
Permissive organs!

571
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,220
I know about those.

572
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,320
I'm still hurting from those permissive organs, Dave!

573
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:44,960
of Bob.

574
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,680
He's the one who gets permission

575
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,300
and you are the one who are forced to obey the rules.

576
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,780
That's what I don't like about it.

577
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,900
But there's a lot of things I don't like about it.

578
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,580
I think Bob's smarmy.

579
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,660
You know what I mean?

580
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,940
Well, that's just the...

581
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,780
You know that pallid mug with the drool

582
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,600
and, you know...

583
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,300
Oh, he's just old-fashioned.

584
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,160
You know, that's just the way people of his generation are.

585
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,720
He's a little older than us.

586
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,440
Yeah, we do the pipe and spit.

587
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,480
Tip your hat.

588
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,560
Tip your hat to women.

589
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
These people in the 1950s

590
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,740
still had the habit of tipping hats,

591
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,660
which they wore,

592
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,220
at women walking or, you know,

593
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,280
people walking down the street.

594
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,440
What?

595
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,560
You know, what?

596
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,360
That's like, you know...

597
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,040
Well, in those days,

598
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,240
the hats weren't stapled onto the wearer's head

599
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,260
like the fashion is now,

600
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,500
or sewn on.

601
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,480
Yeah.

602
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,780
The bottom fuses are what confuse a lot of people.

603
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,300
The fact that all those parts are soldered together

604
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,460
now, they're not, you know, discreet parts.

605
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,740
Well, I think usually the reason they sew the hat on

606
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,460
or shave the head

607
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,640
is to hide the fact that they are balding.

608
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,220
It's as simple as that.

609
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,000
It's just vanity.

610
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,240
If you shave your head bald,

611
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,680
then nobody can tell you're balding.

612
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,080
And if you wear a hat all the time,

613
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,960
nobody can tell how bad your haircut is.

614
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,420
That's why I wear that blue hat all the time.

615
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,780
Yes, but you're not balding.

616
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,320
You're just...

617
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,720
You're thinning a little bit.

618
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
You're receding a little bit,

619
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,280
but you're not balding.

620
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,300
You don't understand the abject misery and pain

621
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,920
of having a bald pate.

622
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,880
Not completely, no.

623
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,100
No.

624
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,600
No, is it miserable, Dave?

625
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,720
Is it really that bad?

626
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,360
Oh, yes.

627
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,180
It's, you know, like you try to pick up a girl at a bar

628
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,840
or maybe in a playground or something,

629
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,220
and the first thing that comes out of your mind

630
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,960
is,

631
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,300
do you got a bald?

632
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,900
Or you make some bald joke or something.

633
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,900
You're balder than I am.

634
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,280
Or something like that.

635
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,040
You're drawing attention to your disability,

636
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,100
your infirmity, your deformity.

637
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,040
Let's go ahead and be...

638
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,240
Come on, let's face it.

639
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,620
If you're balding,

640
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,100
that just means you're weak, inferior.

641
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,080
Whatever happened to bald is sexy?

642
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,380
I don't understand.

643
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,180
Oh, well, that's what the bald people invented.

644
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,200
The balding people invented bald is sexy.

645
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:02,660
But of course.

646
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,360
Then they shaved all their hair off,

647
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,740
and now all of a sudden it's sexy.

648
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,540
Yes.

649
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,840
All the young boys shave their heads.

650
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,020
Women are attracted to bald men

651
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,480
if they're...

652
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,380
like a father or uncle was bald.

653
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,280
Nobody in their family was bald.

654
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,880
They view it as a handicap.

655
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,260
But the style that my nephew thought up

656
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,280
never caught on

657
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,600
where young men would shave

658
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,940
just the top of their heads

659
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,920
and leave the row going all the way around

660
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,100
from ear to ear.

661
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,640
Like a monk, right?

662
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,500
Yes, like a monk.

663
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,260
It's a beard on top.

664
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,660
Yes.

665
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,120
Yeah, I could have a little goatee

666
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,880
on the top of my head and a little mustache.

667
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,880
Our friend sent tentatively a convenience.

668
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,880
A great...

669
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,400
He wrote the Performance Art 101 book.

670
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,200
Yes.

671
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,120
Tentatively, for a long time,

672
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,340
wore his hair cut in mustaches.

673
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,180
He had a...

674
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,800
In fact, he appears in a rise that way.

675
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,200
Yes, he had mustaches all over his head.

676
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:01,540
Yeah.

677
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,500
He looked like Alfred Jari.

678
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,960
He drank too much absinthe,

679
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,700
and that's why his brain putrefied.

680
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,060
Well, now, tentatively later,

681
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,460
he shaved the mustaches off of the top,

682
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,080
off of his head,

683
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,680
and had a brain tattooed on there

684
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,260
so that it looked like, you know,

685
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,740
he had a...

686
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,460
He was not a skinhead, but a brainhead.

687
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,700
He looked as if the top of his skull

688
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,420
had been removed

689
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,840
if the tattoo was a little more realistic.

690
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,860
Now, he has a full head of hair now,

691
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,580
so you can't see his brain.

692
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,920
But if he shaved his head off...

693
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,580
If he shaved his head off,

694
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,260
you'd be able to see his brain

695
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,760
if he then shaved the hair off of the head.

696
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:42,840
Yes.

697
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,280
There's no mistaking...

698
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,180
Well, I'm sure that it was a false brain.

699
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,060
I'm sorry I didn't hear you.

700
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,300
Right.

701
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,200
It wasn't his real brain.

702
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,620
It was just an image, a simulacrum,

703
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,080
a facsimile of a brain.

704
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,600
A simulacrum...

705
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,800
A drawing of a brain.

706
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
...of a better brain is what I heard,

707
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,520
of an actual superior brain.

708
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,980
Well, I think he asked him...

709
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,920
He said, can you draw more convolutions?

710
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,840
Because I've got...

711
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,780
In reality, he had kind of a smooth noodle map,

712
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,940
like all of us subgeniuses.

713
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,520
Mm-hmm.

714
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,700
So he...

715
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,920
He had him roughing it up

716
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,640
in the brain tattoo on his head.

717
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,280
But there's no concealing

718
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,360
his purple and green eyebrow tattoo.

719
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,380
Is that a tattoo?

720
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,460
I believe so.

721
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,200
One is green and one's purple.

722
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,720
I thought the hair was just dyed.

723
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,940
I think he has green and blue

724
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,240
on one of his eyebrows.

725
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,180
Now, it would be really cool

726
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,920
if he could have a green eye and a blue eye

727
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,280
and they weren't contacts.

728
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,600
He'd be like Frankie Stein.

729
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:38,720
Yes.

730
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,440
Our girlfriend on Monster High.

731
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,780
Or David Bowie.

732
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,880
Oh, that's fake, though.

733
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,500
No, no.

734
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,400
Is he really deformed that way?

735
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,960
He was born with two different colored eyes.

736
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,600
Well, well, well.

737
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,420
So...

738
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,660
I was aware once of a person

739
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,780
born with these yellow eyes.

740
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,700
And he had no problems with vision or anything,

741
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,160
but the eye was yellow.

742
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,040
And I'm going to shut up now.

743
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,180
You mean the pupil of the eye was yellow?

744
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,960
The central part?

745
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,520
No, not the pupil.

746
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,460
The pupil.

747
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,760
No, the part that's hazel blue or brown.

748
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,420
The iris.

749
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,360
That guy's yellow.

750
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,800
That was yellow.

751
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,800
The yellow rat bastard.

752
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,620
Now, I knew...

753
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,320
I met a guy standing in line selling...

754
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:23,820
That's all you could tell.

755
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,140
Once in...

756
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,040
The weekend after the Heaven's Gate,

757
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,940
people killed themselves.

758
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,020
I was standing and selling subgenius goods

759
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:37,500
outside a survival research lab show in Austin.

760
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,960
And a guy walked up to me and conversed with me.

761
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,460
We had intercourse, you might say.

762
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:42,460


763
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,760
He had...

764
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,300
Double pupils in his eyes.

765
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,380
His eyes were very, very strange.

766
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,500
It was like something out of Ripley's

767
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,900
Believe It or Not catalog.

768
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,400
It really didn't look right.

769
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,660
I'm serious.

770
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,240
He had...

771
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,300
You could say he had four pupils on his two eyes.

772
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:04,700
Goodness.

773
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,280
And he was associated with Heaven's Gate.

774
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:07,920
No.

775
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,120
This just happened to be...

776
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,220
I'm just...

777
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,380
I'm dating it by...

778
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:12,960
Saying that.

779
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,160
I guess it was 1995.

780
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,460
Anyway, he...

781
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:16,900
I said,

782
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,260
Wow.

783
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,160
That must really impress the ladies.

784
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,780
And he said...

785
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,780
He got a really, really sad look on his face.

786
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,180
And he goes,

787
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,100
No, I wish.

788
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,660
But it has just the opposite effect.

789
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,120
It creeps him out.

790
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,900
It was very sad.

791
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,400
I thought it was pretty cool, but...

792
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,980
His vision wasn't good.

793
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,340
And he didn't...

794
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:42,860
Get...

795
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,040
Picked up in bars because of his double pupils.

796
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,220
He never met any fellow beautiful mutants.

797
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,800
Right.

798
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,940
Think if he'd gone to X-Day.

799
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,440
Yes.

800
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,800
They'd be beaten.

801
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,100
He'd have to beat them off.

802
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,340
Yes.

803
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,180
And blast them.

804
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,280
The living dead.

805
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,400
But he...

806
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,340
There's an alternative story about the Heaven's Gate cult.

807
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,180
Heaven's Gate?

808
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,320
Long before they were known as Heaven's Gate,

809
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,380
they were peeping poop or something like that.

810
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:10,660
Oh, yeah.

811
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,280
Bo and Pete.

812
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:11,940
Bo and Pete.

813
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:12,540
Bo and Pete.

814
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,200
And they appeared with pretty much the same rigmarole

815
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,360
and the same thing that they were going to lay on everybody.

816
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:17,880
Yeah.

817
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:23,420
And they were at some function at University of Florida in Gainesville.

818
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,640
And there was a person there

819
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,000
who later became a friendly enemy

820
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,360
and an anemic friend at the same time

821
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,160
who had half of his face look like classical handsome Joe,

822
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,580
like right out of some book of like, you know,

823
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,220
a Greek statue or something like that.

824
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:40,440
Mm-hmm.

825
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,440
And the other half of his face,

826
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,880
his face looked like Melton, man.

827
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,160
It was like all drooped out.

828
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:46,980
I guess, you know,

829
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
there were some things wrong there and stuff like that.

830
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,260
Uh-huh.

831
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,000
And it was very bizarre.

832
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,240
And I'm not making fun of handicapped people,

833
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,760
but it was really strange

834
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,440
with the way Heaven's cult,

835
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,780
that cult,

836
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,340
treated the meeting

837
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,980
and the bunch of people

838
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,340
that kind of like were weird looking that were there.

839
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,820
And it was very, very creepy.

840
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,060
Creepy.

841
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:11,920
Creepy.

842
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,440


843
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,440


844
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,440


845
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,440


846
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,440


847
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,440


848
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,440


849
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,440


850
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,440


851
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,440


852
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,440


853
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,440


854
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,440


855
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,440


856
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,440


857
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,640
I mean, the meeting was creepy.

858
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,680
Like, they were like,

859
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,860
they would sit there with their eyes closed

860
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,660
and somebody would be the spokesman guy

861
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,460
and say this stuff.

862
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,560
Maybe they'd nod once in a while or something.

863
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,420
And it looked like they were having this,

864
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,800
you know, communication,

865
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,000
this psychic communication between each other.

866
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,360
And then, you know,

867
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,080
it was very, very creepy

868
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,460
and attracted all kinds of strange people.

869
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,220
I'm sorry, I quit.

870
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,920
Well, when they were traveling around touring

871
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,400
and trying to recruit people

872
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,800
for their castration death cult,

873
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,140
which they had fun doing, apparently,

874
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,160
they all seemed to be very into it.

875
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,640
They came through Dallas

876
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,620
and a friend of mine

877
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,160
who was kind of a new agey feller

878
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,260
and interested in the unknown

879
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,880
and the remarkable

880
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,320
and he was gullible as hell,

881
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,200
let's just face it.

882
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,440
He went and saw him

883
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,240
and he came back

884
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,840
and he told me about it.

885
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,400
He said, man, I'm thinking about leaving Dallas

886
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,480
and moving to El Rancho,

887
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,240
whatever it was,

888
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,840
in California with these people.

889
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,180
And they,

890
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,760
I,

891
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,700
he had a flyer from him

892
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,920
and it was just cram-packed with tiny print

893
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,120
like kook flyers should be,

894
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,660
like ours are.

895
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,860
And I studied it

896
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,700
and I said,

897
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,900
man, I think this is the Bo and Pete people,

898
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,320
the UFO contactees

899
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,340
that were telling everybody the world was going to end.

900
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,560
It's a silly idiot.

901
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,960
They thought it wasn't going to be July 5th, 1998.

902
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,340
They had some other silly,

903
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,240
ridiculous, superstitious date.

904
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,020
So,

905
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,760
I said,

906
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,220
I said,

907
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:41,260
here,

908
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,800
I read up on Bo and Pete

909
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,380
because I think this is the same people.

910
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,960
And he read up on them

911
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,300
and he called me back the next day

912
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:47,620
and he said,

913
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,040
thanks for saving my mind.

914
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,180
I'm not going to join him anyway.

915
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:50,920
And,

916
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,060
now he had gone,

917
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,080
he had videotaped their meeting

918
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,080
and when the Heaven's Gate suicides happened,

919
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:57,520
he went,

920
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:57,840
wow,

921
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,660
those were the people I almost joined

922
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,920
that Reverend Stang taught me out of joining,

923
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,240
but I've got a videotape of them.

924
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,420
And he sold it to CNN for $15,000

925
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,420
and they never showed it

926
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,000
because it was really boring and stupid.

927
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,300
But,

928
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,360
here's what happened to Herf Applewhite,

929
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,980
also known as Doe,

930
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,040
the cult leader of the silly Heaven's Gate people

931
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,340
who could have been subgeniuses

932
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,740
and waited for the end of the world

933
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,760
without cutting off their reproductive organs

934
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,580
and actually probably would have met

935
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,420
some more interesting nerds

936
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,400
than the nerds they met in Heaven's Gate

937
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,020
because anybody,

938
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,480
you know,

939
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,540
who joined Heaven's Gate

940
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,840
would believe the dumbest stuff,

941
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,160
whereas somebody who joined Church of the Subgenius,

942
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,220
they'll believe everything.

943
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,660
Dumb and smart.

944
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,960
But,

945
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,740
I don't believe I'm going to be shaving my nads off

946
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:02,420
like some silly saucer cultists do.

947
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,700
Nay.

948
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,240
Best not.

949
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,740
How many can I shave off anyway?

950
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,840
I mean,

951
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,300
you know,

952
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,560
you know,

953
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:11,560


954
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:11,740
you know,

955
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,480
you should get down to the last thing.

956
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,040
I mean,

957
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,340
luckily,

958
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,960
I've got plenty of other organs

959
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,700
that still roll all over the place, so.

960
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:23,760
Yeah,

961
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:23,940
well,

962
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:27,760
trepanation is a far more skillful art and craft.

963
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,160
Cutting a hole in your head

964
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,400
and maybe letting your brain breathe a bit.

965
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,500
Clearing the lid,

966
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,280
as it were,

967
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,320
over the third eye.

968
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,280
It does have its benefits

969
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,580
and it's way, like,

970
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,500
beyond the applesauce.

971
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,340
It's like,

972
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:42,340


973
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:42,580


974
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,200
you know,

975
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,200


976
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,540
you know,

977
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:44,540


978
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:44,540


979
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:44,540


980
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,620
people like that and stuff.

981
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,640
I think it's far.

982
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,980
L. Ron Hoover.

983
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,480
Yeah.

984
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,180
Yeah.

985
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,400
Joe Hoover.

986
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,860
L. Ron Swaggart.

987
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,520
L. Ron Tilton.

988
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,340
And L. Ron Enron.

989
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,340
That was the rich one.

990
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,560
Yes.

991
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,620
So, yeah.

992
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,020
Yeah, man.

993
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,260
Yeah.

994
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:05,980
So, Dave,

995
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,340
did you hear the beginning of the show?

996
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,600
I've been trying to assemble

997
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,740
new Bob song albums.

998
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,260
Back in the day,

999
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,980
we used to put out a new one every year or so

1000
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,380
because there was so much music piling up.

1001
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,740
And no one bought them.

1002
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,340
But it was great hour of slack stuff.

1003
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,660
And we quit because no one bought them.

1004
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,540
We kind of just quit compiling them.

1005
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,140
But then people started,

1006
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,340
instead of buying CDs,

1007
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,480
now they buy downloads off the internet.

1008
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,160
And people started begging for stuff

1009
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,360
they could download more,

1010
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,120
besides just this show.

1011
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,740
So, we've been unearthed.

1012
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,140
Everything are ancient Bob song albums

1013
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,620
that go all the way back to the 80s

1014
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,680
and they were on cassette tape.

1015
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,380
And I went through every hour of slack since 2008,

1016
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,460
about a month ago,

1017
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,040
for several days.

1018
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,180
And I pulled out everything that looked like a song

1019
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,580
from all those hours of slack.

1020
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,040
And there were some that you had done

1021
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,180
in the studio here

1022
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,120
that we all forgot about.

1023
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,540
Buried treasure.

1024
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,500
But I've been ripping them out again.

1025
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,940
And some of them are remarkably well CSB produced.

1026
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,920
The old studio there had a nice,

1027
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,580
fog-warm sound.

1028
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:20,700
Yeah.

1029
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,920
And we made nice CD-quality recordings in there.

1030
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,080
And we always glib and came up with something,

1031
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,400
you know, that hit the spot at the right time.

1032
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,860
And, oh, we could walk back then

1033
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,280
without that jumble-baggy,

1034
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,160
I mean, the infirm and age.

1035
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,780
And we could sing without worrying

1036
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,260
about our stomachs jumping out.

1037
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,100
I don't know those were the days.

1038
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,600
Back in those days,

1039
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,300
we had to have special filters

1040
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,480
to make us sound old and raggedy.

1041
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,760
And now we can do it just without any filter at all.

1042
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,100
Yeah.

1043
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,000
An extra pack of cigarettes a day,

1044
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,800
that's all it takes.

1045
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,540
Well, Princess, we,

1046
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,960
earlier at the beginning of the show,

1047
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,580
I was playing this really old stuff

1048
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:03,440
from ESO radio from the 90s.

1049
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,100
And it had you and me very clearly.

1050
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,440
But I didn't sound like me.

1051
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,260
And you didn't sound like you.

1052
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,180
It was us.

1053
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,840
But it was like these little babies talking.

1054
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,660
There wasn't that extra micro crackle in the voice

1055
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:24,060
that we get from the 25 years of cigarettes.

1056
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,460
It comes with gender

1057
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,340
and difficulties with reimbursing your age

1058
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,260
and stuff like that.

1059
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,040
I talked to all the people at the Social Security Agency,

1060
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,400
but I didn't, you know,

1061
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,220
talk to them in person or call them or anything.

1062
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:39,940
I was just kind of like,

1063
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,160
put it on the side,

1064
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:41,860
like a hotline.

1065
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,040
And I got a call in about 25 minutes

1066
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,720
saying that everybody,

1067
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,360
not just you and we or me,

1068
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,000
we're all being pushed under the,

1069
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,460
you know, with a great sidesweeper.

1070
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,720
This is going to do away with us all.

1071
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,060
Well, no, that's called death.

1072
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,780
That's called old age and death, Dave.

1073
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,340
And that happens to large mammals

1074
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,920
on this particular planet.

1075
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,040
It's probably a good,

1076
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:11,600
it's a good thing too.

1077
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,020
In the long run,

1078
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,700
for the younger ones anyway,

1079
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,620
not so good for us older large mammals,

1080
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,840
but hey, you know.

1081
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,440
No.

1082
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,840
You got to make room for the next life form,

1083
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,380
whatever it may be.

1084
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,360
Squibbins, gibbons.

1085
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,620
It's a rather primitive,

1086
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,460
primitive way of doing things.

1087
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,380
I mean, if you were doing the schematics for it,

1088
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:31,560
you know,

1089
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,280
you just have a common recycling,

1090
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:33,680
you know,

1091
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,300
this being come into existence

1092
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,360
and then at some certain point in time,

1093
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:38,780
you sort of,

1094
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,100
you know,

1095
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:40,200
you're going to have to do it again.

1096
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,820
It may be primitive.

1097
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,680
It may be rough.

1098
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:43,600
It may be,

1099
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,900
it may not go down well

1100
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,780
in the polished ears of the modernist,

1101
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,120
but that's what God's plan was.

1102
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,580
That was the way God set it up.

1103
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,700
It may be a survival of the fittest

1104
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,400
and God was the fittest of all.

1105
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,820
So he's the only one that gets to survive.

1106
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,080
Everybody else.

1107
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,540
I drew my finger across my throat

1108
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,800
for listeners purposes.

1109
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,740
There, I did it again.

1110
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,600
Yes, he did it.

1111
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,060
Nice.

1112
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:11,940
I did it too.

1113
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,680
We did it to ourselves, man.

1114
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,260
And I also went one year like Vincent van Gogh.

1115
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:16,640
You know,

1116
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,160
we can sit around and blame the conspiracy,

1117
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,360
but we did it to ourselves,

1118
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,860
just like Vincent van Gogh.

1119
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,720
Nobody bought his art.

1120
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,720
That was because his art wasn't any good

1121
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,780
and no one bought a single piece of his art

1122
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,960
while he was alive.

1123
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,320
Now,

1124
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:35,320
his mirror scribble sells for $5 million in Japan,

1125
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,500
but obviously it must not be very good.

1126
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:38,760
I don't know.

1127
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:38,760


1128
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,620
I don't know.

1129
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:39,620


1130
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:39,620


1131
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:39,620


1132
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:39,620


1133
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:39,620


1134
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,920
I didn't buy any when it was fresh and new.

1135
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,100
I thought it was weird and self-indulgent.

1136
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,200
They didn't have eyes to see.

1137
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,400
And look at Cezanne of the same school of art

1138
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,480
and they just couldn't hit it off

1139
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,780
because she was so crazy.

1140
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,920
And Cezanne was not crazy.

1141
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,000
Oh, never mind.

1142
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,740
Well, they're crazy in different ways.

1143
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,280
It's like the subgeniuses

1144
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,720
mostly can get along with each other for a while,

1145
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,740
but there's always one subgenius

1146
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,720
subgenius seemingly put on the earth

1147
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,120
just to drive one other subgenius

1148
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,360
literally

1149
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,400
insane.

1150
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,040
I am that subgenius.

1151
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,840
For some people.

1152
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,940
Not all people, but for some.

1153
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:23,620
Definitely.

1154
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,880
Yes. So he's

1155
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,780
written, so is it moat or smote,

1156
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,000
whichever it is. Smote it be. Smote be it,

1157
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,080
baby. If you got him, smote

1158
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:33,220
him.

1159
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,980
Most of the subgeniuses with the

1160
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,840
rather large cranial areas and

1161
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,000
stuff like that and the very, very small jaws

1162
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,580
want to be the

1163
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,980
next high epoch and scribe guy.

1164
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,000
They want to take your place like they think

1165
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,960
they could join your fun

1166
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,000
house and come into

1167
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,920
your palace and become

1168
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,900
the king. I don't understand

1169
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,880
how that works. Hydrocephaly does not an

1170
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,420
overman make, but $35?

1171
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,440
I don't know.

1172
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,900
Maybe. No calls

1173
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,820
to action here. I'm just saying.

1174
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,560
Just points of information.

1175
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,860
If you want to prove you're below

1176
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,020
a genius, you know

1177
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:11,940
what to do, friends.

1178
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,360
Subgenius.com

1179
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,920
There is a way to make it official.

1180
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,060
Right. Official. To prove

1181
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,540
that you are not

1182
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,440
suitable for Mensa.

1183
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,280
We can

1184
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,040
sell you a piece of paper that

1185
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,180
proves that your mind is not okay.

1186
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,160
Well, the only people

1187
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,040
who have pieces of paper that says their mind

1188
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,560
are okay is people who've been

1189
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,100
in the loony bin and then got released.

1190
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,220
Do you have a piece of paper that says

1191
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,560
your mind is okay? No, I do not have this.

1192
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,700
I have one that says my brain is normal

1193
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,040
physically, but that's not the same as

1194
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,740
saying your mind is okay.

1195
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,160
No, it's not the same. Your brain and mind

1196
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,940
are different. You're talking about the physical organ

1197
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,260
of your brain, not what's inside of it.

1198
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,900
Look at Dave. His brain is perfectly good.

1199
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,060
I know. Yeah, your organ is

1200
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,880
actually like your clavimedus or your

1201
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,620
snot nostril or something like that.

1202
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,600
It's the place that you like to vacuum

1203
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,780
when you get the urge to clean

1204
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,420
up the place. However,

1205
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,800
on the other hand,

1206
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,460
subgenius membership is more like a

1207
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,500
map to the

1208
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,580
infernal regions, and you

1209
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,440
learn a lot there.

1210
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,600
Yeah, you learn what not to do. That's for

1211
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,540
sure. But by then, it's too late.

1212
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,520
Welcome to hell.

1213
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,380
That was good cackle there, Princess Wade.

1214
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,180
Did you learn that in Wiccan school

1215
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,280
when you were a young lady?

1216
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,100
Or did you learn that in that Catholic private

1217
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:36,520
school?

1218
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,860
I went to. She went to both. She went to

1219
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,620
Wiccan school and Catholic school.

1220
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,340
I went to Episcopalian school

1221
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,560
and

1222
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,520
the school of very, very

1223
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,540
hard rocks. No, I graduated

1224
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,580
just barely.

1225
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,300
It's high school.

1226
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,980
And there were no girls in it.

1227
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,580
I don't think anybody

1228
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:00,560
did much better than barely graduating from

1229
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,960
Ponson. Yeah? Yeah.

1230
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,340
But let's not go any further

1231
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,120
into that now.

1232
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1233
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1234
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,860
And bounce back and forth

1235
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,400
to different types of deformities

1236
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,460
that people like to create

1237
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:20,500
and shine up

1238
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,520
like a silver hump

1239
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,280
on a hunchback's neck.

1240
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,440
You know?

1241
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,180
Most hunchbacks

1242
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,100
don't get the silver hump. They just get a little

1243
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,220
brass hump or even a plastic hump.

1244
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,340
Man, 50 years gets you

1245
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,420
the silver hump for

1246
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:38,800
beyond the retirement party they throw, too.

1247
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:42,220
I guess they have, like, these huge wires

1248
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:43,380
standing from the ceiling,

1249
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,740
and some are hot and some are not.

1250
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,420
And different contestants or the entries

1251
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,340
or the attendees of the conference

1252
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,820
all stand up on the bus tables, you know,

1253
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,840
where they're serving the salmon and everything like that.

1254
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,520
And once the piggies dance, boy,

1255
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,180
a couple of them get fried real good.

1256
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:07,860
At least I never attended, but I'd heard about it.

1257
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,780
When you're recounting things like that,

1258
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,640
Princess, we and I look at each other across the studio

1259
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,380
with kind of a puzzled look on our face,

1260
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,380
like, maybe when we play it back later.

1261
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,400
Later is coming pretty soon, actually.

1262
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,860
I was cocking my head like a small dog,

1263
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,060
just trying to figure out what it was,

1264
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,360
that you were saying about salmon and trays

1265
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,100
and wires coming from ceilings.

1266
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,420
Must have been a cocker spaniel.

1267
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,000
Yes.

1268
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,960
Well, it's like the Humpin' Baby Cakes parade

1269
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,780
they have every, you know, post-St. Patrick's Day

1270
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:47,500
or something like that,

1271
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,600
to show some sort of spiritual ancestry

1272
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,560
or some kind of...

1273
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,520
Humpin' Baby Cakes.

1274
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,740
Is that a tie-in with the Silver Hunchback or what?

1275
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,720
And we...

1276
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,720
By the way, I hope there's no Hunchback listeners

1277
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,900
who think we're making fun,

1278
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,680
because we are Monster High.

1279
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,640
We are.

1280
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:02,760
Monster High.

1281
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,480
Yeah, we're the ghoul kids rule.

1282
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,760
So, you know, we're cool with all your deformities and stuff.

1283
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,300
To us, they're just marks of superiority

1284
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,240
over the Mirhumes and the Normworms.

1285
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,300
We are Monster.

1286
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,280
The Barbies and Kens.

1287
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,260
We are proud.

1288
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,700
The Mediocratons.

1289
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,740
The Pink Boys.

1290
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,320
Yep.

1291
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:26,000
My eyebrows or any of those parts of my body

1292
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,700
are not purple,

1293
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,660
but I can sure do a good job of pretending.

1294
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,900
And that's what I do every day.

1295
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,160
I'm...

1296
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,920
Pretending, you know, my eyelids are purple

1297
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,120
or that I'm balder than I am or something.

1298
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,240
Dave, you don't need purple eyebrows or green eyebrows.

1299
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,720
Your eyebrows are perfectly psychedelic

1300
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,300
just the way they are.

1301
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,600
Well, you know, it just takes a little bit of extra work

1302
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,400
in the morning when you're getting ready to go out

1303
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,260
and play in the backyard and stuff like that.

1304
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,580
You get all dressed up and you shave

1305
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,260
and you just, you know,

1306
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,420
spend an extra 15 or 20 minutes

1307
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,400
working on your eyebrows.

1308
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,160
You tweak them.

1309
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,300
You pull, you mascara, you rub,

1310
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,940
you shave, you unshave,

1311
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,720
you comb and you brush.

1312
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,140
It's a process that I don't know why I do.

1313
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,100
And listeners, you can learn more

1314
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,480
about whatever the hell he was going on about

1315
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,840
His eyebrows.

1316
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,960
by listening back to this show again

1317
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,320
because I'll probably have it archived

1318
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:29,340
in MP3 and Augvorbis in different formats

1319
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,500
tomorrow or the next day

1320
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,980
like we always do with every hour of Slack

1321
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,900
because you can find, not all of them,

1322
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,400
I think the first couple of hundred

1323
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,740
are mostly absent from 1985 and 86.

1324
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,980
Absent from the annals.

1325
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,560
Everything else that we've ever done

1326
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,900
called Hour of Slack can be downloaded

1327
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,060
from subgenius.com

1328
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,300
or someplace you'll find from that

1329
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,420
if you want to look there.

1330
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,200
I happen to know that most of the radio subgeniuses

1331
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,480
don't want to look there.

1332
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,320
They don't want to look at our books

1333
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,780
and most of the book reading subgeniuses

1334
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,660
already know what the show is probably like

1335
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,800
so they don't want to be disappointed and hear it.

1336
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,480
And the internet subgeniuses

1337
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,180
don't know anything about any of it.

1338
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,080
All they know is that you spell Bob

1339
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,220
with all capital letters and no quotes.

1340
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,280
That's how you know the internet ones

1341
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,780
where they come from.

1342
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,220
So subgenius.com is it, dear friends.

1343
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,580
And I guess for our prisoners out there

1344
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,220
I should give our post office box

1345
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,460
because I haven't done that in a long time.

1346
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:31,460


1347
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,760
You can write for free information

1348
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,980
from subgenius at post office box

1349
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,740
181-417

1350
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,540
Cleveland Heights, Ohio

1351
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,040
44118

1352
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,360
Praise Bob.

1353
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,800
And we're going to have to go out now

1354
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,900
and make room for some other poor wretch

1355
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,180
whose name is Dr. Sinister here in Cleveland.

1356
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,460
Thank you.

1357
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,060
And, uh...

1358
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,360
But we've been lying this whole time.

1359
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,460
It's not really all about Bob.

1360
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,420
Did you know that?

1361
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,260
It's really...

1362
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:08,920
I didn't know that.

1363
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,340
Reverend Bill T. Miller, the king of slack,

1364
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,020
will tell us

1365
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,980
it's really all about Connie.

1366
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,260
You want to hear some great music?

1367
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,620
I just wanted to make money and have fun.

1368
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,820
Hello, doctor.

1369
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:29,460
How are you?

1370
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:30,900
The doctor is on.

1371
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,720
You could have a rewarding career

1372
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,280
as a subgenius doctor.

1373
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,140
That's right.

1374
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,060
Surgeons for Connie.

1375
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,180
Perform healing orgy-divisible surgery.

1376
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,700
Sicken the masses.

1377
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,900
Bombard the patient with subgenius anti-fusing noise.

1378
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,520
Surgeons for Connie.

1379
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,020
Standing by.

1380
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,100
Well, I...

1381
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,420
Ready to operate.

1382
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,160
Scammo.

1383
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:03,640
Goff Club.

1384
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:07,060
Pipe.

1385
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,180
Light the pipe full of froth.

1386
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,680
And insert the Goff Club into the third nostril of the patient.

1387
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,220
And the depro-gaming will begin.

1388
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:18,760
Stop it! Stop it!

1389
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:20,020
Please, I beg you!

1390
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:24,460
You will no longer believe that Connie's little puppet, Jay, are Bob Dobbs.

1391
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,920
You will now realize the truth.

1392
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,260
That Connie is the one true slack master.

1393
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,460
You will now realize the truth.

1394
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:32,260
Praise Connie!

1395
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,480
Praise Connie!

1396
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,740
Praise Connie!

1397
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,040
Praise Connie!

1398
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:39,340
Praise Connie!

1399
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,060
Don't worry.

1400
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:45,900
The spurting, bleeding head side effects are part of the treatment.

1401
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:58,960
Now, whenever you hear the name Bob, you will automatically substitute the name Connie.

1402
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,320
Oh!

1403
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:00,680
Oh!

1404
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,020
Oh!

1405
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:01,440
Oh!

1406
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:01,440


1407
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:01,440


1408
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:01,440


1409
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:01,440


1410
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:31,460


1411
00:58:31,460 --> 00:59:01,460


1412
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:10,400
Here we go, there.

1413
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:18,520
WOO!

1414
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:18,600
Oh!

1415
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:19,260
Oh!

1416
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:19,460
Oh!

1417
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:19,900
Oh!

1418
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:20,060
Oh!

1419
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:20,060


1420
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:20,380


1421
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:20,580
Oh!

1422
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:20,780


1423
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:21,560
Oh!

1424
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,320
Oh!

1425
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,460
Oh!

1426
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:28,920
We're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1427
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,940
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1428
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:41,020
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1429
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:48,500
you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages

1430
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,840
and help out financially as best you can.

1431
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:56,220
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1432
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,860
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1433
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,860
But some of you still have jobs.

1434
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:09,700
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1435
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,120
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1436
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:20,920
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1437
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:27,320
We also take checks and money orders to subgeniusfoundation.com.

1438
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:38,860
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1439
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:44,100
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1440
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,380
We'll see you next time.

1441
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:22,300
Money, Bob!

1442
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,060
Kill me!

1443
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,140
Yes, money, Bob!
