1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
PR news in Washington. I'm still billowing into the air.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:11,020
President Bush came during the afternoon at a popular outdoor market to build support for his new police station, but his bomb exploded.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,740
No one was hurt and eight people were killed. He had been heavily criticized for PR's reports.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,300
On Wall Street, 812-617-4543. This is PR.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,660
Bloody bombing. Bombing killed. Killed. Beheaded.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,960
PR news. PR news. PR news.

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:27,940
PR's dead.

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:33,600
The Philippines military says it is flammable chemicals. Dozens of people were killed there.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,020
Israel's top military leader in central Kentucky is still burning.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,940
When the scheme came to light, PR news plunged in Washington.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,500
All right, fellas, here's your story.

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,640
A man by the name of Bob once saved our world with an arc of electricity.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,980
Bob is recovering from wounds received in the battle.

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,000
He's got a broken carbone and a bad headache.

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,420
Good.

16
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,100
And now, before giving you the details of the battle,

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,760
I bring you a warning.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,860
Every one of you listening to Bob, tell the world.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,740
Tell this to everybody wherever they are.

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,500
Under no circumstances take action against Bob.

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,220
Watch Bob.

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,760
Keep looking. Watch. Keep watching Bob.

23
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,720
Bob, give me a hand.

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,080
Hey, anybody around here want some coffee?

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,960
No. Nothing counts except Bob. Watch it.

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,040
Anybody want some coffee? No.

27
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,520
Then just shut up. Watch it.

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,140
Mm-hmm.

29
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,880
There he is, honey.

30
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,360
He believes that you will put the word of God down and you will quit.

31
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:43,900
Now, remember, Ephesians 6 says that the sword is the word of the spirit.

32
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,400
This series will take you to a new Lord and is highly recommended for you.

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,260
Order your copy now by calling 1-8-ME.

34
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,740
That's 1-8-ME.ministries.com.

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,260
Well?

36
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,620
You've had the better. Here comes the worst.

37
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,160
Can't trust your feelings.

38
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,980
Yes, correct.

39
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,740
It's time for the cursed flood in your life.

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,880
Let me encourage you.

41
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,940
Now, remember, send check or money order to 9090-MINISTRIES-31.

42
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,200
Fellas and girls, what I have to say will only take a few seconds.

43
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,020
It's about cleanliness.

44
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,080
Being clean in mind as well as in body.

45
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,080
Think clean.

46
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,700
Clean and keep clean.

47
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,300
Lack of cleanliness is usually a sign of carelessness.

48
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,980
And carelessness indicates laziness.

49
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,360
Remember always that carelessness and laziness lead to...

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,780
The self-genius power of...

51
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,560
Swag.

52
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,160
Yay!

53
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,480
113013.

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,520
13013.

55
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,540
13013.

56
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:55,880
Bob?

57
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,580
Bob?

58
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:56,620
Bob?

59
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,040
Bob?

60
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,860
Bob?

61
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,840
Yes.

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:01,840


63
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,760
Yes.

64
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,540
Yes.

65
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:03,540


66
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,980
Some scientists were experimenting with Bob.

67
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,160
Shut up!

68
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,680
First, the blonde.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,240
With more curves than the road up Pike's Peak.

70
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,000
And done.

71
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,400
That's right, insult me.

72
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,360
Second, the blonde.

73
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,680
Okay, you can't argue with a blonde.

74
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,020
That's right.

75
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,800
Peter's Moon Drive.

76
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
From Gerd.

77
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,620
Where is my little sixth leg?

78
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,660
Oh, my leg.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,540
Peter's Moon Drive.

80
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,560
From Gerd.

81
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,380
Why do so many fail?

82
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,060
5% success.

83
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,700
Success.

84
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,480
666.

85
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,500
Ideal.

86
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,120
Failure.

87
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:34,880
Ideal.

88
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,700
Conformity.

89
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,600
Now think of it.

90
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,780
7, 20, 20, 25.

91
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,120
Usually by that 25.

92
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,020
Usually by that.

93
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,620
Usually by that.

94
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,720
Why we conform?

95
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,860
Why do you work?

96
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,060
Why do you get up in the morning?

97
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,840
Ideal.

98
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,280
9,999.

99
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,840
No destination and no guidance.

100
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,320
The human race is fixed.

101
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,220
The weakest link.

102
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,060
Well, let me tell you something.

103
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,240
Well, well, well, well.

104
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,600
Immediately.

105
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,600
Doubt.

106
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,080
Fear.

107
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:56,780
Fear.

108
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:56,780


109
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:56,800


110
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,020
Fear.

111
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,020


112
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,020


113
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,020


114
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,540
Key to success.

115
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,560
The key to failure.

116
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,740
Now let me say that again.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,060
Everything comes if a man will only wait.

118
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,880
Cold blood.

119
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,800
9, 23.

120
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
I think in negative terms.

121
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,780
Well, that's pretty apparent, isn't it?

122
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,860
Confusion and anxiety and fear and worry.

123
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,220
Nothing.

124
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,720
Nothing.

125
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,800
Now how does it work?

126
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,040
Why do we become nothing?

127
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:13,660
Poison.

128
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,100
Corn.

129
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,580
Corn.

130
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,080
Failure.

131
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,640
Confusion.

132
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:16,660
Misunderstanding.

133
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,040
Fear.

134
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,020
Anxiety.

135
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,500
And so on.

136
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,980
Must return to us.

137
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,440
Nothing.

138
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,700
What is it you want?

139
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,560
Get on top of a building and jump off.

140
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,840
Picture yourself in your mind's eye as having phenobarbital.

141
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:26,960
Ulcers.

142
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,340
And nervous breakdowns and tranquilizers.

143
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,400
Into the gutter.

144
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:31,840
Be a bore.

145
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,540
The architect of the universe.

146
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,840
Build a stairway.

147
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,700
Leading nowhere.

148
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,680
According to Bob, there's no hard evidence to prove Bob's story either.

149
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,740
What we're going to do today.

150
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,060
Okay.

151
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,560
Dobson.

152
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,420
Dobson.

153
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,220
Dobson.

154
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,320
Dobson.

155
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,520
Dobson.

156
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:50,760
Dobson.

157
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:50,840
Dobson.

158
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:50,840


159
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:50,880
Dobson.

160
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:50,880


161
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:50,880


162
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,180
And this will be kind of strange.

163
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,740
I have hits.

164
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,780
I just.

165
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,700
And so I'd like a filth.

166
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,100
And pretty boring stuff.

167
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,320
The popular cult.

168
00:05:59,400 --> 00:05:59,540
Cult.

169
00:05:59,660 --> 00:05:59,720
Cult.

170
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,780
It is kind of strange.

171
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,080
I don't think from start to finish in my life.

172
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,220
And don't intend to.

173
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,120
Well, I am anxious.

174
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,440
I am the father of the baby of Anna Nicole Smith.

175
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,420
Oh my goodness.

176
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,700
I slept with her.

177
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,600
Oh my goodness.

178
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,060
Turn on.

179
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,420
Turn on.

180
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:15,760
Anna.

181
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,280
Anna.

182
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,600
Oh.

183
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,180
Anna.

184
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,060
Ridiculous.

185
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,620
Anna.

186
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,940
She was doing.

187
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,400
Britney Spears.

188
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,380
She was.

189
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,180
Got fat.

190
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:23,760
Got thin.

191
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,400
Got fat.

192
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,040
Got thin.

193
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,680
Got fat.

194
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,140
Dumb.

195
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,240
Dumb.

196
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,820
It's stupid.

197
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,820
Christian parents really don't have any clue.

198
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,220
Cult.

199
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,420
Cult.

200
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,060
Damaging.

201
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,640
Animate.

202
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,400
Parts.

203
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:31,740
Now.

204
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,660
Bob and Bob.

205
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,380
Bob and Bob.

206
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,720
Bob plugged in.

207
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,020
Bob plugged in.

208
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,360
Bob.

209
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,120
YouTube.

210
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,580
MySpace.

211
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,160
The Anna Nicole Smith and Britney Spears fascination.

212
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,660
Hits.

213
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,520
Come twice.

214
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,160
Come twice.

215
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,780
Maybe even three times or whatever.

216
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,420
Can't wait.

217
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,200
We're going to have a party.

218
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,320
He's talking about Bob's.

219
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,600
Can't wait.

220
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,400
We're going to have a party.

221
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:47,820
Plugged in.

222
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,460
That's right.

223
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,420
Primarily you look at Anna Nicole Smith.

224
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,440
Britney Spears.

225
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,260
Grease me.

226
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,020
Grease me.

227
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,000
Put her arm around.

228
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,780
All ass girls.

229
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,440
Girls.

230
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,340
If you turn over.

231
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,340
Boys and girls.

232
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,180
Turn them over.

233
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,240
Exploit them and twist them and warp them and use them.

234
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,100
Take them to hell.

235
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:05,940
Totally.

236
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,440
Freak show.

237
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:06,780
Freak show.

238
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,040
Hmm.

239
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,520
Very hard.

240
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,180
Now.

241
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:09,940
Go back.

242
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,400
Go back.

243
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:10,780
One.

244
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,720
Very.

245
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,340
Hard.

246
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,540
Hardest of the hardest.

247
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,800
Full nudity.

248
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,320
You got to do that often.

249
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,560
Jesus was wrong.

250
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,040
Yes.

251
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,560
Porn.

252
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,620
He wants the dirtiest.

253
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,020
With family.

254
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,780
Bob and I have.

255
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,720
Have.

256
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,040
Have.

257
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,360
Have.

258
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,500
Have.

259
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:24,760
Have.

260
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:24,820
Have.

261
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:24,900
Have.

262
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:24,940


263
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,440
Have.

264
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,440


265
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,440


266
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:25,500


267
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:25,760
Have.

268
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:25,760


269
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:25,760


270
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:25,760


271
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:25,760


272
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,000
Have.

273
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,000


274
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,460
That's available to us now.

275
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,220
It just takes my breath away.

276
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,000
That was really pretty good.

277
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,680
It really was.

278
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,180
I like the dirtiest porn on video.

279
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,320
Failure on the field.

280
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,960
I just really enjoyed it.

281
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,260
What?

282
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:40,440
What?

283
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:40,620
What?

284
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,520
45 seconds.

285
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:41,940
Sex.

286
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,100
Stick that in there.

287
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,540
Clean.

288
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:43,980
VD.

289
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,100
Oh my goodness.

290
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,620
I absolutely love that.

291
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:46,960
Cult.

292
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,180
Cult.

293
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,660
Freely strut about.

294
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,760
Vile thing.

295
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,820
Let my heart be drawn to what is evil.

296
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,700
Do need to do.

297
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,160
Who is?

298
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,540
Did you knew?

299
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,320
Looking at the cult.

300
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,040
Looking at the cult.

301
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,440
Dobs.

302
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:56,760
Dobs.

303
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,920
Dobs.

304
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,440
Dobs.

305
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,440


306
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,100
Dobsy.

307
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,600
Dobsy.

308
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:00,780
Friends.

309
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,020
We're home.

310
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,640
We're here.

311
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,660
Everything should be okay.

312
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,180
What did you say?

313
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,460
Everything should be okay.

314
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:08,920
Just dobsy.

315
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,360
What kind of dobsy are you talking about?

316
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,740
We're uninformed.

317
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,120
We are of the ignorant.

318
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,880
The mass of the erstwhileest.

319
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,620
The erst.

320
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,600
The masters of hour of slack number 1091.

321
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,240
We've made our way through 1090 of them so far.

322
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,300
And this is the 1091th.

323
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,120
Princess, we, I can't hear you.

324
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,280
I can't hear me either.

325
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,080
If you really lean in there.

326
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,760
What do you mean if I really lean in here?

327
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,120
And talk real loud.

328
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,420
I'm talking as loud as I possibly can.

329
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,440
I can hear you now.

330
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:46,960
Sure.

331
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,040
Her pads may be need to be maxing.

332
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,760
But I can't chase.

333
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,680
See your mic and his mic are Siamese twins.

334
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,440
So I have to actually make contact.

335
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,760
So don't.

336
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,480
I have to actually make contact with this filthy, filthy microphone.

337
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,680
You don't actually have to touch your lips directly to it.

338
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,400
That's the only way that you've said you can hear me.

339
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,280
But you will feel it.

340
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:08,800
But you can speak up.

341
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,400
I am speaking up.

342
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,080
I think you may need to take the shock off it.

343
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,700
Don't spit up.

344
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,680
I said speak up.

345
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,580
Don't spit up.

346
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,440
That's sickening.

347
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,840
That's making me sick.

348
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,440
Blurp.

349
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,780
Blurp.

350
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,340
Blurp.

351
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,100
Blurp.

352
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:37,500
Well, the mysterious organ of lonesome cowboy Dave is here for your edification.

353
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,120
Not much of a proboscis as far as line of punishment or enlistment values.

354
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,340
That was in case something creative happened.

355
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,700
Well, it was encased.

356
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,140
Let's just say it was encased.

357
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,060
Now read frantically, Stang.

358
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,140
Read the copy that you forgot you had.

359
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,800
Friend.

360
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:07,640
You'll be glad to know that Reverend Magdalene's donation fund is now at, and I'm not kidding, $3,333.33.

361
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:14,540
About a week ago, Cleveland listeners won't know, but all the other stations will.

362
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:24,500
Reverend Magdalene had, with the subgenius child custody case, had a serious, serious drawback in her finances and her life.

363
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:35,400
And the subgeniuses came together, despite the fact that they all hate each other and are true weirdos who can barely stand to be in the same room.

364
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:49,100
Yet, when one was attacked by the conspiracy, the subgenii came together and drummed up at least, well, she needed an immediate $2,000.

365
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,220
The subgeniuses drummed up $3,333.33.

366
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,480
The number of...

367
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,200
The Dobbs.

368
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:05,920
And by a similar strange coincidence, friends, I was, you know, it's income tax time, and the conspiracy makes you pay them for taking your money.

369
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,260
And I had to add up my income.

370
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,340
And I won't tell you the first number of this five-figure number.

371
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,520
It was pi, actually.

372
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:22,560
But the next numbers were 6,666.61.

373
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,240
61 cents.

374
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:32,540
Yes, it was pi, 1,006, 1,666 dollars and 61 cents.

375
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,240
6, 6, 6, friends.

376
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,340
And let the sick among you know that that is the phone number of a man.

377
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,520
And that man is whoever is at that phone number, 666.

378
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,840
Actually, my agent has that phone number in his...

379
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,660
The new sacred agent, friends.

380
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,420
Oh, it's a secret.

381
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,320
Well, is it a coincidence?

382
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,440
The sacred agent that also Dave has been exploited by.

383
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,260
Cardinal knowledge of.

384
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,340
Yes.

385
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,440
Dave...

386
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,320
Or cardinal knowledge.

387
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,660
I forgot.

388
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,400
I was wearing the hat.

389
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,000
I was wearing the wrong hat, man.

390
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,520
That's a problem with most of our psychic envoyages.

391
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,640
And publishing achievements or attempts.

392
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,580
Now, the 6, 6, 6 stuff, that's like 6, 6, sexy, right?

393
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,360
It's a part of the Shiva principle.

394
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,560
It's a dissolution of three separate parts.

395
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,240
I thought it was a rock and roll thing.

396
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,040
6, 6, 6?

397
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:25,380
Yeah.

398
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,000
Okay.

399
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,040
Let's not talk about that.

400
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,820
There's all those, you know, stickers that say, you know, 6, 6, 7, the roommate or the

401
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,960
next door neighbor of the beast.

402
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,260
Well, that's important in the Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions, I think.

403
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,380
Well, 7 is also...

404
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:49,320
In the Church of the Subgenius, we kind of freak out when we see 3, 3, 3, which is the

405
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,740
number of the anti-Bob, or 9, 9, 9, which is the number of Bob.

406
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,320
Now, did you know that if you...

407
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,540
You take 3 times 9, 9, 9, you get 1998?

408
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,560
No, that's 2 times 9, 9, 9.

409
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,420
3 times 6, 6, 6 is 1998.

410
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,000
Or 6 times 3, 3, 3 is 1998.

411
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,020
In 1998, the world will end, friends.

412
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,480
July 5th, 1998, that's coming up this July 5th.

413
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,660
Be ready.

414
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,600
You know where to go.

415
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,720
Subgenius.com, that's where to go.

416
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,280
And calm down.

417
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,300
That means what you essentially said, that not only are the dates totally...

418
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,340
...totally askew, that we are fast...

419
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,160
...quickly approaching 1998, which has the magnif...

420
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:36,160
...niqueful sewage number of 9, which is transposed by its, you know, having 1, 9, 8, 9 in it.

421
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,700
And 1 and the 8 is another 9.

422
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,820
Right, so it's 9, 9, 9, number of Bob, number of Bob.

423
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,260
Told you so.

424
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,780
Told you so.

425
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,340
No, no, no.

426
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,700
Subgenius Numerology.

427
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,920
Subgenius Numerology.

428
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,580
My cult's bigger than your cult.

429
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,360
My invisible monster can beat up your invisible monster.

430
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
Ne, ne, ne, ne, ne, ne.

431
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,920
My suicide bombers can blow up your suicide bombers.

432
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,160
See?

433
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,040
That's a pretty good one.

434
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,160
My suicide bombers can blow up your...

435
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
That's right, that's right.

436
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:07,880
Hey, now, also, coming in 1998, the global warming will reach its absolute peak.

437
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,600
In 1998?

438
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,960
In 1998, global warming will completely destroy the Earth, unless...

439
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,480
So that's like 10 years from now, or 11 years.

440
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,800
No, that should be this July.

441
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,200
No, this is 1998.

442
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,900
We don't know, Dave.

443
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,160
Oh, that's right.

444
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,960
We really don't know.

445
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,800
No, we are at 1998.

446
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,640
I'm sorry.

447
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,940
Does anybody really know what date it is?

448
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
How could they?

449
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,800
You know, everything...

450
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,840
Why do dates have names anyway?

451
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:37,420
Why couldn't they have, you know, an infinite number, or at least a calculated number of

452
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,740
names that you'd have to memorize at a school with fierce monks and...

453
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,220
That's the way we used to do it, Dave, if you remember in your days in Dobstown.

454
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,220
Yes, Dobstown.

455
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,020
Tom Dave's days in Dobstown.

456
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,280
But the fighting pokers on the Great Horseshoe Bayou did not...

457
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,280


458
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,220
They did not teach me a damn thing any more than the Jesuits taught me Aristotle.

459
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,040
You know, it's made my breasts grow.

460
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,360
But that's about it.

461
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,540
I've had...

462
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,140
You've learned how to work in the rice paddies and how to hoe.

463
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,040
That's what made my breasts expand.

464
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,560
It had nothing to do with what I was doing or learning at the time, because...

465
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,900
Wasn't it all just a psychic adventure?

466
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,080
It never happened.

467
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,560
Gosh, isn't everything just a psychic adventure?

468
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,940
Anyway, friends.

469
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,560
As I was saying, global warming will peak in 1998.

470
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,800
That's this July.

471
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:37,420
And unless human scientists spending millions of dollars can fix it using the new science

472
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,820
of geoengineering.

473
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:47,340
And I was just reading this in the PayPures tonight, that some of the solutions that scientists

474
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,060
meeting in Dobstown have come up with...

475
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,060
Now, this sounds like a joke, but this is actually true.

476
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:01,020
They've suggested growing giant artificial trees, which would turn carbon dioxide back

477
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,860
into oxygen.

478
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,100
Right.

479
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,480
We don't have enough trees.

480
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,660
Yeah, okay.

481
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,680
Well, these would be bioengineered giant trees.

482
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,320
Oh, they already have those.

483
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,180
That would be self-growing chemical creations, you know.

484
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,300
Yeah, so they grow 10 feet a year.

485
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,460
You can make life.

486
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,880
Remember, you have to yell up.

487
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,860
I'm yelling as much as I possibly can.

488
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,740
That mic has ears like mine.

489
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,080
I'm trying.

490
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,000
Think of it that way.

491
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,700
I'm tired of being a tree.

492
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,400
If I do that the whole show, I'll have a sore throat at the end of the show.

493
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,640
Now, come on, you guys.

494
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,280
This is serious.

495
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,780
Global warming is a serious problem, and we have to come up with a man-made way to solve

496
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,060
it.

497
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,040
Right?

498
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,820
We can't just stop burning garbage and fuel.

499
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,340
So, therefore, we have to come up with an artificial solution.

500
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,880
Another good scientific idea, such as shade.

501
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,160
And this is one I...

502
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,120
I read on CNN.com not two hours ago.

503
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,060
Shade from trillions of flying saucers.

504
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:08,660
Man-made, not excess or grays or any of those amateur-type aliens.

505
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,960
That's the answer to global warming is shade from trillions of flying saucers in the air?

506
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,080
That is positively...

507
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,460
You could think of the platelets of the universal mind of Duxie.

508
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,080
Approaching some sort of substandard equilibrium.

509
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:23,980
Right.

510
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,140
And millions and millions of tiny brains are the platelets, or the coverages for the...

511
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,300
Like the little clouds to keep the houses from being recognized by the space people.

512
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,860
Well, now, see, the aliens will bring such clouds of computerized...

513
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,720
You need to turn that down, because remember Princess Wee is on a deaf man, and you're

514
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,680
on the loud man.

515
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,740
I was getting conflicting symbols.

516
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,940
He doesn't know what to do.

517
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,980
I was just telling him to make some music, and then you told him not to make some music.

518
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,860
Now, here's another...

519
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,700
Another thing you could do, Princess Wee, and this would be a big sacrifice.

520
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:03,920
You would have to move your chair over to near Dave, and his mic would pick you up enough

521
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,580
that it would...

522
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,580
Okay, I'll try that.

523
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,780
Compensate, yeah.

524
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,820
But, like I say, it's a big sacrifice.

525
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:23,360
Now, the other item on the agenda for our bioengineering to bring down the heat that is toasting our

526
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:23,840
little planet...

527
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,220
Yeah, that's the other thing.

528
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,520
...would be sending up...

529
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:33,560
Working like an artificial volcano, sending up vast quantities of crud into the upper atmosphere

530
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,020
that would reflect light away, and thus lower the temperature on Earth.

531
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:44,940
Why not have children be taught the correct norms and fathoms of expectoration...

532
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,400
Well, yeah, that's the other thing.

533
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,340
...and removal of bodily fluids in the correct direction?

534
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,640
Aren't we the Van Allen belt we're wearing?

535
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,400
You know what I'm saying?

536
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:51,620
Right.

537
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,040
It's like, why don't we adapt?

538
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,400
Our...

539
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,020
Force our children to adapt to the changing climate.

540
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,480
That would be a possibility one could use.

541
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,280
We could...

542
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:08,200
Now, that wasn't something these smarty-pants scientists on CNN.com came up with, now, was

543
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,420
it?

544
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,080
I sure didn't hear anything about...

545
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,640
Well, they're not as smart as Dave.

546
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,640
But if I had a little kid now, and soon I'll have grandkids, I trust.

547
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,480
Yes.

548
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,800
Dave, I think, has great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.

549
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,180
I have a 42-year-old great-great-grandchild.

550
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:22,600
Right.

551
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,420
Of course, it's from previous werewolves with Nebuchadnezzar.

552
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,040
But what...

553
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,900
That really hurts.

554
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:29,580
I know.

555
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:30,840
That makes...

556
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,400
Does it hurt less?

557
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,980
That's like my teeth.

558
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,640
That's what it feels like when I chew on tinfoil.

559
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,400
It sounds that way in my head.

560
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,960
Well, does it make you feel better, Dave?

561
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,500
No, but really, if we want to prepare our children for the coming global changes, we

562
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:51,920
need to raise them in little hothouses, greenhouses, put them in... put their crib in a place that's

563
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,580
about 10 feet away.

564
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:59,000
10 degrees hotter than where you are, and just adapt them in a drier, hotter environment.

565
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,700
Don't let them drink much water.

566
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,160
How do you mean adapt them?

567
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,180
And adapt children so that...

568
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,640
Well, we can't reverse climate change.

569
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,000
Obviously, anything that we did to try to reverse it would just make something else worse.

570
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,340
Every time we do something, it makes it worse.

571
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:16,960
Right.

572
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,300
It's all the things that we have to stop doing that we're doing now.

573
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,180
The evil...

574
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,860
Well, speak...

575
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,260
I should...

576
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:28,260
I'm not really speaking for myself because I'm not technically fully human.

577
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,500
Well, we can clearly see that.

578
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,040
Thanks for removing that right in front of us.

579
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,760
Well, it's not like anybody ever argued with me on that point.

580
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,860
Why is it making that noise?

581
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,300
Why is it...

582
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,580
Can't you cover it up with something?

583
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,000
It's kind of like the light is...

584
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:50,120
What you're seeing is the aura of my slack, my luscious slack beaming out because I've

585
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,240
been granted such high...

586
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,440
High slackdomness by the Bob.

587
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,120
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

588
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,880
It's good.

589
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,860
Cool feel.

590
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,340
Looks smoother now, doesn't he?

591
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:00,820
Looks a little...

592
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,140
My cult, in which I believe.

593
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,200
His hair has returned to dark.

594
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,400
The church of the subgenius.

595
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,280
It makes me younger.

596
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,020
His chin is very proper, guys.

597
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,700
It sticks out like a mighty, mighty cliff of granite.

598
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:10,940
I'm younger.

599
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,020
I'm younger.

600
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,020
I never thought that such a thing would ever happen.

601
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,260
Such slack.

602
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,360
Where did you get such fine hair?

603
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,620
You look like one of the pharaohs.

604
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,120
And the day...

605
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,560
Yes.

606
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,820
I feel like a god of slack.

607
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,760
Actually, it's this Rudy Schwartz Project music in the background that makes me feel

608
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,140
that way.

609
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,120
It's an aura that took you over just a few moments ago.

610
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,300
We don't know what it is.

611
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,340
You missed many fine moments here.

612
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,100
They were like micro moments, but they were many fine moments.

613
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,080
What, on your keyboard?

614
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,500
Yes.

615
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
I did miss them.

616
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,320
No.

617
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,540
Well, not perhaps the way you should have, I guess.

618
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:58,060
I'm still feeling a little dizzy, Dave and Princess, from globe hopping.

619
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,840
Ah, the globe hopping.

620
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,300
Yeah, we discovered...

621
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,020
I know everybody else did this three years ago, but they just...

622
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:11,920
They didn't have Google Earth for Macintosh until last year, and it took until this year

623
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,380
for me to actually get around to fiddling with it.

624
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,620
And what a thrill Google Earth was for...

625
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,000
Bows.

626
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,920
We Earthbound.

627
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,300
Bows.

628
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,220
Yes, dear.

629
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:21,980
Friends.

630
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,500
It felt...

631
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:22,840
It's hypnosis.

632
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,860
If you've never done it, it's very Jetsons.

633
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,060
You feel like you're in the Jetsons world.

634
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,960
Finally, a real Jetsons thing.

635
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,740
It's masturbatory, Sting.

636
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,780
It's very auto-hypnotic.

637
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,260
Kids wouldn't feel that way.

638
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,940
Kids would think, oh, well, it's just more electronic gizmos.

639
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,000
But for us olden people...

640
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,740
See, for us to travel from one place to another, we had to get in a vehicle and drive or buy

641
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,120
a plane ticket and be flown there, and it took hours and was dangerous.

642
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,520
But now, you can just Google anything.

643
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,920
Anywhere on Earth and make a bookmark of it.

644
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,140
That's how we're going to get home.

645
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,740
That's how we got to the radio station.

646
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,080
And in one mighty leap.

647
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,540
Like the Incredible Hulk.

648
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,920
If you ever saw that comic movie, The Incredible Hulk, he leaps around.

649
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,620
That's what the Google Earth experience reminds me of.

650
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:16,700
It's like the movies promised us the Internet would be, where you just cast your hand.

651
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,940
And you say, computer, take me to the Grand Canyon.

652
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,800
And you fly.

653
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,020
Through the air.

654
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,400
To the bottom of the Grand Canyon, which is in beautiful 3D.

655
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,680
In arching pole vault loops, just the way the Skull Islanders got to the ship to get Anne.

656
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,780
That's right, yeah.

657
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,680
And you can also...

658
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,160
We bookmarked...

659
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,960
We found Skull Island, or where Skull Island used to be, southwest of Sumatra.

660
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,000
You can still see the bump.

661
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,760
Because they show the geography of the ocean bottom.

662
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,880
As a place to see a bump.

663
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,340
One of the major characteristics of the area.

664
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,260
Or is that just sort of some kind of psychosexual...

665
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:03,640
That's the whole island full of temples and dinosaurs that sank beneath the waves in 1948.

666
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,360
They ran them?

667
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:05,840
Wow.

668
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,420
They ran the temples?

669
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:16,020
Some of the subgeniuses were saying that we really should try to salvage the more permanent fixtures of Skull Island.

670
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,300
In fact, it was Imgur that suggested this.

671
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:18,840
Wow.

672
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,720
But we were going, well, how?

673
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,460
I mean, these things are at the bottom of the ocean.

674
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,100
How do you lift up temples?

675
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,940
A tiny army would do it.

676
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,180
Those gigantic temples with huge ape faces on them.

677
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,480
Empty Dobstown of all those reckless children and put them to work restoring.

678
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,420
Balloons.

679
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:45,180
They were thinking, get the bong of destiny and the frop of doom underwater and fill up balloons from the bong of destiny.

680
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:50,640
And use the balloons to lift the bricks to the surface and recreate the temples of...

681
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,360
Skull Island at the British Museum or the Smithsonian or whatever.

682
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:54,780
That is brilliant.

683
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,780
That's absolutely brilliant.

684
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,340
Or Disney World.

685
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,240
That requires an awful lot of what you're not known for having.

686
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,760
I thought it was kind of a dumb idea.

687
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,340
Oh, well, then there you go because I thought you were being dumb.

688
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,160
But, no, really, we had the greatest time.

689
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:18,020
If you never did Google Earth, I don't mean to do an advertisement for an evil conspiracy conglomerate like Google exactly,

690
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,300
except that I got to admit it.

691
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:27,780
I was thrilled to hop from Tiananmen Square to the South Pole to Monument Valley to my elementary school

692
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:33,160
to Innsmouth to Dagon to Komodo Island.

693
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,880
Remember, you could actually see on Easter Island, you could see some of those heads shapes from above.

694
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,000
And Mount Rushmore.

695
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,600
You didn't see Mount Rushmore yet.

696
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,500
George Washington is losing his hair.

697
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,920
Wow, is he becoming a slope head?

698
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,660
From up above.

699
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,120
From seeing from above, you can tell he's starting to lose his hair.

700
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,820
There was once a mighty sequoia on George Washington's head.

701
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,280
That would be pretty good.

702
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,040
Well, why not?

703
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,680
I think they should do things.

704
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,600
I don't think sequoias grow in the Black Hills.

705
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,040
I think America should become greener.

706
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,720
We can fix that.

707
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,940
We can fix it.

708
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,440
On next day.

709
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,340
We can fix it with our own minds, children.

710
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,180
Use our own minds, children.

711
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,080
Well, and also our money.

712
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,580
Childlike minds.

713
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,880
We need minds and money.

714
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,840
That was what the subgeniuses learned.

715
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,280
Yes.

716
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,280


717
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,280


718
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,280


719
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,020
It was a great experiment.

720
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,540
Was that it takes more than money to make money.

721
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,060
It takes a few brain cells.

722
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,100
And that's where we fell short, perhaps.

723
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,340
But we can make up for it with a lot of extra money.

724
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,320
A lot more money.

725
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,340
We're not going to get any more brain cells, but we can sure get more money, friends.

726
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,840
And we can do a lot more with those few brain cells we have.

727
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,920
Think of it that way, astute, young, brainless children.

728
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,000
Look at the conspiracy.

729
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,240
They don't have any brain cells.

730
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,040
All they have is money, and look how well they've done.

731
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,360
They've almost destroyed the planet without the help of aliens.

732
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,200
I don't know if that's the real way you'd put it.

733
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,280
You see a lot of stiffs accumulating in the streets.

734
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,140
Lots of dead bodies growing in number.

735
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,880
The stink is starting to grow.

736
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,480
Well, now, Dave, you've been concerned, haven't you, about...

737
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,620
I mean, you said down the way here that you were getting paranoid about the...

738
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,880
Well, them.

739
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,620
And it.

740
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,280
And those...

741
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,600
Those.

742
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,720
I feel that they're powerful just to have and want too much power.

743
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,160
They can't give us...

744
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,280
Remember, the best control is good old-fashioned management.

745
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,420
Mickey Mouse said that.

746
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,200
Oh, wrong name.

747
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,700
That's a trademark name.

748
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,160
I didn't mean that.

749
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,160
Oh, boy.

750
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,640
Well, this is for a tape later.

751
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,280
One of those cartoon characters said once...

752
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,100
What did they say again?

753
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,400
Something bad about the conspiracy.

754
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,460
Right.

755
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,760
They said it was all made for a bad movie.

756
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,900
What did I...

757
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,340
Oh, boy, that sheet.

758
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:49,900
There you go.

759
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,520
See, our minds are being sapped by the great sappers, I like to say.

760
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,260
That's exactly our point.

761
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,580
But you can help save our few pathetic, raggedy, pitiful brain cells, friends,

762
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,360
when you contribute your own brain cells to our bank.

763
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:14,140
And by brain cells, of course, we mean your donations to the station of your choice.

764
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:19,100
Of course, it could also mean a one-time only limited consumption deal,

765
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,960
in which case...

766
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,500
We will eat those few brain cells you have donated,

767
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,580
but in the attempt to grow more, which won't work, but we'll enjoy it.

768
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,740
Oh, forget it.

769
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:29,980
Well...

770
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,540
Oh, what, Princess Lee?

771
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,060
Oh, no.

772
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,800
Oh, no, no, no.

773
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,740
Oh, yes, yes.

774
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,360
No.

775
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,460
No, no, no, no.

776
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,240
You guys go ahead and munch your brain cells there.

777
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,520
I did not.

778
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,520
Did I give credits earlier in this show for the great work and the collages that we heard

779
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,720
at the head of the show?

780
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,900
I don't believe that you did do any credits for any of those fabulous...

781
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,900
Collages that we heard.

782
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,740
PR News, number 1,348, actually.

783
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:00,920
We heard a whole wonderful set of collages by Leigh Moore.

784
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,980
Fernanda Leigh Moore.

785
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,900
Deep in the bowels of Colorado.

786
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:14,080
And other collages, actually the longer ones, tend to be by Reverend Norell Preff

787
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,880
of norellpreff.com.

788
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,980
And also heavyconfetti.com.

789
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,260
He's a really good guitarist.

790
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,540
He's a guitar player.

791
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,460
And his guitar playing is on heavyconfetti.com.

792
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:33,760
Whereas his preferential Norellian bits and business are on norellpreff.com.

793
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:42,140
And while we're at it, actually, I'm going to run that again just briefly so I can go

794
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:42,760
get my coffee.

795
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,980
One whiff of the aroma from Granny's cook stove and I knew that there would be roast

796
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,860
grandpa for dinner.

797
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,180
Cooked to a tempting russet brown.

798
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,480
And just falling apart.

799
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,040
And I remember that I thought it was the finest grandpa I'd ever tasted.

800
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:55,800
Nourishing.

801
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,580
Heartwarming.

802
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,260
Into its making goes all the good meat of grandpa.

803
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,320
Won't you make a point of having it this weekend?

804
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:01,760
E.

805
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,120
Cola.

806
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,640
Cola.

807
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,700
Presents ESP.

808
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,200
That's your smartest soaring saucer.

809
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,480
Brought to you each Tuesday and Thursday by delicious E.

810
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:10,840
Cola.

811
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,340
Cola.

812
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,080
Proved of highest purity.

813
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,720
E.

814
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,060
Cola.

815
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,420
E.

816
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Cola has more quick food energy and value ounce for ounce than any other leading nationally

817
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,260
known cola.

818
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,720
Yes.

819
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,460
You get the best and twice as much in delicious E.

820
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:24,840
Cola.

821
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,360
Cola.

822
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,880
It's clear, Pedro.

823
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:27,920
Senor.

824
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,560
No good, Pedro.

825
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,340
Narcotic.

826
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,960
Ah, come in, Bart.

827
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,200
Futuristic mode of transportation.

828
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,240
Oh?

829
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:35,900
Oh?

830
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,240
I keep them happy.

831
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,620
They keep me happy.

832
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,180
Happy.

833
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,040
See underneath?

834
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
A rocket attached.

835
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,260
Ready, Bart?

836
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,920
This is your local newscaster with some more on the latest outbreak of flying saucers.

837
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,920
Big and black.

838
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,160
Small and shiny.

839
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:51,520
Six.

840
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:51,820
Six.

841
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,120
Six.

842
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,140
Now back to Pussycats.

843
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,020
E.

844
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,420
Cola.

845
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:56,800
E.

846
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,000
Cola.

847
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,460
Sure hits the spot.

848
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,580
Enjoy E.

849
00:30:59,660 --> 00:30:59,980
Cola.

850
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,220
E.

851
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:00,600
Cola.

852
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,100
Tonight.

853
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,340
Truth is fiction.

854
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,640
And this is Be Orbit, Be Not.

855
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,540
Thomas Jefferson Chambers of Anoak, Texas was killed by looking into a mirror.

856
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,920
But the very next morning, the police found him in perfect health.

857
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,980
Then, 15 years later, he was hypnotized.

858
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,940
He was hypnotized by Timothy Crother.

859
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,260
While under the hypnotic spell, he cried out,

860
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,120
I'm dying.

861
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,020
I'm dying.

862
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,040
And didn't know it.

863
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,320
Then, 13 years later, the police found the victim's chest hanging on the wall.

864
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,300
Then, 10 years later, he was killed again.

865
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,800
Then, 41 years later, he died twice.

866
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:46,340
Then, 5 years later, in a dream on the night of January 16th, 1862, he was hypnotized by 10 years of marriage.

867
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,120
The dream requires the same woman.

868
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,500
The dream requires the same woman.

869
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,880
Be Orbit, Be Not.

870
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,680
Be Orbit, Be Not.

871
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,360
Good morning.

872
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,580
Good morning.

873
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,980
Well, this just feels funny, doesn't it?

874
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,820
Where's the dirt?

875
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,180
I couldn't believe.

876
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,740
I can't believe.

877
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,460
Be evolved.

878
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,960
Be evolved.

879
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:30,580
all, come as you are, come as you are, come as you are, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

880
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:40,720
ah, ding of the throat and the bleeding, since he's came, only good people can come,

881
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:53,460
who touched me, the prostitutes did, focus on that and just stay right there for a long time,

882
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,460
tonight on 9 news at 10, watch 9 news at 10,

883
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:31,260
but first, here's a mighty swell gang, you'll want to spread the news around that you're

884
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,420
collecting those slick new friends, because that's the only way they'll trade duplicates with

885
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:40,560
them, and you won't want to miss out on that fun, you want to be sure you round out

886
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:40,700
your friends, and you want to be sure you round out your friends, and you want to be sure you

887
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,740
of all 18 different friends, like Smitty and K.O. and Herbie, and of course, and the best part is,

888
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,460
you don't have to ask mom, remember, that's P.P.

889
00:33:54,260 --> 00:34:01,500
Unlike this 500 pound mouse that is inside of you, Jesus spoke of it when he said,

890
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,680
here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty,

891
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,460
one, three, zero,

892
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,300
one, three,

893
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,300
one, three, zero,

894
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,340
one, three,

895
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,160
Bob, Bob, Bob,

896
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:34,840
I've killed probably a couple hundred living and whole human beings, did I just commit mass murder?

897
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:40,240
No, because each of these human beings is nothing more than a part of a larger,

898
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:40,660
me.

899
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:45,440
Now what's great about that is that people tend not to want living human beings.

900
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,100
To put that in even clearer terms.

901
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,220
So what do you think God is like?

902
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:50,720
A fly?

903
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,420
Wow.

904
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,500
Whoa, man, that was some weird typings there.

905
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,220
Yeah, it made me feel really funny.

906
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,540
Be orphaned?

907
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:00,600
Lean on to it.

908
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:01,940
Lean on to it.

909
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,040
I can't.

910
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,500
I can't.

911
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:09,760
I can't.

912
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,600
Oh, the sky wants all whiskey don't it?

913
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:11,760
Forget.

914
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,800
Be orphaned.

915
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,920
Lean on it.

916
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,800
Lean on it.

917
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,360
From Fernanda and the Leaner.

918
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,480
And those other little businesses there.

919
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:21,760
Lean on it.

920
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,560
There was some Norell.

921
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,160
Lean on it.

922
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,640
Cut ups of our friends and people that we hate.

923
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,440
And all manner.

924
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,260
All man-our.

925
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,040
All man-our of people.

926
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,100
All manure of people.

927
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,380
Listen.

928
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,840
Isn't there something important we're supposed to be covering?

929
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,200
Magdalene's case.

930
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:52,180
The actual existence of Bob Dobbs is a matter not only of physical record but a matter of

931
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,380
scientific inquiry taken to its further...

932
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,820
Didn't they find Bob's bones or something like that?

933
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,960
I remember seeing it in the news.

934
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,220
I've been very busy.

935
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,460
What is that knocking like an old robot that needs to be repaired?

936
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,420
Is that your machine?

937
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:13,620
It was a very, very, very, very low setting for a rhythm device.

938
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,440
It's Dave's robot.

939
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,620
You've worn it before, Stang.

940
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:17,820
Look.

941
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,640
It's Dave's monkey.

942
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,500
It's his monkey.

943
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,900
Dave's monkey is making the little funny noises there.

944
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,600
It's Dave and his monkey.

945
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,000
And now it's gone.

946
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:27,920
It's gone?

947
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,300
You killed the...

948
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:29,440
Oh.

949
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,860
Dave killed the monkey.

950
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,680
Dave killed the monkey.

951
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,560
Dave the organ grinder and his monkey.

952
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,820
He killed his monkey.

953
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,880
Dave killed his monkey.

954
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,320
He killed his monkey.

955
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,380
He killed his monkey.

956
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,080
What a spaz.

957
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,300
What a spazzy show.

958
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,620
No, it's good when you kill the monkey on your back.

959
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:44,840
What's wrong with these people?

960
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:49,040
You're not supposed to continuously ask yourself questions like this.

961
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,800
Go back to the original conversation.

962
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,080
You've forgotten what you were talking about.

963
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,420
Please.

964
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,140
Let's get on Google Earth and go back to the rocary in Amsterdam.

965
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,680
Yeah, let's go globe hopping again.

966
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,880
So do you guys relive that when you do that?

967
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,980
The red light district.

968
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,600
Yes.

969
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,480
You actually...

970
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,300
Well, when you land on a spot, you can't...

971
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:08,360
You can't...

972
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:13,340
Obviously, you can't smell the smells because they haven't done that, but you can look at

973
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:18,700
it from street view if somebody else has been there before and put their pictures of street

974
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,460
view there.

975
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,140
So there are all these spots that you can land on where you can then sort of look around

976
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,980
and go, oh, what a lovely building.

977
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,560
Why those pigeons are frozen in midair, flying.

978
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,060
I forgot the name of the red light district.

979
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:32,520
People are all frozen.

980
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,200
Are they still frozen?

981
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,160
Barrio Rojo, if it's the Spanish version.

982
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:37,720
No.

983
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,760
No, I mean in Amsterdam, and it's Barschensnoven or Redenschnap.

984
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,140
Where?

985
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,200
War...

986
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,380
Reden Twanger.

987
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,260
Warrens...

988
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,220
Warn?

989
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:57,620
Oud Zijtjes-Ochterberg is the main canal that the famous prostitution store windows

990
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:04,660
are on, which Princess Wee and I have strolled down there and window shopped, the prostitutes

991
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,340
of Amsterdam.

992
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,700
Ironically, to have a name like that.

993
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:07,700


994
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,380
And the name of an octopus included a place where you would find prairie squid.

995
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,960
There is, in fact, a big prairie squid in front of one of the main clubs.

996
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,000
It's the red something, the red piggy tail or something.

997
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,220
The red peckerwood.

998
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,560
It was Jim's place before.

999
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,660
It's got to be a pig, lit up red in front.

1000
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,640
No, it's not a pig, actually.

1001
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,600
It's something that looks like an upright pig.

1002
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,520
You're thinking of the pig and whistle, which is a...

1003
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:32,880
Sporting.

1004
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,680
A sporting pig in front.

1005
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:36,680
Ausstü...

1006
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,320
Ausstü...

1007
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,400
Ausstübleeft.

1008
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,000
I feel like I've been sitting in one of those coffee shops.

1009
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:43,840
I don't know.

1010
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,420
That's the thing.

1011
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:52,040
When you do this globe hopping on this Google Earth thing, if you go to Amsterdam and spend

1012
00:38:52,040 --> 00:39:00,420
much time there, you'll get pretty high or hurt or whatever it is that happens to you

1013
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,660
if you wander around the...

1014
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:05,020
Well, you get high when you leap up out of there to go away.

1015
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,600
When you Ausstübleeft your way out.

1016
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,300
I don't know.

1017
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:07,300


1018
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:07,340
I don't know.

1019
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,320
And then you can hop over to the Vatican or...

1020
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:16,560
You go out into outer space and you see the whole world rotating around underneath your

1021
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:16,860
feet.

1022
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,220
Yeah, but you can only go a certain...

1023
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,160
You can only go a certain...

1024
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,600
You know, it does make you feel like the world is not that big.

1025
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,220
It certainly does.

1026
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:27,040
Now, if you go over certain sections, it's like flying in an orbiting of...

1027
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,240
You can see this incredible detail.

1028
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,120
That's why it's like Jetson's world.

1029
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,720
I saw Philo in his...

1030
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,800
It looks like paper machining.

1031
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:32,980
It does.

1032
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,440
I saw somebody in Philo's hot tub.

1033
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,300
In the...

1034
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:37,300


1035
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,400
Through Google Earth.

1036
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,400
There have also been collections, I think, on Wired Magazine of pictures of people sunbathing

1037
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,500
that were found upon Google Earth and embarrassing things like that.

1038
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,240
Well, some of them may be...

1039
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:53,860
Appear to be sunbathing, but they're actually collecting rays from a vastly different source,

1040
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,040
I must say.

1041
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,980
But there was definitely somebody in Philo's hot tub.

1042
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,880
Were they there sunbathing or...

1043
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,520
I don't know if it was Philo or Mrs. Drummond or both of them, and I could tell that they

1044
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,300
were going from one to the other.

1045
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,720
But I don't think I'm supposed to say either one of the things they were going from and

1046
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,600
to on the air.

1047
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,300
But I couldn't tell who it was.

1048
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,860
I could tell what they were doing, though.

1049
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,020
No, if you've had a...

1050
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,520
And it's from looking down from above.

1051
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,760
And if you have the expensive $400 Google Earth, you can see through the rooftops.

1052
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,000
And if you have the $1,000 one, you can pick up audio and listen to conversations.

1053
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,280
But they're timestamps.

1054
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,880
They're not like happening right now.

1055
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,700
They're from hours or days or weeks before or months.

1056
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,300
Well, I...

1057
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,440
Well, that's a way of finding rats and other rodents in your attic.

1058
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:46,260
So you could listen to the Pope conversing with his altered boys, but it might have been

1059
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,020
years ago, and you wouldn't be able to really pick up any good tactical...

1060
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,700
Nuclear weapons.

1061
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,800
No, that's another thing.

1062
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:58,080
The Pope doesn't necessarily have tactical or nuclear weapons, but sound travels much

1063
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,620
slower than hearing.

1064
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:04,240
So I think you're talking about your ear balls or perhaps light, which you actually don't

1065
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,720
see with.

1066
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,140
You see what I'm saying?

1067
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,180
The speed of light...

1068
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,700
Well, I can't afford that version of Google Earth anyway, so it's kind of a moot point.

1069
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,720
Yeah, but see, if you were to listen to the Pope speaking in the pasture, we'll say, you

1070
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,700
know, many, many years ago, you'd have to go into a different time loop and see him

1071
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:19,920
there.

1072
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:26,340
Well, people in the future will be able to look back to the past, starting when Google

1073
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:32,520
Earth started and hear what people said and did through Superman vision.

1074
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,380
What you're saying, if you were going faster than the speed of sound, you could hear what

1075
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,120
you just said.

1076
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,040
Right.

1077
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,720
I could, yeah, if I tune in Google...

1078
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,620
Now I have this station bookmarked, right?

1079
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,280
You saw it.

1080
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,100
I showed it to you.

1081
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,300
Among other things, yeah, bookmarking is one of the words you're using now.

1082
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:48,660
Yeah.

1083
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,600
I know.

1084
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:04,860
I got stuck through it this evening.

1085
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:11,140
I ran up to the building, you know, and here are the images I saw, and I just saw a headline

1086
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,680
that said something that was like, do you know who this person is, can I call you?

1087
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:15,900


1088
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:15,900


1089
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,460
And I was like, like...

1090
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,620
Then we were talking the other day and I was like, do you rememberoup sticker with

1091
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,660
your thin bad hair?

1092
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,340
Do you know who that is?

1093
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:25,340


1094
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:25,340


1095
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,220
And so I'm just kind of, I'm really bad, aren't I?

1096
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:26,480
You have no idea.

1097
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:26,580
That's f***** me up.

1098
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:26,580


1099
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:26,580


1100
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:26,580


1101
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,720
and microscope at all those many petri dishes.

1102
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,920
That's old age thinking.

1103
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,160
Yeah, of course it is.

1104
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:31,700
Of course it is.

1105
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,840
But it is the foundation for our...

1106
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,760
Sure, that's where our primate juices are created.

1107
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:43,280
But you can do that and have the virtual world, both.

1108
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,960
Of course, you have to be able to afford all that world travel.

1109
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,360
Yeah.

1110
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,260
What?

1111
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,840
Oh, because...

1112
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,380
Well, because they charge you.

1113
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,180
You know, I don't know if you knew that, Princess Wee,

1114
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,800
but we're charged for every leap that we do on Google Earth.

1115
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,920
You're being silly now, Reverend Stang.

1116
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,660
No, he has...

1117
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,500
That's not true.

1118
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,320
He gets 100% increase for every security clearance he jumps, humps, or pumps.

1119
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,960
That is so not true.

1120
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,920
For instance, you can look at NORAD, but it's going to cost you.

1121
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,740
Oh, you can look at it backwards as DONAR, meaning you're being taken away.

1122
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,660
That's a bunch of baloney and hoo-ha.

1123
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,820
No, it's not.

1124
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,960
Now, if you have the money, you can, as one guy put it,

1125
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:31,360
you can see down the front of the dress of the premier's wife in Russia.

1126
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,620
I simply didn't believe that.

1127
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,020
From these satellites.

1128
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,240
That's how good they are.

1129
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,200
Why would you say...

1130
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,780
They can read a license plate from outer space.

1131
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,100
Okay, if you're one of those...

1132
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,000
They can read a comic book from outer space.

1133
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,180
It prints bigger than nine points.

1134
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,460
See, now you think about famous ejerculators like the Oye guy.

1135
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,240
Yeah.

1136
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,880
Okay, now...

1137
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,520
How is that any different from us?

1138
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:50,980
No, no, no.

1139
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,260
I'm just saying, how could that possibly compare?

1140
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,920
Is your favorite voyeur in Wankula?

1141
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,100
How could that possibly compare to a guy who is obsessed,

1142
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:05,040
perhaps even asphyxiatedly addicted to looking down the Russian premier's wife's cleavage

1143
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,680
and pronouncing his own wisdom upon Pangey?

1144
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,100
Well, that's exactly...

1145
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,640
You're talking to him, Bob.

1146
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,400
She's built like a brick temple.

1147
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,760
He's a little close to home there, did ya?

1148
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,400
You've been staring at Putin's pooper.

1149
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:23,800
No.

1150
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,320
No.

1151
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,280
This is Putin's...

1152
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,060
Putin.

1153
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,360
Oh, no, no.

1154
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,780
Now, kids...

1155
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,240
Putin.

1156
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:32,920
That's Putin.

1157
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:33,720
We...

1158
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:39,200
No, it really is quite amazing technology and makes me...

1159
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,000
It's like being on a little magic carpet that you can't fall off of.

1160
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,040
Why would you want to fall off of?

1161
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,900
Well, you would want to, for instance, get off of the carpet in the red light district

1162
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,700
in Amsterdam now and then.

1163
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,060
Yeah.

1164
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,200
And walk into the...

1165
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:55,700
Museum.

1166
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,280
The Reich Museum.

1167
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:57,900
That's it.

1168
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:58,600
The Reich Museum.

1169
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,200
Yeah.

1170
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,160
Or...

1171
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,400
The Van Gogh Museum.

1172
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,180
The Van Gogh Museum.

1173
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:02,860
Yeah.

1174
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,140
Some place like that.

1175
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:03,880
Sure.

1176
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,220
That's the kind of stuff that everybody does.

1177
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:06,640
That's what we did.

1178
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,000
Yeah.

1179
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:12,220
You wouldn't do, like, Philo and go to Zazub or whatever that place was.

1180
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,080
The famous...

1181
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,180
Is it a...

1182
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,560
The Christopher Street.

1183
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,340
What was it?

1184
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:17,900
I forget.

1185
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,580
He had some secret Masonic thing.

1186
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,340
Oh, he was always getting little secret special places to go for certain...

1187
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,760
Certain particular tastes.

1188
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,800
Well, he's a 33rd degree Mason.

1189
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:28,580
Philo.

1190
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,880
Oh, that Philo.

1191
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:30,300
Yeah.

1192
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,400
I'm only a 31.

1193
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:35,840
Well, what's the difference between the different, like, degrees once you get up in the 30s?

1194
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,640
Well, you're not supposed to know about...

1195
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,680
Could you be, like, a 57 degree or could...

1196
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,220
You're not...

1197
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,000
Any numbers are possible.

1198
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,920
You don't know about those until you've gotten...

1199
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,180
You've reached the very, very top, the 32nd degree.

1200
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,340
And then they let you know about the ones after that.

1201
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,620
Look at Jesus Capristo.

1202
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,420
You know, our lordly person.

1203
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:55,920
You can if you could.

1204
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,960
Yeah, you could if you would.

1205
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,020
If he wasn't invisible.

1206
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,760
But, well, you'd have to take a Google Snap and you'd have to enjoy it all the way.

1207
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,160
And the next thing you know, you'd find yourself over the macrame...

1208
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,180
I mean, you know, the machine island.

1209
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,760
And then it's back to there.

1210
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,460
Man, I think you could go whiplash from something like that.

1211
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,240
No, that was...

1212
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,620
I was talking about...

1213
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,240
See?

1214
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:14,920
There it goes.

1215
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,800
I was talking about Jesus again being a 33 as opposed to an expanded bra.

1216
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,520
Which is like a D cup or something like that.

1217
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,400
What does Jesus...

1218
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,120
Does Jesus' age have to do with Masonic...

1219
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,820
Or his bra size?

1220
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,700
Or the Templi Orientis ranks.

1221
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:34,540
Well, if Jesus wore a man bra, meaning he had achieved to elderly status,

1222
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,660
wouldn't he be around 53rd degree, meaning his waist size?

1223
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,420
They don't call those man bras.

1224
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,020
They call them aprons.

1225
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:41,700
Aprons.

1226
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,160
Right.

1227
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,940
And then they also have wizard hats.

1228
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,060
Now, what if he was so bald that wizard hat would fall off on the floor?

1229
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,220
It's hard to imagine.

1230
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,000
Masonic guys wear wizard hats and have little sparkly...

1231
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,180
Yeah.

1232
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,140
Sure, of course.

1233
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,460
Of course.

1234
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,960
Yeah, they look like wizards.

1235
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,400
They dress up like, well, that's what they are.

1236
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,820
Well, in the higher realms.

1237
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,660
Not the guys, not the shriners in the little cars,

1238
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,880
the guys at the Masonic Temple downtown,

1239
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,900
but the guys in Washington, the guys in the Himalayas,

1240
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,980
the guys in the moons of Saturn, those guys.

1241
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,680
Those are the singular eyeball...

1242
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,360
Those are the elder bankers of the universe.

1243
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,020
The eyeball guys of the pyramid.

1244
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,040
The council of 23.

1245
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,160
Guys, you're scaring me.

1246
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:23,340
The ring...

1247
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:23,380
The ring...

1248
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:23,380


1249
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:23,380


1250
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:23,980
You're scaring me.

1251
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:24,660
...of 39.

1252
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,520
There's 23 or 39.

1253
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,740
Oh, now this is getting silly.

1254
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:29,800
We're talking about numbers.

1255
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,700
No, there are both.

1256
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,720
Okay.

1257
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,280
33.

1258
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,060
This is...

1259
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,600
And the listeners aren't interested in a bunch of occult secrets

1260
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,700
because they can't relate it to anything.

1261
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:40,180
I'm not a fan of them.

1262
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,020
We can give them away here because there's no one listening

1263
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,320
who understands what the hell we're talking about.

1264
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,360
The last part of the sentence was unnecessary.

1265
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,260
Which gives us a certain amount of freedom.

1266
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,420
And a certain low number of listeners.

1267
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,020
Right.

1268
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,860
You could have just said, because no one's listening,

1269
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,000
but instead you said that.

1270
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,760
Listen to this lovely...

1271
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,480
Ooh.

1272
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,420
...what I've imagined.

1273
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,800
It's magical sounding.

1274
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,820
I could play right along here.

1275
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,380
I don't want to ruin anything for you.

1276
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,220
It's all twinkly.

1277
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,000
Who is that twinkling?

1278
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,480
Is that Rudy Schwartz?

1279
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,520
No, it's not.

1280
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,060
I really don't know what it is.

1281
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,400
I'm kind of lost in the ozone as far as I'm concerned.

1282
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,020
I don't know what that is.

1283
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,340
It says DSDR.

1284
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,640
I'm lost in the magicalness of it.

1285
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,800
Now, did you know that there were people...

1286
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,540
Maybe just John.

1287
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,380
...who tried to divine the actual occurrences of Anna Nicole's demise

1288
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,880
through the smirches in her tampon.

1289
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,520
Did you hear that?

1290
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,600
What?

1291
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:46,320
A witch lady who claimed that she had never achieved anything less than perfect success.

1292
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,280
A psychic?

1293
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,760
A psychic doctor.

1294
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,000
She was diagnosing the death of the Saint Anna Nicole.

1295
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,360
By?

1296
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,720
By the squadges, the smudges on her tampoon.

1297
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,140
And much the way somebody might read tea leaves or try and talk back to like a tea tree plant.

1298
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:02,440
If they can.

1299
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:03,920
Uh-huh.

1300
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,720
See, that just sounds like me staying.

1301
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,800
Now you're going to leave that on because it's Larry Schwartz.

1302
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:09,880
It does.

1303
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,500
No, this is just John.

1304
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,540
It's something called Juniper Zombie and it does sound like you.

1305
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,640
See, I'm as good as Juniper John when I'm just hitting my elbows and stuff.

1306
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,340
No, I'm sorry, Juniper.

1307
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:21,960
You can play along.

1308
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,580
I'm sorry, John.

1309
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,720
I think this is brilliant because...

1310
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,980
Not Juniper John, just right.

1311
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,280
It's called Juniper Zombie.

1312
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:27,860
Oh.

1313
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,140
Is the name of this composition.

1314
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,560
So he's also been to the Southwest to look at the mummies.

1315
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,020
Whatever happened to you, it apparently happened to him too.

1316
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,140
We're talking about John right now.

1317
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,720
Bob came and did something to all of us.

1318
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,960
He left his thumbprint on someone's...

1319
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,320
On our forebrains.

1320
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,020
Yes.

1321
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,940
The whorls of Bob's thumbprint are embedded in all of us.

1322
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,480
All of us right in our third eye or where our third eye would be if we hadn't had them.

1323
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:02,220
The doctor didn't snip it off for religious, crazy old, useless religious reasons.

1324
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,880
You know, when you're born, they snip off your third eye.

1325
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:05,880
Boys and girls.

1326
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:06,520
Whoa.

1327
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:07,460
You didn't know that, did you?

1328
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:07,820
No.

1329
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,440
You didn't even know you had a third eye, did you?

1330
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:09,980
That's appalling.

1331
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,160
Well, that's what they do.

1332
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:11,820
And it's why?

1333
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,100
Because of some ancient tradition.

1334
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,000
There's no real health reason for it.

1335
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:16,520
That's so tragic.

1336
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,340
They snip off a piece of your body when you're a little baby.

1337
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,100
A piece of your brain.

1338
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,240
It has a different name.

1339
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:21,660
When you...

1340
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,040
You snip off a female part of the third eye.

1341
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:24,660
It's called the...

1342
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,660
It's different.

1343
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,340
But it's still the same thing.

1344
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,000
It's snipping the third eye.

1345
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,980
Well, I knew what I was talking about for a brief moment.

1346
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,220
I've never known anything you've been talking about.

1347
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,480
Well, this has been an unusually insane hour of slack.

1348
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:49,880
Well, I was thinking about Lenten practices, you know, and getting hit in the forehead with a good old dusting of smudge.

1349
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,520
And then I was thinking about Bob.

1350
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:57,580
And then I was thinking about Bob going around to his parishioners and gouging out their third eye as if it was the last day of the, you know, stations or something.

1351
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,980
No, he gouges out their wallets.

1352
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,200
Well...

1353
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,800
It's a wallet gouging food.

1354
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,300
That hurts.

1355
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:05,740
That Bob is.

1356
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,020
It's too bad he couldn't hurt the necropolis of D.C.

1357
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:09,740
You know what I'm saying?

1358
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,440
The great Bilderbergners or hamburger employers or whatever they are.

1359
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,540
The guys who control the cheeseburger.

1360
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:16,640


1361
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,040
The consumers are the great...

1362
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1363
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:20,380
Yeah.

1364
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:21,640
Yeah.

1365
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,640


1366
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,640


1367
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,640


1368
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,640


1369
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,640


1370
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,640


1371
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,640


1372
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,640


1373
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,640


1374
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,640


1375
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,640


1376
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,640


1377
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,640


1378
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:21,640


1379
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,260
Yeah.

1380
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:22,420
Yeah.

1381
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:22,760
Yeah.

1382
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,360
Yeah.

1383
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:23,700
Yeah.

1384
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:23,720
Yeah.

1385
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:23,720


1386
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:23,720


1387
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:23,720


1388
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:23,720


1389
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:23,720


1390
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:23,720


1391
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:23,720


1392
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:23,720


1393
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:23,720


1394
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:23,720


1395
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:23,720


1396
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:23,720


1397
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:23,720


1398
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:23,720


1399
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:23,720


1400
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,760
Some people get confused between the conspiracy and the conspiracy dupes.

1401
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,900
It's just as some get confused between an application and the file that the application creates.

1402
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:40,620
The program and the actual content created from the programs.

1403
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,120
That is the tissue that's consumed.

1404
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,240
Some fear for the doctor and some fear for the patient.

1405
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,500
God, that reminds me.

1406
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,160
Oh, wow.

1407
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,000
I have to...

1408
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,180
I have to...

1409
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,620
And when the tissue is made of cheese...

1410
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,320
Cheese, it melts away so quickly.

1411
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,540
I have to go to the doctor tomorrow and get a sample.

1412
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,100
They're going to take a core sample.

1413
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:05,900
We're going to drill all the way down to the bag mud and just to see if there's oil.

1414
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:06,880
The doctor.

1415
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,240
All over.

1416
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,300
The doctor will tell you.

1417
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:09,960
Yeah, all over.

1418
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,720
My entire body I'm having these six inch holes drilled.

1419
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,220
Tiny little...

1420
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,100
So they're going to make little petroleum ports on you to try and...

1421
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,420
They want to see if there's gas.

1422
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,860
He's going to be acubated.

1423
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:26,460
I heard that you could do it with sonic just sounding, but they said that...

1424
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:26,580
That's the old way.

1425
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,220
They insisted.

1426
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:30,900
This doctor said they had to poke and dig these chunks out of me.

1427
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:36,240
Usually just takes a little, an index finger poke on the abdomen to find out if there's

1428
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,680
really a rich source of gas.

1429
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,320
There's some violent music in the background.

1430
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,300
And I'm really confused now.

1431
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,740
The music confused me.

1432
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,900
Dave is thinking, well, I could do that.

1433
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,700
I've got a Casio.

1434
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,040
But can't you see the difference?

1435
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,620
It's like Beethoven, man.

1436
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,440
That's great.

1437
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,860
Just banging away.

1438
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,040
I was playing difficult figures here with both of my fingers.

1439
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,920
You didn't notice how complex that was, Reverend Stang?

1440
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,760
You're going to listen to that later and just be marveling at the complexity.

1441
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:20,500
You're losing your polyrhythmic contrapuntal device you wear.

1442
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,680
Well, I'm not sure...

1443
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,000
If I take LSD or something, that might be true.

1444
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:29,840
I might listen to that and go, oh, that is like so totally avant-garde.

1445
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,740
I am into this.

1446
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:36,120
I can read where his mind was coming from, man, when he did this music.

1447
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,980
I'm like with him while he composes this.

1448
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,180
Do we really think he knows what he's talking about when he's saying this?

1449
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,120
I might as well really be the genius doing this music.

1450
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,240
Because we're like all one.

1451
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:50,620
And just because I'm just some kid tripping on drugs doesn't mean that Beethoven,

1452
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,040
is any better than me.

1453
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,260
Because I can hear this stuff and appreciate it because of the drugs.

1454
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:00,100
Therefore, I'm like the same genius as him, see?

1455
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,000
Psst, you're dead.

1456
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,700
That's what every kid is thinking when he's listening to his favorite rock song.

1457
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,240
Psst, you're dead.

1458
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,080
I know that because that's what I used to think.

1459
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:07,800
You're dead.

1460
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,020
But I don't think anymore.

1461
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,700
Beethoven is a businessman.

1462
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,500
I swore off.

1463
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,880
This world was created by you, for you.

1464
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,800
There's no such thing as solipsism unless you get it on a pizza.

1465
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,400
Get it, kid?

1466
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,980
You know what I'm talking about, kid?

1467
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,820
You can pitch, you can play, you can sing, yeah?

1468
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,160
You were born with huge feet and tiny little knuckles.

1469
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,180
You're made for it.

1470
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,040
Step into the light, kid.

1471
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,800
Here comes Santa Bob to take you to your just desserts.

1472
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,380
Or reward.

1473
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,820
I forget the word.

1474
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,280
Is that the contract?

1475
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,080
That's a standard contract, isn't it?

1476
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:50,680
It says here, your reward shall be a gigantic bag of intercellular pudding created by the

1477
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,620
Zedron people.

1478
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:56,940
The Zedron people run the many fine galaxies of the northeast and the Pegasus universe itself.

1479
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,640
I bet there's a lot of people who get up and get into it.

1480
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,360
And friends, you're listening to Hour of Slack number 1091.

1481
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:07,060
The Hour of Slack, voice of the Church of the Subgenius.

1482
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:13,140
And if you are interested in knowing more about that, you can look at subgenius.com.

1483
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:18,360
By the way, subgenius does not have an O in it.

1484
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:19,180
O?

1485
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,660
Shibu Sam, come quickly.

1486
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:26,520
Someone showed it in the vault of the ship we have evacuated.

1487
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,460
They've killed Captain Squirlus.

1488
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,360
How are we going to get out of here?

1489
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,280
This is me.

1490
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:32,900
Listen.

1491
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,600
The law will be upheld.

1492
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,380
If your honor, please, I move to .

1493
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,620
That's correct, your honor.

1494
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,200
That's what you think.

1495
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,620
Very well.

1496
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,160
Are you crazy?

1497
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:54,780
Oh, sure.

1498
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:58,620
If your honor, please, send this to the commander of the ship.

1499
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,840
That expresses it perfectly.

1500
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:01,740
Yeah?

1501
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,420
Kill me.

1502
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,240
Very well.

1503
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:05,260
Look out!

1504
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,520
Oh, no.

1505
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,820
Her mother died.

1506
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,660
That's her laugh.

1507
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:16,480
Is it?

1508
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,320
Yeah.

1509
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,040
There's a real problem.

1510
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:19,160
We have to find the real problem.

1511
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,160


1512
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,160


1513
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,160


1514
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,160


1515
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,160


1516
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,160


1517
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,160


1518
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,160


1519
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,160


1520
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:19,320
It's a serious problem here.

1521
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:23,440
Political leaders have got to stop hiding brass tacks outside of the box.

1522
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,800
And in fact, there's a real problem here.

1523
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,380
Political leaders have got to stop hiding outside of the box.

1524
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:34,420
In short, bureaucrats and diplomats can't take it further.

1525
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,160
In short, there's a real problem here.

1526
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,460
Political leaders have got to stop the box.

1527
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,820
The world and how it works.

1528
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,960
We can achieve nothing.

1529
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,380
Selling our families.

1530
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,040
Selling it.

1531
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:46,500
Selling it.

1532
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,000
Ghouls.

1533
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,060
Selling our children.

1534
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,160
Control our economy.

1535
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:55,020
are thought. Second, beyond belief. Narrow-minded pettiness and prejudice. Ten percent. One, one,

1536
00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:00,220
two, three, four, and five. Ideas are worthless. Keep in mind that you have nothing. More money,

1537
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:06,320
more money. Stop thinking. Stop thinking. Hey, hey, mount. Ask, and it shall be given you. Go at it as

1538
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:10,580
you've never done before. Wake up and live. Gradually, your new habit will form. Nothing

1539
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:14,620
great was ever accomplished. Fear and fear is crippling. Get you off. Get you off. Why should

1540
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:19,220
I bother? Well, look at the alternative. Fear and frustration. Keep looking for something for

1541
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:23,040
nothing, or keep looking for something for nothing, or you're successful if you earn a lot of money.

1542
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:29,280
Give me heat, and then I'll add the wood. The wood. We've got to put the fuel in. We've got to put the

1543
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,160
fuel in. Had you ever thought of this yardstick before? Enrich yourself by deluding others. It

1544
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:40,380
may take some time. Put out. Put out. One, two, three, four, five, six. Start today. Thank you.

1545
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,500
You have nothing. You have nothing. You want to. You want to.

1546
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:52,220
You want to. Come. Come. We aired. We aired. He has a cult history. I am a great threat to this

1547
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:58,500
nation called fundamentalism. The great threat to this nation posed by fundamentalism. Well,

1548
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:04,400
it's great to have an opportunity to be with you. Rediscovering fundamentalism. I heard you speak.

1549
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:12,240
Yeah. You actually believe that the United States, we are truly stupid.

1550
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,600
And that's.

1551
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:20,500
That's why Winston Churchill hangs in my office. Anxiety. Well, you know, anxiety.

1552
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
We are a Hitler. Dick, dick, dick, dick. What? Kill you. What? Kill you.

1553
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,480
Uh, uh, there's not. I mean, what is it? Uh.

1554
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:34,080
The mass murder. Yes. Kill you. Kill us.

1555
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:44,180
Well, well, if a have it both ways, kill 300,000 people. I want this.

1556
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:51,340
I want this. Oh, oh, oh, oh, thank you. Why don't you start out of touch with the American people?

1557
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:08,920
And, uh, you know, uh, I was, uh, headed, um, and, um, I was praying. And when I felt I was

1558
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,020
doing things that were wrong, uh, but I was still doing them.

1559
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,560
If the rumors were true that you were.

1560
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:17,940
In an affair, uh, with Monica Lewinsky.

1561
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:22,440
Well, the, the, the fact is that the, the honest answer is yes, but that it.

1562
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,680
Having somebody beaten up corrupt country of corruption is so deep.

1563
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,880
The very heart of our legal system.

1564
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,400
The, the, the, the, the, the, the deeply turned to dog.

1565
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,580
Uh, dog.

1566
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,820
I enjoy it every time, uh, we have a chance to be together.

1567
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,760
I am always available for you.

1568
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,580
Doc, doc, doc, doc.

1569
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:44,600


1570
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:44,600


1571
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:44,600


1572
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:44,600


1573
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:44,600


1574
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,180
Thank you.

1575
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,340
Uh, dot com.

1576
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,580
Truth is fiction.

1577
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,740
And this is The Orbit Lena.

1578
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:58,640
Hugh Farron was appointed hereditary janitor of Skipton Castle in England.

1579
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,780
He's believed to be inhabited by spirits.

1580
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:05,820
Whenever the king was in a merry mood, he would donate rent money lest the spirits be evicted.

1581
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,580
And they held the job for 38 years.

1582
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,740
And the Grateful King rewarded his descendants with eternal taxes.

1583
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,420
The Orbit Lena.

1584
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:26,320
In a moment I'll tell you about linen trousers, heavy wool stockings, gold embroidered shoes, a wool skirt, two embroidered vests, an apron, scarves, silk kerchiefs, and a heavy head shawl worn over two bonnets.

1585
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,780
It all adds up to one indestructible pilgrim.

1586
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,340
The Orbit Lena.

1587
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:41,400
Hansen, the most famous singer in India's history, was paid the fantastic fee of $45 to 12 successive generations.

1588
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,000
The Orbit Lena.

1589
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,160
In a moment I'll tell you about a king who died of trouble.

1590
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:50,400
He ordered the real king seized and executed on the spot.

1591
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,260
Or not.

1592
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,740
The Orbit Lena.
