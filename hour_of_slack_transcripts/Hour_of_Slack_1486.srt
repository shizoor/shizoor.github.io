00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
From PR News in Washington, I'm chock-full of advertisements.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,680
PR News congratulates New York on becoming the 23rd state to legalize cancer, AIDS, epilepsy, and other conditions.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,180
Hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ohio are still battling some 30 new wildfires, many ignited by fire.

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,380
This is the latest spate of fires outside a U.N.-run school in north-central Ohio.

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,100
This is PR.

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,700
Sunday newspapers called it appalling and disgraceful.

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,040
Well, armed militants called it a moral outrage and a criminal act.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,160
It's being billed as the largest PR news in Washington.

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,000
Vibrant.

10
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,580
Can your heart stand the shocking facts about Bob?

11
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,500
If you're free, it's better.

12
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:58,940
Action.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,740
This is the police.

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,080
Mine.

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:00,300
That.

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,600
Haki.

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,240
Bob.

18
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:28,780


19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,160
Bob?

20
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,380
Bob?

21
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,220
Hello there.

22
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,740
You know, I've been all around this wonderful world of ours,

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,360
and in all this world, nothing else is Bob.

24
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,660
Bob?

25
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,160
Bob?

26
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:19,760
Bob?

27
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:19,880
Bob?

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,740
Bob?

29
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,080
One of these mornings

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,420
One of these mornings

31
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,760
One of these mornings

32
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,860
Bob comes creepin' in the room

33
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,120
Oh, I say

34
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,980
One of these mornings

35
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,920
Bob Dobbs comes a-creepin' in the room

36
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,200
Oh, I say

37
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,540
One of these mornings

38
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,740
Bob comes a-creepin' in the room

39
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,760
Oh, I say

40
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,620
Oh, my lord, my sweet lord

41
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,320
What shall I do?

42
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,500
What shall I do?

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,920
You can call on your president

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,760
But your president won't do you no good

45
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,540
Oh, you can call on your president

46
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,740
But your president won't do you no good

47
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:28,960
Oh, I say

48
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,900
But your president won't do you no good

49
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,220
Oh, I say

50
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,220
One of these mornings

51
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,440
Bob Dobbs comes a-creepin' in the room

52
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,940
Oh, my lord, my sweet lord

53
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,340
What shall I do?

54
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,540
What shall I do?

55
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,260
Bob Dobbs comes a-creepin' in the room

56
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,260


57
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,260


58
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,260


59
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,260


60
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,400
Thank you.

61
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,400


62
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,500
Thank you.

63
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,620
Listen, here's the lowdown

64
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,000
Everybody go down

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,460
Climb into a Greyhound

66
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,060
Find yourself a seat

67
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,200
Head on out to Motown

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,580
Gonna be a showdown

69
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,880
Hypnotizing low sound

70
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,960
Pumpin' to the streets

71
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,160
Another dirty flow

72
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,760
A fight another bloody go-round

73
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,960
Everybody throw down

74
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,940
That's including me

75
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,380
Never gonna slow down

76
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,480
We don't even know how

77
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,760
Everyone we mow down

78
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,020
Joins us eventually

79
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,380
Joins us eventually

80
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,300
guitar solo

81
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,640
Everybody get in line

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,400
Everybody from the new freak nation

83
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,860
Open up your tired eyes

84
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,740
Oh, get up now from your hibernation

85
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,600
Our research shows a shocking rise

86
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
In evil bullshit

87
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,260
And now they pull shit

88
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,140
It's sick

89
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,440
You'd be surprised to know

90
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,640
Just how deep it's got

91
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,060
Or maybe not

92
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,280
So everybody, now's the time

93
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,700
Snag a weapon and file out

94
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,920
Right behind me

95
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,360
The freaky time is coming soon

96
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,960
Our non-believers leave the room

97
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,360
Listen, won't be said again

98
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,920
This is your life to defend

99
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,040
We won't stand idly by

100
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,640
As it devolves into madness

101
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,440
Resolves in a sad mess

102
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,480
A broken pipe dream of the day

103
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,180
When freaks take control

104
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,620
Oh yes, that's right

105
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,240
That's the goal

106
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,300
Now who's still with me?

107
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,400
Hurry up, there's little time

108
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,820
I'm burning up with anticipation

109
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,300
You've heard enough of leaders' lies

110
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,220
Lies

111
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,920
You've learned enough to know

112
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,120
The true frustration

113
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,240
Burning in the hearts of every woman

114
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
Man and child

115
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,200
By a wild style

116
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Sad truth is most folks are trained

117
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,600
In just one thing

118
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,300
Just ignore it

119
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,520
And that's some shit

120
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,640
To turn the other cheek is fine

121
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,880
If you don't care

122
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,760
But if you do

123
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,540
We're counting on you

124
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,260
Raise your hand and take a vow

125
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,780
I'm afraid your species needs you now

126
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,340
You came in thinking life was play

127
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,700
But hey man, that was yesterday

128
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,600
Look around and you'll see

129
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
This is just the beginning

130
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,500
And if your head's spinning

131
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,380
Take that as your cue

132
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,040
Whoop the band

133
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,780
They'll be first to arrive

134
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,840
And if they don't survive

135
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,560
We'll call upon you

136
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,720
The few who understand what's right

137
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,280
The few who hunger for some confrontation

138
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,080
Will get to undertake the fight

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,580
Get set to usher in a new era of freedom

140
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,840
In the new freak nation

141
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,760
No one knows why

142
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,880
All the freaky kids outside are screaming

143
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,400
Or that they're dreaming, scheming

144
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,060
Once it flows this river ain't never gonna stop

145
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,040
Even if we drop

146
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,120
But you just sit on the sub just tight

147
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,420
And imagine all the things you'd change in this world

148
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,300
And you'll never know what's real

149
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,820
And you'll never know what's real

150
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,200
And some of you are gonna fail

151
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,700
Others will end up in jail

152
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,320
Danger lurks so please take care

153
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,900
Try not to get killed out there

154
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,120
Most will say that we're mad

155
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,960
And implore us to give in

156
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,380
But the way that we're living

157
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,740
Just makes my hair curl up your fist

158
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,380
And focus your power

159
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,540
For you'll soon know the hour

160
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,640
Will take back the world

161
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,740
Everybody get in line

162
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,560
Everybody from the new freak nation

163
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,960
Everybody get in line

164
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,940
Everybody from the new freak nation

165
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,260
Everybody now's the time

166
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,760
Snag a weapon and file out right behind me

167
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,920
When the night falls

168
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,640
Once my heart was bound in sorrow

169
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,000
By the mist of conspiracy

170
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,560
Once my heart was bound in sorrow

171
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:36,680
The toilet beckoned kindly, and it drew me to come see.

172
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:47,740
And the sewage, it formed a message, it said 13013.

173
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:59,480
I then heard a voice from Doves Town gently saying, follow me.

174
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:10,880
There's a frog farm down the valley, there's a frog farm past the rain.

175
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,620
There's a frog farm in your sorrow.

176
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,780
When your mind is going insane.

177
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,740
There's a frog farm when you're burdened.

178
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,880
There's a frog farm where you stray.

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:43,680
There's a frog farm, heavenly frog farm, or kill me to say.

180
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,500
Sometimes.

181
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:54,580
My friends forsake me, and I'm tempted to despair.

182
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:03,000
When I summon my dear savior of short duration.

183
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:16,300
And I hear you would pay to know exactly what it is you really think.

184
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:27,160
And I'll guarantee you my brother, you are probably a king.

185
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:38,000
There's a frog farm down the valley, there's a frog farm past the rain.

186
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,080
There's a frog farm in your sorrows.

187
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,380
When your mind is going insane.

188
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,560
There's a frog farm in your sorrow.

189
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,020
And I hear your christening, o take me home.

190
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,480
There's a frog farm within you, when your mind is going insane.

191
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,580
There's a frog farm in your sorrow.

192
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,140
Jorge!

193
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,760
Jorge!

194
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,820
I'll be wherever you are all day.

195
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,460
God's Word.

196
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,820
No mystery, you can do it.

197
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:17,720


198
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,280
What's the least often comment that you hear about a banjo player?

199
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,840
I don't know.

200
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,260
What is the least often comment you hear about a banjo player?

201
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,720
Is that the banjo player's Porsche over there?

202
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,780
The fun thing about ranting up here is if you ever get scared,

203
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,220
you can't see anybody anyway.

204
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,620
If you can ignore hecklers like teeters, it's actually pretty easily done.

205
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,820
And you guys got it easy because GGG isn't here.

206
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,800
Stang doesn't heckle.

207
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,200
We is like the closest visible audience member,

208
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,320
and she's so goddamn sweet, you don't feel bad at all.

209
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,640
I mean, it's really, you know, you guys, if you're in this church,

210
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,980
there's a reason you can't, right?

211
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:22,360
Whether it be you grew up in a town of really messed up crazy Baptists like I did,

212
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:29,300
or maybe the synagogue wasn't working out for you.

213
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,220
Maybe the mosque didn't move you.

214
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,140
Maybe when you went to the coven, it felt wrong.

215
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,540
I don't know.

216
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,620
Everybody's got something.

217
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,320
Something draws you to the church, but what makes you stay?

218
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,300
You know, what gets you off?

219
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,840
We've talked a lot about slack, and we've talked a lot about keeping your slack.

220
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:02,140
And the question always comes up to, I've heard people ask, but what is slack?

221
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,140
So let's put this question out to the audience just for a second.

222
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,020
I'm listening.

223
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,740
I can hear you if I can't see you.

224
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,480
What is slack?

225
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,300
Slack is what you make of it.

226
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,720
You are absolutely right.

227
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,540
Slack is what you make of it.

228
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,920
And what is slack for you may not be slack for me,

229
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,100
and what is slack for me probably isn't slack for you.

230
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,600
But everybody gets their slack.

231
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,200
And as we've talked about, the big key is, as a subgenius, must have slack.

232
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:37,640


233
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,480
Now, some of you are obviously getting a whole lot.

234
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,720
You're getting a lot of slack by sitting on your tuchus.

235
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,560
You're goddamn right I am.

236
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,520
Right.

237
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,900
Who the hell?

238
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,040
Is that YouTube memes?

239
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,180
God damn it.

240
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,400
Some of you get a lot of slack by busting your ass.

241
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,720
And that's okay, too.

242
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,680
But the subgenius must have slack.

243
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,060
However you get it, however you go about it.

244
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,500
And as Suds mentioned, you know, the big key is to not...

245
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,640
steal other people's slack.

246
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,000
The conspiracy does that good enough.

247
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,260
You know, they don't throw you out your own nurseshuts.

248
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:01,260


249
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,480
But they're also going to punish you, right?

250
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:04,820


251
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,000


252
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,000


253
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,200
Whatever, actually.

254
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,220
You.

255
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,220


256
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,600
Show, me.

257
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,900
Say you think I'm stronger than you think I am.

258
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,620
You know what I was Shocking.

259
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,240
Hay there was time when I thought I was THE greater привет.

260
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,500
Worst joke I've ever heard.

261
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,060
And I, I'm a boss of life, it was a boss of life

262
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,220
And any time I wanted to die, I'd die

263
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,280
I wore a hat, and I had a job

264
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,520
And I bought all the blankets so that no one knew

265
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,880
Boss of life, it was a boss of life

266
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,420
Friends were in a way

267
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,860
Boss of life, it was a boss of life

268
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,620
And I thought I had a game

269
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,060
Boss of life, it was a boss of life

270
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,300
I was a woman

271
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,020
Boss of life, it was a boss of life

272
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,880
And I could turn my way and say

273
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,260
And I wore a hat, and I had a job

274
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,460
And I bought all the blankets so that no one knew

275
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,680
Boss of life, it was a boss of life

276
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:09,840
And I thought I had a game

277
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:25,420
And I thought I had a game

278
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,960
And I wore a hat, and I had a job

279
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,480
And I bought all the blankets so that no one knew

280
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,360
Boss of life, it was a boss of life

281
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,760
And I wore a hat, and I had a job

282
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,040
And I bought all the blankets so that no one knew

283
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,240
For all your lies

284
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,820
And I found you

285
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,180
Coming from my bed

286
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,180


287
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,580
Alleys

288
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,780
For all of the pret

289
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,020
All of the pret

290
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,160
O peut

291
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,480
ãy

292
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:14,740
Beer, ketchup, horseradish, bananas, fried rice, choky peanut butter.

293
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,700
Well, that was a sumptuous meal, wasn't it?

294
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,680
Dumb Liar

295
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,580
Break us beer

296
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,220
Break us beer

297
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,180
We need beer

298
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,660
Break us beer

299
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,520
And whiskey, too

300
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,580
We don't ask for a lot

301
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,200
And up on this stage it gets pretty hot

302
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
We're doing it for you

303
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,460
Whether you like it or not

304
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,260
Bring us some

305
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,520
Something to drink

306
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,280
It helps us play

307
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,760
It helps us think

308
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,820
Break us beer

309
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,920
Break us beer

310
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,640
Have us make it clear

311
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,660
This band wants some beer

312
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,840
Break us beer

313
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:39,840


314
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,180
Bring us beer

315
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,940
Bring us beer

316
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,820
So angry Larry won't shed no tears

317
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,960
Bring us beer

318
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,840
Bring us beer

319
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Bring us beer

320
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,880
Praise Reverend Ed Glant

321
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,260
He brought us a beer

322
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:35,920
Bring us beer

323
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,700
But we need more

324
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,460
Bring us beer

325
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,520
Bring us beer

326
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,340
Don't make us shed our tears

327
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,940
Just bring us some more beer

328
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:35,640
Bring us beer

329
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,620
Bring us beer

330
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:35,300
Bring us beer

331
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,040
Bring us beer

332
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,920
Bring it home

333
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,340
Ah, oh oh oh

334
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:54,420
Ah, oh, ah, oh ah

335
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,460
Ha ha ha ha ha

336
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,080
Now on songой

337
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,400
Esquivel

338
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,620
Our children follow

339
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,300
the sleigh

340
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:14,600
And it was only, I think, yesterday that I realized that Milnar was a band that our friend Reverend Stover is in.

341
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:21,620
And they will be playing at the Subgenius Devival in Kent on December 6th.

342
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,700
And we'll talk more details about that later.

343
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:33,180
Because the little song about pork chops was by Evolution Control Committee, currently of Columbus.

344
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:44,140
And then the final thing, the call for beer with Priestess Pisces singing, was the X-Day Jam Band.

345
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,080
Six or more fisted tails of Connie.

346
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,480
In this case, I'm pretty sure that was Reverend Angry Larry on something.

347
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,740
Reverend Suds Pasha on something.

348
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,740
Probably guitars.

349
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,160
And it may have been Reverend Stover on drums, but it was a little looser than that.

350
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,140
We would usually get from him.

351
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,500
Anyway, that's the X-Day credits.

352
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:14,060
We expect to do some more stuff presently.

353
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,820
But for right now, back to the news.

354
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,580
From PR News in Washington, I'm restrained and isolated during the rainstorms.

355
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,960
During storms, rain comes down.

356
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,220
Despite being warned, dry areas known as washes think they can always get PR news.

357
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,080
I mean.

358
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,400
Well, California's Department of Corrections is dead.

359
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,860
Israel's Prime Minister is in his country.

360
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:43,540
U.S. District Judge Lawrence Carlton pepper-sprang mentally ill prisoners to force them from Los Angeles.

361
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,440
Thousands of federal, state, and local litterbugs are putting out the word this weekend.

362
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,660
It's three days of talent shows and PR news in Washington.

363
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:59,760
It is known that the Air Intelligence has in its possession a spacecraft.

364
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,620
31 feet in diameter.

365
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:09,380
And it is entirely undamaged except for a small hole broken in the cockpit.

366
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:17,720
And because of this hole, the 12 small human beings died.

367
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:24,020
The spacecraft made an automatic landing after its occupants had died.

368
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:29,080
The local sheriffs peered into the cockpit.

369
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,500
And they're slumped over their instruments.

370
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,040
The instruments, motionless, were 12 small men.

371
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,140
The bodies were still limp and warm.

372
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,640
They were fair-skinned.

373
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,380
All were males.

374
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,540
They were between 3 and 4 feet in height.

375
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,060
All had differing shades of light hair.

376
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,640
All had blue eyes.

377
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,240
All had perfect teeth without any dental work.

378
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,020
All were superb physical specimens.

379
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,480
With no asymmetrical details.

380
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,580
They could pass on notice as small men or as children.

381
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,780
One body was selected for autopsy.

382
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,900
He was found to have the same organs that a human being has and in about the same place.

383
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,920
His blood type was human.

384
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,520
Genes and chromosomes would match up with those of an earth woman.

385
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,160
Everything was quite normal until the brain surgeon laid bare the right hemisphere of the brain.

386
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,460
There, in his skull, was a human.

387
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,900
The skull was the brain of a human being several hundred years old.

388
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,420
They had never seen so highly convoluted a brain.

389
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:47,180
There was a man several hundred years old who had been spared the infirmities of age.

390
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,580
If they could share their medical secrets with us, what a gift this would be to the human race.

391
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,840
It would be the gift of life to the human race.

392
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,380
Think what that secret would be worth.

393
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,580
Think what an opportunity it would be to develop the psychic powers, to develop culture,

394
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:19,040
and how little space travel would mean to a race whose lifespan was several times longer than our lifespan.

395
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,760
That is one of the benefits they might bring us if we would only stop shooting at them.

396
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,720
Imagine.

397
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,000
Imagine what patience and what forbearance for them to have been fired upon and chased,

398
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,120
and not once to have harmed a human being.

399
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,880
There is nothing to be afraid of.

400
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,400
Will everybody please stop shooting at them?

401
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,420
Ladies and gentlemen, either we are their lost colony or they are our lost cousins.

402
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,080
Undoubtedly, we are somehow related.

403
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:00,600
Undoubtedly, there has been an unbroken link going back a long, long time.

404
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:16,660
Well, I had a dream that the president of Microsoft Word was running around in the grandma's house and he stumbled upon Burt Reynolds.

405
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,940
He was watching some time he fucked up shit on the telly.

406
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,420
The president of Microsoft Word was chasing him around and shooting.

407
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,380
And finally, he traps Burt on the front porch and blows his fucking head off.

408
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,420
Man, that's the truth.

409
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:34,900
.

410
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:34,900


411
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:34,940
.

412
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,300
.

413
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,360
.

414
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:37,540
.

415
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:37,580
.

416
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:37,660
.

417
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,040
.

418
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,420
.

419
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,560
.

420
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,420
.

421
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,040
.

422
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,540
.

423
00:29:59,540 --> 00:29:59,760
.

424
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,240
.

425
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,320
.

426
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,480
Well, it's a God-given fact

427
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,300
That you can't go back, no, you can't go back

428
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,880
It's a God-given law

429
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,120
That you're gonna lose your ma

430
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,760
Yes, you're gonna lose your ma

431
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,500
It's a God-given fact

432
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,740
You gotta buy him by the sack

433
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,300
You gotta buy him by the sack

434
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,880
It's a God-given law

435
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,060
That you're gonna get small

436
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,720
Yes, you're gonna get small

437
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,660
Maybe just another rap

438
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,840
Bet you're running out of sap

439
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,520
Yes, you're running out of sap

440
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,120
Well, you better take a rap

441
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,380
Dying under daddy's cap

442
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,540
Dying under daddy's cap

443
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,840
Shabble up

444
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,920
It's on the top of the list

445
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,040
That you can't get pissed

446
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,660
No, you can't get pissed

447
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,220
It's rule number one

448
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,500
Living right isn't fun

449
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,040
Living right isn't fun

450
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,820
Cause it's a God-given fact

451
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,960
That you can't go back

452
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,560
No, you can't go back

453
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,180
It's a God-given law

454
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,720
That you're gonna lose your ma

455
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,940
Yeah, you're gonna lose your ma

456
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,660
Time-tested and true

457
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,000
You gotta putty-poo-poo

458
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,520
Gotta putty-poo-poo

459
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,220
Well, it's a God-given law

460
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,360
That you're gonna get small

461
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,000
Yes, you're gonna get small

462
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,660
Maybe just another rap

463
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,920
Bet you're running out of sap

464
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,580
Yes, you're running out of sap

465
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,180
Well, you better take a rap

466
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,460
Dying under daddy's cap

467
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,440
Dying under daddy's cap

468
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,820
Now

469
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,400
You're an signals korok

470
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:41,820
And add more

471
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:41,820


472
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,340
Jonah

473
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:48,340


474
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,120
Shout out minimize

475
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,120


476
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,120


477
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,540
Unconvinced

478
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:58,720
All summer

479
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:03,360
15 Life

480
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:09,360


481
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,320
Yes, dear friends.

482
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:40,060
And we have the Psychoskeletons in the background with a song called Plug Lord.

483
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:52,100
We just heard the Sunflower Saints covering Devo doing their classic song Shrivel Up about aging, I think it is.

484
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,880
Sometimes that's my theme song.

485
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,200
Before that, the short one-minute screaming thing.

486
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:07,640
Which will sound a lot different on the X-rated internet version of this show than it does on the broadcast version.

487
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,500
That's by Reagan's Pollock.

488
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,380
They've been re-releasing their crazy old stuff.

489
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,260
And the spoken word piece with music behind it about little space humans.

490
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:27,660
That was done by, insert name here, Joe Jeziorski.

491
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm sorry.

492
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,680
I always bring that guy's stuff to the show without writing...

493
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,540
The log shows the title of it, but not the performer.

494
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,000
Most of these things I know from memory, but he's kind of a new guy.

495
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:42,920
Anyway...

496
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,500
We'll fill in that blank another day.

497
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,640
No, we'll insert name here again.

498
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,280
Yes.

499
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,100
Just to cover it.

500
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:51,440
Yes.

501
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,940
Joe Jeziorski.

502
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,280
So, yes.

503
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,320
I'll have to...

504
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:58,980
I have to...

505
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:58,980


506
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,060
I have to...

507
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,840
Hold the psychoskeletons out.

508
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:04,380
Oh.

509
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,300
Well, no, I kind of have to.

510
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,020
On account of...

511
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,440
Because of technical stuff.

512
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:11,980
Oh.

513
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,900
Gnome sign.

514
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,440
Gnote.

515
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,540
Gnome.

516
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,360
Gnote.

517
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,040
Gnome.

518
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,560
Gnote.

519
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,480
But we do have...

520
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,160
This is six-fisted.

521
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,960
Six or more.

522
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,580
Four-fisted tales of Connie.

523
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,980
That's not tales like stories, by the way.

524
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,220
That's tales like the thing at the end of most animals.

525
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:44,380
And I think this is Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Reverend Angry Larry.

526
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,080
Wow.

527
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,100
Which we could call the two Daves jam.

528
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah.

529
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,720
This was recorded at 9X Day.

530
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,100
I guess that was eight years ago.

531
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,600
Wow.

532
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,840
There's a whole disc of instrumentals here that we're running.

533
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,260
In the background.

534
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,620
And we have news, friends.

535
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,460
Yes.

536
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,240
Lots of news.

537
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:05,720
This particular time.

538
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,760
For one thing, did you know that you can now download subgenius music?

539
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,600
And not by recording this show.

540
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,840
But we did a lot of CDs over the years.

541
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,860
Actually, we did a whole bunch of cassette tapes in the 80s and 90s.

542
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,100
And then we switched to CD.

543
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,880
And most of the old cassettes...

544
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,180
The best parts kind of got reused on some of the CDs.

545
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,360
But the CDs were mostly from the 2000 through 2010 or so.

546
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,680
And we're working...

547
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,400
We're in progress on a couple of new albums.

548
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,580
And those might only be released electronically.

549
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,020
Anyway, what I'm talking about is...

550
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,760
Thanks to Pisces and Suds,

551
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,580
seven of the subgenius CD albums are on Bandcamp now.

552
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,440
And I can't...

553
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,620
Do prices or anything.

554
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,900
Because of the nature of this station.

555
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,480
And the other stations.

556
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,140
Which, by the way, include WORT in Madison.

557
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,660
WREK in Atlanta.

558
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,700
WHUS in Storrs, Connecticut.

559
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,240
WEFT.

560
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,660
Beautiful WEFT in Champaign, Illinois.

561
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,420
And Reverend Zarka's show.

562
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,620
And also in Storrs, Connecticut.

563
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,680
But I can't remember the call letters.

564
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,300
Aww.

565
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,940
All of that information.

566
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,820
In fact,

567
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,500
everything I'm about to say is on subgenius.com.

568
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,740
There we go.

569
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,720
And miraculously...

570
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,820
You can tell that's Dave.

571
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,480
You can hear old lonesome cowboy Dave's guitar.

572
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,600
Yes.

573
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,560
Fingering there.

574
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,760
Distinctively, yes.

575
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,660
So, yeah.

576
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,120
Right.

577
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,560
There's a lot of wonderful songs.

578
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,720
Like, for instance, Dave's song Iodine 131.

579
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,860
It's on one of those seven albums.

580
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,040
I'm not sure which one.

581
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,220
Even a girl's album, you might say.

582
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,960
A Squid for Connie.

583
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,100
But as with most of the Connie stuff,

584
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,480
that's probably the worst of the batch.

585
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,260
A Squid for Connie.

586
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,840
I thought that was like 10 billion squids for Connie.

587
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,520
No, that's a song on that album.

588
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,240
It's 83D Squids.

589
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:16,660
Oh, oh, oh.

590
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,400
That you...

591
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,200
Done by you and Dave and Chaz Smith.

592
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:20,720
Yeah.

593
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,060
83D Squids.

594
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,580
On this radio station, live in the studio,

595
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,940
there's several ESO or Einstein's...

596
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,000
Secret Orchestra songs that were first played

597
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,820
right here at this board.

598
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,520
Yes.

599
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,660
Only before the equipment was moved to this building.

600
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,600
But anyway, friends.

601
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,680
So, yeah.

602
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,120
If you look at subgenius.com

603
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,020
by spelling the word subgenius correctly,

604
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,960
you'll find the link in the big paragraph on the front page.

605
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,720
Also, if you haven't looked at the subgenius website

606
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,580
in a long time,

607
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,880
you may be...

608
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,120
You may be surprised by a certain little detail.

609
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,540
J.R. Bob Dobbs is gaining in power these days.

610
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,540
Also, what else was I going to mention?

611
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,260
Oh, there are all kinds of things happening.

612
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:14,840
Well, there are...

613
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,400
I was gonna...

614
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,260
I'm about to do a bulk emailing about all of this stuff,

615
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:24,180
including a reminder about the best subgenius Facebook pages.

616
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,220
Slack Hole 2.1

617
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,820
and the unofficial...

618
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,460
The unofficial Church of the Subgenius page

619
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,980
are probably the funniest ones.

620
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,160
But there's like a film...

621
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,900
Subgenius Film Society page,

622
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,320
a special Hour of Slack page,

623
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,100
and so forth.

624
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,880
All of that stuff can be found at subgenius.com.

625
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:50,500
And that and about 50,000 to 100,000 pages

626
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,820
of articles and pictures and rants and forums

627
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,740
and all that kind of stuff.

628
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,860
But our other...

629
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,460
Our other important news

630
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,480
is that we have some devivals coming up.

631
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,860
Yes, devivals.

632
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,620
Including WCSB-centric things.

633
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,860
The soonest one is...

634
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,520
This is not just a subgenius devival,

635
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,720
but we will be performing there,

636
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,040
or rather I should say I will be hollering

637
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,980
at whoever shows up at 7 o'clock

638
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,600
at the Witch's Ball,

639
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,260
the Northeast Ohio Witch's Ball,

640
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,820
which happens near Cleveland

641
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:34,180
on October 18th, Saturday.

642
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,200
If you Google Neo Witch's Ball,

643
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,080
as in Northeast Ohio Witch's Ball,

644
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
you'll find that.com,

645
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,040
neowitchesball.com.

646
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,640
Or you can look at subgenius.com events,

647
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,320
because all of this stuff is on there too.

648
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,220
And you can read all about it there.

649
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,240
The Witch's Ball is a masquerade ball

650
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,780
with people wearing crazy masks,

651
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:04,360
and it's a subset of a kind of a fantasy comics,

652
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,380
gaming, and new agey con

653
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,480
called Con on the Cob.

654
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,760
And it's held at Hudson Clarion Inn

655
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,280
in Hudson, Ohio,

656
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,340
which is about 45 minutes away

657
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,940
from most of us listening now.

658
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,960
It's also right near the ledges part

659
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,280
of Cuyahoga Valley National Park,

660
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,680
which is the coolest part of that park.

661
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,200
Mm-hmm.

662
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,120
And we always go there in the morning.

663
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,900
Then we go to the show and the party.

664
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,440
Then we sleep out there,

665
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,760
and then we come back to the ledges,

666
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,200
because the ledges are such a great place to hike.

667
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,920
So beautiful.

668
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,600
Anyway, we in Princess,

669
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,600
we and I will be there,

670
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,680
is what I mean.

671
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,840
They're showing Arise,

672
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,060
the subgenius movie,

673
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,200
at four o'clock.

674
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:56,660
Oh, my.

675
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,840
And then at seven o'clock,

676
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,440
I come on and preach,

677
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,800
and then about 8.30 or so,

678
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,880
our friend Michael Murth,

679
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,080
the magician,

680
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,880
will be doing his feats of telepatheticness.

681
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,960
Now, meanwhile,

682
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,760
I need to see if this is Dave.

683
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,000
It is, by the way.

684
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:15,560
Okay, good.

685
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,120
I'm sorry I'm calling so late,

686
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,340
but I had numerous problems.

687
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,600
I'm not feeling that well.

688
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,320
Oh, Dave.

689
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

690
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,640
I'm flying to Boonday.

691
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,820
Well, yeah, actually, we do.

692
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,540
We do.

693
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,800
I think we should have a prayer session right here and now.

694
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,380
I really do.

695
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,360
We've got at least ten people listening,

696
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:40,220
and I think everybody should bow their heads

697
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:45,640
and hold their breath for not at all.

698
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,800
And strongly concentrate their energies toward

699
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,840
Northeastern Ohio.

700
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,360
Heal Dave by acubating him with your thoughts.

701
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,360
Yeah.

702
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,760
Dave.

703
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,160
Could you please do it in about,

704
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,140
like, right now?

705
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,500
Okay, I'm trying.

706
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,100
I'm going to do it.

707
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,820
Oh, wait a minute.

708
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,040
I think I broke something.

709
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,560
Now we have to pray for both.

710
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,460
Oh, it helped Dave.

711
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,960
It worked.

712
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,620
No, it didn't.

713
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,620
Well, that's just wonderful.

714
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,780
Well, we're not going to talk about doctrinaire stuff, are we?

715
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,540
Because I'm feeling really radical tonight.

716
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,060
I was.

717
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,680
I was bragging up shows that we're going to be at

718
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,280
on October 18th,

719
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,960
the Witches Masquerade Ball in Hudson, Ohio.

720
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,180
Oh, and the WCSB Halloween Masquerade Ball.

721
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,240
Now, see, Dave, you should come to that

722
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,440
because you could be there free and rock out with us.

723
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,040
Oh, and it's so much fun.

724
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,120
The WCSB Halloween Masquerade Ball is November 1st.

725
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,720
That's a Saturday after Halloween

726
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,520
at Cleveland Public Theater.

727
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,040
And there's four bands, including all bands,

728
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:05,000
Dinosaurs, The Gizmos X, Sticky Fingers X, and another one.

729
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:06,580
Counterintuits.

730
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,820
Yeah, Counterintuits.

731
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,420
And we'll be showing...

732
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,480
Well, there's more than one, right?

733
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:17,680
I mean, more than one of the bands.

734
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,660
Not the bands, per se, but I mean, what's that guy's name?

735
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,440
Conduit?

736
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,640
There's more than one ball.

737
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,460
There are at least two balls.

738
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,020
There's the Halloween Masquerade.

739
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,600
There's the Halloween Masquerade Ball on November 1st,

740
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,240
and there's the Witches Masquerade Ball on October 18th.

741
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,800
That's two healthy balls right there.

742
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,600
Right, right.

743
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:42,900
And then there's one that's not a ball on December 6th.

744
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,860
And, Dave, if you could make it to this, it would be great

745
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,500
because we need preachers and singers and musicians.

746
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,520
In Kent, Ohio, at the Stone Tavern on December 6th,

747
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,800
we will join...

748
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:02,300
bands such as Milnar and probably the Amino Acids

749
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,080
or something like them, as heard in the background here.

750
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,440
Well, maybe that's not a good example.

751
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,680
It sounded more like Thomas the Train or the Tootie Whistle

752
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,080
and the Big Ten, whatever.

753
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,620
Actually, Dave, that's you.

754
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,060
And Reverend Angry Larry jamming at 9X Day.

755
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,680
Oh, I thought it sounded like the train conductor.

756
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,380
Somebody's blowing a whistle or something.

757
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,840
Maybe, that too.

758
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,380
There's some of that in there.

759
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,920
There's enough foreground for everybody.

760
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,500
The two Daves jam.

761
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:39,260
So, yeah, we're trying to talk you into showing up at the Kent Devival

762
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,740
and the Halloween one.

763
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,360
Yeah.

764
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:48,500
Well, it sounds wonderful to me, especially the Kent one.

765
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,460
Now, that is if you're not sick, Dave.

766
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,960
I mean, physically sick.

767
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,860
I'm sick every day and my car's always well.

768
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:58,540
Every day.

769
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,780
I'm sick every day and my car is always...

770
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,340
Now, I'm confused.

771
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,520
You changed the rules already.

772
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,680
I didn't even know we had any to start with.

773
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,400
There's nothing like standards of forbearance and practices,

774
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,960
regulations as per...

775
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:19,240
I don't know how any of that works, obviously.

776
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:24,060
I think anyone listening can tell that we don't know how any of that works.

777
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,840
Well, we sure can make sky rockets.

778
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:28,820
We can make sky rockets.

779
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:28,900
You know?

780
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:29,700
Yeah.

781
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,660
We can get people thinking about things they don't normally think about.

782
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,040
But, Dave, you said you were feeling radical.

783
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,960
What's got you feeling radical, man?

784
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,180
Well, I don't know if my sickness is connected with my mental illness

785
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:44,780
or my...

786
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,340
It just seems like this planet is kind of sick, too.

787
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:51,520
You know what I mean?

788
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,260
Life is just Ebola cherries.

789
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,720
No.

790
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,620
Oh, man.

791
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,440
Did you really just say that?

792
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:00,920
No.

793
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:01,780
Somebody else said that.

794
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,500
I ripped him off.

795
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,480
I saw it on Facebook.

796
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,680
I'm just doing what everybody does on Facebook,

797
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,420
ripping everybody else off and not giving them credit.

798
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,220
Yeah, that's what you should...

799
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,100
That's what you've got to...

800
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,560
Those are words to live by.

801
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,380
Lift, rip off, give no credit.

802
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,920
Lift, lift, lift.

803
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,080
Wait, that's six words.

804
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,760
It's supposed to be a three-word intro.

805
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,340
But...

806
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,060
Lift...

807
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:27,720
We can't...

808
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,020
You ever...

809
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,360
We can't worry all the time.

810
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,460
We can take OxyContin like the Mormons do.

811
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,840
I just read an article...

812
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,700
I read an article in the news today about how

813
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,700
they're having a terrible painkiller,

814
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:45,420
prescription painkiller and heroin problem in Utah.

815
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,260
Oh.

816
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:50,060
Well, they have it in Ohio, in small counties.

817
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:50,680
Well, of course.

818
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,980
Well, it's funnier in Utah because the Mormons are perfect.

819
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,400
Yeah.

820
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,000
And they don't do drugs.

821
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,620
They don't...

822
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,880
A lot of them don't even do coffee.

823
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:06,060
But, you know, if the doctor tells you to take Vicodin or whatever once every...

824
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:11,740
You know, three times a day, you eventually start taking it nine times a day.

825
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:15,740
And the next thing you know, you're over at the pharmacy going,

826
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,800
my dog ate my last prescription.

827
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,320
I know I just picked it up yesterday, but I need another one.

828
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,740
I know that because my sister worked in a small Texas town pharmacy

829
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,980
and heard that one on a radio.

830
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,520
And she said, well, you know, I'm not going to take it.

831
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:29,520


832
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:29,540


833
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,980
Yes, it's heard everywhere on a weekly basis.

834
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,620
That's the wellspring of addiction is these darn doctors

835
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:40,500
who are just so full of pus and vinegar,

836
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,500
they don't even have their own side swipes together to, you know,

837
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,700
reprimand the great...

838
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,840
Yeah, I need a new doctor because my doctor just, when I go,

839
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,300
oh, I'm really pained.

840
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,900
Oh, I fall asleep all the time.

841
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,420
Oh, I'm too nervous.

842
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,300
She just goes, you just need more exercise and eat right.

843
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:57,640
Yeah.

844
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,200
Eve, that's not the kind of doctor I want.

845
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,800
I want the kind of doctor who goes, take 10 of these every day for the first day

846
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,060
and then take 20 of them the second day and then take 40 of them the third day

847
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:10,460
and then come back for more and pay me more.

848
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:15,340
Well, that's certainly a bone of contention is the state of our health system

849
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:21,580
because many of the doctors get Alzheimer's and other things that start with A

850
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,300
and stuff like that and ancillaries.

851
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,240
Did I say ancillaries?

852
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,640
They get a lot of ancillaries for prescribing these things.

853
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:36,700
And they're verboten and they're bad for people, what they do is.

854
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,520
Mm-hmm.

855
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,420
See how I tagged those words on the end just to make it disgusting?

856
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,160
Well...

857
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,820
They are bad for people is what they are.

858
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,260
Well, no, I don't know.

859
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,940
It's medicine, you know, makes you feel good.

860
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,300
People want freedom from pain.

861
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:57,760
Yeah.

862
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:57,960
Yeah.

863
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:57,960


864
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:57,960


865
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:57,960


866
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:57,960


867
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:57,960


868
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:57,960


869
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:57,960


870
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:57,960


871
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:57,960


872
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:57,960


873
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:57,960


874
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,580
They're not going to let their cancer cease from anxiety.

875
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,060
And they can find that in a simple little pill.

876
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:09,280
And there wouldn't be any problem with that except that eventually they run out of pills.

877
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:09,680
Yes.

878
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,340
And then they start robbing their family members and neighbors

879
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:18,040
so that they can get more of them kind pills for their body.

880
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,720
Spending a lot of time in the bathroom when they come over your house

881
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,120
going through the medicine cabinet.

882
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,960
Hey, what are you doing in there?

883
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,900
I left my cross-dress and socks in there, you know?

884
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,100
Well, man...

885
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:37,080
I hate to think how you know about looking through other people's medicine cabinets,

886
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,340
but I have to admit that there was a time when I was a young hipster

887
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,840
when I would do that sort of thing.

888
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,920
I learned my lesson.

889
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,820
I learned my lesson.

890
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,080
I had my throat removed so I couldn't swallow pills anymore.

891
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,400
So that's how I broke the habit.

892
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,180
But, you know, I mean, come on.

893
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:56,900
I know we're all...

894
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:57,820
You and me were just...

895
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:58,020
I was jealous.

896
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,460
I mean, I know as well as I know

897
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,440
that we both would love to have one of them pills right now.

898
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:13,080
But we're 160 years old or older and, you know,

899
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,640
the ones who didn't learn their lesson, they're all dead.

900
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,440
Don't you have a lot of dead friends, Dave?

901
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,080
Yeah, we all got a lot of dead friends.

902
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:24,500
Yeah.

903
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,600
And they're the most fun to hang out with

904
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,800
because they don't talk much.

905
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,560
Back to you, you know, they don't give you any snuff.

906
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,820
They just sit there and, well, whatever they're doing.

907
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,500
One thing your dead friends never say to you is,

908
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,440
man, if you don't quit drinking,

909
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,140
I'm afraid you're going to be dead in a couple of years.

910
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,140
They'll never say things like that

911
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,260
because they kept drinking.

912
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,520
When you told them that, they didn't listen.

913
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,380
So they're dead.

914
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,580
Oh, well.

915
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,680
This is a funny comedy show tonight, isn't it?

916
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,540
Boy, it's just a barrel of laughs.

917
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:57,580
There's been an awful lot of heroin overdoses.

918
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,900
It's in the five-county area.

919
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,820
There are 219 people died last night.

920
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,880
And back to you, Gina.

921
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:08,280
Well, those aren't exaggerated numbers necessarily either.

922
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,240
No, I was just somewhat on the...

923
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,120
There's not quite 200 a night, but it's certainly 200 a month.

924
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,080
And it's 2,000 a year.

925
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,400
And it usually starts...

926
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,140
It's often people who would never, ever consider smoking pot

927
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,780
or even drinking too much.

928
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,300
But the doctor said,

929
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:28,860
you know,

930
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,600
that rash that hurts so much,

931
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,260
they give you that pill.

932
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,940
And that pill doesn't really even do...

933
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:39,620
It doesn't really...

934
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,120
It kind of makes you sick at first.

935
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,640
Yeah, they make you learn your lesion, so to speak.

936
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,660
The number of little rips you've got on your torso

937
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:53,560
indicates the number of the 10-pack or the escadrille

938
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,880
of pills you may ensconce

939
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,320
as a member of the...

940
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:57,800
of the...

941
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:57,800


942
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:57,800


943
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:57,800


944
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:57,800


945
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:57,800


946
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:57,800


947
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:57,800


948
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:57,800


949
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,140
of the subterranean parties.

950
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,960
It's one of them.

951
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,480
Dave, you do sound kind of sick.

952
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,980
Your voice sounds kind of rough.

953
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,660
You sound almost like Pigman.

954
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,760
Well, it's not that kind of roughness.

955
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,060
I've been gargling with gravel like Archimedes did.

956
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:18,080
Remember when Archimedes wanted to be the best speaker

957
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,100
in all of Athens?

958
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,460
I heard about that party, but I missed it.

959
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,980
Gargling with gargle could be really dangerous.

960
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,940
Gargling with gargles?

961
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,940
And the Athens cops are not into...

962
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,100
Now, gargling with garlic?

963
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,780
That would be much better.

964
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,880
Yeah, where do those funny hats come from, too?

965
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,940
I mean, those people must think they can fly or something

966
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,300
with those weird, like, four-corner hats and stuff.

967
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,620
That's why I'm proud of being American.

968
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,740
Because it's the biggest liar state in the world,

969
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:50,100
the biggest mass of corrupt, evil people running the show,

970
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:54,620
and still, and still, I believe in America.

971
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:54,940


972
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,760
You hate...

973
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,840
You hate our freedoms, and yet you still believe in America?

974
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,900
I'm confused now.

975
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:01,400
I didn't say I hated any freedoms.

976
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,100
You just said it was the worst country in the whole world.

977
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,400
Or something.

978
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,940
No, it's up there, though.

979
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:08,780
Believe me.

980
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,260
It depends on who you are.

981
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,060
You know, I mean, if you're a rich American,

982
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,360
it's the greatest country in the whole world.

983
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,340
If you're a...

984
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:19,960
Some...

985
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,960
I don't know.

986
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,680
One of our victims, or...

987
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,740
I should put it this way.

988
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:26,480
If you're...

989
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,940
In one of the countries we're trying to help.

990
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,980
If you're one of the countries we're trying to help,

991
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,380
then, yeah, it might be like the Death Star.

992
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,160
Yeah, and that's what Nurse Ratched always said.

993
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,140
What's wrong with these patients around here?

994
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,600
You know what I mean?

995
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,940
Yeah, they act crazy.

996
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,020
Yeah, they're acting crazy and stuff like that.

997
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,340
They don't understand that you must be crazy

998
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,680
to think this is not a worker's utopia.

999
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,860
Because, I mean, just think of it, man.

1000
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,740
We've tried so hard to create a worker's paradise

1001
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,460
where everybody gets a little piece of the pie

1002
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:04,400
plus a little Alamode on top whenever they want.

1003
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,540
That was a long time ago, man.

1004
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,440
Yeah.

1005
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:14,840
I just read several people in the Yahoo comments today

1006
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,060
were saying that Obabo, the preseserp,

1007
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,880
was basically responsible for Ebola

1008
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,240
because God is angry.

1009
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:25,540
Oh, come on.

1010
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,440
You know, he made...

1011
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:26,920
He made God...

1012
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,700
Obabo, the preseserp of Uninu,

1013
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,500
made God angry,

1014
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:35,040
and that's why God is killing Africans.

1015
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,380
Is there nothing...

1016
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:39,720
And then Obabo is going to bring the Africans here

1017
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,900
to kill all of us.

1018
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:46,960
It's a complicated and kind of circular logic

1019
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,320
that I keep reading my fellow Americans spouting about

1020
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,280
when they get on the Internet anonymously

1021
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,420
in that category.

1022
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,160
It's just cowardly fashion they have

1023
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:02,020
of expressing opinions about everything

1024
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,480
they don't know a damn thing about.

1025
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,580
I know.

1026
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,420
That's the most striking thing about it

1027
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,640
is the ignorance of all these people.

1028
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,020
But it's actually more entertaining than the news itself.

1029
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,320
That's the first thing.

1030
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:16,040
I read the headline, then I read the comments.

1031
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,920
Then I go back and read the article.

1032
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,240
I know.

1033
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:19,680
I know.

1034
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,060
It's hard to not want to do that

1035
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,640
because it does tickle your innards

1036
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,420
when you see how retarded these people are.

1037
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:31,000
I read a news story today that was funny instead of depressing.

1038
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:47,540
They are growing penises in labs and are ready to start testing, attaching those to men who have damaged or ambiguous genitalia.

1039
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,720
And I thought, man, this is the best news.

1040
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:55,020
This is the best news in the world for the one penis.

1041
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:04,220
As a spokesman for the ambiguous genitalia party, I'd like everyone and each and every one of us to vote this coming election.

1042
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:12,120
And remember that the penis that you grow now will live on as long as you water it every day.

1043
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,340
Thank you. Thank you.

1044
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:24,080
Well, it brings to mind this comedic imagined scene of a factory with rows and rows of penises in little jars.

1045
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:30,080
Or, I don't know, hanging off hooks or something, being watered or grown or fertilized.

1046
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:39,520
The thing is, though, that it has to be grown from your own penile cells or it won't take. It won't attach.

1047
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,320
Now, what if they tried to grow one with clitoral cells?

1048
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:48,100
That would, I don't, for some reason, I didn't read that article.

1049
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:48,700
That would be the fun part.

1050
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:49,640
Doggone it.

1051
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:54,060
But apparently there's a lot of little boys who are born with clitoral cells.

1052
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,400
Kind of questionable package.

1053
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:05,040
And what they usually do is just do a sex change operation right then and there on the infant.

1054
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:11,720
My dad, the lawyer, has actually had to represent some of the victims of this kind of thing.

1055
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:15,380
So he'll be glad to know that they can finally get a penis.

1056
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:20,560
The rest of us can get, well, the rest of y'all, I should say, can get your multiple penile.

1057
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,960
But you know what, Dave? The show is over.

1058
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:24,900
The show is over.

1059
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:32,320
I'm not even going to have time to play an end song on the other copies.

1060
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:36,780
I have to say, this is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1061
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:40,800
For more information, well, we already told you about subgenius.com.

1062
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:45,960
Well, I'm sorry, so fleshy, because I wanted to become, anyway, never mind.

1063
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,960
We'll save the penises for you, Dave.

1064
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,500
But I'm going to have to, we're going to have to turn everything off because the show's over.

1065
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:54,680
Well, but...

1066
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,240
Oh, wow.

1067
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,700
Just like everything else.

1068
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,760
It's Dr. Sinister.

1069
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:07,200
It sounds like you're, it sounds, however, like your illness has been healed by the ten listeners you've prayed.

1070
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,220
I'm still hurting, but I don't hurt.

1071
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,120
You know what I mean?

1072
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:15,080
It's still like, ouch, but it's not like, oh, man, when's this going to end?

1073
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:23,440
I'd just like to thank everybody out there who looked at their imaginary penis or whatever they were supposed to be doing for the last half an hour.

1074
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:29,820
And just thought good thoughts and put them my way and I'll pay back someday.

1075
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,500
Really, I swear, I really will.

1076
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,860
Maybe Tuesday or something like that.

1077
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,200
Not this week, but a couple...

1078
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,940
Tuesday week or Tuesday couple weeks.

1079
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,440
Tuesday couple weeks from now.

1080
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,240
Yeah.

1081
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,380
From, from, yeah.

1082
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,020
Yeah.

1083
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,400
What Dave said.

1084
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:48,500
Oh!

1085
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:48,880
Oh!

1086
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:54,180
Oh!
