00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,660
communication section Washington low alert on Sierra case standby low alert

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,580
vital information coming through standby

3
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,820
actually Steve Rogers got kicked off the air for saying

4
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:35,900
but I think it was listeners that are not letting him say on the air

5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,160
that's gonna be a whole bunch of

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,500
meep meep meep meep meep

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,860
that'll be the good part when you hear the meep meeps

8
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,580
oh

9
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,620
oh

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,780
beat me to a pulp and I'm

11
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,860
praying for some

12
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,700
pain

13
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,760
I ain't got religion

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,960
I got a damaged brain

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,320
and if I had a dollar

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,400
for every looking that I took

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,000
I'd

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,280
buy the pulpit back again

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,960
and write a dirty book

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,440
oh

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,620
beat me to a pulp

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,460
and I'm praying for some pain

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,220
beat me to a pulp

24
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,060
and I'm praying for some pain

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,700
oh

26
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,740
I ain't got realmente

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,380
a damagedinder

28
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,120
I ain't got really

29
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,520
a Howling

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:33,760
vícon

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:33,760

00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:33,840

34
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,780
that one

summer

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,120
winter

37
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,780
summer

38
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:42,780


39
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:56,340
we'll about

40
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,160
��

41
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,840
and we did a show by phone, just like in the good old days of 2020.

42
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,280
Also, all of the songs in this show are by Dave,

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,260
performed with Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

44
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,680
with Dave singing and playing guitar in all cases.

45
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,380
This show is recorded August 9th.

46
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,880
Is Lonesome Cowboy Dave still alive?

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,000
I wonder.

48
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,340
Let's call him and find out.

49
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,500
I hope.

50
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,820
Hello?

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,880
Dave!

52
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,420
Well, I called.

53
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,120
You said you beat me to it.

54
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,440
That's right, I beat you to the pulpit.

55
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,460
Beat you to the pulpit.

56
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,580
You're praying for some pain.

57
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,260
After you went insane.

58
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,240
Well, should I start drilling in the microphone right now?

59
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,700
Yeah, that's part of your messed up brain.

60
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,400
I beat you to a pulpit after you go insane.

61
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,680
It's not your dirty mouth.

62
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,140
It's not your orals.

63
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,500
It's just your messed up brain.

64
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,720
See, that's it.

65
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,320
I made up a Dave type song.

66
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,040
Well, that's delicious.

67
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,040
It's like the little slices that they have at the Hungarian store of sliced up cow brains

68
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,860
or lamb brains, I guess.

69
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,620
Real thin.

70
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,220
It's almost like sushi and you can wear it as a hat.

71
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,020
Well, Dave Brains.

72
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,240
That's what I was going for.

73
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,200
Dave Brains.

74
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,460
Well, that's different.

75
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,860
You can't wear a hat to that.

76
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,880
The hat is already provided.

77
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,200
But, damn that's weird.

78
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,300
Well, what made you go insane you did?

79
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,400
in a different color and fashion.

80
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,500
Some people say it's too ludicrous to be held.

81
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,520
Well, how's your hat, Dave?

82
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,340
Well, I got some rain in the soup.

83
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,480
I had to take the potatoes out.

84
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,020
It was mashed up pretty good in there.

85
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,740
I froze up some cinnamon stick and gave it to my grandmother.

86
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,260
She showed me how to do the rest of it,

87
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,320
so I guess I could say it's all right.

88
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,860
Cool, man, cool.

89
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,880
I mean, it's cool sometimes.

90
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,440
It's hot here. It's so hot.

91
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,880
I don't want to go anywhere near the doorway or the airlock.

92
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,780
Yeah, it's 90-something here,

93
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,580
but it's 90-something humidity, too.

94
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,880
It's just making people just pass out like birds on a telephone wire.

95
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,580
Yep, yep.

96
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,520
That's why I'm in here calling Lonesome Cowboy Dave on the phone.

97
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,220
Well, you have actual...

98
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,980
It's a sedentary breakfast, don't you?

99
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,060
I mean, air conditioning.

100
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,700
Yeah.

101
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,140
Yeah, our airlock is still functional.

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,820
That's good.

103
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,280
Yeah, I had to repair it a lot with snot and scotch tape and stuff.

104
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,520
They normally work pretty good.

105
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,600
Scott and snot tapes.

106
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,460
But, yeah, yeah.

107
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,460
I'm sorry, I was just going to say,

108
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,960
I was wondering if Princess We Are Doe had her gums removed or something.

109
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,660
She said she had a hard time finding things

110
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,860
because they put some articles in there that something, I don't know.

111
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,700
Yeah, she did.

112
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,400
She had her gums removed today.

113
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:16,500
In fact, she's still not home yet from the dental mental hospital.

114
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:17,780
Ah.

115
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,760
Yeah, she had gum all over her hair

116
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,120
and, you know,

117
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,060
just stuck in every little crevice.

118
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,480
And so she had to go get her gums removed.

119
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,660
But they did it with lasers.

120
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,920
They do it with lasers now.

121
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,120
They don't have to surgically peel it all,

122
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,820
scrape it off with scalpels

123
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,720
and peel your skin off and everything.

124
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,080
They just, they shoot a laser at you.

125
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,140
It still peels your skin off,

126
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,740
but they don't have to use a knife.

127
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,720
It's easier for them.

128
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,940
It doesn't make it easier for the patient.

129
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,120
Oh, no, of course not.

130
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,080
But it's easier for the insurance company

131
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,940
and the...

132
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,760
you know, the nurses and stuff.

133
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,420
I noticed when you go,

134
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,980
when you go in the dentist's office,

135
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,300
everybody has to wear a face mask

136
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,580
except you,

137
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,820
the patient,

138
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,880
or me, the patient.

139
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,980
And it's not fair

140
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,860
because there's all these pretty dental assistant ladies

141
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,480
that you want to be able to recognize them

142
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,640
in the supermarket later.

143
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,780
But you won't

144
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,080
because they have masks on,

145
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,700
but they can recognize me.

146
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,400
Except that when I go to the supermarket,

147
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,080
I still wear a mask.

148
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,480
Even now.

149
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,660
Even today,

150
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,200
and with the Lambda Delta Beta virus going around,

151
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
I still wear the mask.

152
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,720
Yeah, I thought that was a fraternity

153
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,080
when I first heard about it.

154
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:51,560
I mainly do it just to tick off the others.

155
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,200
I'll refrain from using the term

156
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,480
ignorant rednecks.

157
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:57,820
Yeah.

158
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,900
Don't do that because...

159
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,200
Well, do do that because

160
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,300
it'll make it much easier later

161
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,680
to recognize the bodies when they're

162
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,220
trying to, you know,

163
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,540
get the motorcycles going again.

164
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,580
Yeah, I know.

165
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,020
But I...

166
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,020
I don't think many of these women

167
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,820
who have to wear a mask

168
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,940
wouldn't want you to see them drooling

169
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,740
in their pants or their

170
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,120
hard pickle or their, you know,

171
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,960
suitable escapes of whatever kind they had.

172
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,940
Well, you know,

173
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,260
I hadn't really thought about that.

174
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,000
I guess that just like those pretty ladies,

175
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,060
I could drool all I wanted behind my mask

176
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,560
and nobody would be the wiser or the wetter.

177
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,800
Yeah.

178
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,960
I retrograded mine.

179
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,860
I put, like, a bunch of fur on it.

180
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,780
Pasted some fur on there.

181
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,080
It's like a portable beard and mask.

182
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,900
It works both ways.

183
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,900
That's what I...

184
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,200
Because I've been feeling kind of...

185
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,360
Funny, you know, I have this goatee

186
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,760
and the mask doesn't quite cover it.

187
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,740
And I figured, well, the germs are crawling in

188
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,940
through the hairs underneath the mask.

189
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,500
And if I glued more hair onto the inside of the mask,

190
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,780
that would form a sort of a baleen type of barrier.

191
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,720
Yeah, and then you would know...

192
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,520
Keep the bad germs out,

193
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,280
but I could still eat the good germs.

194
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,120
Yeah.

195
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,400
That I live on, the phytoplankton,

196
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,060
if there's any left after this heat wave

197
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,320
in the ocean.

198
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,100
So you think he's going to...

199
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,380
Until the phytoplankton in the oceans

200
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,200
is going to be so bad?

201
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:26,440
Oh, they've already...

202
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,620
They've announced that they've already done the funerals.

203
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,780
Billions and billions of tiny funerals

204
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,880
have already been enacted

205
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,060
because all the microbes in the ocean are...

206
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,500
They died yesterday,

207
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:45,280
and now the slightly larger krill are hungry.

208
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,040
And then the fish and whales are going to get hungry.

209
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,220
And then pretty soon,

210
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,780
the fishermen are going to get hungry.

211
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,400
And then the landlubbers

212
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,640
will have to spend a lot more

213
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,120
for a can of tuna fish with dolphin in it.

214
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:01,980
Yeah.

215
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,780
And, you know, I'm glad that we're both so old that...

216
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,740
Well, actually, you know, the funny thing is,

217
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,140
I thought that I was going to die before the planet did,

218
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,540
but now I'm not so sure.

219
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,740
It's...

220
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,040
Yep.

221
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,120
The snowball's kind of rolling through hell all over again.

222
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,960
It's melting fast.

223
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,260
Yeah.

224
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,520
I was wondering when the calling hours are going to be.

225
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,300
Or if anybody's going to call them anyway.

226
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,580
Well, the Lord's going to call us all home.

227
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,480
To call them B.

228
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,560
I just want to...

229
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,520
I was hoping to avoid seeing the whole rest of the ecosystem

230
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,840
get called home at the same time.

231
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,160
Yeah, that's going to be another very pretty sight, I'm afraid.

232
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,200
Right.

233
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,500
I was thinking, well, too bad about my grandsons

234
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,940
and possibly my children.

235
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,120
But now I'm starting to...

236
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:53,440
Damn.

237
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,400
I'm probably going to live to see that stuff.

238
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,620
Darn it.

239
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,740
What they're probably going to do is a retrofusion

240
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,200
on the last 500 years.

241
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,500
And you know they're going to charge double for tickets.

242
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,740
Oh, amazing.

243
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,120
Yeah, to watch yourself die.

244
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,280
Because that's the way them are.

245
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,400
That's they for you.

246
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,680
Thame.

247
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,680
Thame.

248
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,680
Hate Thame.

249
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,060
Yep.

250
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,080
But it doesn't do you any good to hate.

251
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,900
It doesn't do you any good at all.

252
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,600
But it's a tasty word still that you can use

253
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,720
in many elaborate situations.

254
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,600
Like if you want to impress the congressman,

255
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,180
get some money to clean up the phytoplankton.

256
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,680
You can't just...

257
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,720
You can't just...

258
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,760
Whatever I just said.

259
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,660
Right.

260
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,900
Whatever you said, you can't do that anymore.

261
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:41,620
No.

262
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,340
It's verboten.

263
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,540
Yep.

264
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,820
Oh, boy.

265
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,300
Actually, the funny thing is,

266
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,200
where I am in North Texas,

267
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,360
well, we're under a heat advisory,

268
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,460
but that's normal here for this time of year.

269
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,500
It's everybody else in the country

270
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,340
that's getting the really, really strange,

271
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,040
bizarre Texas weather.

272
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,040
Well, they were saying you can see the stuff in the sky

273
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,340
from the wildfires and stuff

274
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,900
as far east as New Jersey.

275
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,420
And I thought that was silly

276
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,500
until I looked out and asked,

277
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,340
the skies look all hazy.

278
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,080
Oh, yeah.

279
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,420
And I asked somebody if that's it.

280
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,820
And they said, that's it.

281
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,040
Yeah.

282
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:30,560
Yeah.

283
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,420
When I look at the hills,

284
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,080
they're very, very hazy now,

285
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,200
kind of orangey.

286
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,100
The sunsets are pretty,

287
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,600
and my lungs are infected

288
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,880
with the toxins from the burning appliances

289
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,280
and homes of the Californians.

290
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,260
Yeah.

291
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,580
I mean, I've really noticed my...

292
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,160
I get...

293
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,280
I get bad enough allergies

294
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,020
living in this cedar forest,

295
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,200
but now it's pollen plus burning plastic

296
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,280
in minute quantities,

297
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,780
but it doesn't take much.

298
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,600
Hell no.

299
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,800
You know, to make you snot and sneeze

300
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,120
and hock up loogies, lungers, and bungers.

301
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,280
Yeah.

302
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,380
Or not be able to and fiercely want to.

303
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,120
Right.

304
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,020
Yeah.

305
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:18,800
Yeah.

306
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,060
It's a sad thing,

307
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,140
but I suppose it's...

308
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,440
Sadder things happening all at once,

309
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,140
so we shouldn't have to worry about it too much.

310
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,940
Just get under the old pillow

311
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,780
and pull down the bed

312
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,260
and just repartee

313
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,000
like there was nothing going on.

314
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,620
You know?

315
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,920
That's actually a good idea.

316
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,480
As soon as we hang up,

317
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,580
I'm going to go do that.

318
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,100
I'm going to go to bed,

319
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,440
pull the covers up over my head,

320
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,900
shrivel up,

321
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,220
and cower and tremble.

322
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,640
Yeah.

323
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,900
Until I go to...

324
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,520
Until you go to bed.

325
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:54,800
I know.

326
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:54,800


327
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:54,800


328
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,560
I like the trembling part, you know?

329
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,620
Well, it's as close to sex

330
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,620
as I ever get anymore at my age,

331
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,300
I'll tell you.

332
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,840
Well...

333
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,260
Yeah.

334
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,840
You know, I mean...

335
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,040
It's good.

336
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,900
But hey, hey,

337
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,820
trembling beats nothing.

338
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,560
It's good for making milkshakes.

339
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,060
You just put the milk and the chocolate

340
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,920
and the ice cream in there

341
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,180
and just shake away.

342
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:16,960
Yep.

343
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,420
And within a few hundred hours or more,

344
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,600
you've got a beautiful, delightful milkshake.

345
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,020
Right, you can use your fear to save on electric bills.

346
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,820
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

347
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,760
Or your palsy, you know, fear, palsy, whatever.

348
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,120
All those things that make old people quiver uncontrollably and spew.

349
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,380
I think it's because their underpants are too tight.

350
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,740
You know, the people in these lounges, what do you call them, lounges?

351
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,800
You know, where people are kept in solitude until they get older and die?

352
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:03,020
Well, those nurses that come around and so dutifully pull down the underpants and replace them,

353
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,740
they don't do such a good job all the time, especially when they're paid off, you know what I mean?

354
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:16,000
Well, yes, sometimes the man pays them off to humiliate the old elders and old people, helpless.

355
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,340
At least the old woman just, yeah.

356
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,480
At least the old woman just said it for a pleasure.

357
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,440
Speaking of old women, the old woman just came home.

358
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,520
Are you making a show of these?

359
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,960
Yeah, I'm making a show.

360
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,160
Now, see, here comes that box of...

362
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,960
Oh, and I have to make a pit stop before I can.

363
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,440
Remember, I've just been on the road for a while. I'll be back.

364
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,080
She has to make a pit stop because of her pits.

365
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:48,300
Well, you know, you live close enough to California, you're bound to get some pits once in a while.

366
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:48,920
Yeah.

367
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,360
Fort Pitt. Remember Fort Pitt? They named Pittsburgh after that.

368
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,160
Oh, I didn't know that.

369
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:56,820
Yeah.

370
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,520
Pittsburgh is kind of like American for Pittsburgh, isn't it?

371
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,680
I don't know. I didn't see an H on the end of it. I saw a couple of X's.

372
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,040
So I got confused and I asked the witch doctor.

373
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,020
Don't ask which one.

374
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,020
I asked the witch doctor.

375
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,000
At the police station, he told me everything was off until next year.

376
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,820
I said, man, I'm just trying to find an etymology of some snakes, some animals.

377
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,600
And, you know, where does the word Pittsburgh come from?

378
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,680
Because Detroit, we know, was formerly under French rule until the American Indian...

379
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,060
What's it called? Wars.

380
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,420
French and Indian wars.

381
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,140
The French Indians probably pronounced it Detroit.

382
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,140
Yeah, Detroit.

383
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,480
Because they don't use the T. They just waste it.

384
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,900
Yeah, it's just wasted.

385
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,040
And Fort Pitt, that used to be... What was the name of that place?

386
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,440
Oh, Duquesne, which was also a bottled beer in the 1940s.

387
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,180
Hey, speaking of French Indians, I heard that in Cleveland,

388
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,820
they changed the name of the baseball team to Guardians of the Galaxy or something like that.

389
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,520
Yeah, isn't that ridiculous?

390
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,280
They're not called the Redskins or whatever they were.

391
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,780
They're the Braves, the Powwows.

392
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,700
And the local Native American organization said,

393
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,640
you know, we've been doing this for a year, but there's no negative onus with it.

394
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,280
Why don't you just call yourself the tribe?

395
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,800
Because we go along with that, too, and we even play drums at halftime.

396
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,860
Instead, you come up with some ridiculous, you know, game-sounding name,

397
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,100
or maybe it sounds like a European soccer team, you know.

398
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:58,060
Yeah, but if you call yourself the tribe, then the other tribe's going to go,

399
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,120
no, no, we're the tribe, so we're going to have to kill you.

400
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,160
Because everything's tribalism now, you know.

401
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,620
Yeah.

402
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,100
If you don't have the right totem pole in front of your house,

403
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,940
the other tribe will probably want to set your house on fire.

404
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,400
Except they won't need to, because it'll already be on fire from the climate change.

405
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,320
And the spare change, and small change.

406
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,280
I heard that it actually got into the triple digits,

407
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,880
1-0-something.

408
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,400
It was even higher than 1-0-something.

409
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,720
It might have been like 1-10 or something.

410
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,140
In British Columbia.

411
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:40,160
Actually, Dave, the oceans just off the coast of western Canada are dead zones now.

412
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,920
Yeah, it got real hot.

413
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,760
They're not used to seeing asphalt melt.

414
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,140
You know.

415
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,440
And they don't even know what air conditioners are up there.

416
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,320
Yeah.

417
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,340
So basically, everybody's already dead.

418
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,640
You might as well just, anybody you knew up there in the northwest, U.S. or Canada,

419
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,600
they're probably burned up by now.

420
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,380
Have you spoken to anyone before they died?

421
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,720
Did they what?

422
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,900
Have you spoken to any of the western Canadians and Oregonians and Washingtonians before they died?

423
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,160
Well, I'm not sure.

424
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:33,120
But at least they'll die clean because the water from the glaciers will be washing over them pretty soon.

425
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,200
There won't be any glaciers left, but there'll be plenty of water for a little while

426
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,700
flooding down from where the glaciers were about 10 seconds ago.

427
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,180
Yeah, I was wondering if that became gigantic tuna casserole, you know.

428
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,020
Yeah.

429
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,600
Of all those.

430
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,740
Well, it's funny.

431
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,040
It's happening even faster than doomsayers like me thought it would.

432
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:07,380
And I remember when this movie came out about 20 years ago called The Day After Tomorrow, I think that was it.

433
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,800
Yeah, something like that.

434
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,180
Climate Change Horror Movie.

435
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,140
And at the time, I thought, oh, this is ridiculous.

436
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,800
Look at this.

437
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,180
Suddenly, there's glaciers in New York and it only took five minutes.

438
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,320
Yeah.

439
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,460
Yeah.

440
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:18,460


441
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:18,460


442
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:18,460


443
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:18,460


444
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:18,460


445
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:18,460


446
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:18,460


447
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:26,240
And then it turns out that's exactly what I think I just just before I came downstairs here, I was glancing at the news.

448
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,340
And I think that that was what was going on.

449
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:36,100
The air froze in Manhattan and was creeping down, you know, freezing up in New Jersey.

450
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:48,280
And meanwhile, the the water was evaporating on in the West so fast that people were just shriveled up desiccated potato chips.

451
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,840
One minute they're fat and happy at McDonald's.

452
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,760
The next minute the heat wave hits and they're just crisp, crisp, crisp.

453
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,540
You know, like, you know.

454
00:19:59,560 --> 00:19:59,900
Yeah.

455
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,420
And see, we're kind of in the middle in between the coast.

456
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,840
So it hadn't hit us yet or whatever is going to hit us and hit.

457
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:15,260
Well, that will be the dynamic thrash point between between you and the other sides of the continent.

458
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,860
That will be what causes the explosion.

459
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:25,080
And eventually your suborganic demise, not yours personally, but, you know, millions of people in that area.

460
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,660
Oh, well, I'd probably I'd probably be in that number, too.

461
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:40,920
I mean, I'm a person and I do have an airlock, but, you know, they only they're only good up to a temperature of about one hundred and eighty degrees Fahrenheit.

462
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,600
That should be a lot of fun.

463
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,360
Yeah.

464
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:46,540
Yeah.

465
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,040
One hundred and eighty plus.

466
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,880
I think I think it's about one hundred and fifty out there today.

467
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,560
The last time I looked.

468
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,520
But we're going to have we were going to have a cool spell next week where it would get down to the hundred and thirties.

469
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,980
Oh, geez.

470
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,560
Yeah.

471
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,260
Real funny.

472
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,100
Real funny.

473
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,040
Yeah.

474
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,120
So funny.

475
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,920
I forgot to laugh.

476
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,540
I remembered to.

477
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,340
I remembered to.

478
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:16,340


479
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,080
I remembered to laugh.

480
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,760
I.

481
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:30,100
You said Chernobyl was so long ago, nothing to worry about.

482
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:40,120
And I hear the news is John Geisinger Department of Energy, the Defense Department to start build a budget Chernobyl across the United States.

483
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,100
Now you're in the news.

484
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,720
It's not really over.

485
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:43,960
No.

486
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,900
All these people are dying.

487
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,460
It's all the pollution, it's getting into the water, it's getting into the aquifers

488
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,640
Everything goes, it's all one, it's all one

489
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,720
It's the distance between Kiev and Cleveland, no man, we're getting in tune

490
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,280
You'll make hearing

491
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,560
You know, then I started thinking

492
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,660
How come my movements are getting so...

493
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,520
...janky?

494
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,900
The iodine, a one three one

495
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,220
Has got my thyroid on the run

496
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,380
And the krypton, a eighty five

497
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,520
Is making it hard just to stay alive

498
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,960
But the iodine, a one three one

499
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,020
The iodine, a one three one

500
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,700
No more runnin' through the metal man's

501
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,260
No more boyhood in the mud

502
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,500
Power, power, power

503
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,000
Power's in the power's hands

504
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,720
Shake the bony hand, shake it good

505
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,140
The barium, a two four eight

506
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,360
This baby's sterile, I can't procreate

507
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,680
And plutonium, a two oh seven

508
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,980
So long folks, I'll see you in heaven

509
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,220
But the iodine, a one three one

510
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,780
The iodine

511
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,400
The iodine, a one three one

512
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,840
No more runnin' through the metal man's

513
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,500
No more barefoot in the mud

514
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,200
Shake the bony hand of the poison man

515
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,260
Shake the bony hand, shake it good

516
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,480
Inoculate, inoculate, inoculate, inoculate, inoculate

517
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,440
Salt is over two million known pollutants

518
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,400
That can cause cancer, pancreatitis, and I do see that

519
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,500
Bad breathing, you know that?

520
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,400
Bad breath, acne, what's the use?

521
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,720
The iodine, a one three one

522
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,080
Has got my thyroid on the run

523
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,180
And the krypton, a eighty five

524
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,320
He's makin' it hard just to stay alive

525
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,920
But the iodine, a one three one

526
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,200
The iodine, a one three one

527
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,300
No more runnin' through the metal man's

528
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,100
No more barefoot in the mud

529
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,780
Shake the bony hand of the poison man

530
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,680
Shake the bony hand, shake it good

531
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,560
No more runnin' through the metal man's

532
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,200
No more barefoot in the mud

533
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Shake the bony hand of the poison man

534
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,020
Shake the bony hand, shake it good

535
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,760
Shake it

536
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,440
Shake it

537
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,380
Shake it.

538
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,440
Shake it.

539
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,940
I'm in love with you.

540
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,420
I'm in love with you.

541
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,500
Wow.

542
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,960
That's so exciting sometimes.

543
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,560
Yeah.

544
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:51,580
And.

545
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,880
Well, it can be frustrating, I'm sure,

546
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,180
especially when you're talking about albuming

547
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,060
and tricks automation,

548
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,400
automation, different, you know,

549
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,600
things that happen when the world is melting.

550
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,560
But now that we're talking about serious things,

551
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,700
like we just went to the bathroom,

552
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,180
what's the matter with your teeth and your gums,

553
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,320
you know, stuff like that,

554
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,440
then we don't have any problems

555
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,280
except for when we see the guy

556
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,200
who committed the crime in person.

557
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,620
Well, I'll be able to hear this on the recording later.

558
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,620
I'll be able to hear everything everyone says later

559
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,040
when there's just me in the room.

560
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,360
The headphones.

561
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,760
So your deafness has a time shift on it?

562
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,420
No, it has a sort of a space shift.

563
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,760
If there's another headphone in the room,

564
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,520
my headphone loses half of its hearing.

565
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,400
It's cheap equipment is what it is, Dave.

566
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,280
It's cheap equipment.

567
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,680
Yeah, I've had people,

568
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,040
I've had erstwhile beginner podcast people

569
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,020
go, Stang, tell me what kind of equipment

570
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,040
you're using for your wonderful sound on your show.

571
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,080
And it's like, well, this is a 30-year-old,

572
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,400
$20 Radio Shack mixer,

573
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:22,600
three old microphones with rotten foam windscreens on them,

574
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,060
chewed up by wind and cats,

575
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,640
and a cassette deck,

576
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,860
an iPhone 6,

577
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,740
that has to be kept charging all the time,

578
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,720
and a, yeah, and a match, a little box of matches.

579
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,620
That's our studio.

580
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,100
That's Tarzan's radio station.

581
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:52,020
Oh, and the preamp is a boom box, a $50 boom box.

582
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,960
That's the most modern thing we have on this table.

583
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,700
There's actually a four-track TX recorder

584
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,240
right in front of me,

585
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,800
but it's just there for show.

586
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,900
It's just there because it looks cool.

587
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,140
It doesn't really work at all.

588
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,900
It's got spiders.

589
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,840
It's got a spider farm inside of it.

590
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,380
Yeah, it's got cobwebs everywhere.

591
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,740
It just makes it look like this is a real sound studio

592
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,460
and not just a table with a bunch of junk on it.

593
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,860
Like I said, it's for a fact.

594
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,260
What it really is is a table

595
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,820
with a bunch of really dusty old junk on it.

596
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,720
I mean, really, really dusty.

597
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,020
So dusty that there are also,

598
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,120
I mean, there are dinosaur footprints

599
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,160
within my eyesight view here.

600
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,460
Seriously.

601
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,840
There are.

602
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,560
That's true.

603
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,900
That can be considered kind of a good thing,

604
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,900
especially when you get in, you know,

605
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,900
some kind of protectionist racket

606
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,960
and you have to hide out there.

607
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,160
You pretend like it's 1987.

608
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,580
What?

609
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,480
Wait a minute.

610
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,420
Wait a minute.

611
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,780
What year is this?

612
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,140
1987 that I'm talking about.

613
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,400
Oh.

614
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,760
Oh, what a relief.

615
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,180
God, I thought for a minute there I just, you know,

616
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,820
had a stroke or something.

617
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,240
I kind of forgot the last 50 and a half years.

618
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,640
Right.

619
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,220
You had a stroke of bad luck.

620
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:12,840
That's for sure.

621
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,360
Well.

622
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,820
Especially when you were young.

623
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,880
Oh, no, no.

624
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,480
Everything was easy when I was young.

625
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,380
Somebody else wiped my butt for me and everything.

626
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,060
Pretty soon that'll probably happen again.

627
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,320
Not less.

628
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,040
Yeah, that's what I miss about, you know,

629
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,740
being young.

630
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,240
Is it not having somebody wipe my butt?

631
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,220
And everybody's saying, well, don't worry,

632
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,360
you're going to be having your butt wiped pretty soon.

633
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,120
Yeah, it won't be that much longer

634
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,880
before somebody's wiping your butt again,

635
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,780
if you're lucky.

636
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:43,940
Yeah.

637
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,520
At least they won't be using spoons now,

638
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,380
you know, plastic spoons anymore, I think.

639
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,460
Oh, those are...

640
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,060
We're doing there for a while in the late 1980s.

641
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,780
Oh, I hate those.

642
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,840
So wiping your butt with a plastic spoon.

643
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,660
I hate that.

644
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:55,980
Ew!

645
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,740
Yeah, can you just see, like, you know,

646
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,800
Ronald Reagan walking around with a bunch of,

647
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,300
you know, plastic spoons hanging out over his...

648
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,340
Unfortunately, I have actually seen that.

649
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,080
I went to a party once in Hollywood

650
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,280
just before he was elected governor.

651
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,960
And I saw him in that condition at the party.

652
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,300
But I was just a little kid.

653
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,440
I was only about 18 or so when Ronald Reagan was 25.

654
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,080
Did you get his screen legend?

655
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,760
I got his autograph.

656
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,880
Yeah.

657
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,080
But unfortunately, it was written with one of those spoons.

658
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,960
So it's...

659
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,260
Ew!

660
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,200
Yeah, it got...

661
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,960
In the end, the flies ate it.

662
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,780
Some of the vowels are hard to read.

663
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,600
It would have been valuable someday,

664
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,940
but I didn't keep it because it smelled funny.

665
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,140
Yeah, it reminds me of basketball or something.

666
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,600
Somehow.

667
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,400
I don't know.

668
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,440
I just don't know.

669
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,260
I just don't know.

670
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,960
I don't know.

671
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,760
I simply don't know.

672
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,360
I simply don't know.

673
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,080
I simply...

674
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,600
I just don't know.

675
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,540
I simply don't know.

676
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,760
Nate Crooks, I'll pass.

Professors at a White House tea

They're talking opportunity

He's talking opportunity

685
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,120
Like there's enough for folks like you and me

686
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,280
Meanwhile the world is tumbling down

687
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,940
Down in a pile of shit

688
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,080
There's more revolution

Saying, should I turn on the evidence

Or be a good old stumble

The president's on the phone

699

Or maybe just by half of time

It's a democratic country where they don't have votes

703

And business is not an offshore boat

704
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,640
And business is growing and there's no surprise

Well, Dave, I'm sure the listeners will be amazed and surprised to hear that you're still alive.

718
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:44,820
I know that they're amazed every week that I remain alive.

719
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:51,480
But nobody's heard you on the show except in hail and hearty reruns.

So welcome back, Dave.

Yes, welcome back, Dave.

I'm feeling welcome and useless, actually.

726
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:14,580
I have a fictitious idea of what's going on in the world right now.

727
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,140
But you count your blessings, dude.

728
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,020
You don't want to know what's really going on.

729
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,440
Reverend Stang tells me pretty much every day that he's really glad that I don't read the news

730
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,160
because it's just so...

731
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:26,840
So bad.

732
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,880
Yeah.

733
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,320
Especially environmental news.

734
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,540
Good old Washington Post last night.

735
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,020
Most people don't read any of that anyway.

736
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,580
I looked at...

737
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,780
Today, I thought...

738
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,000
I was looking at the regular, you know, the fake news headlines.

739
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,340
CNN, you know, BBC, that kind of thing.

740
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:53,660
And the main headline was, world is ending.

741
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,200
I mean, that was the first thing.

742
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,340
Because there was a big conference that they released this compiled data

743
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,780
that was worse news than even the eggheads expected.

744
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,900
Then I thought, I wonder what Breitbart.com is saying about this.

745
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,520
Nothing.

746
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,640
Nothing at all.

747
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,880
It wasn't even mentioned.

748
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,680
It was all about movie stars that refuse to wipe their own butts

749
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,860
because they're Hollywood elites.

750
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,400
And the...

751
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:21,920
Oh, what was it?

752
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,960
The sex rapist and the...

753
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,020
The whisperer.

754
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,720
That's Cuomo and Biden.

755
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,320
Ah.

756
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,700
The sniffer.

757
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,580
No, the sniffer.

758
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,800
Yeah, the whisperer.

759
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,680
And he sniffs.

760
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,840
And that was why the world is ending,

761
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,960
because of Biden's sniffing and whiffing and whispering.

762
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,620
Ah.

763
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,720
And Cuomo's attempted gropes.

764
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,620
Apparently, he never really got anywhere.

765
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,300
All he did was grope and harass,

766
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:51,980
but he...

767
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,100
Nobody has actually said that he did anything.

768
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,540
But put his hand on their butt.

769
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,940
Which, that used to be standard operating procedure

770
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:05,040
for every 1950s male boss.

771
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,680
Absolutely.

772
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,240
Yeah.

773
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:10,640
I mean, if your boss didn't chase you around the desk like in a sitcom,

774
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,340
you felt like you weren't doing your job.

775
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,340
Those were the days.

776
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,260
You were missing something.

777
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:16,620
Yeah.

778
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,920
Nowadays, all you have to do is whisper or sniff,

779
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,560
and the right-wingers will come after you.

780
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,100
Now, you can grab them by the country,

781
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,180
but...

782
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,180
But that...

783
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,080
And that's okay,

784
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,880
because it's one of them doing it, see?

785
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,320
Yeah.

786
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,460
But if a sniffer or a whiffer even sniffs or whiffs,

787
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,100
much less grabs them by the country,

788
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:47,280
like the Russians and the North Koreans did to our country,

789
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,580
they grabbed it by the country.

790
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,160
I'm sorry.

791
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:54,820
I...

792
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,640
I...

793
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:55,920
I...

794
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,140
I...

795
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,180
I...

796
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,380
I...

797
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:56,740
I...

798
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:56,740


799
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:56,740


800
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:56,740


801
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:56,740


802
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:56,740


803
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,440
Do you think I speak of country matters?

804
00:36:59,300 --> 00:36:59,740
Yes.

805
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,500
That's Shakespeare.

806
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,020
That's from him.

807
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,940
Seems like selective countries.

808
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,240
Country matters.

809
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,860
Country matters.

810
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,460
It's a rude, crude joke.

811
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,100
Country.

812
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,300
Country, yeah.

813
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,600
And you even hear him making these sexist remarks,

814
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,520
like she was a good sex otherwise,

815
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,900
and then they go,

816
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,020
and look at each other in an annoying way,

817
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,060
and then they go,

818
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,260
and look at each other in an unknowing way,

819
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,140
and they go,

820
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,620
and then,

821
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,720
and make it look like they're not quite sure.

822
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,140
And then they say it again.

823
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,660
They say sexitary, and then they all laugh uproariously.

824
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:32,780
Sexitary?

825
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:33,960
Yeah.

826
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,720
And a real good cocksuckertary to read my morning mail.

827
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,340
Well, see, there's one I can't use.

828
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,740
You did not just say that.

829
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,360
Yes, I did.

830
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,880
I quoted Dolomite in a Rudy Ray Moore imitation voice,

831
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,740
and I have to cut that out of the show

832
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:55,380
because if you're not woke, you're asleep,

833
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:58,780
but if you're woker than thou, that's even worse.

834
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,120
So they got you coming and going.

835
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,360
Oops, I said coming.

836
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,860
And you know what going means?

837
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,140
That's like number two.

838
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,160
Yeah, that's bad.

839
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,140
Knock, knock, knock at your back door.

840
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:10,540
Stinky.

841
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,780
Yeah, bad.

842
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,640
It's a bummer.

843
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,720
Well, that's, we have to.

844
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,700
That's probably wrong.

845
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:18,780
Murr.

846
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,400
I missed that.

847
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,800
It's a bummer.

848
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,620
It's a bummer.

849
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,260
Murr.

850
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,120
It's a what now?

851
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,860
A bummer.

852
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,780
Yeah, Monty Hall, let's find out what's behind door number two.

853
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,700
There's another door there.

854
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,940
I'm actually quoting the Trailer Park Boys Greasy Money phone app game,

855
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,720
which I'm addicted to.

856
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,700
Deeply addicted to.

857
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,660
Oops, I said addicted.

858
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,400
That's got an unwoke word in it.

859
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,400
I'm addicted.

860
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,380
Richard did too.

861
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,680
This game.

862
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,620
The Trailer Park Boys.

863
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,440
How do they get away with anything?

864
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:00,740
Canada.

865
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,380
Oh, that's right.

866
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:02,820
It's Canada.

867
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,860
They're from Canada.

868
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,060
They're from Canada.

869
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,100
They can do anything they want.

870
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,380
The FCC.

871
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,540
Those poor creatures, they have no freedoms like we in America.

872
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,060
Right.

873
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,600
So they can say anything they want on TV or radio.

874
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,180
They do.

875
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,160
Actually, Steve Rogers got kicked off the air for saying cocksucker, but I think it

876
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,540
was the goddamn listeners that are the cocksuckers for not letting him say cocksucker on the air.

877
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:28,940
That's true.

878
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,220
That's going to be fun.

879
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,180
That's going to be a whole bunch of meep, meep, meep, meep, meep.

880
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,520
That'll be the good part when you hear the meep, meep.

881
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,200
Yeah.

882
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,080
Well, that's what the Cleveland and radio broadcast audiences hear.

883
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:48,100
The internet audiences only hear that if it's funnier to put the beeps in than the curse words.

884
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,360
At least the curse words are in cursive now.

885
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,300
They're encouraging the children to learn backwards.

886
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,000
No, but see, that's okay.

887
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:04,440
If you say them in cursive, people under 30 or so can't hear it.

888
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,180
They can't.

889
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,740
They never learned cursive.

890
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,060
They can't.

891
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:15,240
To them, like the former president, the Declaration of Independence appears to be in a foreign language.

892
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,540
What language is this?

893
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:17,960
What language is this?

894
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,740
Because they don't know how.

895
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,440
They actually ask that question.

896
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,460
Because he can't read English cursive.

897
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,840
We can't read big words.

898
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:32,060
They typed it out for him and hand him the handwritten calligraphy of the Declaration of Independence.

899
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,380
But, you know, they sell at gun shows and stuff.

900
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,060
They sell copies of it, right?

901
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,260
Yes.

902
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,960
Replicas of the Declaration of Independence.

903
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,160
And kids have to ask what it is.

904
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:46,600
It's like...

905
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,120
They can't even read the title of it.

906
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,520
They can't read a clock either.

907
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,460
A regular clock.

908
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,500
They can only read digital readout numbers.

909
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,800
A circular clock with, you know...

910
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,400
With hands?

911
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,180
Yeah, with hands.

912
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,380
Yeah, that means nothing to them.

913
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,160
They don't...

914
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:11,780
They didn't sit at five minutes till three every weekday staring at that round thing,

915
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,140
waiting for that hand to hit the top.

916
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,720
You know?

917
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,980
When you could leave school.

918
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:17,920
To get out of school.

919
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,400
Right.

920
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,960
That means nothing to them.

921
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:25,200
They look at their phone, which has a countdown, and tells them when they can leave.

922
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,960
And also sex pictures of the kids all sitting around them.

923
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:36,940
Because that's all they do in school now is unzip their pants, take sex-ties or whatever of their privates,

924
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,520
and then text them to each other.

925
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,500
No, seriously.

926
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,460
I heard that on Fox News.

927
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,280
That's all they teach in school.

928
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,740
We left.

929
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,800
And Marxism.

930
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,200
That and Marxism.

931
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,960
And that's all there is in schools now.

932
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,640
Oh, I see.

933
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,460
You need to...

934
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,360
There's a microphone.

935
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,680
That's all there is in school now is just...

936
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:52,780
Yeah.

937
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,760
You know, you, Philo, and Susie have a lot in common, Princess Wee.

938
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,900
No memory whatsoever.

939
00:41:59,340 --> 00:41:59,820
None.

940
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,980
Complete blank.

941
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,660
You can remember there's a microphone there for, what, about ten seconds?

942
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,040
But then your back gets tired of leaning.

943
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,080
Actually, Hal does that, too, to some extent.

944
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:14,320
You know?

945
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:20,640
Although usually he leans forward until his lips and nose touch the windscreen on the mic,

946
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,600
and then he falls asleep.

947
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,620
I thought he was just turning blue.

948
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:25,660
That's it.

949
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,540
It actually has happened.

950
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,780
But that's because Hal's shows are usually on at four in the morning.

951
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,600
I've seen Hal fall asleep on the mic.

952
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:32,960
Yeah.

953
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,020
I've seen him fall asleep while he was awake.

954
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,700
Or awoken.

955
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:39,700
Awoken.

956
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,200
Awoken berries.

957
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:41,740
Yeah.

958
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:41,980
Yeah.

959
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,320
There's a lot.

960
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,300
What's up with all the new vocabularies?

961
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,940
I remember when I first started doing some stuff, they'd say contact or whatever, and

962
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:57,840
now they say everybody has to reach out to somebody, and then if you're aware of something,

963
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,500
you're woke, and then otherwise you're gaslighting.

964
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,400
What does gaslighting really mean?

965
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,840
I'm wondering.

966
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,760
Is that fitting?

967
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:10,480
It basically means lying, more or less.

968
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,700
It's based on a movie called Gaslighting.

969
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:14,520
Gaslighting.

970
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:14,720
Yes.

971
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:21,100
Where this woman thinks she's losing her mind because she keeps thinking she turned off

972
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:26,820
that gaslight, but then it's on again, and her husband berates her and tells her she's

973
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:31,840
losing her mind, but he's the one secretly turning the light on and off to make her believe

974
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,500
she's crazy so she'll go crazy so he can get all the money.

975
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,380
That's gaslighting.

976
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:38,780
Yeah.

977
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:44,300
I don't think most people who use that term have any idea whatsoever where it came from.

978
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,660
Because it's a movie from the 30s.

979
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:47,080
Yeah.

980
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:47,700
Yeah.

981
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,500
And I have not ever seen it.

982
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,500
I really want to see it someday.

983
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:51,860
Really?

984
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:51,980
Yeah.

985
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:52,560
Goodness.

986
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,000
That's what I was just going to ask you.

987
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,580
It was from the 1930s.

988
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,080
Yes.

989
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,220
The predictive decade before DeFiro walked the earth.

990
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:05,360
It was a famous movie, but that was over 150,000 years ago.

991
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:12,440
These creatures were thought to be extinct, and yet here they are gaslighting.

992
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,220
Yeah.

993
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,300
They're stinking the place up.

994
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:14,420
Stinking.

995
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,860
And everything else that we thought had gone out of fashion.

996
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,480
But it's all back in fashion again.

997
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,140
Well, they're going faster than a speedboat and they're on their way to hell.

998
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,420
If you ask me, but nobody did.

999
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,420
No, they just motorboated me.

1000
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,620
Did you ever try and haul some bowling balls?

1001
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:41,840
I'm sorry.

1002
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,040
What was that, Dave?

1003
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:43,740
I am too.

1004
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,060
I'm sorry.

1005
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:46,620
Say it again, Dave.

1006
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:46,700
You're sad?

1007
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,640
Oh, I was just wondering if they were taking canoes and putting bowling balls in them to

1008
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,880
make sure everybody got to the right shores of the river.

1009
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,800
You know, because if you didn't, then...

1010
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,020
Dave, they quit doing that back in 2030.

1011
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,380
Which was 35 years ago.

1012
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:06,020
Yeah.

1013
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,060
Yeah.

1014
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:08,860
Yeah.

1015
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,800
They quit making bowling balls around 2035 entirely.

1016
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,120
Yeah.

1017
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,340
Because bowling was outlawed.

1018
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,220
You know, it wasn't...

1019
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:18,540
I don't know.

1020
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,520
There was something...

1021
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,520
The right-wingers hated it because of the racks.

1022
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,680
And the left-wingers hated it because of the balls.

1023
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:35,660
Yeah, but at least the left-wingers had enough little marks on their bodies so that it wouldn't

1024
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,300
pinch you there.

1025
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,660
Nobody cared about pins.

1026
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,440
The pins were fine.

1027
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,240
You can still get bowling pins, but you can't have balls.

1028
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,040
You can't have balls.

1029
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,880
Not anymore.

1030
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:46,600
Yeah.

1031
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,460
It's balls pretty much kind of been outlawed on all fronts.

1032
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,000
Both sides have outlawed balls.

1033
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,360
Wow.

1034
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,160
They don't like balls.

1035
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,420
I see.

1036
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,220
No, they're just taboo.

1037
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,560
They're becoming more and more taboo each day.

1038
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:04,080
I have balls, but don't tell the cops because they don't like balls.

1039
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:09,600
Well, I've been sitting on mine lately as I've become older, like closer to 105 years

1040
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:09,900
old.

1041
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,780
I've noticed now that it's very easy to sit on that.

1042
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,160
On your...

1043
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:14,940
On your...

1044
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,500
Troll area.

1045
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:16,740
Yeah.

1046
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:22,280
When I say balls, that's kind of a figure of speech in my personal case.

1047
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,820
Well, why wouldn't you call...

1048
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:24,940
Ball, ball.

1049
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,940
It's a singular is the way it...

1050
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,140
But let's not...

1051
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,100
Let's not go into that.

1052
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,220
Let's talk about something that blesses my heart.

1053
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:34,620
UFOs.

1054
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,860
They finally told the truth about UFOs.

1055
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:37,540
Which is what?

1056
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,400
They don't know anything about it.

1057
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,220
They don't know Jack Who-y.

1058
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,560
They finally admitted it.

1059
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:43,920
Yeah.

1060
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,000
Yeah.

1061
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,020
They finally admitted, yep.

1062
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:45,800
Yep.

1063
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:46,780
UFOs.

1064
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,320
We have no idea.

1065
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:49,900
Not a clue.

1066
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,760
If you do...

1067
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:50,940
Boy, wait.

1068
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:51,920
If you know, tell us.

1069
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,360
All that Roswell stuff, that was all big story.

1070
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,160
Well, no.

1071
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:55,880
We don't know.

1072
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:56,940
They don't know.

1073
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,020
They just don't know.

1074
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:58,640
They just don't know.

1075
00:46:58,740 --> 00:46:59,140
Roswell?

1076
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,680
Heck, who cares about that?

1077
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:01,240
That's...

1078
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:01,780
That's...

1079
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,780
So, haven't they been collecting information for the last 50 years?

1080
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,560
Well, they released the information.

1081
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,240
It's just that it doesn't say anything.

1082
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,160
Nobody knows.

1083
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:11,500
Yeah.

1084
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,440
It's like, well, yeah.

1085
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:12,780
That's what I'm afraid of.

1086
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,780
This thing buzzed.

1087
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:18,360
All these planes, all these things buzzed all these planes and did all these crazy things,

1088
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,160
but we don't know.

1089
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,620
Might be Nazis from the hollow earth.

1090
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,040
Might be aliens from out of space.

1091
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,240
There could be Nazis from the moon.

1092
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:33,360
Might be creatures of light that fly around and dart around in the sky, and they're just

1093
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,260
some species we never heard of before that's been here this whole time, and they just like

1094
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,180
to tease us.

1095
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,880
Or it might be John Galt and his rich people that...

1096
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,160
Yeah.

1097
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:49,100
Withdrew from the world 500 years ago to dedicate themselves to peace and science and slack,

1098
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,240
and now they're teasing all the rest of the suckers.

1099
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,000
Better hands.

1100
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:53,520
That's...

1101
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,320
Honestly, that's...

1102
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:03,080
To me, that's the most likely scenario for UFOs is secret geniuses that a long time ago

1103
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,620
went, this whole thing is screwy.

1104
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:11,860
Let's go find ourselves a nice hiding place in the hollow earth or somewhere that only

1105
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,760
brilliant geniuses like us...

1106
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:13,940
Yeah.

1107
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:21,120
...can learn how to live in, and we'll just become advanced, like Wakanda in Africa.

1108
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:26,280
That's a case of a secret civilization that's way more advanced than everybody else.

1109
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:26,720
Ah.

1110
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,380
And you don't expect it, because they're protected by holograms, and it just looks like remote

1111
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:32,940
jungle.

1112
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:38,940
Dave wouldn't know what I'm talking about, because he hasn't seen a movie in 45 years.

1113
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:39,700
Wakanda.

1114
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,420
Yes.

1115
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,480
That's where Black Panther comes from.

1116
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:43,760
Okay.

1117
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,500
You know, long live Wakanda.

1118
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,900
No, I never saw Black Panther.

1119
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:48,380
What?

1120
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,200
I heard it.

1121
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:49,700
I heard it.

1122
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:50,740
You've got to be kidding.

1123
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,040
No, I've told you a hundred times I never saw it.

1124
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,040
And you always think you have that same reaction.

1125
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:56,680
What?

1126
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,540
You didn't see Black Panther?

1127
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,500
That's great.

1128
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,620
No, I didn't see it.

1129
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,540
You ranted to me about it, and I really wanted to see it, but I never saw it.

1130
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,500
Maybe I should go rent it from the Red Box right away.

1131
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:13,500
Oh, by now, it's probably free on one of those pay-per-view channels.

1132
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:13,920
I've tried.

1133
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:14,260
For free.

1134
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:14,840
I've looked.

1135
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:15,580
If you pay.

1136
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,080
Oh, well.

1137
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:17,440
Free.

1138
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:18,360
Only $5.

1139
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,980
The Subgenius movie isn't on Amazon anymore, unless you bought it.

1140
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,880
You can watch it on Amazon if you bought it.

1141
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,680
But it's still on Fandango, I think, and Hulu, and Apple TV, and all the other ones that

1142
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,300
we don't have.

1143
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:40,460
It's a moot point, because I have my own bootleg copies that I can reproduce any time.

1144
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,680
And I have the official DVD.

1145
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,660
Well, I'm glad you can reproduce any time you want.

1146
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,980
But it makes it less...

1147
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,120
You know what?

1148
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:52,560
I bet Dave's never seen the Subgenius movie, J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

1149
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,600
I bet he hasn't.

1150
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,100
Well, he's not in it, so he wouldn't care.

1151
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,420
I tried, Dave.

1152
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:57,900
I tried.

1153
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,120
Remember I filmed you?

1154
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,800
She didn't use anything I filmed.

1155
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:06,880
I filmed G. Gordon Gordon, you, Gary Gabrogfren, and Anna Mall.

1156
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,640
And she didn't use any of that footage.

1157
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,080
I even went to Portugal to film G. Gordon Gordon.

1158
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:13,480
It was awful.

1159
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:13,480


1160
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:13,480


1161
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:13,480


1162
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:13,480


1163
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:13,480


1164
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:13,480


1165
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:13,480


1166
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:13,480


1167
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:13,480


1168
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,540
It was a horrible trip, too.

1169
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,960
She still didn't use the footage.

1170
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,120
She drank a lot of blush.

1171
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,940
She drank a lot of blush wine and smoked a lot of Tunisian arceece.

1172
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,200
No.

1173
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:24,520
No.

1174
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,960
I didn't even get to do that when I was in Portugal.

1175
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:34,340
The only fun thing I got to do was try goat in a fancy restaurant, and I didn't even like it.

1176
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:34,900
He didn't like it.

1177
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,080
No.

1178
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:40,060
Well, anyway, the Subgenius movie came out pretty good, even though you're not in it.

1179
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:40,580
It did.

1180
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,540
It's really good.

1181
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,540
It has me in it a lot.

1182
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,460
So it's really good.

1183
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:43,460


1184
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:43,460


1185
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:43,860
It's really good.

1186
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,700
They interviewed Princess Wee, and they didn't use her.

1187
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,060
No.

1188
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,560
Not a second of it.

1189
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:54,140
You can see her smiling at 7 a.m., the fake 7 a.m.

1190
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:59,360
It was actually 7 p.m., but the sun was in the same position.

1191
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,560
So I said, let's just do a fake 7 a.m. ceremony.

1192
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,640
We'll have more people that way.

1193
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,600
So we had almost like a dozen.

1194
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,560
Yeah, but you didn't want to have people all the time.

1195
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,540
People, yeah.

1196
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:12,120
People, sure.

1197
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,460
Stranger elements and people.

1198
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:13,760
People.

1199
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:14,460
Yeah.

1200
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,460
You want some, you know, nice fried figs, some people from outer space.

1201
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,140
That's right.

1202
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:20,540
Not people.

1203
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:27,020
We wanted people from outer space, but all we got was a small film crew.

1204
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:32,820
They did use some of the footage, but I bet they felt like, man, why did we all come out here for this?

1205
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,040
Yeah, you get paid in bars.

1206
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,840
They didn't use much from that.

1207
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,900
Anyway, Dave, we have to go because it's almost an hour.

1208
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:42,300
Okay, well.

1209
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,960
It's been a very pleasant hour, and I'm glad the world's not going to completely.

1210
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:49,980
Oh, it is.

1211
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:50,580
It is.

1212
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,220
It is.

1213
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:51,640
It is.

1214
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:51,940
I know.

1215
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:59,540
Yeah, by the time I get this recording upstairs to my computer, I probably won't even get a chance to copy it over.

1216
00:51:59,660 --> 00:51:59,780
Right.

1217
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,180
The sky will have fallen.

1218
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,360
Yeah, the sky will have fallen.

1219
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,660
30 seconds left to go.

1220
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,620
That's so sad to think of.

1221
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,680
Seven, six, five.

1222
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:13,380
Five.

1223
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:13,820
Four.

1224
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,200
Four.

1225
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:14,800
Three.

1226
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,220
Two.

1227
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:15,800
Two.

1228
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,320
One.

1229
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,880
And it's the day called X.

1230
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,620
Not really.

1231
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,360
Not really.

1232
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:23,820
Not really.

1233
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:33,280
Okay, well, I'm going to go back to my, well, I don't want to say what I was doing.

1234
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,640
I don't see why you wouldn't want to let everybody at least know that.

1235
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,120
No, I don't know what the kids call it nowadays.

1236
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,820
I don't know the vocabulary.

1237
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,280
As you were saying, they change the words for everything.

1238
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,280
It's hog fishing now.

1239
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,520
At least that's the rural term.

1240
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,500
Have you ever gone hog fishing?

1241
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:53,920
Hog fishing?

1242
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:55,300
Yeah.

1243
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,300
I never have been hog fishing.

1244
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,500
Is that a thing that girls do?

1245
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:04,400
When they're allowed, yeah, they do it better than guys.

1246
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,580
They don't like that idea.

1247
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,100
It goes against their sexist dichotomy.

1248
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,380
That's the way it is.

1249
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,620
Well, I guess I'll sign off now.

1250
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,480
The sky is turning purple again.

1251
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,120
I can see the little children outside my window all praying.

1252
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,320
Yeah, the pages of my script are curling up and catching on fire.

1253
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,440
I guess we better call it quits.

1254
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:39,340
The last hour of slack, number 1,843?

1255
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,400
43?

1256
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,740
Wow, 1843.

1257
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,820
Holy mackerel.

1258
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,780
That's a lot of radio shows.

1259
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,960
That's the envisionment of a super animal.

1260
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,120
I've actually been doing this show longer than Johnny Carson did his show

1261
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,980
or David Letterman did his show,

1262
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:03,300
but they did them every night, five days a week.

1263
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,540
We only did them once a week, but I'm just as tired as those guys.

1264
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,380
In fact, I'm about as tired as those guys.

1265
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,840
Tired as Johnny Carson now.

1266
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:17,820
Okay, man.

1267
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,160
Okay, man.

1268
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,060
Okay, man.

1269
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,920
It's fun to make a radio show with you, Dave.

1270
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:25,680
Yeah, it's good.

1271
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,360
I just noticed the battery went down, too.

1272
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,560
It's still working, but it wouldn't work for much longer.

1273
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,220
Boy, they go fast now.

1274
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,220
I know how it feels.

1275
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,560
I know exactly how that battery feels.

1276
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,380
Totally full one minute.

1277
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,660
Suddenly, it seems like no time at all goes by.

1278
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,180
There we go.

1279
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,420
Just like my old Wi-Fi.

1280
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:43,860
No energy.

1281
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,020
Yep, that's where I'm going right now.

1282
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,200
Okay.

1283
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,940
Swap batteries, Dave.

1284
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,060
See you on the flip-flop.

1285
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:55,280
Set the end.

1286
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:55,820
Dave?

1287
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,780
He actually hangs up.

1288
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,340
Even though he could fake it, you know.

1289
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,820
He actually hangs up.

1290
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,080
Ah, well.

1291
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,080
So might it be.

1292
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,360
Well, I guess I'll push the switch.

1293
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,020
I'll push the stop button.

1294
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,420
Stop.

1295
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:16,920
But go.

1296
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,220
Go and get Dave's book,

1297
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,140
The Novel Neighbor World,

1298
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,380
published by the Subgenius Foundation.

1299
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,480
Kindle version on Amazon

1300
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,020
and print version at subgenius.com

1301
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,300
or Amazon.

1302
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,400
But we make more money and I autograph it

1303
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,240
if you buy it from us.

1304
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,080
subgenius.com

1305
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,000
And finally, let's go to hear live versions

1306
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,160
of two of the songs we played earlier

1307
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,360
recorded at the Beachland Ballroom.

1308
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,360
in Cleveland as part of Subgenius Debunkers.

1309
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,960
There may be time coming soon

1310
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,440
when you will not need that dangly dingly

1311
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,160
or that thing.

1312
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,320
No!

1313
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,520
That pristine juicer you can hang from yourself.

1314
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,360
That slimy eye.

1315
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,060
It's not good for pie in the sky.

1316
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,820
Oh, I don't know.

1317
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:06,820
Hmm.

1318
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:10,820
Oh.

1319
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:11,260
Oh.

1320
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,120
Oh.

1321
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1322
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1323
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1324
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1325
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1326
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1327
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1328
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1329
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1330
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1331
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1332
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1333
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1334
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1335
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1336
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,360


1337
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,160
So long ago.

1338
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:13,560
Yeah.

1339
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:29,120
Well, they said Chernobyl was so long ago.

1340
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,540
There's nothing to worry about.

1341
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:35,020
Then I hear in the news a bunch of dumb guys

1342
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,960
in the Department of Energy and Defense Department

1343
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,040
going to start building a bunch of Chernobyls

1344
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,140
across the United States.

1345
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:41,940
Oh, my God.

1346
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,020
Yeah, then I hear Chernobyl's not really over.

1347
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,960
All these people are all dying with their 250-mile radius

1348
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,560
because all the underground aquifers are all polluted.

1349
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,540
So now we're getting it, too.

1350
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,320
And then I wonder, as I stare into the mirror,

1351
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,520
why my movements are getting so jerky.

1352
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,420
Jerky.

1353
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:00,760
Yeah.

1354
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,680
One, two, three, four.

1355
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,460
The iodine, the 1, 3, 1

1356
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,620
Has got my thyroid on the run

1357
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,640
And the krypton-885

1358
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,580
Is making it hard just to stay alive

1359
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,960
But the iodine, the 1, 3, 1

1360
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,060
The iodine, the 1, 3, 1

1361
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,940
There's no more running through the metal lanes

1362
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:31,660
No more barefoot in the mud

1363
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,960
Shake the bone in hand

1364
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,660
Of the poor man's heart

1365
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,000
Shake the bone in hand

1366
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,700
And shake it through

1367
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,540
The barium, the 2, 4, 8

1368
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,240
Has made me sterile

1369
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,640
I can't procreate

1370
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,760
And the plutonium, the 2, 4, 7

1371
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,260
So long, folks

1372
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,780
I see you in heaven

1373
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:59,860
But the iodine, the 1, 3, 1

1374
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:02,920
The iodine, the 1, 3, 1

1375
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,640
There's no more running through the metal lanes

1376
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,780
There's no more running through the metal lanes

1377
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,460
And no more barefoot in the mud

1378
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,960
Shake the bony hand of the poison man

1379
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,440
Shake the bony hand, shake it through

1380
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,180
Yeah.

1381
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:19,920
Yeah.

1382
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,520
Yeah.

1383
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:21,300
Yeah.

1384
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,060
Yeah.

1385
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,280
Oh, my God

1386
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:33,280


1387
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,100
Oh, my God

1388
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:34,620
the poison man

1389
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:34,620


1390
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:34,620


1391
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:58,820
So, if you're over 2 million known pollutants that can cause cancer, skin lesions, brain

1392
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:09,120
tumors, conjunctive lymphoma, Parsons disease, Hodgkin's lymphoma, chicken neck, acne, gingivitis,

1393
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,480
bad breath, what's the use?

1394
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:26,360
The iodine, the 1, 3, 1, has got my thyroid on the run, and the krypton, 85, is making

1395
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,140
it hard just to stay alive.

1396
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:37,000
But the iodine, 1, 3, 1, the iodine, 1, 3, 1, there's no more running through the metal

1397
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,060
lines, no more barefoot in the body.

1398
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:45,880
Power, power's in the power's hand, shake the pony hand and shake it.

1399
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:52,180
No more running through the metal lines, no more barefoot in the body.

1400
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:57,880
Shake the pony hand of the poison man, shake the pony hand and shake it.

1401
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:08,320
Oh, beat me to a pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.

1402
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:12,100
I ain't got religion, I got a damaged brain.

1403
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:18,660
If I had a dollar for every licking that I took, I'd buy the pulpit and Vatican and buy

1404
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:19,680
the dirty part.

1405
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,760
Oh, beat me to a pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.

1406
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:27,440
Beat me to a pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.

1407
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:28,800
Beat me to a pulpit.

1408
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,360
Oh, beat me to a pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.

1409
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,220
Beat me to a pulpit.

1410
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,160
Oh, beat me to a pulpit.

1411
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,360
Beat me to a pulpit.

1412
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,040
Oh, beat me to a pulpit.

1413
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:37,040


1414
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:37,040


1415
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:37,040


1416
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:37,040


1417
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:37,040


1418
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:44,160
Okay, friends, thank you, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, who also did this instrumental in the

1419
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:44,560
background.

1420
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:49,220
That was the end of the broadcast version of this show.

1421
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:56,380
The internet version, this one, has no time constraints, so I want to share with you something

1422
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,800
I removed from the rest of the show.

1423
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:06,620
While recording, we had a little technical difficulty for about four minutes.

1424
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:13,820
The kind of thing that a first-time car radio listener might not appreciate.

1425
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:18,220
It might even make them hit that dial.

1426
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:25,140
And yet, it's sort of funny in a sad kind of way, especially if your hearing is impaired

1427
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:28,200
and your gear is really old like you.

1428
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:28,780
Oh, yeah.

1429
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,940
And yet, you're still trying to be a sound engineer.

1430
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,100
But it's still funny.

1431
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,360
Princess, wait, do you need headphones?

1432
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:39,440
Oh, my gosh.

1433
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:42,680
Oh, everything's all un-headphoneded.

1434
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:43,780
Hold on.

1435
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,900
Here, I have to fund her.

1436
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,580
Should I do a switcheroo?

1437
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,400
No, no, I have to do it.

1438
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,060
No, I can't hear.

1439
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,000
Can I hear?

1440
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:55,820
What did I just do?

1441
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,600
Well, that's what, yeah, that's my headphone.

1442
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:58,780
I've put this on.

1443
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,240
I've got this in here.

1444
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,040
And then that, wait.

1445
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,440
Oh, that, that goes in that little hole, yeah.

1446
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,500
The one with the hair around it.

1447
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,060
There you go.

1448
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:07,700
There, see?

1449
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:08,460
I knew that.

1450
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,060
Can you hear it?

1451
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:10,700
Yes.

1452
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,980
I can't hear it nearly as well.

1453
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:18,180
Because when you put, when you split, hello, hello.

1454
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,940
When you split the little phone, it splits my mind.

1455
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,600
It splits the sound.

1456
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,220
You have to talk.

1457
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:28,500
The sound is split right down the middle.

1458
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:30,900
Okay.

1459
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:31,140
Here you go.

1460
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:31,940
Now talk some more.

1461
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:32,460
Okay.

1462
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,080
The sound is split down the middle when you split it.

1463
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,660
You have to split it.

1464
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,460
You don't think my microphone is on?

1465
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,880
No, I don't think your mic is on.

1466
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:45,220
It sounds like it's on to me and my ears.

1467
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,120
Okay.

1468
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:46,780
It is.

1469
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,120
Yeah.

1470
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,940
The bug, the bug is jumping when you talk.

1471
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,500
See, I can't hear.

1472
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,280
I made the bug jump.

1473
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,780
That sounds like a bug.

1474
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1475
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1476
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1477
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1478
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1479
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1480
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1481
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1482
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1483
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1484
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1485
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1486
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1487
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1488
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1489
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1490
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:58,780


1491
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,540
It's hard to be deaf and do a talk show.

1492
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:02,740
It is.

1493
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,300
It's fun though sometimes.

1494
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:07,180
But I'm doing it anyway.

1495
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:13,220
To boldly go where no deaf sound person has gone before.

1496
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,300
Dave, are you still there?

1497
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,660
Yeah, the grave is a difficulty.

1498
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,720
I can't hear Dave now.

1499
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:18,440
I hear Dave.

1500
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:19,080
You do?

1501
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:19,580
Uh-huh.

1502
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:20,700
What happened?

1503
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,940
Can you hear me?

1504
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,160
I can hear Dave.

1505
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:25,980
He said, can you hear me?

1506
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:26,780
Okay.

1507
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:28,660
This is so embarrassing.

1508
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,800
Can Stain not hear me now?

1509
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,100
Can you hear me?

1510
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:33,260
No.

1511
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:34,280
I can hear you.

1512
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:35,360
You can't hear Dave?

1513
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:35,760
No.

1514
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,640
Well, I'm on a television remote.

1515
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,540
This machine can't.

1516
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:42,600
My problem is in this connection here.

1517
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,180
I can hear Dave.

1518
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,860
And I can hear me.

1519
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,380
I can hear all you guys.

1520
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:53,660
All five of you.

1521
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,040
I can hear you muttering mumble.

1522
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,760
What I'm hearing is just the mumble.

1523
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,280
How about now?

1524
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:58,420
Say something again, Dave.

1525
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:02,220
Say something again about the terrible quality of food.

1526
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,240
I can't hear you.

1527
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:08,460
Well, that's just what it must be reckoned with.

1528
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:09,260
No, I can't.

1529
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:09,980
Okay, good.

1530
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:10,380
Okay.

1531
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:10,880
Hold on.

1532
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:11,360
You finally found the one.

1533
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,040
I'm not going to touch it.

1534
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,000
I'm just setting it down.

1535
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,200
I'm not touching it.

1536
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,940
You guys are equal hearing distance.

1537
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:18,560
Yes.

1538
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,620
You know why I can hear it now?

1539
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,080
No.

1540
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:25,800
Because I didn't put the pole all the way into the hole.

1541
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:26,560
Oh.

1542
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,300
It's only a little ways into the hole.

1543
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,640
That shows that my pole isn't working right anymore.

1544
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:32,480
Yeah.

1545
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,060
You got to have your pole in the hole at all times.

1546
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:38,700
He has to know that you can't put the pole all the way into the hole.

1547
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:39,120
Yours is.

1548
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,820
You shoved your pole all the way into the hole.

1549
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:41,960
I shoved my pole all the way in.

1550
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:42,180
Yeah.

1551
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:42,820
Well, I didn't.

1552
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,460
I couldn't hear.

1553
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,540
I didn't have a pole in the hole.

1554
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,620
What does that hole have to do with my ear hole?

1555
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,500
It's a completely different hole.

1556
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:55,480
The hole, that hole is a port to sound.

1557
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,420
Portra-skeleton.

1558
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,500
Portra-skeleton.

1559
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,400
I never heard that hole.

1560
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:00,920
Yeah.

1561
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:00,920


1562
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,560
Is it like wavy?

1563
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:05,680
Does it sound waverly or is it fruitless?

1564
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:06,740
No.

1565
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,220
It's fine.

1566
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:09,680
It's fine and full and groovy.

1567
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,720
Speak for yourself.

1568
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:21,760
Today we have mushy spares and spangled dichotomies for dinner and chocolate pudding.

1569
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,360
At least that's what my side of the wing is having.

1570
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,140
Something for dinner and chocolate pudding.

1571
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,220
That's all I could hear.

1572
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,340
Oh, well, can you hear this now?

1573
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,780
A little better, yeah.

1574
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,520
A little better.

1575
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,160
That means not quite good yet.

1576
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,380
Don't worry about her.

1577
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,620
I'm the one that's deaf.

1578
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:51,300
And when I had to split my ear with her ear, strangely enough, that cuts my hearing in

1579
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:51,540
half.

1580
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:56,280
Think if there was a third person here in the room that had to plug into that other

1581
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,080
port.

1582
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,100
Oh, no.

1583
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,840
I'd have one third of a day.

1584
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,500
Two thirds gone.

1585
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:00,780
Yeah.

1586
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,440
Horrible.

1587
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,840
I can only hear one third of a day if there was another person.
