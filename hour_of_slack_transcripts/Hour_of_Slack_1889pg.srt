1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,880
Tonight, radio's distinguished series dedicated to man's imagination.

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,080
The Soul Genius Power of Swag.

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,760
It's our way of acknowledging our American heroes.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,960
That's what you say.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,500
We say you could act like a jackrabbit.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
With frazzled nerves and a heart pounding like a trip hammer.

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,120
You gotta keep jumping. You gotta keep punching.

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,300
Punch. Punch. Punch that grandfather.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,220
Ugh.

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,700
The victim can stand only so much abuse.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,940
Too many people die because they couldn't live.

12
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,760
Grandfather's journey is ending.

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,300
He swam from the Pacific Ocean all the way up to Mount Fuji.

14
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,560
That's impossible, isn't it?

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,340
This is beyond our present knowledge or understanding.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Bob? Bob? Bob?

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,780
Good evening, Bob.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,520
Where are you going tonight, Bob?

19
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,540
Who will you be with tonight, Bob?

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,260
Where will I find you if I need you, Bob?

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,700
And there's a joint in it.

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,460
That's good.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,440
Do you know a Bob?

24
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,220
Oh, yes.

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,460
Yes.

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,460
Khuri Mahru.

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,100
Bob's cool.

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,140
He takes special interest in Bob.

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,140
Bob's sensitive.

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,020
Very clever.

31
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,660
Bob smashed people.

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:39,920
Bob.

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,440
Look here, what's this all about?

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,320
You're a cunt.

35
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:42,780
What?

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,680
Thank you, Lemur.

37
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,280
And this is not a rerun.

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,720
We have some jolly stuff at first.

39
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,360
Then it'll get somber because I have yet more subgenius obituaries.

40
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,020
Then it'll get scary.

41
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,880
But then hopefully we'll have a call-in from Dr. Philo Drummond,

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,120
overman first degree, co-sub-founder of the Subgenius Foundation and Bob's good buddy.

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,420
But first, well, this piece of music is a mystery to me.

44
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:23,100
The file title was Shadow Men, and I presume that's the band.

45
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,280
And the file also had the call letter CKLN,

46
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,340
which is, or rather, the name of the band.

47
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,340


48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,360
There was a small Toronto college station that once had this show on every week.

49
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,000
Shadow Men.

50
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,340
Madam Ohayon Ziel Sundays Area,

51
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,820
Sir fromdoggy państwa

52
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,160

77
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:06,620
I ended up making a list. I was going through my paper mailing list, believe it or not,

78
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:17,800
and cutting out a photocopy and reorganizing it because half the people on this really old mailing

79
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:24,240
list had died. These were people that I knew really well or sent a lot of mail to or wanted

80
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:32,840
to send a lot of mail to. We hardly knew ye. And these are all people that you've heard on the Hour

81
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:43,120
of Slack. Reverend Ann Atrocity, Frank Barney. He was the guy who started the brushwood, the use of

82
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:52,580
brushwood as a campground. Charles B., or Reverend Ouroboros Rex. George Clinton.

83
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:10,760
Joe Cosby. Halim Eldab. Victoria Ganger. Mark Hundahl. The Mojo Bag. You needs it. You gots to have it.

84
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:23,080
That was his routine, and that was him. Reverend Heathen. Reverend Jess John. Don Joyce. Dottie

85
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
Kekever.

86
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:39,100
Ken Keesey. Greg Klaber, also known as Doctor Dark. Paul Krasner. Ken Musgrave, also known as Doc Mojo.

87
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:50,240
Ken Narowski, also known as Doctor Kataden Lagim. Jeff Rosenbaum, co-founder of ACE in Cleveland

88
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,580
and the festival's. Charles...

89
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:02,840
Chaz Smith, Professor Chaz Smith, my good friend, had that band and that show.

90
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,480
Cecilia Pinson Smith of Dallas.

91
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,040
Zug's Rift.

92
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,500
Joe Riley, the film guy of Dallas.

93
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,820
Robert Anton Wilson.

94
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:26,920
And just recently, my uncle St. Clair, he was the last of the old brothers there.

95
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,860
Now, I'm next in line.

96
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,240
Let's see, what have we got here?

97
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,460
Oh, this music in the background is Cyber Chomp.

98
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,440
And the album is...

99
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:44,800
I've used Cyber Chomp.

100
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:44,800


101
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,500
I've used this a lot, because it's an unobtrusive rug, but it's pretty.

102
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,340
Their Moment of Perfect Happiness.

103
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,820
That's an apt title.

104
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:04,160
Friends, Onan Canabite is still publishing the Dobbs Town Mirror out of Dobbs.town.

105
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:11,520
And I want to read some of that again, some more.

106
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,740
But it's actually quite late at night.

107
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,800
And I should probably get off the microphone.

108
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,960
But, yeah, we had a little serious moment there.

109
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,560
How about that?

110
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,880
From PR News in Washington, I'm setting fire to PR Reports.

111
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,320
It looked like, I guess, uh...

112
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,780
President Bush demanded a small fixed-wing airplane smashed into North Korea.

113
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,800
The president, sending a strong joint, said he stands by his rose garden.

114
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,820
Stock price is 822-1077338.

115
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,980
This is PR News.

116
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,840
PR News.

117
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,340
PR News.

118
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:44,540
PR News.

119
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,340
Just in case.

120
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,920
PR News.

121
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,540
PR News.

122
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:52,040
The FBI erratically said terrorism was involved in the crash of a small plane into a PR apartment building.

123
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,680
Officials say at least the crash killed PR News in Washington.

124
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,040
Whoa.

125
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,340
Hi, man.

126
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,960
Hi, yo, Scudder.

127
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,420
My family has left for the day.

128
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,840
They've gone to get their hairs cut.

129
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,340
And, uh...

130
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,860
I always thought it was funny they call it a haircut.

131
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,620
You know?

132
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,440
Instead of a hair's cut.

133
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,500
Yeah, so if you're only gonna have one special hair cut.

134
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:27,920
Or like you had just one big shaft of hair sticking out of the top of your head.

135
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,240
Boy, that would be so...

136
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,480
It was like six or seven inches in diameter.

137
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,340
Right.

138
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,060
And, you know, it looked like a horn.

139
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,880
Right.

140
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,660
It would end up looking like a big old horn.

141
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,040
A hair horn.

142
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,740
Like a rhino.

143
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,200
It would be a lot easier to keep clean.

144
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:47,980
You would think.

145
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,820
If you don't hear me talking, it's cause I'm propping.

146
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,580
Okay.

147
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,160
I'm trying not to waste time.

148
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,460
I was thinking about going to get a beer.

149
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,600
You should.

150
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,920
I can't hear well.

151
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,440
Hold on.

152
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,420
I'm thinking about passing gas.

153
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,340
You can just blather.

154
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,500
The recorder is still on.

155
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,160
I'm thinking about passing gas.

156
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,160
Oops, I don't even have to think about it anymore.

157
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,660
It's actually manifested itself into reality.

158
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,500
And as a result...

159
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,660
Whew, I gotta walk away for a minute.

160
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,240
Yeah, this is the time.

161
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:33,660
This is the time that all men must enter their adulthood and take hold of the beer bear.

162
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,500
A beer bear.

163
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,620
And wrangle that guy back into control.

164
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,640
I'm not sure.

165
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:42,640


166
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:42,640


167
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:42,640


168
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,120
Get that beer bear up with his beer belly.

169
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,840
All right.

170
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,580
Wow, what's that?

171
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,640
So...

172
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,760
So, okay, Dr. Drummond, I've got my...

173
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,880
I want you to fetch me a Lagunitas and...

174
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,460
Okay.

175
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,220
I've got me a Frappinitas.

176
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,400
What is that noise in the background?

177
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,480
Sounds like you're dragging a coffin across a concrete floor.

178
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,800
I was just dragging a coffin across a concrete floor.

179
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,780
Oh, okay.

180
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,100
That was a good guess on my part.

181
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,160
Yeah, very good.

182
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:17,620
Very good.

183
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,740
See, that's exactly what it sounds like.

184
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,220
Yeah.

185
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:28,100
To have drawn a carpet of concrete often across a carpeted floor.

186
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,380
It's heavy.

187
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,720
Oh, I had it backwards.

188
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,980
Anyway, what we got...

189
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,480
So now it's the hour of slack number 1,800.

190
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
2,889.

191
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,760
Wow.

192
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,940
I can't believe it.

193
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:50,020
That's definitely a milestone of magnificent proportion.

194
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,420
Huge.

195
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:51,980
Huge.

196
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Well, yeah.

197
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,700
Who else has done almost 2,000 subgenius radio shows?

198
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:06,260
Well, Puzzling Evidence has been on since 1982 and still is.

199
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,620
And our slack started at 1,000.

200
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


201
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


202
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


203
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


204
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


205
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


206
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


207
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


208
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


209
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


210
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


211
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


212
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


213
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


214
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


215
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


216
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


217
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


218
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


219
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,620


220
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,520
It started in October 1985.

221
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,640
Wow.

222
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,240
Yeah.

223
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,780
So it's been...

224
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,020
I don't even want to think about the math.

225
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,760
It's too much.

226
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:30,540
Do you remember how jealous we were when Doug Wellman had his own radio show and he

227
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,000
was doing stuff and sending us tapes?

228
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,320
Man, we had to do that.

229
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,620
It's amazing how competitive we were.

230
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:38,620


231
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,100
We were back then with our friends.

232
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,400
Well, yeah.

233
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:48,840
But once I finally got a show, I played a whole lot of their show, you know?

234
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,360
Yeah.

235
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,100
Oh, yeah.

236
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,360
Because it was so great.

237
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,320
The parts that you could hear were really great.

238
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,180
Then there were the other parts.

239
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,020
Yeah.

240
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:03,060
That no one would want to hear except Puzzling Evidence in headphones.

241
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,500
Right.

242
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,420
Well, I wanted to hear them, you know?

243
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:05,980
Oh, well.

244
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,860
I like to hear all the bad and the good.

245
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,340
The good and the bad.

246
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,620
That's very...

247
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,060
Noble.

248
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,140
Yeah.

249
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,700
Noble of me.

250
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,160
Yeah.

251
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:14,440
Yeah.

252
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,340
I kind of like that.

253
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,120
Well, okay.

254
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,420
To listeners who don't know anything, we're the two original cool guys that Bob first

255
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,060
recruited.

256
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,280
Yeah.

257
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:33,320
And we allow a small group of other almost as cool guys to hang out.

258
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,300
We shouldn't talk that way.

259
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,880
They get real mad when we do that.

260
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,720
You better cut this part out.

261
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,360
We're not out of the race.

262
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,040
That's right.

263
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,480
But it's true, though.

264
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:48,440
The handsome and mature gents are few and far between, but...

265
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,140
We're a special elite squad of subgenius hierarchites.

266
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:53,620
Right.

267
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:53,920
Yeah.

268
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,740
We make big decisions in the background.

269
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,220
So, okay.

270
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,040
Okay.

271
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,440
Onan sent me this letter.

272
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,960
And when he wants to tell me something real...

273
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,560
I mean, we talk all the time in text.

274
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:13,000
But when he wants me to take something real seriously, he'll actually send it by mail.

275
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:20,060
You know, I was dragging my feet on getting that Agent and Mr. Dobbs book out, which bothered

276
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,160
him because he had actually done all the layout and work himself.

277
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,240
Yeah.

278
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,120
And he...

279
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,080
He was just waiting for you to put your imprimatur on it.

280
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,780
Your imprimatur.

281
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:37,540
I got this immensely heavy box in the mail that probably cost 50 bucks to mail from him.

282
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:44,820
And inside was a brick with the word Agent and Mr. Dobbs written in charcoal on it.

283
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,780
And basically, I had to carry that brick around until I got that job done.

284
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,180
And we did get the hardcover.

285
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,900
We got the $50 hardcover edition is out and all sold out.

286
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,220
And then I dragged my feet on the paperback.

287
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:07,340
But by the time people hear this tonight, I'll have that purchase button on subgenius.com.

288
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,180
In the book section.

289
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,380
And people can buy the Agent and Mr. Dobbs, which is hilarious.

290
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,040
It is hilarious.

291
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,880
I've got my...

292
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,800
I actually have my copy here.

293
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,140
Yeah.

294
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,220
Right here in front of me.

295
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,580
It's very much like a cross between H.P.

296
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,200
Lovecraft and the Three Stooges.

297
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,760
Yeah.

298
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,840
Right.

299
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,200
It is.

300
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,060
If that could be done.

301
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,220
If that could be done.

302
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,380
It captures...

303
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,160
This book does it.

304
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,320
It captures the essence.

305
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,320


306
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:42,620
The essence of Bob better than just about anything else anybody's done, including me.

307
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,760
It's amazing.

308
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,320
Yeah.

309
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,780
And you know, people would be...

310
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,160
You know, if they...

311
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,600
I could just say that, you know, that particular line about any H.P.

312
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,840
Lovecraft fan or...

313
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,460
And any Three Stooges fan.

314
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,920
You don't have to be both.

315
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,060
You could just be one or the other.

316
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:07,160
And still find this to be a very interesting and revealing...

317
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,680
If not enlightening book.

318
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,880
Yeah.

319
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,260
Mainly, it's just really funny.

320
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,160
Yeah.

321
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,600
It's funny.

322
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,160
You'll probably laugh more than anything.

323
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,420
Now, here's the weird thing.

324
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,100
I have not...

325
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:22,360
I have not heard back from Titor LaVerge since I sent him the first copies of the hardcover.

326
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,960
Maybe he got drunk in celebration and is still celebrating.

327
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,300
Well, another...

328
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,620
He was still on Facebook, but he was talking about Ukraine.

329
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,500
I think he's, you know, from a Ukrainian background.

330
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,720
Oh.

331
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,020
Maybe he went over there to be a freedom fighter.

332
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,880
Despite the name LaVerge.

333
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,480
Yeah, right.

334
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,060
I don't know.

335
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,600
But he's...

336
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,000
He's just kind of fan of...

337
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,080
You know, it could be...

338
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,080
I don't know, but it could be that LaVerge may be a subgenius name.

339
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,380
It may not be actually a birth name.

340
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,260
Titor LaVerge?

341
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,960
It might not be his conspiracy name.

342
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,020
So, he might have some real dull name like...

343
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,920
Yeah.

344
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,740
Bill Smith or Doug Wilcox or...

345
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:05,800
No.

346
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,140
It's gonna be a Ukrainian name.

347
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:14,100
It's gonna be like, you know, Vladimir Shmugmoid or whatever they have over there.

348
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,140
Right.

349
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,560
Okay.

350
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,860
Well, anyway, here's this letter that Onan sent.

351
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,860
And it's kind of...

352
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,160
The first page is pretty short.

353
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,900
Then there's a short story, a true story about P.T.

354
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,860
Barnum and Grizzly Adams.

355
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,920
Oh.

356
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,720
Okay.

357
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
But get this.

358
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,640
Please stop Hour of Slack.

359
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,120
I'm sorry.

360
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,120


361
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,060
I'm sorry.

362
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:43,300
Please stop at any day, at any time, unannounced or no.

363
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:44,860
Stop.

364
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,760
Lots of work, lots of time, little pay, much complaining.

365
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:56,400
And you know, you guys and my wife hear the complaining.

366
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:03,500
In fact, Princess Wee said that I'd been complaining about having to do this stupid show as long

367
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,660
as she knew me, which was 1990 or something.

368
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,100
Oh, yeah.

369
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,100
Anyway, Onan says, you won.

370
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,200
You outlasted most paid career DJs.

371
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,300
And it's true.

372
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:22,460
Hour of Slack has been on longer than Johnny Carson or what's his name more.

373
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,520
We ought to work on like a Wikipedia page just for Hour of Slack.

374
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,540
Well, there is one, but...

375
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:35,100
A groundbreaking show that lasted longer than everything else, you know?

376
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:35,600
Yeah.

377
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,360
But all the ground was totally broken afterwards.

378
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,420
It's completely broken.

379
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:40,860
You had to repair it.

380
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,780
It's all soft.

381
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,660
It's completely soft and mushy now.

382
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,940
You can't even repair it.

383
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,520
It's mushy.

384
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:45,900
You can't.

385
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,660
You can't grow anything in it.

386
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,220
No.

387
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:54,500
Anyway, he says, free up that complaining for something else.

388
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,240
Permission granted.

389
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:01,820
The listeners don't know this, but I really do complain because it's a routine.

390
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,220
It's not just...

391
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,560
Yeah.

392
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:10,260
There's all this other stuff I have to do that a nutless chimpanzee could do my job if

393
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,880
only I could train him to read numbers.

394
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,640
He says...

395
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,760
You might need one nut.

396
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,080
He says, every X day...

397
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,180
Oh, you're right.

398
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,700
That's not funny, Dr. Drummond.

399
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,660
Every X day in Devival has a curtain.

400
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,700
Every book has a back cover, and yet, subgenius rolls on and you roll on.

401
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,540
I am specifically not...

402
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,920
I am not saying to switch to any other anything.

403
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,300
Not web, not books, not dogs, not anything.

404
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,160
Just stop doing the one thing over and over as if there will be a different result.

405
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,880
Whatever it is, are you making it better or are you making it worse?

406
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,080
And I've been...

407
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,260
I've sort of been begging for permission to quit this weekly routine for a long time.

408
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,100
Yeah.

409
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,580
Let's face it.

410
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,540
There's 2,000 shows that anybody can listen to anytime.

411
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:02,780
Anytime.

412
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,660
Or play on their own station or podcast.

413
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:06,640
That's right.

414
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,720
I even...

415
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,440
I could call them up.

416
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,960
They're retrievable.

417
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,160
They're like archived and all ready to go.

418
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,900
Anybody could even mechanize that process if they wanted to.

419
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,680
Actually, some stations did, I think, already.

420
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:23,660
Yeah.

421
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,080
It's simple.

422
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:30,200
It's like I'm 168 years old.

423
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,560
Right.

424
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,760
I'm 168.

425
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:32,940
I'm...

426
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,780
Everything's taking longer.

427
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,720
It takes...

428
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,220
And you were that sacred scribe for that other religion before this one.

429
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,480
Well, we don't talk about that.

430
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,640
But there's...

431
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,560
You know, there...

432
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:51,840
I'm still sacred scribe number 273, but there's going to be a number 274.

433
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,380
Yeah.

434
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,160
And I think he's already...

435
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,280
I think he's probably going to be...

436
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,760
Yeah, he's probably already...

437
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,620
I think he's like in his, you know...

438
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,420
Yeah.

439
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,680
...journeyman phase.

440
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,620
Yeah.

441
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,080
You know, he's more than an apprentice now.

442
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,640
He's actually graduated up almost to yeoman.

443
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,260
Well...

444
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,200
Not quite there.

445
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,100
Right.

446
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,320
Well, he...

447
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,060
And he's done his own...

448
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:24,760
He did the Man of Books and his own podcast and things.

449
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,200
Yeah.

450
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,720
He's done...

451
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,500
He actually at one point offered...

452
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:27,560
Man of Letters.

453
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,420
Yeah, Man of Letters.

454
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,400
He offered to take over the show at one point.

455
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,400


456
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,400


457
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,400


458
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,400


459
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,400


460
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,400


461
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,400


462
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,400


463
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,400


464
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,400


465
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,400


466
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,400


467
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,400


468
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,100
But, you know, I don't want to do that.

469
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,000
It would be a different show.

470
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,000
It wouldn't be the Hour of Slack.

471
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:37,420
Yeah.

472
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:37,920
That's right.

473
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,400
And we're not getting the contributions.

474
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,640
You know, there's no Lee Murr cranking out new stuff anymore.

475
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:46,800
Yeah.

476
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,160
That's all from the olden days.

477
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,340
Yeah.

478
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,520
So the content is, you know...

479
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,920
The content's harder to come by and not just...

480
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,400
But that's not a really...

481
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,600
It's not that much harder to just...

482
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,300
And here's another thing.

483
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,640
I'm not an angry young man anymore.

484
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,380
Yeah.

485
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:02,740
Right.

486
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,320
You're like a happy old man.

487
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:04,620
I'm angry...

488
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,780
Yeah, well, I'm angry at chronic diseases and aches and pains and that kind of thing.

489
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,240
Who isn't angry at that, though?

490
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,060
I mean, that's everybody's anger, you know?

491
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,860
No, not everybody has chronic pain, believe me.

492
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,560
Not like you.

493
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,940
Not like you, I would say.

494
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,880
Hey, we...

495
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,340
Well, remember, a long time ago, we needed units of measurement for things like pain

496
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,400
and slack and confusion...

497
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:26,760
Yeah.

498
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,000
...and inebriation.

499
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,360
And the first...

500
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,380
We both immediately landed on Drummond.

501
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,360


502
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:32,740
...and stangs of...

503
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,840
Or was it phylos of slack?

504
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,500
Yeah, phylos of slack.

505
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,940
And stangs of pain.

506
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,100
Yeah.

507
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,260
And that may have been a self-fulfilling prophecy.

508
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,640
Man, we should have been given...

509
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,560
We should have given old Stang some upside.

510
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:55,060
Well, there was janers of confusion and I think sternos of inebriation.

511
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,380
And I forget what some of the other ones were.

512
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,160
They...

513
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,820
I don't remember.

514
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,660
I remember that may have all been cut from Revelation X.

515
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:04,740
Yeah.

516
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,460
Just think about all the stuff that got cut.

517
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,800
Well, that...

518
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,640
See, there's another whole half a book right there.

519
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,560
History.

520
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,940
And I'd like to be scanning old things that were never published that happened before

521
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,540
the internet.

522
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,380
Yeah.

523
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:25,400
But after we quit publishing because the postage cost too much and it was too hard

524
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,120
and I always lost my shirt...

525
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,820
Yeah.

526
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,640
...on this giant...

527
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,340
Do you remember what...

528
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:35,880
Reverend Stang, do you remember when the internet was just like seven guys with tape

529
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,200
decks?

530
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,320
Yeah.

531
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:37,860
Right.

532
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,520
That was our internet.

533
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,340
Yeah.

534
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,400
That was the only...

535
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,280
That was the only worthwhile part of the internet.

536
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,820
It was very slow and it was mostly audio but it was mobile.

537
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,240
I mean, we would record...

538
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,120
We would talk to each other and do...

539
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,780
And it was fun.

540
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,800
Really fun.

541
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,480
Yeah.

542
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,580
Well...

543
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,300
Man.

544
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:02,160
We all had horrible real life jobs then and we needed that fun.

545
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:02,940
We had...

546
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,560
Yeah.

547
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,100
When we managed to take a break, we didn't waste it.

548
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,480
No kidding.

549
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:15,020
Whereas now, we're kind of jaded in that respect and both of us have farming chores

550
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,780
that we...

551
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,420
Yeah.

552
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,380
I got animals to feed and...

553
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:20,800
Right.

554
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,420
...and crops to harvest.

555
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,600
Yeah.

556
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,420
It's...

557
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,180
I got a...

558
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,120
I got some crops.

559
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,100
Man, the squash has been coming in.

560
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:31,560
Whoo.

561
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,320
Yeah.

562
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,520
I saw those pictures.

563
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:41,700
Dr. Drummond actually has a farm with crops because it rains and he has dirt.

564
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,960
Yeah.

565
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:49,840
I have a very big garden but it's in pots because our dirt is not really...

566
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,000
It's...

567
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,240
Yeah.

568
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,680
I feel sorry for your dirt, man.

569
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,080
Because our dirt is so...

570
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,520
It's just like you just plant...

571
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,260
You just put seeds in it and they grow.

572
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,260
Well, you put cactus seeds in this stuff and it'll grow and seed...

573
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,860
Well, that's true.

574
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,540
Yeah.

575
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,920
But yeah, it's...

576
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,700
You put it...

577
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,440
You said it well.

578
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
You said it was...

579
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:16,240
This land had an ornamental dusting of dirt over a foundation of solid limestone.

580
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,360
Yeah.

581
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,860
That's what it is.

582
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,720
I was just out there...

583
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,660
That's just where the limestone got worn down a little bit and turned into dirt.

584
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,420
The limestone is all made of dead sea creatures, shells.

585
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:31,920
Yeah.

586
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,300
It actually is.

587
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,940
I mean, if you look at it real close in a lot of areas, if you know what you're looking

588
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:46,580
at, you're looking at ancient eroded sea shells that were piled up for billions and billions

589
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,560
of years or something.

590
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:50,760
So...

591
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,140
Oh, here's the rest of this letter about the Quintin the Hour Slack.

592
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:54,600
Yeah.

593
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:00,020
And you know, I hate to admit it, but I have been thinking about it for about 25 years.

594
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,680
My first wife was so happy when I got kicked off KNON, she thought I would stop.

595
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,980
But I just kept making tapes and sending them to the other stations.

596
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,600
Anyway, here's more in ONAN's excellent handwriting.

597
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,980
One day, a man made an appointment to see P.T.

598
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,840
Barnum at his American museum.

599
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,200
The visitor was known to Barnum.

600
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,340
Grizzly Adams!

601
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,380
Mr. Adams was begging for a job.

602
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,200
Barnum put him to work wrestling bears.

603
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:38,060
After a time, Barnum asked Adams to come to his office and say how things were going.

604
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:44,500
Adams had taken the job to pay for his children's education so that they did not have to wrestle

605
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,280
bears past retirement.

606
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,400
Adams appeared in Barnum's office but left his animal skin cap on.

607
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,180
Barnum said he was accustomed to men remembering that.

608
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,960
Making them sit at their desk in the back of their office is like removing their hat in his office.

609
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,040
Adams removed his hat.

610
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,700
And so revealed a great wound on his head.

611
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:07,100
Adams explained a bear had bitten him, removing flesh and part of his skull.

612
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,900
But he didn't want to quit for his children.

613
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:17,060
Barnum wrote out a check to pay for his children's education and fired him on the spot.

614
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,820
Don't be Grizzly Adams.

615
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,720
So I think what ONAN is saying is that,

616
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:36,320
You know, I've been bitten by the bear enough times, and my children are past the age of education, and it is getting...

617
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,040
That is so frightening.

618
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:45,920
Doing those links every week, it's the linking, and you have to write a blurb.

619
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,440
You have to write a little blurb about it.

620
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,880
Yeah, the blurb always got me.

621
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,400
I could do all the mechanical stuff, but the blurb, man, you had to take time.

622
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,400
You actually had to listen to the show and make...

623
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,380
Yeah.

624
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,240
Oh, yeah.

625
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,640
My website has logs of just about everything.

626
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,940
You know, any show that has less than 100 cuts, I'll usually have a log of it.

627
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,640
Yeah.

628
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:18,540
It's really just the file names and the order they were played, but, you know, it's a lot of stuff, and it's all still there.

629
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,200
And, you know, if I get a wild hare, and we do something.

630
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,120
And it's really amazing.

631
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,940
Yeah, a special show.

632
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:31,520
You know, I can always tack it on as, you know, here's an hour of, like, annual special.

633
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:36,160
It'd be like the Ewok special for Steven Spielberg, you know?

634
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,520
That was George Lucas.

635
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,660
The Christmas, the Star Wars...

636
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,500
Yeah, the Star Wars Christmas special.

637
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,100
Star Wars Christmas special.

638
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,160
You need a...

639
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,480
You'll have an hour of that Christmas special.

640
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,080
That's so bad that people can't...

641
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,580
That it's a collector's item.

642
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,460
It becomes a cult classic.

643
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,280
Because of...

644
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,080
It's just whole, total badness, you know?

645
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,960
People have to seek it out.

646
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,220
Well, that would...

647
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,720
Artificially restricted supply.

648
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:11,200
That would be when Princess Wee and I finally record our 17-minute rock dog opera, Buddy, based on Tommy.

649
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,340
You read the lyrics.

650
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
You thought they were hilarious.

651
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,560
Yeah.

652
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,000
We're ready to go.

653
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,060
I actually have...

654
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:22,180
I found a website that pulls the vocals out of sound.

655
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:23,600
Wow.

656
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:30,480
And I used the Live at Leeds version of Tommy and removed the vocals.

657
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,740
It sounds a little weird.

658
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,540
And, of course, Princess Wee is almost a professional singer.

659
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,720
Yeah, she can actually sing, but you are different.

660
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,460
Yeah, I'm a little different.

661
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,700
Dave, Reverend Angry Larry said,

662
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,300
I want to help you do that, just so you won't be the one singing.

663
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,000
Yeah, you know, I miss him.

664
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,420
I used to get to see him every year.

665
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,100
At least once a year, and now I don't get to see him anymore.

666
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,560
So that's the bad, sad thing about X Day being a do-it-yourself thing.

667
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,700
Oh, Reverend Angry Larry?

668
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:11,700
Yeah.

669
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,140
Oh, yeah, yeah.

670
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:13,700
I mean, well...

671
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,320
I've been here at my house for some...

672
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,000
Like, for five people.

673
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:17,660
Yeah.

674
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,460
But it's too late now.

675
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,320
Well, I mean, no...

676
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,300
You know...

677
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,260
I mean...

678
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,260


679
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,260


680
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,260


681
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,260


682
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,260


683
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,260


684
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,260


685
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,260


686
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,260


687
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,260


688
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,400
Reverend Xanthia is going to start her resort up again.

689
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:34,020
She's got new land, and she's moving the weird domes and buildings and all of her stuff.

690
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,040
I don't know where she gets the energy.

691
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,020
Oh, now I remember.

692
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,840
She's never done...

693
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,880
She doesn't do drugs.

694
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:40,860
Oh.

695
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,740
She didn't really drink or frop or anything.

696
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,020
Man, I don't know if I like people like that.

697
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,480
Oh, she's wonderful, actually.

698
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,280
She's great.

699
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,360
But she's an overachiever.

700
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,920
She always looks like...

701
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,860
She's kind of in pain in those pictures.

702
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,420
I think it's just the...

703
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:06,360
I think it's just the artificial irises.

704
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,520
The irises.

705
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,500
That's what does it.

706
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,500
Oh, the contact lenses?

707
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,580
Yeah.

708
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,120
Well, she sure does work hard in her...

709
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,360
Oh, yes, she does.

710
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,460
Skimpy, skimpy costumes.

711
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,960
You sure can tell that, for sure.

712
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,040
A lot of subgeniuses went...

713
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,520
I don't know.

714
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,880
How can she be a subgenius?

715
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,900
She's too beautiful and too...

716
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,620
I don't know.

717
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,760
Right.

718
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,760
And...

719
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,400
She's too...

720
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:29,980
I don't know.

721
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:34,340
She's actually come to this house and was really cool.

722
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,660
I've stayed at her house, but she's moving.

723
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,940
But we still might have ex-days in Florida.

724
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,360
However, right now, you know, because of my situation, I can't leave.

725
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,640
We're going to have an ex-day here.

726
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:52,120
Just me and Princess Wee and Wee Mama.

727
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:58,740
Who is mostly pretty out of it because she's heading for the saucers.

728
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,240
That's why I can't go anywhere.

729
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,460
Yeah.

730
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:11,040
And so, I would love to do that stuff again, but I'm not ever going to go back to Ohio.

731
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,380
Oh, no.

732
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,600
I don't want to get on airplanes and I don't want to...

733
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,560
I can't carry luggage anymore.

734
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,660
That's what broke my back was all those ex-days.

735
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,520
Packing the car.

736
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:21,680
Packing the car.

737
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,220
Unpacking it in a big hurry.

738
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:30,880
I can remember every time I picked up a case wrong and went, oh, that was a mistake.

739
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,420
You had a pinched nerve recently, right?

740
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:35,700
Yeah.

741
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,600
I used to get one.

742
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,620
I got over my pinched nerve.

743
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,780
That's something that I would get almost every ex-day and suffer through it.

744
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,820
Oh, man.

745
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,340
That's why...

746
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,160
You mentioned that I grunted incessantly.

747
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,520
Yeah.

748
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,100
You know, my grunting has only gotten more constant and louder.

749
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:52,780
Yeah.

750
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:52,880
Yeah.

751
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,580
And it drives people...

752
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,380
It actually makes people feel sorry for you, but...

753
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,440
I know, because I'm always going...

754
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:06,480
But then the other day, you know, not too long ago, actually, maybe a little while ago,

755
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,960
I noticed I was grunting a lot more.

756
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,860
Like, wait, why am I grunting?

757
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,800
Well, folks, it's just a sign that happens.

758
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,500
It's a sign that you're transitioning into a different setting.

759
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,240
It's a sign that you're in a different phase of existence.

760
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,240
Yeah, a skeleton.

761
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,940
One that you need to maximize.

762
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:32,340
You know, it's like I was telling somebody the other day, is that every age of man has

763
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,060
its advantages and disadvantages.

764
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:39,940
And you don't want to get all bogged down in the disadvantages of being an old man that

765
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,480
you forget about the advantages.

766
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,820
It's great.

767
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:47,240
If you look around, you know, you're always getting a discount on a buffet somewhere.

768
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,360
That's true.

769
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,480
That's true.

770
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,440
Princess, we got shopping on Tuesday.

771
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,980
Tuesdays and Thursdays, because that's old folks' 5% off day.

772
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,540
Yeah, see, people always want to say, hey, go to McDonald's.

773
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,720
They give me coffee for like 70 cents.

774
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,900
Yeah, the first time that happened, I didn't ask, and I didn't understand.

775
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,760
I looked at it and went, oh, man, they can...

776
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,360
They did that.

777
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,740
I didn't even ask, you know.

778
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,180
They gave me a senior discount.

779
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,300
And that was 15 years ago.

780
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,600
So my point is just don't forget, you know.

781
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,500
Every age is a special...

782
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,180
It's a special time, and you got to live it.

783
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,440
Live it.

784
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,180
Live it or lose it.

785
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:34,460
Dolomite said something about when I get old, Dolomite's not going to lay around and feel

786
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:34,880
sad.

787
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,820
He's going to get his kicks thinking about all the swinging times that he's had.

788
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,580
That's exactly right.

789
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,340
Dolomite was, you know, he was a great philosopher.

790
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,260
Yeah, but he's dead.

791
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,440
Yeah.

792
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,200
Well, nobody lasts forever.

793
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,060
That's for sure.

794
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:57,300
Some of us are lucky if we make it to, you know, 70, 80, 90.

795
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,320
Well, that's the thing.

796
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,900
We're lucky.

797
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,060
We're already lucky.

798
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:00,980
Yeah.

799
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:09,100
I mean, I think 73 is the average age of a white man in America.

800
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,100
That's about the...

801
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:18,300
If you're a 73-year-old subgenius right now, you're a lucky son of a buck.

802
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,140
Yeah, I think I'm in or you're dead.

803
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,280
Son of a mother...

804
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,000
A mother buck.

805
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:23,820
Yeah.

806
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,560
I read the list earlier before you were on.

807
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:32,860
It's a long list of people who are already on the saucers.

808
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,760
Oh, well.

809
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,300
Already made it up there.

810
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,860
They're reading their old comic book collection right now.

811
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,460
And all good things must come to an end.

812
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:49,380
And we're thinking maybe show number 2,000, which is 10 shows from now, maybe that, we

813
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,320
can say, will be the last show.

814
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,360
But wait.

815
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:52,800
Why?

816
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,060
What symbology does 2,000 have?

817
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:56,780
Nothing.

818
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,740
I mean...

819
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,240
Doesn't 1998 have a much better symbology?

820
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:05,540
Actually, yeah, that would only be eight more shows.

821
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,980
Eight more shows.

822
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,460
I like that.

823
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:07,740
Yeah.

824
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,440
To 1998.

825
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,520
That's it.

826
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:09,960
Yeah.

827
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,660
2,000.

828
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,940
Anybody would end their career at 2,000.

829
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,500
Anybody can end there because it's round.

830
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,780
You know, the first thing somebody says is, oh, you're going to be 2,000.

831
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,820
You're going to stop at 2,000.

832
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,260
Oh, wait a minute.

833
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,200
I just thought about something.

834
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,500
That's another 100 shows.

835
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:21,500


836
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:27,260
I would actually have to stop at 1,900 because we're at 1,889.

837
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,160
Yeah, that's...

838
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,920
Oh, damn.

839
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,180
Yes, that wrecks the whole thing.

840
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,000
1,900, who cares about that?

841
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,940
Yeah, who cares about that?

842
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,460
You know what Onan would say?

843
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,720
Onan would say, well, just end it right now.

844
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,620
Just, that's it.

845
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,520
And we could just turn the recorders off right now and say, okay.

846
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,100
Yeah.

847
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,420
And that'd be it.

848
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,120
I'm not going to do that, though.

849
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,900
I'm going to play...

850
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,040
No.

851
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,380
I'm going to play...

852
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,220
I'm going to play Dockstock Mountain.

853
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,400
High on Dockstock Mountain from the Soak Your Butt album by the Swingin' Love Corpses.

854
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,620
Why does this one sound so much better than the one I've played?

855
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,440
Because this one was actually recorded in our little basement studio, you know, when

856
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,160
we were trying to practice and do things well.

857
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,580
We weren't actually in a...

858
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,340
Not that we weren't trying to do things well in a show.

859
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,540
It wasn't in that...

860
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,080
Right.

861
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,860
It's just harder to get a good recording.

862
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:18,820
Yeah.

863
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,360
And we never had good minds.

864
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,800
Yikes are good recording attempts.

865
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,700
We were too worried about doing a show.

866
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,320
Right.

867
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,320
And unfortunately never had really good live recordings.

868
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,220
Well, there's some.

869
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:34,140
I think some of my best of Swingin' Love Corpses is live because...

870
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,180
But it was just, you know, it was collected from old tapes.

871
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,940
So anyway, this is about the Dockstocks that we used to...

872
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,820
Actually, Sterno, you might say, was the host of those in Arkansas.

873
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:47,780
Yeah.

874
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,900
They were secret subgenius gatherings.

875
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:55,340
They were secret gatherings that only like 20 or 30 people and maybe their spouses and

876
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,060
kids would even be invited to.

877
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,760
And they were pretty wild.

878
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:06,800
And everybody would jam and rant and swim in the lake.

879
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,220
Fun times.

880
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,680
Those were great.

881
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,360
So anyway, here's a song about it.

882
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,100
High on Dockstock Mountain.

883
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:17,860
Okay.

884
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,100
Okay.

885
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,720
That's where we play.

886
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,060
Here's a song.

887
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,920
Here we go.

888
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,580
Here we go.

889
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,040
Here we go.

890
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,360
Here we go.

891
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,120
Here we go.

892
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:40,780
Here we go.

893
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,980
Here we go.

894
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,820
Here we go.

895
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,520
Here we go.

896
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,100
Here we go.

897
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:44,840
Here we go.

898
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,400
Here we go.

899
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:45,400


900
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:45,400


901
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:45,400


902
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:45,400


903
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:46,980
Here we go.

904
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:46,980


905
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:47,040
Here we go.

906
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,400
Here we go.

907
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,040
From across the nation they came and they saw

908
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,940
A new world begin in northern Arkansas

909
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,280
They drove the storms and hurled the night

910
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,060
To the new awakening and dark, dark inside

911
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:14,360
They shared seeds of love and great times

912
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,280
Eternity was there and they were meeting in time

913
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,260
Body was there but they were few

914
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,460
There was mostly cool guys like me and you

915
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:31,960
And we got high, so high on Dr. Council

916
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:40,240
Yeah, we got high, so high on Dr. Council

917
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,660
We ate lots of mushrooms to commune with nature

918
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,260
How old were we?

919
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,820
We took no weed at the move our sh** later

920
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:54,800
Five hundred colors flashed into my brain

921
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,860
My cell division occurred in three or four planes

922
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,860
My brain was blasted, my head feeling thick

923
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:06,760
My eyeballs protruded but I didn't get sick

924
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,020
We packed up our tips but we kept seeing dots

925
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:15,020
Then we found that the peaks had gotten all the best spots

926
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,260
So we got high, so high on Dr. Council

927
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:28,340
Yeah, we got high, so high on Dr. Council

928
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,900
Yeah, we got high, so high on Dr. Council

929
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:31,900


930
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,240
People were happy, they were all having fun

931
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,400
While Dr. Sir Bob was farming skulls in the sun

932
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,380
The corpses were swinging, their love did abound

933
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,500
The average corpse floated a foot off the ground

934
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,260
But the sun was still shining, the sun was still shining

935
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,620
The bandit's hair knot was speaking its name

936
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:55,780
While his doctors on the plant show was claiming their fame

937
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,800
Sparkdog explosion and combo gang punch

938
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,560
Finisists said, just in time for lunch

939
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:09,000
And we got high, so high on Dr. Council

940
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:17,240
Yeah, we got high, so high on Dr. Council

941
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,540
We packed up our tips and our heads feeling thick

942
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:27,900
And we kept seeing dots

943
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:33,640
We packed up our tips and our hair knot was claiming their fame

944
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,360
But we got high, so high on Dr. Council

945
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,880
We packed up our tips and our hair knot was claiming their fame

946
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,140
But we got high, so high on Dr. Council

947
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:42,600
We packed up our tips and our hair knot was claiming their fame

948
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:47,760
Now we travel, we get ill, break we wake

949
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:47,860
We packed up our tips and our hair knot was claiming their fame

950
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:48,140
Now we travel, we get ill, break we wake

951
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:48,260
Break through to Collaboratal

952
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:48,260


953
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:48,260


954
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:48,260


955
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:48,260


956
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:48,260


957
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:48,260


958
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,380
I'm gonna go back there

959
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,260
I'll even meet the Pope

960
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,600
Better make it to Doc's Dock

961
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,220
Or just give up hope

962
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,340
The dead will be walking

963
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,100
Maybe Bob will appear

964
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,620
The sound of chainsaws

965
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,300
Will be all that you hear

966
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,280
Now I'm gonna go back

967
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,300
And I won't be stopped

968
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,320
I'm gonna go back

969
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,460
To smoke the ultimate frown

970
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,340
You just can't imagine

971
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,380
What it's like to you go

972
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,640
When reality's on hold

973
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,700
And Doc's Dock's a show

974
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,280
We got a lot

975
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,960
So why

976
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,540
Do you want Doc's Dock

977
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:46,900
Now?

978
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:50,780
Oh yeah

979
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:50,840
We got high

980
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,640
Too high

981
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,020
To Doc's Dock

982
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:55,120
Now

983
00:48:55,120 --> 00:49:00,240
Oh yeah

984
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,500
I went way up high

985
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,700
On Doc's Dock Mountain

986
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,200
I climbed down

987
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,540
I climbed up all the way to the top

988
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:11,080
I took everything you could think of

989
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,260
I shot

990
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,280
Beer

991
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,880
I smoked heroin

992
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,600
I smoked heroin

993
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,040
I snorted marijuana

994
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,000
I stuck

995
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,140
I stuck

996
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,580
A stiff glue

997
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,400
I put

998
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,120
Um

999
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,260
Barbiturate

1000
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,860
Propositories in my rectal cavity

1001
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,400
I um

1002
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:42,100
I soul danced on Venus with James Brown's sister-in-law

1003
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,760
I've seen ten square miles of asphalt

1004
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,200
I've seen ten square miles of asphalt

1005
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:47,200


1006
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:47,200


1007
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,120
And then I got stuck up there on top of Doc's Dock Mountain

1008
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,120
Cause the song was over before I could ever come down

1009
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,720
So now I'm lost in a Doc's Dock

1010
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,540
Frappulated hell neither world

1011
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,360
In the song

1012
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,500
Man, okay, tell me when you're gonna go back into the show

1013
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,320
We can talk about how awesome that was

1014
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,200
Okay, yeah, I'm gonna go back into the show

1015
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,280
Cause you know that particular one I really dragged out

1016
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,720
Yeah, okay, one, two, three, go

1017
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,000
Man, that was so awesome

1018
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,340
Yeah, that was a great version

1019
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,700
I think we were probably a little bit inebriated or something

1020
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,300
During that one

1021
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,720
That's you singing mostly and not your brother, isn't it?

1022
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,100
Yeah, that's my brother, my cousin

1023
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,340
Singing in the background vocals

1024
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,280
And I was singing lead there

1025
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,500
Yeah

1026
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,200
And I was singing lead there

1027
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:50,520
I know you and Colonel Sphinx Drummond traded off a lot

1028
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,040
Right

1029
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,620
We traded songs

1030
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:57,080
Generally we didn't trade in a song

1031
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,920
You know, he'd do one or I'd do another

1032
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,960
And then we'd trade backup parts

1033
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,460
Things like that

1034
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,320
Every now and then my cousin, my brother cousin

1035
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,200
Would do some vocals

1036
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,300
Dr. Ray Hay

1037
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,080
Dr. Ray Hay, right

1038
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,220
And yeah

1039
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,020
I'm actually in the process right now

1040
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:24,580
Of getting all of the live footage in one place

1041
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,460
So I can

1042
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,960
My plan is to make this little bit of a playlist

1043
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,440
Kind of a thing that anybody that wanted it

1044
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:37,380
Could easily watch all of the live footage that I have

1045
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,960
Of Swingin' Love Corpses

1046
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:44,880
Listeners, the Swingin' Love Corpses were long before Spinal Tap

1047
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,200
And I think that's a good thing

1048
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,860
And yet there's a lot of similarities

1049
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,100
There's a lot of differences too

1050
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,080
There's a whole lot of differences

1051
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,720
We played a role

1052
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,600
You know, we were a band that was

1053
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,500
A famous touring band

1054
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:04,880
That had met harder times

1055
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,380
And was doing local shows again

1056
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,780
And our tours may have only been like

1057
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:15,360
Two stops in the U.S. that year

1058
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:15,980
You know

1059
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,200
Yeah, like the subgenius world

1060
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:17,200


1061
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:17,680
World tours

1062
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,500
Yeah

1063
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,840
And so

1064
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,960
But yeah, we played that role

1065
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,400
And it was a lot of fun

1066
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,880
And we all had wigs

1067
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,860
In fact, that was one of our few rules

1068
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,700
Is that you could not appear on stage

1069
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,140
Without your wig on

1070
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,260
Yeah, they had

1071
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,060
And wild costumes

1072
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,360
Very tasteless

1073
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,260
And crazy outfits

1074
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:44,380
Yeah, our outfits were based on some hippie's nightmare

1075
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,180
Yeah

1076
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,080
A bad trip

1077
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,420
A bad trip

1078
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,900
A hippie's bad trip

1079
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,900
And there was great spaz dancing

1080
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,500
During the instrumental parts

1081
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:55,780
Yeah, we had

1082
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,060
In fact, we talked about

1083
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,620
Just recently

1084
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,180
How we had a character named

1085
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,140
Beetle Bob

1086
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,580
Who would show up at our shows

1087
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,740
And he was really tall

1088
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,840
And he would stand right in front

1089
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,200
And do the craziest dancing

1090
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,420
Right in the middle

1091
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,000
Right

1092
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,240
Now, unfortunately

1093
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,140
People couldn't see me as well

1094
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,040
Right

1095
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,400
When Beetle Bob was there

1096
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,000
Even though I admired his dancing

1097
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,500
And didn't want to lose his draw appeal

1098
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,680
So what we did is

1099
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,580
We would prepare

1100
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,500
Because Beetle Bob came to every show

1101
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,520
We got some

1102
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,940
Like that kind of tape

1103
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,240
That they tape off where

1104
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,580
You know

1105
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,680
Crime scene

1106
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,680
Crime scene

1107
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,560
And we taped off an area

1108
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,440
And then designated it

1109
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,620
Beetle Bob only

1110
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,840
Over on the side, right?

1111
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,940
Oh, it was on the side

1112
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,480
Yeah

1113
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,080
But up front

1114
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:48,940
Right up front

1115
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,720
Next to the stage

1116
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,820
But a little over to the side

1117
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,800
So that he wouldn't obscure

1118
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,200
The audience's view of me

1119
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,340
I always used to videotape

1120
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,640
My favorite bands like yours

1121
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,140
And the amino acids

1122
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,200
From the side of the stage

1123
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,680
So my right ear was pointing directly

1124
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,960
At the main speakers

1125
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,900
And that's why I can't hear anything

1126
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,600
In my right ear

1127
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:11,960
Yeah

1128
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,060
Isn't that funny?

1129
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,640
It'll do it to you

1130
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,220
It's not

1131
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:19,120
It's funny but only in an ironic sense

1132
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,460
So anyway

1133
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,420
Let's play one more

1134
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,620
Swingin' Love Corpses song

1135
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,800
And this one's an instrumental

1136
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,860
That you just posted recently

1137
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,720
I'd never heard

1138
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,820
And the title of this one is

1139
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,580
Rock Roll Lead Zep

1140
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:34,640
With Robert Planet Voice Horn Parts

1141
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:35,920
All one word

1142
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,220
There you go

1143
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,280
That's pretty much a good description

1144
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,820
Dot Wave

1145
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,540
We can climb up on Doc's Doc Mountain

1146
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:45,600
While that song plays

1147
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,020
Yeah

1148
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:46,560
Okay

1149
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,500
We know what that means

1150
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,320
Okay here goes

1151
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:50,620
Yeah

1152
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:52,880
Okay

1153
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:52,880


1154
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:52,880


1155
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:52,880


1156
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:52,880


1157
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:52,880


1158
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:52,880


1159
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:52,880


1160
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:52,900
Yeah

1161
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,200
Yeah

1162
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,600
Yeah

1163
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,400
Thank you.

1164
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,340
Thank you.

1165
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:26,960
Thank you.

1166
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,220
Thank you.

1167
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,900
Thank you.

1168
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:02,140
Thank you.

1169
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,160
Thank you.

1170
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,040
Thank you.

1171
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,140
Thank you.

1172
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,300
Thank you.

1173
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:46,400
Thank you.
