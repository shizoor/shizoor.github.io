1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Um, don't congratulate yourself now, Doctor.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,880
D-O-K, Doctor.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,720
Sit down in that chaise large.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,860
Place your feet behind Chaz's ears and begin rubbing slowly.

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:16,120
Eh?

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,120
Little blue ones that dance in front of your eyes.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,460
Just reach over and take one of these Sumerian tablets.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,880
I think you'll feel the presence of something that goes way, way, way back.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,260
Once you do, the floodgates will be all open.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,900
Nice and open.

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:49,640
And now, the sub-genius hour of swag!

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,260
It leaves its victims either dead or incurably mad.

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,840
You got that?

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,160
Have any further messages been decoded?

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,640
Or aren't we allowed to know?

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,200
I'm not sure, Mr. President.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,780
And now there will be no further messages to decode.

18
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,100
You must shut down your transmitter.

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,000
Shut it down.

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,340
I've got to clamp the lid on this business.

21
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,280
Stop these communications.

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,600
Oh, damn.

23
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,760
You know what?

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,840
Those that lie within your power, Mr. President, you can declare a national emergency.

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,500
I don't have to.

26
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,680
It's here.

27
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,300
But I don't.

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,400
And not merely national.

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,380
Wait, I'm getting a no-go signal.

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,480
Now I'm losing one of the craft.

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,280
Hey, Bermuda, you getting it?

32
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,400
I lost contact.

33
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,740
A lot of dust blowing up there.

34
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,860
Okay, they're calling those two little peewee dogs.

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,000
The pumpkin birds, I think they're calling them now.

36
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,520
Okay.

37
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,600
Come in.

38
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,060
No, I'm sorry.

39
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,860
The Red Seed is...

40
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,820
We lost the Red Seed.

41
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,520
Now how the hell are you guys going to explain away a town that's either wiped out or reduced to mindlessness?

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,540
I'm starting it again.

43
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,720
Well, I can't change into Superman.

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,460
I can do my best here for the show.

45
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,460
I remember staying at my post.

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,100
Now it's time.

47
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,120
I can't stop.

48
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,440
I'm not being swayed by these demonic faces.

49
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,540
They're gibbering, squeaking ghosts and phantom of silence.

50
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,780
Malicious demons.

51
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,440
Incubi and Subdubi.

52
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,820
That's for you.

53
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,160
Oh, I couldn't see.

54
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,200
Twittering woofers from the underworld.

55
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,040
No, fleshless heads reaching up.

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,700
The terrible rotten smell of burning.

57
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,380
The terrible rotten smell.

58
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,620
The terrible rotten smell of burning.

59
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,700
The terrible rotten smell.

60
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,720
Okay, now how...

61
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,080
What are you having for breakfast right now?

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,280
Burning flesh.

63
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,440
I can't.

64
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,100
Hey, it sounds good.

65
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,200
Well, it is traditional.

66
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,880
So if you're going up north on 80 on Immigr...Graph...Graph...I...

67
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,860
Well, then you'll need your portable personal refrigerator.

68
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,940
It works as your condiment for the people that came across and failed to make it a cooler.

69
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,000
Some would call this mini-fridge a cooler.

70
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,460
But I choose to call it a refrigerator.

71
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,800
Because it looks and acts like a refrigerator.

72
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:19,800


73
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,320
A refrigerator.

74
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,420
Wow.

75
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,460
In fact, it acts like a duck.

76
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,700
It walks like a duck.

77
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,060
Well, I guess it's a refrigerator.

78
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,500
Well, it might be a cellar.

79
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:34,800
And therefore, its easy take anywhere design makes it perfect for your car, van, motorhome,

80
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,220
tailgate parties, lynchings, picnics, dorm rooms, sweatshops.

81
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,460
It's beautiful in here.

82
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:48,540
Even near the TV when you're too lazy to get up out of the chair and you don't want to

83
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,540
miss a minute of your...

84
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:49,780
I wonder what's in here.

85
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,120
A favorite sport or ballgame with written scripts for the kitchen fridge.

86
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,040
Oh yeah?

87
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,260
Ice caps thousands of feet high melted away in a few days.

88
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:00,700
Great.

89
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,980
Well, those people must use atomic power as we use water.

90
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,280
It's okay, show begins.

91
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,380
Dave, they'll be able to..after they sign that bill tomorrow, they can search your home

92
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,500
without even telling you.

93
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,520
They can search your bag of candy, man.

94
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,520
There gonna be feds on the street searching your bag of...anybody wearing a funny-looking

95
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,800
suspicious costume.

96
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,860
costume. If you ask me, the door

97
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,780
done swung wide open, and

98
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,920
every neo... I don't want to say

99
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,460
the word anymore, because it might not be allowed.

100
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,020
Just got his way.

101
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,760
And people didn't even know it. And, of course, we

102
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,980
aren't really people, are we?

103
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,920
Well, that's... You know, some call us

104
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,280
the rats in the walls.

105
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,880
But other people kind

106
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,540
of wish they could party like we do.

107
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,560
In those cracks.

108
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,580
They think we're the rats in the walls?

109
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,300
The interstices between

110
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,500
the insulation

111
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
and the walls. Wow, you're saying

112
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,820
that... That's where we're partying, man.

113
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,580
They're like mouse thing, right? And we're the rodents?

114
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,460
Or rodents, depending on...

115
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,660
I've got a plan, see?

116
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,900
I've got it all planned out.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,780
We'll live underground

118
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,020
when they take over. And we'll

119
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,340
plot and plan. But you know,

120
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,340
there's gonna be

121
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,340
subgeniuses that

122
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,900
hunt us

123
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,960
for the man. They'll hunt

124
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,560
other subgeniuses.

125
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,440
I would like a bubble that no one

126
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,320
could pierce to float around in.

127
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,260
Interruption. Prolofeed.

128
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,380
Oceana Special Forces

129
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,600
have begun ground phase of Oceana's

130
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,360
plus war against terrorism in

131
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,640
East Asia, operating in small numbers

132
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,380
in southern East Asia and support

133
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,480
wise of the CIA's effort in

134
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,540
the East Asian heartland. The Eurasians

135
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,420
have said they are confident this can be

136
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,340
all worked out within a matter of five

137
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,680
fiscal seasons.

138
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,620
Their presence on the battlefield

139
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,660
field, pardon me,

140
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,020
battlefield,

141
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,340
comes amid growing indications

142
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,380
that the war's unintensity

143
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,100
is about to speedwise dramatically

144
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,320
after almost two weeks of oceanic air

145
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,160
strikes that many PACS

146
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,120
officials say have vaporized

147
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,260
East Asian defenses. Teledep mandatory

148
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,940
at 1800. Victory!

149
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,840
Brazil.

150
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,280
No, no, no, no.

151
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,540
No, no, Brazil.

152
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,380
That's the life

153
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,340
we're living in. 1980 Brazil.

154
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:12,860
It's

155
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,320
the reality that we have to fake

156
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,340
face every day when we think we might

157
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,360
go up the elevator and this sneaky lady

158
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,540
or Mr. Dogfish or some of the other

159
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,200
evil creatures they're releasing from

160
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,920
the side factories in Langley might

161
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,540
release on us.

162
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,040
This optimist, he thinks the life is

163
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,960
like Brazil. It's more like the

164
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,680
Matrix, dude. You're in a jar.

165
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,920
You're plugged in somewhere,

166
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,060
copper top. This is all just part

167
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,160
of the program, dude. Get used to it.

168
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,060
Oh, that would be so depressing.

169
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,140
I would want to sell my Forrester

170
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,220
and my Outback and I would probably want

171
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,220
to maybe even sell one of these

172
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,260
cylindrical objects that you gave me that...

173
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,280
No, there is no spoon.

174
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,260
Well, there's no silver spoon that we

175
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,960
can all claim was dangling from our

176
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,140
orifices when we were born, but

177
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,080
we've tried our best, haven't we?

178
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,820
Battle of the Millionaires.

179
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,500
Yes, tonight

180
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,600
in Afghanistan,

181
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,480
the Battle of the Millionaires.

182
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,360
Tonight, the wealthy

183
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,920
East Asian

184
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,160
is top of the lot on the news.

185
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,580
He's got a dream in his own mind.

186
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,520
He's been talking directly to his doom king.

187
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,420
Hello?

188
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:27,720
Hello?

189
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,760
Sheriff's Office speaking.

190
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,220
Oh, gentlemen, we're not dealing with

191
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,380
a flu virus here. We're dealing with

192
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,080
an often lethal, always

193
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,180
debilitating encephalic

194
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,660
mutation.

195
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,940
Bring out your days!

196
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,020
Attention

197
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,880
conspiracy!

198
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,100
You are condemned.

199
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,380
Did you know that?

200
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,220
The instant the normals you support

201
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,060
attempted to take over our slack,

202
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,240
you sentenced yourselves

203
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,440
to death.

204
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,940
The slack forces of the

205
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,700
Church of the Subgenius are here to shut

206
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,960
down your system and seek justice

207
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,820
for our oppressed.

208
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,740
Highly trained clergy are coming to

209
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,460
shut down, once and for all,

210
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,740
the man's ring of pinkness

211
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,780
and the conspiracy that

212
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,360
supports them and their actions.

213
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,940
Our forces are armed

214
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,980
with state-of-the-art, mind-altering

215
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,820
paraphernalia. What are you

216
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,900
using? Obsolete and ineffective

217
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,940
thought processes?

218
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,600
Our heliopters will

219
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,560
rain phlegm down

220
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,240
upon your camps before

221
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,880
you detect them on your radar.

222
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,380
Our bongs are

223
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,380
so accurate, we can drop

224
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,340
them right through your Neiman Marcus coffee

225
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,180
tables. Our infantry

226
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,520
is trained for slacking off in any climate

227
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,200
and terrain on Earth.

228
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,040
Subgenius warriors

229
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,480
fight with superior marksmanship

230
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,220
and are armed with superior

231
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,620
psychological weapons.

232
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,560
You have only one choice.

233
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,040
Surrender now,

234
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,100
and we will give you a second chance.

235
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,700
Really?

236
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,780
We will let you live.

237
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,500
If you surrender, no harm will come

238
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,140
to you. No, no, really!

239
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,100
When you decide to surrender,

240
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,080
approach subgenius forces

241
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,160
with your feet in your mouth.

242
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,460
Sling your bullshit and lies

243
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,320
back across your back towards

244
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,180
the ground. Remove your wallet

245
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,560
and expel any cash to the coffers

246
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,360
of Dobbs. Doing

247
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,200
this is your only chance

248
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,380
of survival!

249
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,720
Bombs

250
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,600
not racism!

251
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,580
Oh yes, my friends,

252
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,200
and uh, hey,

253
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,540
hey, we thank

254
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,820
to great Reverend Crawford

255
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,720
Smith for a great

256
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,820
conspiracy broadcast

257
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,180
script. Anti-conspiracy

258
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,320
war broadcast

259
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,540
script. Friends,

260
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,820
friends, oh, and this

261
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,440
music in the background is by

262
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,400
Xerox, a tune called

263
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,540
Subgenius.

264
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:14,980
Subgenius.

265
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,400
And now, friends, but actually

266
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,420
I want to switch over to this music

267
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,380
by this new, this person named

268
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,460
Gene Strong, who makes

269
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,200
movies in Chicago.

270
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,240
Apparently Reverend Tesla Coyle

271
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,480
sent us this and said that we

272
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,340
would like it, and he was right, because it is

273
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,260
wonderful background music

274
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,500
for such as ourselves,

275
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,520
so you know, to tell

276
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,300
the truth, the evil,

277
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,520
evil truth. Friends, you know

278
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,040
this war is, uh,

279
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,200
it's a confusing

280
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,500
mess. You know, a lot of people have very

281
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,660
very strong opinions, and I do too.

282
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,460
My strong opinion is that I

283
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,160
don't know what's going on.

284
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,060
Because I don't trust anybody.

285
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,600
I know that sounds

286
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,240
kind of

287
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,600
sick or something, or wise,

288
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,600
I don't know, I mean,

289
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,940
but that's the problem, now ain't it?

290
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,660
Um, you know, I'm, I

291
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,320
God bless America, I

292
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,100
love my

293
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,340
homeland, and I've traveled around the world,

294
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,460
quite a bit, and I know how

295
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,040
horrible it is in

296
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,900
everywhere else. I mean, it's

297
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,240
horrible everywhere. It's rough here, it's rough

298
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,340
here, there, and everywhere.

299
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,780
Although I understand they just

300
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,540
decriminalized in England, you know.

301
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,020
Now I don't have to learn how to say

302
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,020
Var is der Badkammer

303
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,980
und der Drugs, I still blieft.

304
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,200
Anyway, friends,

305
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,900
yes, it's an upsetting thing, and

306
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,200
you know, there was a time,

307
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,440
well, you know, I mean, uh,

308
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,460
for the first month or so, like

309
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,080
most people, I was, uh,

310
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,200
ready to say,

311
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,640
well, uh, we must

312
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,520
root out these

313
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,400
evildoers, and of course we

314
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,520
must indeed root out these

315
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,660
evildoers, but then, you know, then you start

316
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,540
seeing the evidence

317
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,900
that the evidence might be doctored,

318
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,500
and you have to wonder who that

319
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,380
evidence comes from, and you read some

320
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,560
anti-government thing, and

321
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,580
you agree with it, and then it turns out to

322
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,020
be from Pravda.

323
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,440
But you don't know if it's really from Pravda, or from,

324
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,420
from some, you know,

325
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,440
wise military person in America, like it

326
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,040
claims to be, saying that, well,

327
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,380
yes, it is all a lie,

328
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,240
and the whole reason for all of this is

329
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,920
because the oil

330
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,040
will be gone in 20 years,

331
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,240
and the world will plunge into chaos,

332
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,460
and, uh, 25%

333
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,580
of the oil is under Saudi Arabia,

334
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,540
and the government of Saudi Arabia

335
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,020
is collapsing, and

336
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,440
you have to kind of go, well, now,

337
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,540
um, uh, certainly

338
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,380
it's possible that this whole thing is,

339
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,380
is an excuse to strong-arm

340
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,520
into the region,

341
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,220
basically colonize,

342
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,360
uh, set up camps here, there, and

343
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,200
everywhere, and then suddenly colonize Saudi Arabia

344
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,280
before they can have a chance to side with

345
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,080
Iraq and form another world superpower,

346
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,940
and my friend, you have to ask yourself,

347
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,360
do I want to be

348
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,420
a slave

349
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,920
to Mullah

350
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,860
bin Laden, or

351
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,940
Mullah Bush?

352
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,040
And that's where, you know, it's like, well,

353
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,180
Mullah Bush would probably

354
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,040
still let me go to strip joints.

355
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,320
Sigh.

356
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,000
And, you know, once again, the conspiracy

357
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,620
has given us subgeniuses

358
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,600
a

359
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,080
huge range of choices between

360
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,120
A and B.

361
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,300
And this time, it's a fairly clear-cut choice.

362
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,280
You know, I mean, of course, it must be,

363
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,800
uh, uh,

364
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,220
well, uh, of course, you know,

365
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,140
we, we, we

366
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,520
don't,

367
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,620
we don't want to, uh,

368
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,020
have all the Connie-ites, uh,

369
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,840
forced underground

370
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,960
where they can't learn to read,

371
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,980
have to wear masks so we can't see their

372
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,340
purty faces, or their, their purty legs,

373
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,900
or, and, and, and,

374
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,640
you know, they, well, well, friends,

375
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,240
if you're confused, I got this little, little, um,

376
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,880
read out here in the, uh,

377
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,040
the internet from, uh,

378
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,380
from St. Bayron Werner,

379
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,260
who helps, uh, with, uh,

380
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,560
this handy guide

381
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,060
will help us to distinguish differences

382
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,600
between terrorists,

383
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,460
terrorists, and the U.S.

384
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,060
government. Uh,

385
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,220
let's just, uh, switch, and I'll, uh,

386
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,280
really, I guess all I need to do is describe

387
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,320
the terrorists, if you were

388
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,200
ever wondering what it is that makes

389
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,300
a terrorist, and, and if you're feeling

390
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,460
confused, this should straighten you out.

391
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,300
Terrorists, well,

392
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,560
the supposed leader of the terrorists

393
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,860
is the spoiled son

394
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,320
of a powerful politician from an

395
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
extremely wealthy oil

396
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,340
family. Uh,

397
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,200
the leader of the terrorists has declared

398
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,440
a

399
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
holy war, or jihad, against

400
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,640
his enemies, and believes that any

401
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,480
nation not with him is against him.

402
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,620
Believes God is on his side, and

403
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,520
that any means are justified.

404
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,440
The terrorists

405
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,680
are supported by extremely

406
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,680
fundamentalist religious leaders

407
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,460
who preach hatred, intolerance,

408
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,660
subjugation of women, mistreatment, and

409
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,340
worse, of gay, lesbian, and

410
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,020
bisexual, and transgendered people,

411
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,200
and persecution of

412
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,240
non-believers. That's us, friends.

413
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,500
The terrorists

414
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,240
leadership was not elected

415
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,100
by a majority of the people

416
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,060
in a free and democratic election.

417
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,640
The terrorists kill thousands

418
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,320
of innocent civilians, some of them

419
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,420
children, in cold-blooded bombings.

420
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,280
They operate through

421
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,300
clandestine organizations

422
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,680
with agents in many countries

423
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,440
using bombs, assassination,

424
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,540
and other terrorist tactics,

425
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,500
friends, and, worst

426
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,380
of all, the terrorists use war

427
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,000
as a pretext

428
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,460
to clamp down on dissent

429
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,600
and undermine

430
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,520
civil liberties. And I guess that's

431
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,160
what the big worry here, friends,

432
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,980
is that our brave soldiers

433
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,260
are going to go through hell

434
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,820
and kick booty

435
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,920
and come back to a country that

436
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,600
ain't the one they left.

437
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,160
Where you, all of a sudden, can't

438
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,500
smoke cigarettes in a bar or a restaurant

439
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,180
and suddenly they've made laws

440
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,040
to look out for your own good,

441
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,060
to tell you what you in your private own home

442
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,880
can or can't do in bed,

443
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,740
and so forth.

444
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,380
Oh, wait a minute. Now, maybe I should think of better

445
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,240
examples. Uh, something

446
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,380
worse. Anyway, friends,

447
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,940
the bottom...

448
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:20,960
Well,

449
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,280
once again, let us, uh...

450
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,560
People, what

451
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,980
have you done?

452
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,700
Locked him in his golden

453
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,520
cage.

454
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:42,800
Yeah.

455
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,640
Golden cage.

456
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,840
Made him

457
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,900
bend to your religion.

458
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,520
Him resurrected

459
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,340
from the grave.

460
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,540
Yeah.

461
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,760
From the grave.

462
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,160
He is the god of nothing,

463
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:06,820
which is

464
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,020
all that you can see.

465
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:09,980
Yeah.

466
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,640
You are the god of everything

467
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,780
since he's inside

468
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,240
you and me.

469
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,700
Yeah.

470
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,100
So lean upon him

471
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,000
gently

472
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,460
and don't call on him to say

473
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,140
fool.

474
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:42,460


475
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,340
oh...

476
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,840
That's not

477
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:57,420
the moment

478
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,640
now.

479
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,780
Does he realize

480
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,900
you've tried

481
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,240
to Лолъ

482
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,940
and to

483
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,560
The

484
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:08,900
guest

485
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:08,900


486
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:08,900


487
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,200
yeah

488
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,220
Each claim ain't just a part of him

489
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,560
Also a part of me

490
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,480
So you guys aren't really disturbed as you sound?

491
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,280
I mean, like about the fact that our world is rapidly crumbling around us?

492
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,300
Just like the World Trade Center crumbled around those people in Battery Park?

493
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,180
Well, you know, I had a full...

494
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,000
I avoided the news for two years, and now that I've plunged back into it,

495
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,700
I've been diving into all this incredible detail that you can find in foreign newspapers,

496
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,000
on the World Wide Web, and so forth.

497
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,680
Yeah, there's a lot of news out there.

498
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,980
But you have to turn off the TV, and the radio for that matter, to make it work.

499
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,640
And you have to be able to read.

500
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:39,040
But there's some weird stories out there of people,

501
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,180
caught wandering in the desert, and wandering in America.

502
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,680
Do you have one that you can play on the audience of 12 we have here?

503
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,660
Well, I'll tell you.

504
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,860
The crazies are getting crazier.

505
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,320
They're leeching up out of the woodwork,

506
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,820
as if soaked up with a miracle industrial chemical called war.

507
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,640
And as sacred scribe to the Church of Subgenius,

508
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,920
I have been the recipient of quite a...

509
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,280
bit of diseased mail, email,

510
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,980
and internet comings and goings,

511
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:23,720
by people who take gigantic world-spanning events personally.

512
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,100
And allow them to help create the cracks that are crumbling it.

513
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,440
Well, they feel responsible for everything good that happens,

514
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,400
and everything bad that happens, they blame on Bob.

515
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,880
Which, you know...

516
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,480
You should have neutralized this faction back when you had a 3,000-foot penis, Stang.

517
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,600
Oh, the conspiracy is gonna do their thing no matter what.

518
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,700
The consp... the conspiracy... you know, the... the... there's just... it just is.

519
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,820
It's... it... there's...

520
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,980
Stang, in the world we're in, you should have had their house numbers and everything like that.

521
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,980
And one day, uh, you know, as they were going out, brrrrrrrat,

522
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,860
you know, just like in Europe and the Middle East and everywhere else.

523
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,700
You know?

524
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,660
You would have got them.

525
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,360
That's what you should have done.

526
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,740
As a true leader... We had Bob and...

527
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,140
Bob in our sights.

528
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,980
You should have eliminated...

529
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,360
We had... we had the Moolah Dobbs in our sights.

530
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,740
And we didn't... and... and we lost... we didn't have the nerve.

531
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,840
It was a lack of nerve.

532
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,640
Look like smoking, Imam.

533
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,620
It's more than a hookah.

534
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,000
It's a bond of fixtures.

535
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,480
Stuck somewhere between the dentures in your head and your eye.

536
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,200
An aluminum paste that lives inside your...

537
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,160
Bob's not Bob!

538
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,840
Bob Dobbs.

539
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,360
Bob's not Bob!

540
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:37,940
Bob Dobbs.

541
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,580
Well, I remember him when he used to clean eels down on the dock.

542
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,560
He wasn't anymore than a 300, 400 pound little baby.

543
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,780
We had to take care of him because he couldn't fish the way the rest of us could.

544
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,840
Bob Dobbs.

545
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,040
Oh, you're saying now he's gone all the way up and down Wall Street with that one gamey leg

546
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,020
and making all that money.

547
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,900
Ah, be Jesus, sir Christ, I... I can't imagine it.

548
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,800
I can't imagine it.

549
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,880
Friends, you have nothing to worry about.

550
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:21,300
All of your needs and all of your proportionate cares and worries have been flaked about and given back to once they came, friends.

551
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,960
There's nothing to stampede about but panic itself.

552
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,840
You're all cattle now.

553
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,460
You're all wearing horns.

554
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,300
There's the river.

555
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,140
There's the female divestress.

556
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,140
You can smell the many of these a mile away.

557
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,300
Mmm.

558
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,920
Mmm.

559
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,620
The longhorn steers.

560
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:55,340
There are many things your pathetic human minds could never understand.

561
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,420
Yeah.

562
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,020
Yeah, they all had that W brand on them.

563
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,600
Earth.

564
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,380
The barbed and W.

565
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,060
Oh, my God.

566
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,180
Hey.

567
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,180


568
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,600
Ha!

569
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,180
What is this, another piece of information I forgot to pass on to you guys?

570
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,080
Well, it's a number.

571
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,160
But in any case, somebody will help.

572
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,500
Must be wiped out.

573
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,380
Someone will answer your pleas.

574
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,280
I cannot fly in the face of 180 years of American history.

575
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,640
No, don't fly in my face.

576
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,740
For God's sake.

577
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,160
I cannot start a war.

578
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,380
A month from now, we may not have the strength to fight one.

579
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,660
The Russians may have in their hands the power now.

580
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,280
Oh, I'm shocked.

581
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Ah, we're remilitarizing.

582
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,300
This country will not launch a war.

583
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:35,740
George.

584
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,980
George W. Bush's desire to create a U.S. space core.

585
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,620
We've served a great many years together.

586
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,200
And there's never been a day when I couldn't happily go along with any decision of yours.

587
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,340
But I have a responsibility to this country, too.

588
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,900
And I can't stand by and see it destroyed.

589
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:58,260
Our difference is that I don't believe it can be destroyed by 13 slips of paper covered with obscure symbols.

590
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,540
The Ketler's empire was destroyed.

591
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,060
Oh, there it goes.

592
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,400
Obscure symbols.

593
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,600
An empire one moment and nothing but glowing rubble afterwards.

594
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,440
Excuse me, sir.

595
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,780
Won't you come in, please?

596
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,740
How do you do?

597
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,860
How do you do, Mr. President?

598
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,560
Mr. President.

599
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,220
Mr. President.

600
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,880
It was very good of you to come.

601
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,740
Mr. President, please do well.

602
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,240
I want to tell you that I'm bringing your boy with you.

603
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:21,980
Boy with you?

604
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,600
I want to bring your couple to the start of this whole business.

605
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,520
Okay.

606
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,120
I want you to sit down, please.

607
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:26,980
Okay.

608
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,360
I'm not going to drag this out.

609
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,140
No, not there.

610
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,080
Stop dragging things around.

611
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,700
Let's just get to business.

612
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,380
You made a pretty fair start in that, Mr. President.

613
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:34,380


614
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,420
When you clamped the center ship on us, have any further messages been decoded?

615
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,000
Just show.

616
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,920
Or aren't we allowed to know?

617
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,460
I'm not sure, Mr. President.

618
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,320
There have been no further decodings.

619
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,020
And now there will be no further messages to decode.

620
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,320
You must shut down your transmitter.

621
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,260
Shut it down.

622
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,960
We're not serious.

623
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,600
I've got to clamp the lid on this business.

624
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,600
Stop these communications.

625
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,880
Oh, damn.

626
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,060
Reach for the steam whistle.

627
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,060


628
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,060


629
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,360
I'm going to have to go.

630
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,020
I'm going to have to go.

631
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,420
I'm going to have to go.

632
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,720
I'm going to have to go.

633
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
I'm going to have to go.

634
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,240


635
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,700
I'm going to have to go.

636
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,620
Reach for the steam whistle today.

637
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,360
It will be extremely interesting to hear the reaction of President Musharraf.

638
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,660
And be sure to ask for free shipping.

639
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:17,340
To send a delegation into Kandahar to try to convince the Taliban to hand over Osama

640
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:17,800
bin Laden.

641
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,120
Even professionals can't give you the fast, easy, affordable clean of the compact steam

642
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,400
whistle.

643
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:31,640
Well, I'll have you know, it's a person who has very, very big ears and eyes and very

644
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,680
tiny, tiny ears.

645
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,700
And he's got very tiny, beautiful little hairs.

646
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:42,360
Osama bin Laden is not a true representative of the German or the Hungarian people.

647
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,380
Dave, you wanted some news?

648
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,140
I've got some details.

649
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,480
Here's some interesting details.

650
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,660
The Augustine haircut.

651
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,820
Pardon me.

652
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,980
I'm sorry, what?

653
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,900
You asked for details from the news.

654
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:01,920
And I've got some really interesting, weird little details about the Department of Homeland

655
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,680
Security's...

656
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,800
Use of the Army, Reservists, and National Guard people at internal security checkpoints.

657
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,820
Now get this.

658
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,240
Scare me, baby.

659
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:11,640
I'm here.

660
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,860
The basic plan is to have each of these internal security checkpoints manned by six armed Army

661
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:23,840
or National Guard Reservists carrying M16s with full field kit and a medium machine gun

662
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,360
emplacement.

663
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,780
But according...

664
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,240
Now get this.

665
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,740
You'll love this.

666
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,680
According to a Homeland Security representative who requested anonymity, the Department of

667
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:32,680


668
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:32,680


669
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:32,680


670
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,440
Security said the National Guard had ordered the M16s to be disarmed and to be dispatched

671
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:33,440


672
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:33,440


673
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:33,440


674
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:33,440


675
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,020
It might take, quote, it might take double or triple that number of lazy used car salesman,

676
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,420
fast food workers, and other weekend warriors, unquote, to man a single post.

677
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,040
Now, here's what they're gonna do with these things.

678
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,420
Gee.

679
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,280
All citizens not having proper identification will be detained.

680
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,180
All foreign nationals will be detained.

681
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,240
All citizens who are deemed to be acting in a suspicious manner will be detained.

682
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,740
Well, we're all doing that all the time.

683
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,280
But I...

684
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:24,620
Um, let's see, uh, the reservists and guardsmen are also, uh, oh, the, the guys that they got to do this aren't, it's like, as Tom Ridge has expressed his disgust at the quality of the reservists and guardsmen, who themselves are now objecting to their new uniforms, which they repeatedly complain are ill-fitting and silly-looking.

685
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:37,660
It's a new gray uniform with a gray helmet and a visor so you can only see the eyes. The only thing you can see is from the lips down to prevent, quote, prevent any retribution, unquote, from people who don't like this new idea.

686
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,520
Oh my God, this sounds like Deutschland Uberology.

687
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:50,080
Well, the, it says that is another problem. Um, the uniform looks exactly like the Imperial Stormtroopers from Star Wars, except instead of white, it is gray.

688
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,280
The trainees seem to like the helmet's little transceivers.

689
00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:04,060
Transceivers, so they can communicate with each other, chatting until their instructor deactivates their headset. But otherwise, say they feel like extras in a low-budget science fiction movie.

690
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:10,340
Oh, well, see, now we have, we can empathize with these guys, because we felt like low-budget extras in a B-movie for how many years, Chaz?

691
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,180
So, um, so this...

692
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:18,560
That's a long time. All we've got to do is get the uniforms and the costumes down, and, um...

693
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,100
Oh, you'll like, here's, here, you'll like this part.

694
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,540
We could set up our own checkpoints.

695
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:32,900
This order was also, has also proved very trying for the instructors, as the reservists and guardsmen couldn't seem to grasp why people should be shot.

696
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,860
In frustration, the instructor finally told them to shut up and shouted, quote,

697
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:44,860
Shoot them because I say you're supposed to shoot them. Damn it, do what you're told. You follow orders. They are bad guys.

698
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,260
If your officer tells you to shoot someone, you shoot them.

699
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,520
His aggravation seemed to make little impact on the men who were...

700
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,740
They're mostly interested in when they can go back home to their families, or what is for dinner in the mess hall.

701
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,720
Thank God for people like that, like good soldier Schweick, who do...

702
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,520
Let's see, this drill sergeant was disgusted with the performance of his trainees.

703
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:11,940
He kept repeating and repeating, we're here to protect the people, we have to regain control over the country.

704
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,720
Then he put his hands, his head in his hands and shook his head.

705
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,880
And you could tell he didn't believe a word of what he was saying, like it was a big joke.

706
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,940
Well, we know you have to destroy the global village to save it.

707
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:34,220
And anyway, Secretary Ridge enraged at the shortage of personnel he deems fit to wear the distinctive uniforms he so carefully designed.

708
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:42,200
First suggested a draft until he was informed that draftees are even less disciplined than our reservists and guardsmen.

709
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:50,220
And that news came from New Monet, Reverend New Monet of the likeexcess.org.

710
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,560
Well, that is unsettling, Chad. What do you think about this?

711
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,740
You're going to be playing. Man, give it up. Not give it up.

712
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,800
But you're going to be like, you know, underground Joe playing in the mountains for all the compadres.

713
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,100
This, you know, what...

714
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,120
I'm going to become a secret agent man, dude.

715
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,840
There's going to be a barbed wire around Brushwood from now on.

716
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,760
That's right, I'm going to be a secret agent man.

717
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,200
It's going to be a survivalist compound.

718
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,780
I'm going to become a G-boy.

719
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,200
You can be number six.

720
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,560
I'm going to be a G-boy.

721
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,520
I'll be number six.

722
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,020
I said, go take your G-string out of here because I was not a G-boy.

723
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:31,020
When they came for the people with kind of like fuzzy lips, I said, go on out of here because I'm clean shaven.

724
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,320
There can only be one.

725
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:38,440
When they came for people that had, you know, like real hairy feet and stuff like that, I said, there's none of them here.

726
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,460
Then they finally, they came for me.

727
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,060
And what a party.

728
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,080
Well, Dave, it's because it takes one to make a village.

729
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,840
And we want you to be number one in our village.

730
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,800
Dave, you could...

731
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,120
It only takes one.

732
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,900
Village to make an idiot.

733
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,640
Just like a fuse, it takes one to blow.

734
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,620
It only takes one number six to escape from a village.

735
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,720
One number six?

736
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,740
I thought it was a seven.

737
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,900
Oh, that was less with an assault rifle, right?

738
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,560
You're not allowed to say that, Dave.

739
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,500
I'm not sure what the criminal code is nowadays.

740
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,220
You know what I'm saying?

741
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,180
It's how I've had pieces of my brain removed.

742
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,580
But, you know what I mean?

743
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,820
Isn't that still a number seven?

744
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,040
Stank?

745
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,220
Oh, I'm sorry.

746
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,440
I wasn't paying any attention.

747
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,900
I was listening to that groovy music in the background.

748
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:19,640
Easy.

749
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,380
Easy.

750
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,120
Easy.

751
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,220
Easy.

752
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,620
Easy.

753
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,240
For Russians and Ukrainians, we're...

754
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,640
Okay.

755
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,580
Let me...

756
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,560
We try.

757
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,220
The opus fat ref...

758
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,500
No, no.

759
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,080
Easy.

760
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,160
You've died to it.

761
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,220
P.

762
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:34,820
P.

763
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:35,260
P.

764
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,880
Please.

765
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:38,820
Jeez.

766
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:39,860
All right.

767
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,960
Magic food.

768
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,440
Yeah.

769
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,300
Yeah.

770
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,880
In the course, the normal course of events,

771
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,520
the high E-pop comes to the...

772
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,580
AndIRROR to...

773
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:52,940
The

774
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,580
place where Vigil costs five in 지�be

775
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,840
of the nameless mission.

776
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,560
Tonight, no such report is needed.

777
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,780
It has already been delivered

778
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,020
by the yet-tinson people.

779
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:09,860
We need to talk in peace...

780
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:21,080
Yes, friends, tonight we are a species

781
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:27,520
seas awakened to danger and called to defend our slack. Our grief has turned to anger, our anger

782
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:34,900
to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies to orgasm or bring orgasm to our enemies, orgasms

783
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:42,900
will be done. I thank the Council of Subgeni in the Hierarchy for its leadership at such an

784
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:48,400
important time. All the Subgeni were touched on the evening of the tragedy to see Holocaustals

785
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:55,540
and Evangelicals joining together on Alt.Slack, mocking God Bless America. And you did more than

786
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:01,360
mock. You acted by delivering the insight and freedom of speech to protect our communities

787
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,840
from militaristic jingoism. On behalf of the Subgeni in America, I thank the world for their

788
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,780
outpouring of support. Subgeniuses will never forget the sounds of our anti-music played in

789
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,940
Berlin, in the hash bars of Amsterdam.

790
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:29,340
And in the cold wastes of Kedah. We will not forget European skeptics pointing out the bull on CNN

791
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:35,160
or the frenzied copulation in Discordian sex temples. We will not forget the moments of humor

792
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:42,860
and days of mourning in Alt.Slack and the Subgenius chat rooms. Nor will we forget the slack

793
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:48,160
full of other religions who died with our own. Dozens of Muslims, more than a hundred and

794
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,380
thirty-five, have died with our own. We will not forget the slacks full of Muslims, more than a hundred and thirty-five,

795
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:53,120
and thirty Jews, more than two thousand Christians, men and women of Hindu, Buddhist and Mormon faiths,

796
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,600
and hundreds of atheists. Subgeniuses have no truer friends than atheists.

797
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,380
But Subgeni have many questions tonight. Subgeni are asking,

798
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:09,860
What will happen to our civil liberties? The evidence we have gathered all points to a

799
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:18,360
tightly organized military-industrial complex run by the Conspiracy. They are the same murderers

800
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,580
for the Taliban and for the Southern Baptist Convention

801
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,880
and are responsible for the Cold War.

802
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,400
The leadership of the conspiracy has great influence in Afghanistan

803
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,320
and supports the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country.

804
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:40,860
In Afghanistan, we see the conspiracy's vision for the world.

805
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,280
The Afghanistan people have been brutalized.

806
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,020
Many are starving and many have fled.

807
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,040
Women are not allowed to attend school.

808
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,800
You can be jailed for using the Internet.

809
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,260
Religion can be practiced only as the leaders dictate.

810
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:58,420
Indeed, a man can be jailed in Afghanistan for wearing a dob's head.

811
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,760
Our nameless mission then begins with the conspiracy,

812
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,440
but it does not end there.

813
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:11,240
It will not end until every subgenius is on a pleasure saucer

814
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,140
with its own personal sex goddess.

815
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,320
And yet subgeniuses are asking,

816
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:17,660
Why?

817
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,420
Why do they hate us?

818
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,700
They hate what they see as right.

819
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,980
A slackful, self-indulgent anti-government.

820
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,440
They hate our freedoms.

821
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,400
Our freedom of religion.

822
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,220
Our freedom of speech.

823
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,900
Our freedom to laugh and copulate and disagree with each other.

824
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,800
These conspirators kill not merely to end lives,

825
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,620
but to disrupt and end a way of life.

826
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,200
With every atrocity, they hope that America and the subgenius grows fearful,

827
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,580
retreating from the world and forsaking our friends.

828
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,800
They stand against.

829
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,960
They stand against us because we stand in their way.

830
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,300
And we will accept ever tightening,

831
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:52,900
quote,

832
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,080
security laws,

833
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:54,460
unquote,

834
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,680
in the name of fighting terrorism,

835
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,200
in the name of freedom.

836
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,340
We are not deceived by their pretenses to patriotism.

837
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,020
We have seen their kind before.

838
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:09,380
They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century

839
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,820
by sacrificing human life to serve their radical vision

840
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,200
by abandoning every value except the will to power.

841
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,260
They follow.

842
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:21,520
They will follow in the path of fascism and Nazism and totalitarianism.

843
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,620
And they will follow that path all the way to where it ends,

844
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,740
in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies.

845
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,640
Subgeni should not expect one battle,

846
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,100
but a lengthy campaign like the Vietnam War and the war on drugs combined.

847
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,800
It may include pointless strikes that look good on TV

848
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,240
and covert operations against a group of people,

849
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:47,960
but it will be a great victory for the American citizens,

850
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,100
secret even in success.

851
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,840
They will seize funds from American citizens the way they do against drug dealers.

852
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,460
Unless they're dealing alcohol and tobacco.

853
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,080
Dismantle the remains of the free press,

854
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,960
all three of them left,

855
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,540
and portray any dissent as a threat to security until there is no refuge or no rest.

856
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:16,080
And they will pursue nations that deny them oil or cheap labor

857
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,580
on the grounds of fighting terrorism.

858
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,920
Every political group in every region will be given a decision to make.

859
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,340
Either you are with the military-industrial complex,

860
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,700
or you are with the terrorists.

861
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:37,780
From this day forward, any person that continues to harbor or support unorthodox views

862
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,920
will be regarded by the United States as a terrorist.

863
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,560
Our species, the subgenius, have been put on notice.

864
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,480
We are not immune from attack.

865
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,780
We will take defensive measures against oppression to protect subgenii.

866
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,760
Today, dozens of grassroots clenches,

867
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,400
as well as established groups like Sputum and the Coniites,

868
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,280
are taking responsibility for protecting our precious slack

869
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,960
from the Homeland Security conspiracy.

870
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,480
These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level,

871
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,100
so tonight, I announce the creation of a council-level position

872
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,400
reporting directly to Bob.

873
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,760
The office of the Clench of Coni Babylonian.

874
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,780
Many will be involved in this effort,

875
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,140
from slack masters to sex gods and goddesses

876
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,580
to the Bobbies we have called to active duty.

877
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:31,080
All deserve our thanks and all share our frop.

878
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,740
And tonight, a few hundred miles from evacuated Dobbs Town,

879
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,720
I have a message for our clenches.

880
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,060
Be ready.

881
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,440
Bob.

882
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,320
Bob has called the doctors to alert,

883
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,880
and there is a reason.

884
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,400
The hour is coming when subgenii will act,

885
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:55,900
and you will make Bob proud!

886
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,100
The Yeti world is rallying to the Nameless Mission.

887
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,220
They understand that if this crackdown goes unresisted,

888
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,300
their own cities, their own citizens may be next.

889
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,840
Oppression unanswered can not only bring down

890
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,320
politicians, it can threaten even our sex lives.

891
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,300
And you know that we will not allow that.

892
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:31,560
The Yeti world is rallying to the Nameless Mission.

893
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,780
They understand that if this crackdown goes unresisted,

894
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,520
their own cities, their own citizens may be next.

895
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,360
The Yeti world is rallying to the Nameless Mission.

896
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,840
They understand that if this crackdown goes unresisted,

897
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,760
their own cities, their own citizens may be next.

898
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,560
And you know that if this crackdown goes unresisted,

899
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:45,560


900
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,240
Oh, and it is a grim and grave world that the young folks are entering.

901
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:50,420
Oh, and it is a grim and grave world that the young folks are entering.

902
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,760
It's not a big deal to me.

903
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,160
It's not a big deal to me.

904
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,640
When I was a teenager, I honestly truly believed that the nuclear war,

905
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:03,380
mutual assured destruction would leave the planet a barren and lifeless plane,

906
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,740
one that would make Planet of the Apes look good.

907
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,040


908
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,560
One that would make Planet of the Apes look good.

909
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:13,740
Now, of course, kids are merely paranoid about being thrown into a Road Warrior world.

910
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,040
environment, which to some of them probably looks pretty good.

911
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,300
And maybe they're right.

912
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:28,340
Maybe the only way to fix things right is to start with a clean slate.

913
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,020
But, you know, you have to wonder if they aren't going to clean the slate so well that

914
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:42,760
there's nothing left but microbes to re-evolve back up into rock-and-stick-throwing, territory-pissing

915
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,980
primates.

916
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:52,420
Domesticated primates who still fling their poo at each other and shriek madly as soon

917
00:40:52,420 --> 00:41:00,460
as one starts eyeballing the other one's property, which is usually its lovely little

918
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,740
connytite bonobo sweetie.

919
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,360
Yes, friends.

920
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,440
You know, when...

921
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,800
The balloon goes up, and the war is engaged, you have to win.

922
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:27,260
And what worries me, really worries me, is that that is exactly the position in which

923
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,480
we have been placed.

924
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,060
And, uh...

925
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,680
We'll have to deal with blame later, I'm afraid.

926
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,540
Oh...

927
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:41,560
Oh...

928
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,740
Oh...

929
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:42,980
Oh...

930
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,320
This background music is, um...

931
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,680
The rarely heard...

932
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,800
It's a treasured LP.

933
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:55,380
The soundtrack of Lucifer Rising, the Kenneth Anger underground movie.

934
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:02,520
The soundtrack is by a bunch of guys in prison who did it for the movie, including Charlie

935
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,580
Manson's boy, Bobby Busalil, who is now dead.

936
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,360
Yes, friends.

937
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,520
You know...

938
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,860
In the end...

939
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,000
In the end...

940
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,720
In the end...

941
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,060
In the end...

942
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,060


943
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,060


944
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,060


945
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:23,640
Osama Bin Laden, the Mullahs, George Bush, the Afghanistan fighters and the American

946
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,740
fighters, you and me, we'll all end up the same way.

947
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,160
There's no winner.

948
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,360
They, as Bob said, they always end up on their heads.

949
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,100
One and all, from the greatest to the smallest, my friends.

950
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,700
We all end up the same.

951
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,740
Same place.

952
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,660
I hope not to see you there any time soon.

953
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,400
Praise Bob and hail Connie.

954
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,900
Oh...

955
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:01,980
Oh...

956
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:02,800
Oh...

957
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,000
Oh...

958
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,120
Oh...

959
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,120


960
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,200
Oh...

961
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,440
And the graven image, Catholic.

962
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:13,860
Yeah

963
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,920
With his plastic crucifix

964
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,220
You get it

965
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:21,660
I hate

966
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,500
Confusing me

967
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,320
As to who and where and why

968
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,860
As to how he gets his kicks

969
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,360
He gets his kicks

970
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,600
Confessing to the endless end

971
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,060
With endless whining sounds

972
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:54,260
Every pain till next Thursday

973
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:58,840
For the gods that you can count on

974
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,500
I am

975
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,840
The King of the Bob

976
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,840
Bob

977
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,520
Bob

978
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:41,580
Bob

979
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:41,920
Bob

980
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:42,580


981
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,360
Bob

982
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,860
Bob

983
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,800
Bob

984
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,200
Bob

985
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:48,820
Bob

986
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,080
Bob

987
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:49,100
Bob

988
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:49,120
Bob

989
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:49,140
Bob

990
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:49,160
Bob

991
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,180
Bob

992
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:49,200
Bob

993
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,220
Bob

994
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:49,220


995
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,200
Bob

996
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:02,200


997
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:02,200


998
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:02,200


999
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:02,740
Bob

1000
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:02,740


1001
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:02,740


1002
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,780
autopsy on John Wayne, they found 40 pounds of meat in his intestine.

1003
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:20,380
People in their rapine and panic use their body as a specimen for primor of fear.

1004
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,560
The electrician.

1005
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,680
An impressive statistic is true.

1006
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:35,260
And I also heard that now the world's first chewable green tea tablets are available

1007
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:39,020
by national natural subscription.

1008
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:45,000
These herbal blurbs are available in bicentennial blossoms and buds,

1009
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:50,260
along with macro earthworms, each in its own earthenware urns.

1010
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:57,720
And for a special time, only the Real Ease Support TM provides total relaxation

1011
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,700
for your neck, shoulders, and bust line.

1012
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:08,380
With this handy device, you can know the indoor temperature and humidity at a glance,

1013
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:18,760
and safely, quickly, and easily, you can trim unwanted hair.

1014
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:31,060
Avoid eyebrows like Sir Donald Wolfe or Thufir Hawat,

1015
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:36,780
and trim yourself into a trim setup,

1016
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,000
where everything is...

1017
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,760
ship-shaped and squared away.

1018
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,200
A1 at Lloyd's.

1019
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,440
A-OK.

1020
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,580
All systems go.

1021
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,860
Yes, now you're cooking with gas.

1022
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,660
And you're comfortable.

1023
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,040
Listening to the show.

1024
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,460
Don't cry, little callers.

1025
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,480
We're here for you.

1026
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,480
Because we...

1027
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,260
That would be a real...

1028
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,000
We deeply care...

1029
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,780
about you, the listener.

1030
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,880
I say that you don't say that.

1031
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,160
And we feel for you...

1032
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,440
in the hour of your distress.

1033
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,680
Now, and at the hour of your death.

1034
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:23,700
Amen.

1035
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,360
Dammit.

1036
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:34,600
Perhaps life can be projected at the end of time on a giant movie screen in God's throne room,

1037
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:38,620
like Johnny Carson's favorite moments from the Tonight Show.

1038
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,540
Johnny Carson's yet again.

1039
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,860
Yes, you'd laugh hysterically as you saw Johnny's old routines.

1040
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,240
All that mayhem.

1041
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,480
All that meat.

1042
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,860
That was John Wayne.

1043
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,860
The impacted colon of John Wayne.

1044
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:06,780
And remember the final episode of that Carson show where we all shed a tear as Bette Midler serenaded the host with the most...

1045
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:10,320
And then you take the Ras Crispy thing and you throw it against the wall.

1046
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,120
Ras Crispy.

1047
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:12,980
You do it that way.

1048
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:14,900
Snap, crackle, and pop.

1049
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,120
I agree.

1050
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,780
Ras Crispy's are great in the crushed mode.

1051
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,820
Flattened like those guppos that landed near Roswell at high speed.

1052
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:29,760
But the form of the being was so crisped and rice-like that it was impossible to determine the exact...

1053
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,720
The little biobots were alive enough for American soldiers to run up and hit one in the head with the butt of his M1.

1054
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:44,000
Some claimed it was a wireless radio-controlled device built somewhere along the lines of an Abrams M1 tank, America's super tank.

1055
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,300
I just broke my show.

1056
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,520
In alien form, it sprang to life.

1057
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,600
Where's my audience?

1058
00:48:52,720 --> 00:49:03,820
If it weren't for the KPFA puzzling evidence show with puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell, and sometimes Dr. Philo Drummond.

1059
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:13,260
If it weren't for such as they and Einstein's Secret Orchestra Swamp Radio and WCSB Cleveland, why this show would...

1060
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,620
And the stuff sent in by all the wonderful subgeniuses.

1061
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:21,560
Well, I guess this would be a pretty boring show.

1062
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,180
You know.

1063
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:40,340
I don't have much time.

1064
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,540
Get out of my way, Stan.

1065
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,940
Multiione,äischen На.

1066
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,820
Finish!

1067
00:49:55,820 --> 00:50:00,140
cultures and

1068
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:09,500
Right.

1069
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,300
No, I think it's under the code

1070
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,040
is adultery with an adult tree

1071
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:13,960
fornicating,

1072
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,640
arboreal fornication or something.

1073
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,840
Have you ever done that?

1074
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,640
You know, I do feel kind of weird

1075
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,260
talking about copulating with trees

1076
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,420
when there's a war on

1077
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,760
and we feel like we should be

1078
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,020
more supportive of our troops

1079
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:29,820
or something.

1080
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,520
Yeah.

1081
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,580
What's going on?

1082
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,040
Well, if you...

1083
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,820
That's the thing.

1084
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,380
They don't go into very much detail

1085
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,220
on the news and the radio.

1086
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,720
Are there soldiers on the ground

1087
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,380
who know that?

1088
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,740
Is there a real war happening?

1089
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,120
There are,

1090
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,160
and there's the weirdest little stories.

1091
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:42,880
Like, for instance...

1092
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,100
Right, and then they're releasing...

1093
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,580
Then the above ground media

1094
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,000
is releasing all these little trickles

1095
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,900
of things like somehow

1096
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,900
we might be losing or something.

1097
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:50,680
Well...

1098
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,460
What's he talking about?

1099
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,020
No, no, it just might take a long time.

1100
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,280
That's the...

1101
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,460
Well, that's what they say.

1102
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,000
Obviously, anything you hear,

1103
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,160
you have to keep in mind

1104
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,600
is spun some way or another.

1105
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,440
Right.

1106
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,740
Now, here's one.

1107
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,180
I couldn't quite figure out what...

1108
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:04,840
If this was...

1109
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,120
This one was just weird enough

1110
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:06,720
to be real.

1111
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,100
This fellow in Pakistan

1112
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,600
decided he wanted to...

1113
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,500
He'd heard that there was

1114
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,760
this jihad going on,

1115
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,320
and of course,

1116
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,760
he wanted to join it.

1117
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,620
So he drove down to Afghanistan

1118
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,480
and to Kabul or whatever,

1119
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:20,980
and they said,

1120
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,900
well, drive back up to the front

1121
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,840
and tell them you're a soldier.

1122
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,040
So he drove back up to the front,

1123
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,140
and they said...

1124
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,740
The Taliban sold off the military,

1125
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,400
said, okay, well, here's your post.

1126
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:32,720
Go to Afghanistan.

1127
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:32,720


1128
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:32,720


1129
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,080
Go to that post

1130
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,020
and get ready to fight.

1131
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,680
So this guy drives over to the post,

1132
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,220
and he runs out of cigarettes.

1133
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,980
So he decides to drive into town

1134
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,740
and get some cigarettes,

1135
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,180
and he's from Pakistan.

1136
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:42,980
He doesn't know his way

1137
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,820
around northern Afghanistan.

1138
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,120
He drives into the nearest town,

1139
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,380
which happens to be controlled

1140
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,000
by Northern Alliance forces

1141
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,820
and Newsweek reporters,

1142
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,660
where he is promptly captured

1143
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,300
and then interviewed at length

1144
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,360
about how he wandered in there

1145
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,080
to get cigarettes.

1146
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,120
He didn't really know

1147
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,000
what it was all about.

1148
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:02,660
He just knew

1149
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,400
that there was a jihad going on,

1150
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,440
and he didn't have anything better to do.

1151
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,880
And now he's...

1152
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,840
But, again, you have to remember,

1153
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,020
every little story is turned around,

1154
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:14,880
and, you know,

1155
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,260
who did what little release

1156
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,340
of what strange...

1157
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,540
Remember what happened to Mardahari.

1158
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,900
Loose tits ripped ships,

1159
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,820
and you can't be too careful,

1160
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,960
and you never know

1161
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,320
who that fellow

1162
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,260
you're giving state secrets to

1163
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:31,900
might be.

1164
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:32,980
That's right.

1165
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,660
So, um...

1166
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,000
So shut up!

1167
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,240
I would suggest that anybody

1168
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,640
on any public conveyance

1169
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,280
just stop babbling

1170
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,500
top secret stuff

1171
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,500
at the top of their lungs.

1172
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:43,600
Keep your head on the bag.

1173
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,300
Back to the wind in your sack

1174
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:44,780
and the saddle.

1175
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:45,260
We'll see y'all.

1176
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:45,740
Good.

1177
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,540
Yes, that was from WCSB Cleveland,

1178
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,020
Chaz Smith's ESO Radio

1179
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,220
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1180
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,140
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1181
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,080
This, however, is the Hour of Slack.

1182
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:01,880
And for more,

1183
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,720
more on the Church of the Subgenius.

1184
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,060
Get your pencil ready

1185
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,020
for the info coming in a minute.

1186
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,740
We've also heard a lot of

1187
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,260
KPFA Berkeley's show

1188
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,460
with Puzzling Evidence

1189
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,680
and Dr. Howell.

1190
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,820
That was actually the first show

1191
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,700
called The Show.

1192
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,620
It started around 1983

1193
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:24,360
or two.

1194
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,460
Some of the clips and cuts

1195
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:30,520
and collages that I played tonight

1196
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,880
were posted to all channels

1197
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:40,460
and are now available

1198
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:40,460


1199
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:40,460


1200
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:40,600
And I'm sure you'll find

1201
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:40,600


1202
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:40,600


1203
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:40,760
So, if you're interested

1204
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:40,760


1205
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:40,760


1206
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:40,760


1207
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:40,760


1208
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:40,760


1209
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:40,760


1210
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:40,760


1211
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,080
Rants that I read

1212
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:42,760
were written by

1213
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,780
Reverend Crawford Smith,

1214
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,420
Reverend Jim,

1215
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,080

1216
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,120
and Saint New Monet.

1217
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,500
Now, for more information

1218
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,920

1219
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,320

This music in the background

1238
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,220
is from Jean Strong

1239
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:46,160
sent to us by Reverend Tesla Coyle.

1240
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,460
You can find out more about

1241
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,740

live song, My God,

1251
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,940
is from this 25th anniversary

1252
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,640
box set.

1253

Praise Alt Binary Sounds MP3.

1254
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,260
And to carry us out, friends,

1255
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,060
to clean our souls

1256
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,360
and wash away the bob shite

1257
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,680
and the stink of the war,

1258
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,640
let's listen to this bathing collage

1259
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,460
by St. Allian

1260
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,360
or Stalio

1261
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,640
or I don't even know.

1262
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,240
It was another posted thing.

1263
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,420
A bathing collage

1264
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,900
from St. Allian.

1265
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,400
Girl, you gotta take a bath.

1266
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,940
Girl, you gotta take a bath.

1267
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,280
Girl, you gotta take a bath.

1268
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,580
Splish, splash,

1269
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,180
I was taking a bath.

1270

I'll see you next time.

1329
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,080
I taste just like candy.

1330
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:06,680
Every day when I make my way to the tubby.

1331
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,400
I want candy.

1332
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,120

I taste just like candy.

1336
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:28,340
Every day when I make my way to the tubby.

Splish splash, I forgot about the bell.

1342
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,160
Ooh, you think that sounds spooky?

1343

Just wait.

00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:17,120
In a moment, you'll be hearing the creepy, haunting, fun sounds of Halloween.

Like Frankenberry, Booberry, and Count Chocula cereals.

1348
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:33,940
Now, grab a spoon, pour yourself a bowl, sit back, and try not to be too afraid.

1349
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:37,680
Because the spooky sounds of Halloween are about to begin.
